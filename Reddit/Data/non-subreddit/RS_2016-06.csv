4lz3a7,7,2016-05-31,Veteran freelancers: How do you stay completely calm when you have a crazy amount of stories to do?,JustinPSports,Journalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Journalism/comments/4lz3a7/veteran_freelancers_how_do_you_stay_completely/,"So, let me begin by saying that despite the title, I'm not 100 per cent stressed ... yet. But, I can see that happening because of what's happened the past few days.

First, I was contacted by a local bi-weekly newspaper editor to do a freelance story about a major issue in the area. I was given two weeks to get everything done for next Monday afternoon. With that story, the only things I have left to do is write the story and get a photo for it with a local MPP. I had that scheduled for Friday afternoon.

Yesterday, I was officially hired by a local online-only publication to join their staff as a freelance reporter on a one-year contract. I was told the amount of stories I would do would vary on average between three to four each week. This was after one of their two journalists (who I was classmates with and who had worked for this media outlet for two of the past three years) took a position out in Eastern Canada. I officially start in less than two hours.

Now, this is where it gets chaotic.

This afternoon, I was asked/assigned to do a story about a local art show going on this week to start off for tomorrow/this week. With this being my first weekly paid job ever, I said yes and got to work with my research so I could make some calls/emails for the morning. Then, a great story idea was sent to me through Twitter that I decided to pitch, which was accepted.

Then, I was asked to do another two stories - one a simple inaugural awards banquet, while the other being a major high school track and field championship. The latter one also had the possibility of having stories published in other markets depending on which schools/teams I did them about. It also requires photo galleries for all three days.

Now, because of the major event, that means I have to cancel the photo appointment because it would be the exact same time the opening ceremonies would be. I also might have to cancel a prior commitment with my alum school for Saturday morning.

So yeah ... right now, I have to do:

- Three stories that can be done quickly
- A total of eight interviews for those stories alone
- Write said stories for tomorrow/Thursday
- Write the other freelance article I've almost finished
- Go back and forth between each story location for the first two I was assigned/pitched
- Go from the event and the third story
- Figure out how I'm going to get the photo for the other freelance article
- Send stories and photos from the major event on my laptop from the stadium stands
- Find unique story angles for multiple schools/regions (there are 501 schools and more than 2,300 student-athletes competing)
- Try and work the school commitment into my schedule without causing chaos for the major event coverage
- Find time for myself to wind down and go to the gym (which I just started going to today)

(Note: If some of these bullet points sound a bit all over the place, it's because I'm trying to think of multiple story questions at once for three of these stories for tomorrow too.)

Did I mention this is within my first four days with the company I'm doing most of this work for and that I still need to find time to buy a car by the end of next week since I can now afford the cost of insurance and gas?

I love journalism so much.

**To the question:** How do you stay completely calm when you have a crazy amount of stories to do, specifically when you're freelancing?

I feel like I'll be able to manage it for the most part - if this was three months ago, I'd be going ballistic right now. I went through a similar amount of stress while interning at a weekly newspaper two weeks ago and didn't have any problems at all. But because this is a paid position for what could be a major opportunity for me to grow as a journalist and will be even more work than I did during the internship, I just want to know what others currently/would do in this type of situation.

Edit: There's also now a gunman on the loose in the east end of my city and my editor doesn't come into his office for another 90 minutes. Because of that, I have to write my story through Facebook because I also can't access the website portal. Great."

I'm currently looking for a Co-Op position in Android development from January 2017 up to June 2017. I am a Junior CS major at Clemson with a minor in Chinese. I am interning with an organization developing language software for Android this summer. Most of my actual experience lies in Android Development and Unity but I am proficient other languages outside of just Java and C#. In school I've taken a C and C++ course, discrete, algorithms, data structures, and some software development seminars. Does anyone know of good companies to Co-Op with that might be hiring this spring? What can I do now or during my internship to help make myself more hire-able? Any advice is appreciated."

They're hoping that by the end of the summer I can have a searchable database of their members up on their wordpress website.

My two main issues are:
1) The database needs to be searchable not just by a member's name, but also by their membership status (apprentice, master, etc.), membership date, and several other criteria.

2) ...there is no database. I actually found this out just this morning. I assumed this would already be set up through MySQL or something. In any case, this means a lot of data entry for me, but I figured I should ask if there's anything I could do at this step that would make issue #1 a little easier.

I apologize, I know these questions are a bit open-ended. My background is mostly in python and I have little knowledge of Wordpress. But if any of you can just point me in the right direction, I'd really appreciate it."
4lzskw,5,2016-06-01,"Me [28F] with my ex [21F]. We were together 1.5 years, broke up last week and now have to live together for 1.5 months.",Morgans_a_witch,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4lzskw/me_28f_with_my_ex_21f_we_were_together_15_years/,"Last week a broke up with my girlfriend of 1.5 years. There were a number of issues, but it really came down to 2. 1) our life experience difference was too great and I couldn't take her immaturity. This was something I'd been worried about, and we talked about when we first started dating, and it became true. 2) she committed such severe boundary violations of someone I care about that I just couldn't be with her after finding out. 

We currently live together and will need to for another 1.5 months. She will be starting a multi month internship in another state and our lease will be up while she is gone. If I kicked her out, she would have to move back in with her parents in another city and it would damage her school and internship chances. So it just makes sense that we live together until she leaves in july.

For the past week though, our break up has basically been repeated every single day. She also keeps trying to call me love, tells me she loves me, says that she wants to get back together, tries to hug and kiss me, and wants to have sex. I'm just emotionally exhausted. No matter how many times or ways I tell her we are done, she won't accept it. I've tried to take a hard line around intimacy, but have screwed up by letting her hug me a few times and us having sex once. I know that was a huge mistake. We had sex the one time because we hadn't in over a month and she had said she wanted to one more time. Being an idiot and feeling emotional, I agreed to.

I just don't know how we're gonna get to July. I don't want to keep breaking up over and over and I don't want to keep having to deny her intimacy and hurt her. I don't want to give her false hope though, and taking a hard line against affection seems like the best way not to do that. 

It doesn't help that she keeps wanting to do things together. I'm on an at home vacation this week so I'm doing a number of things each day. She wants to come along and basically turn each thing into a date. Of course she doesn't have money to do things, but is hoping I'll pay and she can pay back later. She also keeps trying to invite me to do things with her that we both know I don't want to do.

Lastly I'm just so angry at her over the violations. I heard about them the day before we broke up. She knows enough, but not the full extent. Well she knows what she did, but not that I know. I was asked to not tell her because this person isn't ready for confrontation between them yet. So I keep switching between anger at my ex and not wanting to cause her undue pain since I do care about her, even if I don't love her anymore. I also feel guilty over being kind to her while caring for the person she violated. Like I feel like it's a betrayal of that person to be kind to my ex given the situation, but I know not being kind will make the next 1.5 months a lot worse.

Tldr: need to live with my ex for the next 1.5 months. We broke up a week ago over maturity issues and her violating someone I care about. We keep repeating our break up daily and she keeps trying to act like we aren't broken up. Don't know how to get through the next 1.5 months like this."
4m06vc,3,2016-06-01,I [21 M] feel like a lot of my friends have generally started treating me like crap. Is it me or am I just being sensitive? [Personal Issue],NesterBop,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4m06vc/i_21_m_feel_like_a_lot_of_my_friends_have/,"Hey reddit,

I'm going through a weird time, a lot of my friends have traveled back at home for the summer and I'm still hanging around my college town for both a summer job, an internship, and summer classes.

After reaching out to a handful of my friends (mostly from different friend groups), I've noticed a lot of people in my life have started being rude, and unnecessarily mean in the way they act around me now, or just act much happier they are when I'm not around and make it a point to let me know that I'm not wanted around them. 

There have been a few instances when a few friends would invite me out and spend that time insulting me, often completely unprovoked. I don't want to respond with negativity or respond to it but it just never lets up. 

In the past I've been sarcastic and rude, and I've been making it a point in my life to treat people better and have more of a positive outlook on life and people in general, and I've actually been doing a really good job at maintaining that desire to be a better person with a better demeanor and I've managed to make myself happier.

Within the past few weeks it just feels like a lot of people have changed towards me, and jump on almost every chance or opportunity to rag on me, insult, or bring me down in some way.

I feel as though it shouldn't matter to me as much as it does, but I'm tiered of being he butt of the joke and bringing attention to it only ousts me more. At parties, some of them will introduce me as ""the guy we love to hate,"" and I absolutely hate it, but I don't know how to change, and I don't want to abandon these people completely because I genuinely care about some of them, who mostly seem like the ones who are more friendly towards me.

Am I just being a little sensitive or is there an actual problem? Am I just someone who people can't stand and how do I stay on the course to be a better person?

**tl;dr**: Been trying to be a better person, seems like my friends hate me, is it actually me or am I just being sensitive about it all?"

We are a tech company and one colleague made a script that calculates who was late most often and who has missed the most minutes.

I am on top of both charts and I feel super bad about it. However, 90% of the times I was late, it was because I also have to attend school and those meetings ran late, or because of other reasons I couldn't help (doctor visit, bike tire was torn). 

I haven't said anything about it, but I wonder, should I defend myself? Right now it looks like I'm not very dedicated to my company, while I am. However, I'm scared it will look childish if I start to argue about it.

And at Hudson there is one frat that reins supreme, where the brothers are smarter, stronger and more privileged then any of their rivals. And boy do they know it.

The line stretches down the block as students wait to enter Alpha Sigma's first party of the semester. I stand on the doorstep of the opulent fraternity mansion, arms folded in a way that shows off my bulging biceps and rippled chest. The collar on my Abercrombie polo is up, obviously, and I scan the line for any lithe young pickings that I could have fun with. I dumped my Theta slampiece over the summer - I said I had to focus more on my Goldman Sachs internship, but the real reason was I was just... bored of her. Who knows what I'll find tonight? Maybe a girl truly worth showing off to the high society I had been born into...
____________________________________________________

Hey, thanks for reading! So the premise of this roleplay is pretty simple. I want to play a douchey, All-American frat bro who gets to corrupt and use a naive young first year. You could be a spoiled, stuck-up legacy blonde, a small-town busty brunette or even an ebony/latina girl who'd never dream she'd abandon her people to suck on the cock of a rich white guy. So long as you're creative and imaginative, I'm game!

This can be played short-term, but what I'd really like to do is create a little world of opulence and privilege. I want to seduce your character with promises of the high-life, taking you to all sorts of exclusive events and country clubs, all the while making you into a more and more depraved slut. By the end of it I want you to be my bimbo, a good, obedient little girl who smiles and sticks her chest out while the men discuss business.

Detail, creativity and good grammar are key. I'm pretty open to most kinks and this scene can go from plain vanilla to extremely dark.

Hope to hear from you!"

  You tried. Some of you managed to stay strong. Most of you failed to go through with it and won't be able to refrain from throwing money at Riot at some point into the future.
  
  What to do? Easy! Tell Riot your opinion on twitch on any of their major tournaments!
  
  Riot still thinks that Reddit is nothing but a vocal/loud minority, [as proven here](https://twitter.com/Pwyff/status/737766563919495168).
  
  You heard often enough that they use the pretext that the majority of the playerbase likes Dynamic-Q and just isn't represented on reddit.
You often heard that there exist surveys that allegedly prove that the majority is okay with the current system.
  
If Riot has to mute the chat on their twitch-channels because of all the 'bring back solo-q' they basically have to admit that something is wrong.

  No whitewashing with survey data we never saw. No 'lets send in some interns in a round table that work as our scapegoats by admitting we fucked up but no higher-up will ever show their face and admit the mistakes they rubber-stamped'.
  
  If you want to hit Riot, then hit them were it hurts; Publicity! Make the fact known that something is wrong! Most of the uninformed casual players probably don't even know or care about the scrapping of Solo-q. That's what Riot bases their 'the majority is okay with it' on.
  
 You can't hurt a big company that feeds off micro-transactions with not buying one skin. Most of the business partners don't know about the discontent of the playerbase and will never get to know if all you do is ranting on Reddit about it. Give your discontent a voice and maybe someone who really matters will start to questioning Riot and their bad decision making.
  
  Make yourself heard. You can't vote with your wallet? Vote with your voice!"

4m2flg,1,2016-06-01,F4M - Celebrity wins hot vacation,[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/4m2flg/f4m_celebrity_wins_hot_vacation/,"By ""raffle"", I won a trip to special vacation resort. This resort is unique because it’s ONLY for couples and no one seems to know much about it, as people who won tickets have to sign nondisclosure agreements. But the rumor is that it’s really great, and most importantly one of the most exclusive in the world. I really want to do that trip, but have nobody to go with, so I ""catch"" you and drag you into it so I can go.

In that resort, a lot of activities are organised for couples. We quickly discover that some are mild, and some aren't at all. Romantic dinners, massage lessons with other couples or just the two of us, sexy cooking lessons, but also more kinky ones. Moreover, some employees can give dares to couples every time they see them, from kiss and grope each other right here (“here” being anywhere from an empty corridor public places)or skinny dipping to have sex in that place without getting caught (or make sure you do get caught by somebody). Each couple can choose anytime between 3 categories and activities and dare at the beginning of the day, but won’t know any details until they start. You can be an employee or a fan, or some rich friend and you have to act like your bf. At the beginning You'd probably kind of shy/nervous because of all of this, hanging out and pretending to be with THAT celeb's boyfriend. On my side I'm having a blast, enjoying myself and keeping us from all the things you'd love to try.

And from here, the scenario can go differen ways depending on what you want to do, your kinks &amp; limits… So let’s discuss it

Do youstart to enjoy yourselfself and we both start to take part is more and more daring activities? Do you figure out that you can take advantage of the situation, start to get more and more touchy every time you can? Trying to get us into the hottest activities, and if I refuse to play along threaten to expose us as a fake couple? Or maybe you start to even blackmail me after getting some serious leverage, and get me to do everything you want.

LOTS of possibilities, with either a young celeb and an older employee, assistant, agent... Or an older one with the new intern or some fan she randomly picked, I'm open to suggestions !

Celebrities : Candice Patton (The Flash) - Natalie Dormer, Emilia Clarke, Sophie Turner (GoT) - Lauren Cohan (TWD) - Willa Holland (Arrow) - Chloë Grace Moretz (Kick Ass) - Evangeline Lilly (Lost) - Emma Watson, Scarlett Johansson (Never heard of them ? Seriously?) - Lucy Liu (Kill Bill) - Cobie Smulders (HIMYM) - Penélope Cruz (Vanilla Sky) - Rosario Dawson, Jessica Alba (Sin City) - Olga Kurylenko (Quantum of Solace) - Blake Lively (Green Lantern) - Kate Beckinsale (Underworld) - McKayla Maroney (Gymnast) - Natalie Alyn Lind (Gotham) - Alexis Ren (Model)- Your suggestion?

4m2frw,2,2016-06-01,"Me [28/F] feeling like a martyr with my partner [29 M] of 16 months, because of chores and bills",hananasuunto,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4m2frw/me_28f_feeling_like_a_martyr_with_my_partner_29_m/,"We dated casually for about two years before becoming ""official"", and soon after I was accepted into a competitive PhD program.  I told him (my boyfriend at that time)  I had to move to continue my education, he said he would move with me.  He wanted to be my partner and help me. I told him I would have to depend on him, and he might have to support me while I worked toward my degree. 


Flash forward 9 months- I am supporting him.  


He is currently in an internship position where he is making minimum wage.  Its great for him professionally, but it is really hard on us financially.  In order to compensate, I am working two-three jobs in addition to my graduate school work.  We've been making ends meet, but over the last two months I've been covering every single bill and grocery trip.  I expect him to pay me back, as we usually split everything 50-50.  I've kept a running total for the past two months, and trying to lovingly remind him I need the money to pay off credit card bills. Last week, he told me he can't pay me the $300. And we have another round of bills coming up, and he can't pay those. Because I love him, I forgive him, but it puts me in a really tough spot for the next few months.  It puts US in a tough spot. 


He doesn't want to talk about money because it stresses him out and he feels emasculated that he can't make enough money to contribute to home costs.  So we've talked about how he can contribute by doing more around the house- more cleaning, more chores, more cooking.  But it's not happening. 


Let me be clear- I deeply love and respect my partner.  But I am now beginning to fear he may not respect me. I see this in how he treats our co-owned space.  He rarely takes care of things, and I feel like he only cares about his things and his needs. He feels entitled to the things I own (my car, my toys, my technological gadgets).  If I do ask him to do the dishes or take out the trash, he makes a big deal out of it.  He will open food or cook something, and leave the trash sitting out on the counter and the dishes unwashed in the sink for days.  He doesn't do laundry, except for his own (and he just assumes he can take my car).  I'm beginning to wonder if his parents taught him how to do chores. 


He consumes way more food than I do, and will eat the food I have purchased for meals or for myself.  He doesn't walk the dog and he doesn't purchase dog food.  At the end of the day, I come home to a dirty house with no food and a dog who needs a walk, and I just look at my partner and it seems like he doesn't care.  Because he is so tired and exhausted from his internship.  And then I feel like a martyr, because he doesn't understand what sort of mental triathlons I run every day while getting a PhD. 


Okay, I know I'm ranting here.  I know he cares. And in three months, he will be able to get a better job, and many of this issues will reduce in pressure. 


 I've just been trying to be passive and loving about all this, but it's irritating the poop out of me.  I want to avoid being passive aggressive and avoid being mean, but I'm about to explode. The final straw is when he tries to explain something to me like I am stupid- 


I don't know what to do, or how to approach him about this.  Because I've bought all the food in the house, I pay to maintain my car, I pay to keep utilities on, I feel like I'm entitled to more ownership over our space. I feel like I'm entitled to a clean house.


How to I assert myself in a loving and respectful manner?  How do I validate his hard work, without discounting the amount of work I do to keep fresh veggies in the fridge and running water?  How do I get him to start doing chores regularly and get him to walk the f*cking dog every day, without emasculating him?


**tl;dr**: I (F/28) am the major breadwinner in our relationship, and I end up doing most of the housework too. How to I assert myself and my efforts while respecting my partner?"

I hope this isn't violating any sub rules or anything, I just am completely desperate and don't know where to turn anymore. 

I've been overweight all of my life. And I mean all - I hit my ""growth spurt"" at about four years old, gained a bunch of weight, and have been considered overweight to obese since - I'm now almost 21 years old. I've been working to lose said weight since I was little because the rest of my family isn't overweight, my parents raised me on a very strict low-sugar, high-veggie diet, and I was always active growing up. I had some success for a few months, where I lost about thirty pounds with moderate exercise and not eating meat, but quickly gained it all back. I've only added on more weight, especially after going to college, where I've ballooned and added at least fifty pounds in the last three years.

I know my weight has caused me physical and mental damage and it makes me scared for the future. I have really bad knees and constant foot pain. Last year, I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism and I'm so terrified of getting diabetes. I've had depression related to my weight since elementary school. What's worse is that I also have ADHD, which makes commitment, long periods of exercise, memory/routines, and a normal eating schedule close to impossible.

In terms of weight loss, I've tried the full spectrum but never found it within myself to commit or have the time for anything. From keto, C25K, killing myself in the gym, or even avoiding meat and dairy, I've never found something that really ""stuck"".  

I've always taken active steps to stay healthy, even in college. I cook instead of going out, don't allow myself junk food, and walk a lot between classes. It's really hard for me to stay committed to a schedule, though, because I'm incredibly busy (full-time student, part-time job, additional internship, student organizations, and an editing role at an online magazine) and often don't even get ""free"" time until 10 PM at night. Yet, I continue to gain weight - I know I could do some things better or probably work out more, but it's hard for me to find the time.

Now that it's summer, I have more time to work on my weight loss before school starts, but am discouraged because I feel like I'm out of options. The University gym is available, but incredibly judgmental and I get very bored on an elliptical for 30 mins. Bodyweight exercise is almost a non-option due to limited space in the gym and a shared studio apartment with a roommate. Working out outside is dangerous because it gets super hot in the summers - I passed out last summer when trying to play tennis in the middle of the day. Meal prep is do-able, but I have a hard time committing to it when I have such a crazy schedule. I also don't have a ton of money to spend, and my only available grocery option is Whole Foods (for those who don't know, more expensive than normal grocery stores).

I guess this post is mostly a cry for help to people who may have been where I've been. I'm becoming convinced I'm meant to be fat and don't even know where to start to change that. Advice is appreciated."

Havent touched excel since year 10 IT class (age 14/15 and I'm 20 now). Have experience programming in Python and MATLAB, and I want to somewhat prepare a little for my internship as the job description has modelling described (I don't know with what languages but I assume VBA/Excel will be in the mix).

I am following these videos for Excel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGPx94pSOP0&amp;list=PL3FBEE51974F03CCF&amp;index=33

I will start VBA after - probably will do project euler problems 1-50 as I did for python and MATLAB. 

My questions:

- Is that sufficient - do those videos go into enough detail?

- Any particular book/resources you'd recommend? Or anything in Excel which is a must know

- What year is standard in the industry? I am learning Excel 2010

I plan to try incorporate Excel into some personal projects just to keep me familiar.  Thanks."

My boyfriend lives in the Henrietta area, and his lease is up on the 25th. I currently live south of Syracuse now, but am planning on moving in once schooling is done. We're 23 and 22, and both love the downtown area. We're currently having a little bit of trouble finding an apartment that is both what we like, and affordable. 

We are looking in the range of $500-700/month for rent, and must allow pets (I have two little fur babies that I could not give up. My kitties Theo and Moe).

He works at RIT, and I'm planning for an internship in the Rochester area. 

We have looked at a few places in the East/Park Ave area. That's where we would like to be close to, but knowing that we have limited time to find a place, and they're a little more pricey, we're getting a little nervous. 

If anyone has any recommendations on where to look, either area, rental complex, or companies, we would both really appreciate it!"

4m3csb,7,2016-06-01,I feel like I no longer have a relationship with my mother. Did I ever really have one? ([support]),bexyrex,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/4m3csb/i_feel_like_i_no_longer_have_a_relationship_with/,"So I just got off the phone with my mom. She's that silent sort of angry where she just gets real quiet and petulant. Shes angry because I didn't answer her text message about going to church etc.


I just didn't know what to say. I gave her a half-assed sorry and it was just so awkward and quiet. Then she made an underhanded comment ""Thats fine because I have strength in the lord and like david danced I will dance and watch those who work against me fall"". Then she said "" So have you changed your major too?"". To my mother changing your major is a sign of weakness and something that was berated into my head as a kid. Which is why I never changed my major. I don't love my major I actually wish I had changed it from neuroscience to health and societies but i'm Ok with it and i'm graduating in a year so at this point it doesn't matter. 

Then she went on about how "" It looks like you don't have any enthusiam like you used to over the past 2 years"". Which is funny because shes mistaking the anxiety inducing self destructive fear of failure for enthusiam. I was never particularly ENTHUSED. But I kept trying because I disdain being a failure. Eventually that bit me in the ass and I had to re-evaluate what sort of goal I was making out of my life and why. SO I spent the past year and a half looking at other things I may want to do besides medschool (which has been beaten into my brain as the only option since I was four. My mother likes to call it my dream but who are we kidding its her dream). 


Anyway I explored some classes and talked to people in different fields and I did end up back in healthcare but with a different mindset. I want to get my masters in Physician Assistant Studies and Public Health. I really really want to have some future involvement in public health and health policy but I also want relevant clinical exposure because I love working with patients and people and seeing the effects of my work. But at the same time I don't find the 8 year sacrifice of medschool and residency to be worthwhile for me.


Anyway, I feel like as the years have gone on I've lost any and all ability to feel like I have a relationship with my mother. I don't talk to her about anything and when I do its only when i'm questioned or when I have to drop the bomb at the last minute. I stopped talking to her about who I was and what I felt when I was 12 when she used y serious bullying experiences as evidence against me for not being a good enoough chrisitan but also that it was expected that only god would love me since i'm a ""child of god"". ( Which is funny because i've been a nonbeliever since I was 9 but was being bullied for years before that). 


And now that i'm getting older and i've changed so much I still find it so incredibly difficult to even talk to her. Since I stopped trying to feed her emotions I've noticed how little we have to build a relationship on. I'm not a religious person wherein she's fanatically religious and revolves her whole life around it. She doesn't like my hobbies and has in the past beaten me for drawing so I can't tell her about my art commissions that I do or my recent artwork or how excited I am to be developing an artistic style. She doesn't watch TV or movies so I cant tell her about the shows I watch. She doesn't know i'm dating my amazingly supportive boyfriend who's been one of my closest friends for 3 years so I can't tell her about that. She hated every friend I ever made in high-school even the girl who was within her religion and so I can hardly even tell her about my friends or their lives. She didn't even get excited for me last year when I got my research job or when I interned over the summer or that i'm doing an independent research this fall, or my interest in public health so I cant tell her about the internship I really want to get after I graduate. I can't tell her about moving out. She literally just doesn't know a thing that's substantial about me.

And I wonder if its my fault or not. Sometimes I just feel like everything is my fault. If I could just be a believer like she wants me to and go to medical school like she wants me to I'd be fine but I cannot do things I feel live been coerced and bullied into doing. And I hate myself because family, even though they hurt me are important to me, and I depend on them and I just feel like the villain. She lives through me and its exhausting but if I don't let her live through me I feel like i'm just killing her. She has nothing else to live for except her church and her kids (and her grandkids via my eldest brother). She has no hobbies and no real friends and all she does is work work work. Then she guilts me and makes it feel like I'm complicit in her misery.

Sometimes I don't think she's a full narcissist, she does have empathy and feelings but she's like an emotional vampire sometimes.

I'm not even trying to go no contact right now, I'm just being the gray rock as I've always been and its eating me up that I cant just have a normal family. That maybe I caused this. That I might not be able to fix it. Perhaps what she sacrificed wasn't what she should have sacrificed. (perhaps she sacrificed too much at the expense of our relationship).

 And maybe I never had a full mother. "
4m3g77,2,2016-06-01,I totally Cured anxiety for Two years - but now it's back.,adjouk,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/4m3g77/i_totally_cured_anxiety_for_two_years_but_now_its/,"Hey all, it's my first post in this forum and I'd like to share my story.

Up until I was 16, I was the most confident guy around - I didn't care what anyone thought etc. I then lost my mother suddenly at that age and I started partying hard etc and drinking/taking drugs. When I was around 18, I was walking downstairs and my grandmother shouted really loudly as my grandfather had collapsed. Since this incident, I started becoming really panicy and I had a severe panic attack. (I think these two events contributed a lot to my anxious state).

This triggered about 2 years of hell-like anxiety. I would literally wake up in the morning and not be able to get out of bed all day and just feel like I was dying. I was not depressed about life etc, I just didn't know what the hell was going on.

Anyway, I went to see a ""therapist/hypnotist"" and essentially what he done was showed me how to meditate. I did this once or twice and it made me realise anxiety was all in my own head. This greatly helped and it started to make me motivated again. 

I decided i didn't want to be that person anymore, so I joined an army training course for 13 weeks. During the first week it was hard, but I literally got RID OF ALL MY ANXIETY. I was doing fitness 2/3 times a day and I was forced to interact with people yet again. It felt great. This changed my life again, and I became the confident guy that I was. I didn't go to the army but I decided to go to college for a year so I could go to university - which I did.

This is where it went wrong again. Being in university made me isolated. I drank a lot yet again and I avoided lectures as I was so anxious. I only socialised when drunk and I began to use alcohol as the tool to socialise. 

I am two years into my degree but I have now left as my internship has kept me on full time so I have a decent job. But what nobody knows is, my anxiety is crippling me. And my friends don't know it because they only see me when I'm drunk.

Basically, I know what is causing the problem. It's drinking/partying and avoiding social situations. I've joined this reddit to keep myself motivated - as I will defeat this and I will not fall into the same rut again.

If any of you have experienced something similar to me - please comment below. I want to cut the party lifestyle and become that super confident guy I am when I'm drunk. Meditating and being active helps so so much! 

If anyone has advice or tips - please send me them.

^ Life story :p  - feels good to get it all off my chest!

Oh yeah and my main purpose for this is to show people that THERE IS HOPE AND THERE IS A WAY OUT. I know it as I've done it. But you have to maintain it to remain anxiety free. I believe that lifestyle changes are critical - it's just really difficult; especially while being surrounded with students (in my case)."
4m3y44,23,2016-06-01,Interview (M/f),KingOfAstoria,BDSMerotica,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMerotica/comments/4m3y44/interview_mf/,"“Can I take your coat?” a very stylishly dressed receptionist asked a young nervous looking woman before her in a calm and soothing voice.

“Sure, to ahead,” the woman answered. Her name was Kayla and today was supposed to be a milestone in her career. She wanted to become an intern for a major legal firm during her studies, but she ended up having trouble with her parents and spending a lot of time on coast to coast flights, having to postpone the start of her career to a later date. Now that her studies were finished, she felt it was the right time to send her CV to various companies that were hiring and see what comes out. There were only very few reputable law firms in the city, three to be exact. Two of them weren’t hiring. Only one was, the most reputable of them all, KLL. A company with a long lasting tradition of excellence, but it was not the place Kayla wanted to work in. She knew it was a way too fancy, over the top professional and unforgiving environment. But it was also a challenge. 

Kayla scanned the lushly decorated waiting room and saw three other people. Two men and one woman. Everyone was nervous as hell, biting on their nails, texting or nervously checking the internet. Not one of the applicants seemed confident. That didn’t make Kayla feel particularly good, but she was normally fairly successful at suppressing her fear. She actually considered the ability to work under stress one of her biggest advantages.

“Hello everyone, thank you for coming. Miss Carmichael and Mister Keaton will interview you today. I’ll divide you into two groups and each of you will be assigned to one of the two interviewers. I’ll come back in five minutes. 

Kayla knew both of the people she mentioned. Miss Carmichael was an international law specialist and a very popular woman in the educated circles. She often appeared on television and even in her forties she always appeared fresh and energetic. She was very polite and definitely not a threat to Kayla. Mister Keaton however… he was the owner of the company, head lawyer and a person Kayla knew little about. She naturally wanted to be interviewed by a woman – she assumed Miss Carmichael would understand her better, but she also knew how unlucky she could sometimes get. She once lost the lottery by just one number.

“So, here are the two people interviewed by Mister Keaton,” the receptionist said, storming into the waiting room. She clutched a small piece of paper in her left hand. After a quick glance at it, she continued: “David Moore and Anthony Price. Ladies, you’ll be interviewed by Miss Carmichael. Good luck. David, come with me,” the woman said and Kayla felt an overwhelming sense of relief. This was one of many small turns of luck she needed to succeed. Everything was going well thus far and she was grateful for it.

David went in and the interview began. No loud noises were coming out, the conversation seemed normal. Several minutes later, a red faced, nervous and sweaty creature walked out, barely being able to close the door with its shaky hands. Clearly, Mister Keaton wasn’t an easy person to get along with.

“Miss Kayla Jensen,” the receptionist called and Kayla stood up, straightened her business skirt and slowly walked into the conference room. The room was airy with views of the rainy city serving as a backdrop to the undoubtedly important conferences taking part here. On the far end of the room was a young man with dark hair, a two day stubble and a very focused look. He was probably doing something on his computer and didn’t want to be interrupted as he didn’t even acknowledge the young woman who just entered the room.  He seemed displeased.

“Thank God!” Kayla thought when she saw the arrogant young man ignoring her and being generally disrespectful.
“Miss Jensen, I’ll ask you to whisper. Mister Keaton is doing something very important on his computer,” Miss Carmichael said slowly, looking in Keaton’s direction.

The bizarre whisper-interview was about to commence.

“So, you’d like to be employed here at KLL. We’re a very reputable company and only look for the best. Do you have any experience in the field? Your CV seems a little empty…” the elegantly dressed woman said. Her voice was low and every few seconds she looked in Keaton’s direction, checking if the noise levels were acceptable to him. She was a completely different woman from the one Kayla knew from television.

“Ehm, I worked part time in a law firm in Detroit, but then they stopped operating and so I chose not to put it in my CV,” Kayla answered, minding her voice and also checking on the man at the end of the conference table.

“Great, I’m happy to hear that you know how things work in similar companies as ours. That’s always a plus,” Miss Carmichael said. “What are your hobbies?”

“I like music, sports…I do yoga and badminton. One day I’d like to buy a farm with horses. It’s that connection between people and animals,” Kayla continued. “I’d like some of that.”

Miss Carmichael looked in Keaton’s direction again and then silently continued. “I know, right. I went horse riding a couple of times and though it was scary at first, but it eventually became very enjoyable and relaxing…”

“Send her over,” Keaton announced loudly. It came out of nowhere.

“I’m supposed to interview her according to the…” Miss Carmichael tried to protect her interviewee.

“Send. Her. Over!” Keaton worded out the order, his eyes not leaving the screen of his laptop.

“Sure…” Miss Carmichael admitted defeat and gave Kayla the “I know, right?” look.

Kayla stood up and suddenly felt pressure in her head. It was nothing like the final exams. This was the real world. It was a strong sensation, earth shaking even. But what was there to lose? She didn’t want the job anyway now that she saw the owner of the establishment. Could she work under such an arrogant jerk? 

She slowly walked to Keaton who was still looking at the screen of his laptop and then took a seat. Keaton was wearing a dark blue sweater with a white shirt underneath – by far the most casual of all the outfits one could see at KLL. He could afford to. It was unlikely any of his employees would challenge him on anything, let alone his clothes. He was a millionaire and a respected lawyer. Nobody could say a bad word in front of him.

“Miss Jensen,” Keaton said, his eyes still pointed at the screen of his computer, “who are you?”

Kayla wanted to give him some kind of an answer, but then she paused. What kind of a question was that? Who was she? A graduate? A young woman? A naïve twentysomething creature trying to make it in the world? “I’m… a twenty two year old woman from Omaha in…”

“I know where Omaha is,” Keaton interrupted her, his voice increasingly frustrated. “What do you want from life?” he then asked.

“I’d like to become…”

“I’ll interrupt you again Miss Jensen,” he said and then he finally stopped looking at his computer and gave Kayla a look for the first time. His gaze was very strong and Kayla couldn’t hold it. Suddenly she found herself looking at her hands, nervously shaking in her lap.

""I’ll give you a word of advice,” Keaton said. “Don’t say “I’d like to”. Say “I want to”,” he said, still looking at her.

“Yes Sir,” Kayla answered. Then, she realized just how subservient that sounded and shook her head in disbelief. Where did that attitude come from? Seconds ago she wanted to tear him into pieces and now she was unable to stand up to him. She wanted to take those words back, but it was too late. She nervously looked at Keaton, who didn’t react to her word selection and continued with the interview.

“Why did you choose to become a lawyer?” he asked. It was probably the first normal question, one that people get asked at interviews. 

Kayla had a good answer prepared, but she almost didn’t want to give it. It sounded too superficial. She knew Keaton would see through her fake enthusiasm.

“Other than you want to make money to buy horses,” Keaton added.

“Ugh…” Kayla uttered, angry at the man before her. He was arrogant, intensive and clearly not pleased with her answers. What was the point of continuing the conversation? She wanted to stand up to Keaton, but it was impossible. Her heart started beating through her chest, her breath was shallow…she couldn’t speak. She’d love to tell him how wrong was his attitude to young job seeking graduates, but she simply couldn’t do it. “It’s about justice, the ability to help people when they…”

Keaton interrupted her again. “Miss Jensen, we defend the people who pay us, not the people who are right. I thought you knew that.”

“I know that, of course,” Kayla replied in a hurry. “But sometimes, we can also help,” Kayla said.

“We won’t get along,” Keaton sighed. Then, his gaze left Kayla as a previously unseen person walked in the room.

Kayla turned around to see a man in a suit, carrying a bunch of papers clipped together.

“What did I tell you about folders?” Keaton scolded the man immediately. “They’re meant to be utilized,” he added.

“Sorry. Here’s the research. I’m sure the case we’re looking for is in there somewhere,” he said. “Most cases involve a careless biker. One in particular is very similar to ours. I think it will work.”

“Martin?” Keaton asked, seemingly ignoring the information he was given.

“Yes Mister Keaton?” Martin replied immediately.

“Would you employ this woman?” Keaton asked and pointed his finger at Kayla.

Kayla blushed and turned around to give Martin a confused look. 

Martin shrugged: “Sure, why not.” He didn’t seem as confused as Kayla expected him to be. Maybe he was used to Keaton’s antics.

“You’re hired,” Keaton said in an unexcited voice and extended his arm towards Kayla.

Kayla still couldn’t quite hold his gaze, but she gave him a few seconds before looking down and quickly letting him squeeze her hand. She couldn’t believe it. She was given the job and the two other applicants didn't get to be interviewed yet.

But then the realization dawned on her. She couldn’t take it. Keaton was too intense, dangerous and controlling. She couldn’t work under him. It would make her life miserable. He would make her life miserable.

“M…Mister Keaton…” Kayla mumbled. “I can’t take the job.”

Keaton leaned back, his eyes not leaving Kayla’s. “Why?”

It wasn’t that difficult to explain, really. “I don’t like the environment. It’s way too…”

She couldn’t finish her sentence. Keaton stood up and loudly exclaimed: “Everyone out of the room. I want a private conversation with this woman.”

Martin and Miss Carmichael both briskly left the room and she was now alone with Keaton. The pace of their departure was truly stunning – as if they expected something.

“Mister Keaton, I’m sorry, I just can’t take it…” Kayla said.

“You don’t like how we work here?” Keaton asked, his voice low and rough.

“I made a mistake. I was naïve. I’m sorry,” Kayla said.

“There’s only one thing that’s above the US law. Do you know what that thing is?” He sounded as though he was still continuing the interview.

“International law?” Kayla answered.

“No. Above that,” Keaton replied, unimpressed. His face remained unfazed. 

“God?” Kayla answered instinctively. 

“Me,” Keaton corrected her. “Are you afraid of me?” he asked out of nowhere.

 “I don’t know!” Kayla answered, raising her voice. She wanted to leave, but because Keaton kept staring her down, she somehow felt compelled to continue the conversation. It was as if he had a magnet that kept her close and prevented her from leaving.

“Of course you are,” Keaton replied immediately.

“I have to go,” Kayla sighed. She wasn’t talking to Keaton but to herself. She desperately wanted to muster enough courage to stand up and leave, but she was somehow still glued to her chair.

“Who do you belong to?” Keaton asked casually. It was yet another one of his weird questions but the way he phrased it made it sound just as normal as “How are you?”.

“What do you mean?” Kayla answered. “I belong to myself.”

“No, you don’t,” Keaton replied. “Every woman belongs to someone. Her father, her boyfriend, her husband or, worst case scenario, that perfect man who resides in her head – you know, the one she sees herself with when dreaming of her future, the one who’s perfect, strong, caring, relentless and unforgiving. He punishes her when she’s with a lesser man than him. He teases her when she’s alone and desperate. He takes up all the free space in her mind, giving her a terrible headache at times. Is it him?”

Kayla paused for a moment, unsure how to react to the strange turn the conversation took. Suddenly, there was a lot of electricity in the air and everything seemed very personal. The detached unimpressed businessman turned into a male predator, scaling his prey. “Uhm. I have a boyfriend, but…”

“You’re lying,” Keaton answered. “I can see it in your eyes. The man who owns you is inside your head. And he’s mistreating you. I want him out.”

“What are you talking about?” Kayla asked.

“Stop fearing me. Open yourself to me,” Keaton said loudly, annoyed by Kayla’s lack of understanding. “Tell me what you really think.”

Kayla took a deep breath. Before she’d leave, she might as well tell the truth. “I can’t work under someone so intense and …”

“Just say it,” Keaton teased.

“Dominant,” Kayla said. She almost couldn’t believe just how that word came out of her mouth. But it was out in the open now. “I can’t. I need space to breathe. This isn’t for me. This is not the environment I want to work in,” she said.

“If I moved a little closer to you,” Keaton said, looking at Kayla, “you’d get up from your chair and take a step back, wouldn’t you?”

“Probably,” Kayla said, not even thinking about it too much. Her heart was already pounding and now he proposed getting closer to her. 

“Hmm. I understand,” he said. “But there must be a way for me to move closer to you. You need me closer to you. It’s the only way I can breach the barrier between us and make you accept me and stop being afraid of me. You know that,” he said.

“What are you talking about?” Kayla asked. She was getting increasingly nervous. Keaton seemed to have something on his mind. 

“Stand up and walk over there,” Keaton said, pointing his finger at the far right corner of the large room he was in.

Kayla’s mind was hijacked. She was walking to the place Keaton indicated without even thinking about it. Somewhere deep down inside she knew it was stupid to cooperate with the man, but she just couldn’t focus hard enough to find a way out of the room. Keaton was a very intensive presence in the room and overshadowed everything else and everyone else.

“Good,” Keaton said. “Now, turn around,” Keaton ordered and watched Kayla turn on her heels to face him. 

Kayla looked away. She tried to find a way out. All she needed to do was to say “stop” and walk out. But somehow, that was close to impossible. The room wasn’t locked and Keaton probably wouldn’t chase her down the hallway. She could walk out…but could she actually?

“Put your arms behind your back,” Keaton ordered. 

Kayla knew this was no good. 

“Put them behind your back, Kayla,” Keaton said again. His voice wasn’t particularly irritated. He seemed very at ease but there was a certain firmness to the way he said things. It was difficult to oppose him.

Kayla obeyed. Her arms were behind her back and her hands clasped behind her buttocks. She gave Keaton a two to three second advantage. If he were to do anything, she’d have about that much time to move her arms back forward and try to prevent him from touching her. Somehow, she knew it would be pointless.

“I’m not going to hurt you,” Keaton said as he got one step closer to Kayla. Then, he took another step and suddenly he was right in front of her. 

She could smell his expensive cologne and knew that she was in trouble. His body was huge, muscular and obviously more powerful. His entire persona was bigger than she could ever imagine. It was not easy for her to maintain composure.

“Imagine being with that man in your head…you know. The one I talked about earlier. Imagine being with him,” Keaton said.

“Sh…should I close my eyes?” Kayla asked.

“You can imagine him while looking at me,” Keaton answered. “Can you feel it?”

Kayla was in some kind of a hyperspace. She couldn’t think straight. She didn’t even know what she was saying.

“I asked you a question. Answer me. Can you feel it? Can you feel…him?”

“Yes,” Kayla answered. “I…yes.”

Keaton smiled a little bit. It was the slightest facial expression that could pass for a smile. “I’m just like that man. But there’s one important difference between me and him. I’m real.”"

I am a Dutch master student who's gonna do an internship in one of the computational biology labs at the school of medicine.   This intership will start around the end of October 2016 and will last approximately 6 months.

So I was wondering if some of you could maybe supply me with some information regarding housing and just general life in Pittsburgh?  
Thanks in advance!

4m4c8u,1,2016-06-01,Cynthia Lewis - Behemoth,Thrice_Berg,randomsuperpowers,https://www.reddit.com/r/randomsuperpowers/comments/4m4c8u/cynthia_lewis_behemoth/,"**Name:** Cynthia Lewis 

**Alias:** Behemoth

**Age:** 19

**Species:** Demonic Host

**Physical Description:**

Cynthia is an attractive young woman with straight blonde hair tied back into a ponytail and sharp green eyes. She has a slender frame that looks like it hasn't had a day of hard work in her life- although that was pretty darn true until recently. Her left leg has some burn scarring on it from an accident while she was in Hell^TM. 

Her powers can dramatically alter her appearance, such is opening a massive mouth on her stomach, fulled with long sharp teeth and a massive tongue. This only appears if both Ika and Cynthia wish it too.

She never wears shorts anymore, instead preferring to wear long jeans (or knee high socks if this is a skirt event).

**Mentality:**

Cynthia is without a doubt intelligent, although she rarely chooses to display it. Despite being much more tolerable than she was at the start of her journey through canon, she still sometimes gives in to her spiteful nature.

She does try though, and she is very mellow compared to what she was before. She is generally somewhat detached- although she can get worked up into a firey rage really, really easily.

She doesn't like Marcus Smith, and if the opportunity ever arose, she would back stab him.

**Backstory:**

Cynthia Lewis was the bratty daughter of a rich man, who had finally had enough with her. Sick of her attitude, he cut her off for a year, during which Cynthia had to support herself.

She was quite intelligent, and got a job at the successful Smith Powers. Unfortunately, Marcus Smith used this to force her to go through an adventure through hell.

During this time, she bonded with an ancient and unspeakable entity of sin, Ika. Placing on some cursed armor, the demon like being took the opportunity to merge with her soul, creating an unbreakable bond between the pair.

After this, she decided to accept Marcus's offer to join a superteam of the others of the expidition who got powers, including but not limited too, the White Recluse and Chris.

**Resources: Assets**

Her family is very rich, although she doesn't speak to them anymore. She does earn 6 figures from her position in Smith Power, which is nice. She lives in a nice apartment in a good neighbourhood in chicago.

**In Character Reputation:**

Cynthia Lewis isn't really known, except as either a: the estranged daughter of a rich family, or b. an intern at smith power. Some interdenominational travelers may know Ika as the gluttony demon but who knows.

---

**Proposed Tier:** 3

**Powers:**

Cynthia manifested her powers when she foolishly decided to wear a suit of armor that had been the prison of an old god of gluttony, a demon like being named Ika. Ika has been bound to Cynthia, giving her great power- but demanding constant sacrifice. 

Ika is a being of gluttony, and as such Cynthia must provide it with enough meals in order to briefly satisfy it's eternal hunger. Surprisingly, traditional food doesn't really do that much for Ika (although Cynthia can / wants to eat almost constantly since the bonding without many side effects), to satisfy it's hunger Cynthia must resort to more... esoteric sources of energy. Ika eats souls, powerful magic, and other sources of energy (hell, even something like a power core can work). 

Should Cynthia fail to provide, she'll be placed through agonizing pain, and be induced into a hulk like state, going on a wild rampage until Ika can eat enough through her body to satisfy her hunger. Ika can also temporarily take away her powers should she make a decision that he disagree with.

Ika grants Cynthia three boons:

####**The Ravenous Mouth:**

Ika's physical manifestation on Cynthia's body, when *both* of the pair will it, Cynthia can 'crack' open her stomach, which manifests into a [massive belly-mouth](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/147546210054438912/176152989453516801/146063970726982.png) (although Cynthia looks nothing like the girl, the mouth is about right) with long sharp teeth and an even longer tongue. The mouth has various properties I can describe below. 

* First and foremost, the mouth is not limited by size. Despite being the size of a slender woman's torso, the thing could eat a cow whole, somehow stretching large enough to envelop the thing and eat it whole. This takes longer the larger the thing she is attempting to eat is, going anywhere from instantly for anything human size or less, to days to devour a warehouse or something like that. 
 * Speaking of size, no-one is quite sure where Ika's mouth leads exactly, but nothing that has gone into it has ever been heard from again. Nor does any connection (magical, technological, physical) survive the process.
 * She can actually use this to her advantage be eating things that would normally hurt her, such as opening it to eat a spear or a fireball thrown at her by a amazonian or a wizard. 
* The mouth's bite is extremely powerful, being able to bite through far more than the rest of Cynthia and Ika can damage normally, being able to bite through anything short of adamantine. However, on more durable things, this bite takes a while to complete, making it impractical to preform in combat. A normal instant bite could bite through her own durability.
* The tongue of the stomach is extremely strong, and although prone to being cut easily, regenerates surprisingly quickly. It is also extremely *long*, and Cynthia has full control over the thing, meaning she's able to reach out and grab people with it, or lash opponents with it like a whip.
 * The tongue is lightning fast, able to shoot out at 5 times the speed of a normal whip in order to lash opponents for powerful damage (against unarmored targets, less so against armored ones) and to apply the poison described below. The tongue has a strength of 40 tons.
* The teeth and tounge of Ika's mouth are coated in a powerful venom, which causes numbness within minutes of entering the blood stream. More strikes bring the venom effects to bare much quicker.

**Edit:**

* The mouth leads to a corrupting dimension which slowly digests anything inside. People can remain alive for quite some time, and can escape should they manage to go through three 'impossible' tasks. On top of this, should Cynthia die, everything still alive shall be released in a massive eruption of matter.

####**The Starving Armor:**

The Armor is what Ika was bound in, and also what binds Cynthia to Ika. A decently powerful artifact- despite the fact that it binds Cynthia to a greater demonic being, is actually quite the boon when it comes to combat, providing a few solid bonuses. The [Starving Armor](https://cdn0.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/001/727/372/large/jennifer-choi-knightccg.jpg?1451852250) looks like the pictured armor, although there is a slight shadowy wispy aura that escapes from the chinks in the armor.

* First of all, although Cynthia is permanently bound to the armor and cannot remove it, the armor itself can shape-shift into a copy of anything Ika has eaten, for example feeding Ika a shirt would result in Cynthia being able to shift the armor into a shirt. Everything it turns into will fit perfectly and will always be perfectly clean.
* Secondly, whilst inside the armor, Cynthia can draw upon Ika's massive amounts of power to enhance her strength, toughness, speed, and agility. These boosts can be preformed even if the armor has shapeshifted into something else, such as a dress. 
 * However, using these boosts will make Ika much more hungry, and thus they can only be used for an hour before Cynthia transforms into her mindless hunger mode, where she'll lose control and eat anything in her way.
 * Even just during the transformation Cynthia loses some control, and often starts eating random things in the middle of fights in order to satisfy the ever-hungry Ika and prevent him from cancelling her powers.



####**The Shadow Armory:**

Before being bound, Ika had to give his hosts something to defend themselves with, and eventually he came up with the Shadow Armory. Becoming more powerful as the user goes out and consumes, it was the perfect tool for a host of Ika.

* Cynthia can fire orbs of shadow that act as an immaterial conduit for Ika to eat weapons. While Ika can summon 'standard' medieval weapons (swords, spears, bow and arrows) thanks to him eating thousands of them in ancient times, he needs to 'eat' any modern weapons or sci-fi / magical one in order to use them.
* Once Cynthia has absorbed a weapon (which can be *any* weapon, laser gun or magical spear of doom), she gain the ability to summon a single copy of them. A ranged weapon will come with one full quiver, clip, etc. with no capability to reload, and a melee weapon gets one use.

Weapon Type | Shots Required
:-:|:-:
Normal | 1
Demonic | 1
High-Tech | 3
Magical | 5
Divine | 10
Sentient | 10

**Resources: Equipment**

Can summons shadowy weapons, and has the Starved armor, and keeps some mace on her. Other than that, nothing really. She relies on the benefits of having Ika with her to fight almost entirely.

**Miscellaneous Skills:**

Cynthia is very academically intelligent, despite her not acting like it most of the time. She can offer many insightful opinions and things that one would not expect from her most of the time, and is generally quick minded.

---

**Strength:**

While in the Starving armor, Cynthia can lift up to 130 tons without too much trouble. She can lift 150 if she really pushes herself, but for the most part 130 is her in combat limit.

**Movement:**

She can move at about 60mph in a fight, and although quick, she isn't particularly agile, limited to hulk like jumps and stuff like that. She much prefers to barge through an object than move around it.

**Defense:**

Her armor gives her a large amount of defense, allowing her to shrug off bullets and grenades without any effort at all. She can even take a few missile strikes (mid level artillery), but those are quite painful for her, and she can't take too many direct hits.

**Perception/Awareness:**

Cynthia is intelligent and aware of her surroundings compared to a normal person, although it isn't superhuman or anything. She's more detail oriented rather than being aware of her surroundings.

**Fighting Ability:**

She has somewhat better skills than a normal person, but for the most part she relies on her abilities and powers to fight, being much more inclined to use raw force than skill or finesse. She has been buying lessons so this may change in the future.

**Danger:**

High physical strength and the ability to remove *anything* incapacitated or unable to fight back make her a very dangerous opponent. She could potentially level large buildings and an extended fight might spell the end for a city block.

**Weaknesses:**

Ika's unholy force merged with her soul has made her weak to intrinsically good / purfying things. When they are near him, Cynthia has trouble forming the Starving Armor and manifesting Ika, which scales with just how 'good' they are.

On top of that, she can easily tunnel vision on something that Ika would want to devour, leading her into an almost rage like frenzy in order to get to it, neglecting or even harming her innocents and team in order to get to it."

I'll be in HK from end of july to end of august for an internship.

It will be in the International Commerce Centre.

I need to figure out housing right now.

Also, is subway a better option than bus?

There are cheaper places if I take the bus but kinda scared it will be difficult to catch in the morning.

We were in and out of the courts for two weeks before we got him out. I am also studying for the LSAT's and my pretest was sub par. I cannot stop thinking about the importance of this test and how I need to do well on it. My best friends have also been fairly distant lately and I cannot stop thinking if I did something wrong or why they hate me, even though I know I  did nothing wrong. While I am at my internship i rotate between these three thoughts and it is driving me completely insane. I just want to sit and do nothing, but I can't even get myself to do that. I have to constantly be doing something to not start thinking about the twist and turns of my summer so far.

It's looking like a very sweaty summer for us guilters! First, Super Lawyer Kathleen Zellner received a 90 day extension to file what is sure to be the *Mona Lisa* of justice, ensuring our inevitable ownage. Then, our collaboration with the MTSO PR and some ill-tempered mods to eliminate the intense sleuthing in the main sub has blown up in our sweaty faces - with the birth of a new *even sleuthier* sub! 

Frankly, we don't have much to do here at **KIT Headquarters,** so I had my team make a list of claims made by Kathleen Zellner via her twitter account so we could have an idea what we're up against and maybe get a guilter brainstorm session going. 

*Please note that some of these were deleted, and thanks to our intern Elizabeth (we call her ""Sweaty Betty!"") for helping put this together!*

**Bold Claims in Queen Z's Tweets:**

*January 1, 2016:*

&gt; .#Makingamurderer is a simple recipe; a tablespoon of your blood planted by cops in victim's car blended with false confession of slow teen.

&gt; .#MakingAMurderer; If Kratz had real evidence of Avery's guilt he wouldn't have had to rely on planted blood &amp; coerced confession to convict.

&gt; .#MakingAMurderer whoever deleted Teresa Halbach cellphone calls is either the murderer or part of coverup. Either way the killer is free.

* Claims blood is planted by cops in TH's car, BD's confession is ""false,"" and that ""whoever deleted Teresa Halbach cellphone calls (?) is either the murderer or part of the cover up.""

**NOTE: The press release from Zellner Law saying they have taken on Avery as a client is dated January 8, 2016.**

&gt; btw:if Teresa Halbach was alive and well when she left Avery than all of the evidence on the property was planted. #MakingAMurderer

* Claims there is no doubt that Teresa left the Avery property alive, that this proves ""all of the evidence on the property was planted,"" and implies the evidence leads to one door - the real killer's.

*May 17, 2016:*

&gt; SA: evidence planted -trailer, garage, fire pit. burn barrel &amp; car. BD: evidence planted - in his mind. Both: badly done #MakingAMurderer

* Claims the key, bullet, bones, and car were all planted on Avery's property.

***

**IN SUMMARY:**

* Steven Avery is innocent and literally all the evidence was planted. For most of it, it's either implied or explicitly stated that LE did the planting.

* Cellphone tower records provide an airtight alibi for Avery and it's clear Teresa left the Avery property alive.

* Teresa's body wasn't burned in the burn pit.

* The killer didn't have access to the crusher, and whomever deleted cell phone calls from Teresa's phone is involved in either her death or the cover-up.

* It's ""kinda obvious"" who the killer is, and ""all roads lead to one door.""

* By the end of January she had already put in over 250 hours of time and had 14 people working on the case.

4m5547,18,2016-06-01,[Progress] Former runner 115lbs- 135lbs,BabyBlondeBeard,gainit,https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/4m5547/progress_former_runner_115lbs_135lbs/,"Long time lurker and excited to read everyone's stories each morning! Please forgive my formatting as I usually don't post longer comments. I am 5'8, and up from 115 lbs to 135 lbs in about 3 months

I am currently 22 years old and a recent college grad. I ran competitively the last 8 years of my life so I have hovered around 110-115 lbs. the last 4 years. My lifting schedule during cross country consisted of 2 full-body workouts a week. These lifts were usually 2 sets of about 10-14 reps of bench, squats, lunges, etc...
After deciding to stop running my last semester of my senior year to focus on internships and grad school resumes, I started a lazy bulk and no real routine. while I did notice some gains initially, it wasn't until I got serious about my diet and lifting habits. 

I currently aim for 2500 calories a day, but now that I am living back at home and not on a Sodexo meal plan where calories are easier to measure, I have to be conscious of what I eat. A typical day looks like this:
Breakfast-Waffle/sandwich with peanut butter and Nutella, milk, some leftovers from the night before. Glass of water.
Lunch- Some form of meat and grains precooked (Thanks mom) More recently I've been eating Tyson chicken and sometimes frozen macaroni. Not the healthiest but it is easy. Glass of chocolate milk.
Dinner-Some kind of meat on the grill. rice/noodles and vegetables. Glass of chocolate milk.
Snacks- Nature valley bars, pb sandwiches, hotpockets, anything I can get my hands on. I am also not afraid to eat some fast food if I'm out and about, although it is not a major part of my diet. 

I use some supplements because my brother works at Vitamin Shoppe and gets some nice discounts...
Creatine: 5g a day
Bcaa's: One serving of xplode pre/intra workout.

I spend about two hours a day working out and really make sure I have plenty of rest between sets. I am running a split and a typical week looks like this:

Monday- Chest/triceps
Chest
-db bench, 4 sets of 8-12
-Incline db, 4 sets of 8-12
-Decline db, 3 sets of 8-12
- Pec flies, 3 sets of 12

-Front raises, 3 sets of 12
-Lat raises, 3 sets of 12 
-Face pulls, 3 sets of 12 
Shrugs, 3 sets of 15

Thursday- Day off
Friday-Repeat

 I try to do abs about 3-4 times a week usually doing one machine and then a circuit with leg raises, a set of planks (medicine ball plans, side planks, extenders, etc...) 

I would like to start deadlifting more frequently but I need to work on form. I have DL in the past but my gym isn't DL friendly. I would also like to squat more frequently as my legs aren't seeing the growth I would like. 

My goals as of now are to continue to bulk up to 145 and then figure out what I want to do from there. I want to work on my bench progress. I started benching 75 lbs and have increased that to about 110 for reps.My squats were at 95 lbs and now they are up to 150 for reps. 

Finally, any critique on my program, physique, diet and any areas that need extra attention are gladly welcomed!

Here are some of my progress pictures. I wish I would have taken more but these will have to do.

That whole neighborhood is behind me. Memories from those street propelled me through high school, college, business schools. Late night and internships. Coffee runs and dumb meetings. Hating that place drove me to a better life. 

But man they had the best pizza back there. 

I promised myself I would never go back. But it's not really going back if it's just for one slice, right? Ok, maybe two slices. But it's still no homecoming. I can be in and out and no one will see me. 

At least, that's what I told myself. Now that I'm here in front of the shop, I can't open the door. I should turn around, head back and order another fucking salad. 

But then some dude opens the door and - oh my. The garlic. The oregano. Even the smell of those cheap plastic red and white countertops brings back the memories. Next thing I know I'm standing in front of those glass dividers as if I'm some art fiend checking out the latest gallery. Only I get to eat the art. 

""Hungry?""

That voice. I look up. And then I see that it's you.

All I wanted was a couple slices!"
4m5blj,8,2016-06-01,"Me [23 F] with my long distance BF [26 M] of 2,5 years, and his intern [20s F]. Am I overreacting or is this out of line?",throwawaywithdoubts,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4m5blj/me_23_f_with_my_long_distance_bf_26_m_of_25_years/,"Me and my BF have a mostly sweet and chill relationship. In just 3 or 4 months we're going to be together for good, after at least one year and a half of long distance. I met him while on an exchange to his country, and after i came back to my country to finish my studies, we decided to work it out. We're super devoted to each other, trying to discuss things as openly as possible, and there has never been any suspicions or trust issues from both sides. However, there's something lately that has been bothering me..

He works in a company where every semester he has to administer a small group of interns, around 4 people. This semester, he's been telling me regularly how happy he is with the current group, as they're very dedicated. One of them is this 20-something girl, that according to him is a very hard working girl, super talented, picks things fast, and whatnot. He's been telling theses things about her here and there all these pasts months. I've been fine with it and even admire myself the amount of effort she puts on things, from what he says. But here and there he also slips that they can relate a lot on several things, as in the songs they like (he's a metalhead), their view on things and even personality traits. I've never really been rubbed the wrong way by these statements until now, but i couldnt prevent myself from feeling slightly put off.

Anyway, two days ago we were happily talking on the phone (we try to talk everyday for at least one hour, but with our 5-hour time difference, its not always possible and our schedules often crash), and he starts going about how happyhe is  with the girl's work, it's been fantastic to have her there taking the load off of him and stuff, and then im happy for him too. But then i say ""so its a pity that hers and the others interns time is almost up for the semester, right?"". He responds that actually she's going to be hired as an employee there. (He had also told me about another intern that is going to be hired, but that weeks ago, i just learned about the girl two days ago). Okay, kinda sucks for me, but good for the girl, of course. I voice my concerns a bit saying that it makes me feel inadequate how ""in tune"" they are while I'm one continent away, and they see each other nearly  everyday for 6 hours in a row, while i get to talk to him on the phone for barely 1 hour everyday. I just said i didnt like the idea of it  and asked  him to simply not to tell me more about their interactions, as i cant help but feel a bit jealous. He reassured me a little and i moved past it.

But just following this, he lets me know that this saturday we wont be able to call and catch up from the week, since the interns (mostly the girl, apparently) have been insisting for weeks that their department makes something fun together to bond outside of the workplace, so theyll be having a barbecue. My bf says they set up the barbecue from 3pm to 23pm, and i was weirded out by how long this seemed. So i said ""you have to see your workmates during the entire week and now on the weekend as well?"", and he said ""i knoww, so annoying, i wish i didnt have to"". So i said ""but you dont have to stay there the whole time, you could go idk at 5pm, or go at 3pm and leave at 7pm"". I dont understand why but he got kinda defensive over it, saying i was demanding him to leave earlier, and that he doesnt like to go out with a set up time to go home. Which is understandable, but for one i didnt demand anything from him, i just asked a reasonable question. And why would he say he doesnt want to go while at the same time he plans to stay in the gathering the entire time? It doesnt make a lot of sense to me.

Anyway, my whole issue with it is that i feel like i need some more garantees from him. I dont think he wants to pursuit the girl or anything (which i cannot say the same about her, honestly). I trust him but i wish he would put himself in my shoes and see how innapropriate it seems, we being this far apart while he and this girl connect almost on an emotional level regularly, and now she's going to stay there for good. And the whole barbecue thing i confess it feels kinda shady for me.. 

The moment he went on to say that he isnt atracted to her and i shouldnt worry about it was followed by comments on how amazing she does at the work, how dedicated she is, how this how that. I mean, i wish he would just back off a bit... My question is if all this from an outside perspective seems inapropriate/inconsiderate or if am i overreacting. Also, what could we do to reach a compromise? I'm not expecting the girl to be sent away or something, i hope she has a great future and all. I do hope though my bf would stop with the comments about her and to just put some brakes on their interactions. Is this reasonable?

**tl;dr** : Long distance boyfriend admires a lot one of his interns and it makes me feel insecure. Is it unreasonable to ask him to tone it down?"
4m5naw,3,2016-06-02,I [23 F] told my FWB [25 M] I have feelings for him and he has ignored me ever since he left the country 6 months ago.,seagal126,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4m5naw/i_23_f_told_my_fwb_25_m_i_have_feelings_for_him/,"In September 2015 I met my FWB. We got along great but both of us weren't looking for a relationship because he was graduating in December but we had great sex together and wanted to try being FWB.

So we did it. Once a week (sometimes more) he would come over or I would go to his place, we would talk for up to two hours, have great sex, and then go our separate ways. We often went home with each other after being out at the bars and overall had a great time together.

On Halloween night, my friends had bailed on me for going out together so I texted my FWB and asked if we could meet up. He was extremely vague but I decided to go to the bar anyways by myself. He does eventually show up but once he's there, he proceeds to insult me and belittle me every second he gets. I felt horrible, called my best friend to pick me up, cried the entire night, and removed him from every social media platform possible.

I was doing well for the next month until my birthday rolled around at the beginning of December. Queue him texting me on the night of my birthday asking if he could come over and we could talk. We talked on the phone about the Halloween incident until he apologized. He came over with a bottle of wine and things went on as usual until he was about to leave, I realized he was too drunk to drive home. I was relatively sober so I drove him home myself. After I parked his car, I walked him into his house and since his roommates were in the living room, I left him there and started walking out the door until he ran after me, begging me not to leave. I was surprised that he cared so much but I went back in, walked him to his room and left him there.

He came over one other time before the end of the semester and then bailed on me for the last time we were going to meet up. During our last meet up, I was planning on telling him I have feelings for him so I ended up waiting a few weeks after finals week and I sent him a text instead. It said something along the lines of, ""You don't have to reply to this but since you managed to avoid me the last few weeks and I planned on saying this in person, I just wanted to let you know I have feelings for you.""

I got no reply. He never responded to snapchats since then or even a Merry Christmas text. A friend of a friend had seen him once before he left for England in early March for an internship. She asked if he still talked to me, he told her about the text. She asked what he replied to it. He said nothing. She asked why he didn't at least let me know that he had gotten the text. He said, ""I just don't know"". And refused to speak about it.

He left in early March and will be back mid-June, at which point it is likely I will see him since we have mutual friends. He's also going to law school at the same place I'm finishing my undergrad in August.

He still looks at my Snapchat story consistently (which I'm not sure is really that important) and is still friends with me on other social media.
   
TL;DR
I have feelings for my FWB and I'm worried that when I see him next, he's going to act like I never confessed my feelings and just want to resume our casual relationship and I don't know that I will be able to say no. He's always told me I'm the best sex he's ever had and I feel the same. Not only that, but I'm a sucker for his apologies. The thought that he might feel the same is keeping me hung up on him. I don't know what I should do when I see him again."
4m5v2a,2,2016-06-02,Just a rant about recent circumstances,ledditthrowaway123,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/4m5v2a/just_a_rant_about_recent_circumstances/,"Hi,

Lately I've just been feeling really down about my life. I feel as if I'm not living up to my own expectations, and that I just keep setting myself up for disappointment. Objectively, I am not doing that badly: for example, I have a 3.6 GPA in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Technology program at my college (and the only female in the major), I had an internship with NASA last summer, but for some weird reason I still feel as if I'm not doing enough with my life. I feel that my brain is never satisfied (I have mild Aspergers so maybe that's it?) I want to go out and travel more, but I am currently limited with funds and feel guilty for spending money during the school year.  Right now, I want to go and have a part-time job, but my parents would prefer me to stay at home and watch my brother even though I feel as if I spent way too much money this school year and I'm worried. I have around $7k saved, but around August last year I had $11k. 

I actually had a problem with smoking marijuana that started when I first arrived at college, and I recently quit about two and a half months ago. I initially felt happier, but lately I've felt absolutely awful about my self esteem. I realize how much money I had wasted smoking weed, and I hate myself for it. It made me much more of a nervous, neurotic recluse, and I feel my brain is still recovering. Almost all of the money that I made at NASA was spent on weed, food, or traveling, and I feel like an awful subhuman. Traveling honestly is the only thing making me happy lately. 

I've been losing and gaining weight, almost like a yo-yo, but now back to gaining weight lately because I keep overeating like a fucking pig :( My college experience so far has been negative. I am attending a school out-of-state, 6 hours from home, and I have had trouble keeping quality friendships. The school is a heavy commuter school, so on the weekends many students go home and there's not much to do. Plus, I've found that a lot of students just seem fake or incompatible, or maybe it's just my own insecurities projecting. All they want to do is party, but now I want nothing to do with that. I have a few good friends there, but even then I still feel like they're not around when I feel the worst. I've had many people walk out of my life lately, it's surreal. At one point, I was in tears every week, but I had to keep it hidden from my parents because ""we're not going to pay for you to be miserable"" or ""you can't just throw away the scholarship you got""I know the degree will eventually pay off, but for now it fucking sucks seeing people with 2.0 GPAs get great jobs while I have to sit around and beg for freedom at this house. I have a fucking curfew at 20 years old.

 I honestly don't know what to do at this point; I have so many ideas buzzing in my head for my future, grad school, etc but  as of the past few months I have been lacking all motivation and have found myself in tears many, many days. My parents refuse to hear me out, as everytime I try to bring something up they're like ""We don't want to hear about this again...."" I had a panic attack last semester and went to the ER; I had to hide this from my parents and pay the bill myself because they would have flipped shit if they knew. They trust me to go out-of-state, but as soon as I come home I feel trapped in my house, a slave of my mind. I honestly don't know what else to do...I've been doing well for most of my life, albeit with some anxiety issues here and there, so why does everything seem to be crashing down now? Please let me know if anything needs clarification, I was pretty upset when writing this so I can help you guys out if needed. BTW I have been going to counseling during the school year, it helps out for like a day or two then I go back to feeling worse than before, I say I'm going to fix a bunch of things but never do"
4m6c16,28,2016-06-02,I have a confession to make,peaceofmeandothers,Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/4m6c16/i_have_a_confession_to_make/,"First of all, I need to say something before I tell you everything. There was never any harm in my actions below. I pray that everyone is somehow able to see past how incredibly messed up my apparent actions were. I want to give you a glance at my intentions. I never had any ill will towards anyone. The simplest way to say it is that I was lonely. I made a terrible, terrible mistake, one that I suspect will follow me for the rest of my life, but I need to come clean. The thing that I was trying to fake became more and more real, and this is the right thing to do. I shared this with people in my real life, and as a result, it became real to them as well, and that was a horrible thing to do. I have said it before but I am far, far from perfect. I have and will continue to make mistakes, but this is one that I can put behind me. Either way it is for the best, because at the end of the day, even if the world around me decides that I am unworthy of trust any longer, I will have finally, made the right choice, and that is something to be proud of, not for anyone else, but for me. 

This story below: https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/44o1ag/i_was_an_atheist_seven_months_ago_today_im_a/

It's largely a lie. Well, let's be even more explicit than that. It was a massive exaggeration of an experience I had, I felt at the time the exaggeration was needed for me to follow Jesus. The most improbable experiences in the stories I wrote never happened. 

Here is the real one:

Pt 1:
I was a lonely commuting sophomore, who decided he needed to get involved in some activities on campus. The first activity happened to be a class crawl where I ran into this girl from a campus ministry group. It was kind of improbable that I ran into her, because she separated from her group and almost everyone else there was with a sorority or frat. We hit it off a bit, she invited me to a group meeting later that night, but ultimately I decided not to go. I took a look at their website, and decided to cruise by their table in the sub where they were advertising. I didn't see anyone I knew there, and basically decided to just skip it, but as I was walking out the door I ran into the girl that I talked with on the class crawl. She seemed cool again and invited me to her group meeting on the following Thursday. I went, it was okay, but seemed fake to me. However, I was lonely enough to come back. Over and over again, actually. I did have a really positive interaction with one of their members where I was surprised how genuine he was towards me. I think about going to one of their guys nights and end up being late. I'm insulted by the soccer players. 

Pt2:
So I start going to church with the interns, out of curiosity and once again out of loneliness. That church was definitely not for me, but I continued to go regardless. The pastor did say a number of things that made me wonder about what I was doing there, specifically, about spiritual warfare. I had signed up to go on a retreat with them, but changed my mind as a result of the above. I got into contact with the group leader who told me that I needed to finish paying the amount owed. I was annoyed by this, but decided to do the right thing. I arranged a meeting with one of the interns. I met with him, and, well, I don't even know why I did it. There wasn't a reason behind it, at least not one that I remember. Maybe I was hurt that they would take my money and wanted to get back at them, but I told him the exaggerated story in my first post. The bible study next to us did actually happen, it was pretty random, in the middle of the meeting. Also, the leader did later message me and tell me that I could get my money back, which did result in another brief meeting where I ran into the group leader and president. ALSO, I did actually see a few people who had been pretty impactful on my life. There was this guy who I had actually gotten into a religious argument with when I was a freshman and he was with the leaders of HIS campus ministry group (to the best of my knowledge). He was an engineer, and for some reason I sort-of looked up to him despite what was a dislike of our interaction at the time. It was what I wanted to be, I guess. I saw him there while I was waiting for the intern. Also I did randomly change my mind and decide to go to on the trip with them.

I had a pretty horrible time there. They pushed some of my buttons and made me feel poorly. I had a strong sense that I was being manipulated whilst at the camp, and really this was the point where I committed to trying to be a Christian without fully committing to following Jesus' commandments. I did actually go to the lodge in the middle of of the night and turn over a piece of paper that said ""Can Jesus heal me?"" at the top in orange letters. I also got a religious chain text some time later, but it was definitely not within 5 seconds, more like 15 minutes or so. I actually do not at this point remember if it actually said ""Jesus heals all!"" or not. It was a religious text though, that's the best I can say. 

The comment chain was true. What I mean by that is that I was actually being sincere when I wrote that. I did sincerely try to pray that night, and I did actually feel something. However it was not Jesus but his absence, I guess.

I could go on. The issues with the Church I mentioned were mostly true. To say that I straight up lied about being a Christian in the beginning would be inaccurate, it was more complex than that, but it wasn't completely true for very obvious reasons. I did try to read the bible but not nearly to the degree I described. 

--------------------------------
The real conversion came later and is being completed right now. That story, well, I suspect it's for another time, but let's just say that I am taking a leap of faith that a lot of people are willing to truly forgive me and that there are people who have my best, eternal interests at heart. "
4m6p4n,4,2016-06-02,Issues with Episode 3: Marrakesh,Shukakumura,HiTMAN,https://www.reddit.com/r/HiTMAN/comments/4m6p4n/issues_with_episode_3_marrakesh/,"So, I finally reached Mastery level 20 in Marrakesh and I have some concluding thoughts about it (not going to talk about impressions or walkthroughs, we have a megathread for that):


* Guards still (occasionally) see you through walls, doors and even different floor levels. Noticed that while wearing a General-disguise in the school after having killed Strandberg with a Sniper-Rifle undetected (!). I was neither compromised or anything, and there wasn't even a possible line of sight.
* You should be allowed to get in through the main entrance with a key card and be free to roam in the lower level of the embassy in your fine clothes (Summer Suit and Classical) - there are a lot of people in suits roaming around, why should a guard instantly shoot you if you only wander around like any one of them?
* What is the point of the Intern?! He is incredibly hard to find and his disguise doesn't give you any benefit at all. Every guard sees through it and there is no special interaction except the many computers. Why are there even that many computers to hide with as the intern?! You get his disguise once for the challenge, but never again after that and the whole place is filled with it, like it's the normal disguise to walk around in...
* Aaaaand, of course, the Contracts-mode still needs massive revision. Marrakesh is like the perfect place to create a contract, but you barely have any freedom or options. You cannot lock particular starting points, define an extraction point or even rate or filter other guy's contracts.


Apart from that however, Marrakesh of course was another great mission - looking forward to the next one. I'd like a New York-Highrise or something like that, would be really cool."
4m6p5n,6,2016-06-02,Help Learning Good Engineering Habits,Necrodox,MechanicalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalEngineering/comments/4m6p5n/help_learning_good_engineering_habits/,"I recently landed my first internship as a mechanical engineering student, the company does metal fabrication and cutting with very tight tolerances 

My issue here is that they don't necessarily have an engineer on staff (tons of talented machinists though). As a result I'm on my own and I certainly don't want to get into a routine of bad habits because I ""think"" x, y, and z is the best approach. 

Essentially what I'm asking is, what are some good tips to keep in mind when working as a mechanical engineer (for the first time) and what are some industry standard practices that I should become accustomed to?

My work for now is essentially projects that optimize their metal cutting procedures such as updating machinery to allow for larger cuts, or optimizing a particular process for deburring parts.

I also wanted to ask about CAD software (the big question haha). I'm currently playing around with Fusion 360 because of how easy it is, but because I'm a beginner I'm not exactly sure if this is the software I need to learn for the long term. The other software I've contemplated and am also playing around with is Inventor because of how similar they are.

There is a strong possibility that my designs will be used for CNC'ing so CAM compatibility would likely be ideal but to my understanding Fusion 360 can do this no problem.

Thanks in advance."
4m6t8r,0,2016-06-02,"Father passed away 5 years ago, family struggling. Help?",Throwawaydirection91,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4m6t8r/father_passed_away_5_years_ago_family_struggling/,"Hi /r/personalfinance. I've read many posts lately about parents passing away and how to proceed in the aftermath and I was hoping you might be able to advise me as well..

I'm the oldest child of 3 and 5 years ago, when I was 19 my father passed away somewhat unexpectedly. My mom has had a rough time since his passing as she has no college education and was a stay at home mom most of our lives. She currently nannies for a family and is paid under the table but doesn't make enough money for us to sustain the house and essentials. I was in college when it happened and had no idea what to do other than be there for her as best I could. I left school and moved back home shortly before he passed. I worked as an intern for a year before returning to school and she insisted that my education come first and didn't want me to worry about bringing in money. Then I got sick. I won't go into detail but I was unable to attend school for 3 years and had to take a medical leave of absence which was documented and approved by my doctor and the school.

Now I'm in the process of putting my life back together and I want to do what's best for my family. I am not sure if I should go back to school in the fall or if I should figure out a career path that would lead to bringing in money more quickly. I have been doing freelance work in the creative field, various projects in fashion and film mostly, some painting and modeling as well, but it's not enough and I want something steady that will provide security and stability.

I've never had a traditional job and I'm afraid that my unusual resume, plus 3 year gap in work/school is going to hold me back and keep me from getting a good job. It's my dream to eventually support myself with my creative work but that seems so far off now I just need to figure out how to take care of them and fast.

I applied for disability when I got sick but the process was long and I wasn't initially approved, although they recommended I appeal the decision (not sure why) but I've since abandoned that pursuit since I'm healing now and I don't think they'll do backpay on a disability.

Anyway, my mom hasn't been comfortable sharing any hard numbers with me about what my dad left behind but I know she is debt free (I have 17,000 in school loans) makes less than 30,000 a year, the house was 180,000 when we bought it in 1998, I have no idea what the payments are or how close she is to owning it now. We have expenses like phones, internet, etc, and I've cut as many costs as I can in an effort to help balance everything. We don't have cable, I buy groceries in bulk, no extras, we share a car, etc. But I think we should consider downsizing our living space, selling the house and moving into something more manageable. It's been difficult getting that process going because she is a hoarder and won't let people in the house to fix the things that are broken so I have to do it in secret at times. I'm getting close now. Hopefully the house will be ready to sell soon. Any advice with how to proceed in selling an old large property?

What should I do with my inheritance? It's about 32,000 and it's being wired from Europe this year. I had asked that my uncle keep it in his account over there because I know it will be taxed if I let him wire it to me but he has decided he doesn't want to be responsible for it anymore. My brothers each have the same amount coming to them. One is 22 and the other is 18. The 22 year old is unemployed and totally uncooperative/unnsupportive of the family. He lives with us rent free and doesn't contribute monetarily or to the upkeep of the home and never went to school or showed any interest in doing so. The youngest is in trade school but has recently lost interest in graduating and none of us can figure out why. I feel my family is falling apart and I don't know what to do to help them, all I know is this cannot continue. I need some stability in my life, I can't just rely on freelance anymore. I love the work I do but I need a day job, preferably one that will look good on my resume so I can achieve my dream someday but more importantly make enough money that I can start saving and building a future for myself and my mom. I'm sorry this has been so long and disorganized. I'm sort of panicking in the moment.. for all this time I've been telling myself, it will get better, you will figure this out, but I feel like I'm failing them and myself. I feel lost.

I don't know much about what to look for as far as pay and benefits as I've never had a job like that, it's always been commission work except for the internship. That was only 10/hr but I need to be making more than that. With no traditional job experience what can I expect? What should I do? Should I invest my inheritance? What kind of job can I seek that is relevant to my creative endeavors, makes enough money to support me and help my family, but also doesn't require a college diploma? I haven't finished school yet and I'm not sure I even should at this point since I'm in debt and my field doesn't even require a diploma, just a portfolio. And I have a strong one. I was pursuing graphic design as my major but my disability is visual and made worse by staring at a screen all day so obviously I picked the wrong major and I feel like I wasted my time and money with school. If I go back I'm considering switching to business and marketing. But I don't even know. More relevant to my personal goals would be something to do with film, or styling &amp; makeup, set design, or coordinating. I know it seems silly but I eventually want to be a director even if it's just small scale. And I do have a mentor who's doing what I dream of doing but he hustled to get to where he is and I don't think I can do that anymore. I don't have the freedom to hustle, I want to take care of my family. I just have no idea what to do. Please help me find direction..

My dad was a creative director and when he was alive he inspired me to pursue graphic design. I wanted to follow his footsteps and make him proud but I feel like I'm failing him. I promised him I would take care of everybody and instead I got sick and now I have no idea what to do. My grandmother told me that before he passed he told her I was doing the right thing by seeking an education in design and that I would take the family legacy to the next level by breaking into design and technology. But I'm not even good with most programs, I'm an amateur, I'm good at design on an artistic level, color theory, composition, even typography yes I'm great at it. I can draw with incredible precision and accuracy but translating those things to the computer is not easy for me and this field is SO competitive. That's why I started branching out and giving some energy to my personal dream of working in film. I thought, hey maybe I should do what I wanted to do instead of this legacy thing. But I just don't know anymore. At this point I'm considering getting back into nannying like my mom. Or maybe I should try to work as a makeup artist at some shop, I actually have a portfolio to show and I wouldn't have to stare at a screen. I've also had some interest in culinary and I'm very skilled with cooking and meal planning (had to be!) so I've thought about being a personal chef. Honestly everything I come up with just sounds stupid in my mind because I'm in such a panic mode right now. I don't even know what to say about my skills, they're so all over the place.

I really want to turn my life around.",TheRedPillStudent,asktrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/4m7ex3/failed_in_relationship_of_12_years_now_31_year/,"I have been reading topics on here for quite a week and was really shocked to see, i must confess that i was under the illusion of some kind of rulebook loser life. Redpill really removed it from my eyes.

Here's my story : I was around 18 and fell in love with my neighbor, she was really top in her school and i was just below average in studies. We both eventually started liking each other. Time passed, i moved to another city for college and broke up her. I really loved her, then after a year or so, she called me, we started talking to each other again. I fell into Love again, we talked about meeting and eventually lost our virginity to each other. After this i took break from college and two years of day night fucking continued. When i was 22, she got pregnant by me twice, which resulted in her abortion. I was really sad about this, but was not in position for a kid. I went back to college to complete it somehow and eventually also got the job offer. Came back and saw change in her behavior , apparently her father was alchoholic and never treated her or her mother with respect, so her childhood was kind of disturbed. 
I felt kind of distance in air and vibe, discovered that she is in relationship with another guy from her work. I kept crying , hurted myself, took year long to really move on after long time consumption of alchohol and depression. Then came my job time, i joined and came for holidays at my place, met her again, gave into pussy power, had sex , returned to my job place. It was year 2010 January, we both were in touch and i got message from her that she was pregnant again! Phew! Since i was on job , i called her to job place and we both decided to keep the kid so as not to risk her health further. Things were going great, i and my friend really took great care of her. And i kind of noticed that during her pregnancy period she was kind of sad, kind of guilty and she used to say that we will give the child for adoption and i really wanted to keep the child, because i had the fatherly feeling. Fast forward 7 months, we were blessed with a cute boy. I still remember myself crying outside, listening to her screams of pains, my friend standing beside me and congratulating me and i was just crying. Fast forward 3 months, i somehow got to know because of blood group, her guilty behavior  that child was not mine. I entered into manic depression and still lived and supported her and her child, but the child was constant reminder of past, i was getting depressed day by day, no happiness at all. Seeing this, she decided to be with me and gave the child for adoption to parents who were childless, after that she came into depression, which was obvious. I was 25 and she was 23. After that we decided to have some space and live seperately with our friends. I shifted with my best friend. I was able to overcome my depression, but all this affected my career, i was not able to learn anything but somehow managed to get things done. Fast forward 3 years, at age of 28 i got married to her, things went smoothly for 1.5 years . She was really too busy in her job and i was not growing, so i decided to pursue masters from germany, it was our decision. I came here and in between there was some issue between her and my mother. She eventually started raising her demands like, she did not get respect after marrying me and all! Long story short, i came back from my masters and saw that within two months she was in relationship with a guy. This broke me , big time. We had a discussion, we both agreed to go on, and i forgave her again! Came back to germany, recently got to know that she wants a divorce and she is still in relationship with that guy, cheated me again! I am in serious depression now, failing in my exams, currently only thing i have is an internship at great sports company. But all this years of depression has left me in self isolated position. I used to look very handsome, but now i don't have confidence at all, i am balding. There was period in between when i used to lift and i got better. But now, i just want to be in my home alone, i dont have friends, i have 0 social skills, I suck at life and if this continues, ill prove to be a big disappointment to my parents and myself. 
I have enrolled in crossfit, yoga, but go there once a month.
I really want to turn my life around, get out of debt, give her the divorce, pay her the marriage money which she has demanded to be around $30,000.
But how? How to i end this depression? How do I make friends?
How do i shed this super pathetic version of beta?
The only thing i enjoy here is trance music festivals, because of drugs and music!
Please help friends!


Edit : Also what i have lately realised is that i suffer from attention deficit disorder! I hardly can focus on anything
         and attention is most important key to do anything you love."

4m7r92,4,2016-06-02,Need summer ideas for reclusive 15-year-old,jkh107,Parenting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/4m7r92/need_summer_ideas_for_reclusive_15yearold/,"After setting up several camps &amp; things for my 12-year-old, I went to find some activities for my 15-year-old son and discovered there really is not much for this age group in terms of structured summer activities.

My son is not exactly autistic, but he has some of the ""features"" (according to his child psych) and isn't very social.  He prefers to socialize online.  He would rather spend his time ""coding"" than go outside and do something in the fresh air.  This is probably the last ""fun"" summer for him before he gets some internship (they have a lot of opportunities  advertised at his special-snowflake magnet school--he is brilliant in math and science, and it is required as part of his program to do at least one).

All I really see is an (affordable and local) all-ages tennis day camp which takes ages 4-17.  The rest is academic stuff, which he gets plenty of during the school year and is going to do anyway.  He is interested in taking Japanese, and he did take a course last summer at a local cultural center, but he is interested in a full academic course (as opposed to conversational) and I can't find one locally this summer (have looked) that he qualifies to join.

I can encourage him to go to the pool each day.  I've already encouraged him to exchange contact info with his school friends so they can hang out in person (as opposed to on email/google docs/skype) during the summer.  He suffers from a lot of allergies so sending him out mowing lawns (aka what we did at his age) isn't as much of an option.  

Does anyone have any other ideas of what a nerdy, low-social-skills/less independent than average 15-year-old should/could be doing with his summer free time?  I don't mind paying for a camp or program, but I don't have thousands lying around for one of those on-college-campus experiences (or Concordia Language Villages type thing) that he would no doubt love."

After going to Bonnaroo for the first time last year I was sold that this was the place for me to be. Unfortunately, after graduating this past December I was unable to find a full-time position and ended up having to take an unpaid internship in hopes of it potentially turning into a full-time gig. After months on the job and seeing many-a-intern come and go without receiving an offer, I was pretty bummed that I would not only not be receiving an offer from the firm, but would be unable to attend Bonnaroo this year. 

This morning, however, I was called into the office to speak with the head of HR. Preparing to hear the news that they would be unable to extend me an offer, I was pretty down on myself. I get in, expecting to hear the worst, when I was met with a huge smile and an offer letter on the table for full time employment!

But wait – it gets better. They not only want to hire me, they want to give me a signing bonus!! But wait – it gets even better! They not only want to hire me and give me a signing bonus, but they also want me to take the next 2 weeks off for “rest and relaxation”!! 

After wetting myself with excitement, y’all can only guess what my next move was. I'M GOING TO BONNAROO MUTHAFUCKAS!!!

I am convinced there is a God and he is a huge fan of Roo. This only goes to show that hard work and positive thinking really can make a difference. Somehow find me and a beer is on me people! See you on The Farm in 6 DAYS fam!!!

4m8wqs,3,2016-06-02,[Event] Explosions rock Moldovan capital,HanbaobaoZaiNar,Geosim,https://www.reddit.com/r/Geosim/comments/4m8wqs/event_explosions_rock_moldovan_capital/,"Minister of Foreign Affairs Natalia Eminescu heard the series of explosions from her office downtown. She walked toward the window, seeing plumes of smoke begin to rise above the city from toward the central square. She murmured under her breath,

&gt;""Dumnezeule""

An ambulance screamed past the building on the street below. As more sirens began to wail their way toward the sound, armed service members appeared at her doorway.

&gt;""We need to go now, mam.""

&gt;""Yes, of course""

Stopping only to gather her phone and few papers from her desk, stuffing them into a briefcase, she followed them down the back stairwell and into a waiting unmarked car. Taking a place in the back seat, one of the men joined the driver up front while the other slid in beside her. As the driver began weaving his way out of town toward a more secure location, she turned to the man beside her.

&gt;""Tell me the situation.""

&gt;""All we know so far is a series of explosion have taken place near the capitol and associated government buildings. We don't know for sure but we assume this to be some form of deliberate attack. Communication lines are currently overwhelmed and we're having a hard time getting through to any of the other ministers, though we assume all teams will be converging on the safe zone as we are.""

&gt;""No word from anyone else?""

&gt;""No mam, none yet. We'll let you know as soon as any communications come through.""

She sat in silent disbelief as they continued to drive through the streets. Moving out of the city and into the suburbs, she heard continued radio chatter, muted but constant through the earpiece of the two service men in the car. How could this have happened? Why hadn't communications come through from any of the other ministers, or even the Prime Minister himself?

&gt;""We made contact with the safe zone, mam. They're confirming contact from us, Red, Gold, Blue, and Green Teams as well as the new kid.""

Good, she thought, Anatolie was alright. He had been doing well since his recent promotion to Minister of Cyber, Digital, and Information Affairs. Maybe he would know more of the situation once they all arrived. She ran through the others in her head. Constantin, Maria, Mihai, and Sergey were all safe. She thought again about the other 13, including the Prime Minister.

Reaching the compound, the pulled through the gate and she was ushered into the conference room. The other five were already present, clustered around a laptop on the table at the far end of the room. As she walked in, they all looked up at her. Her heart sank when she saw the tears in Anatolie's eyes.

&gt;""Nat, he's gone. The Prime Minister is dead.""

*time skip to later that evening*

Prime Minister Natalia Eminescu stood behind the podium they had erected in the offsite compound. The television crew fluttered around behind the camera, preparing everything for her address of the nation. Her eyes were still red and raw from the tears, though the crew had taken a few minutes to retouch her makeup where it had run earlier. The five remaining cabinet members were seated around the conference table out of camera view. A few kilometers to the west, the only other surviving cabinet minister, Dan, lay recovering in the hospital. Most in the room quietly conferred with what remained of their staff. Anatolie was furiously typing, somehow both on his laptop and phone, simultaneously gathering all he could from online while sending word to those across the globe. As if sensing she was looking at him, he broke gaze from his screen and mouthed the words ""Good luck!"" to her before returning to work. As the crew behind the camera began a countdown of 3,2,1, she gripped the podium with whitened knuckles, took a deep breath, and addressed the nation and the world.

&gt;""Good evening. 

&gt;Today, our fellow citizens, our way of life, our very freedom came under attack in a deliberate and deadly terrorist act. The victims were in their offices, in their homes, on their way to work: government officials, business men and women, military workers, school children, moms and dads, friends and neighbors. Over a hundred lives were suddenly ended by an evil, despicable act of terror. The loss of these lives, including Prime Minister Nastase and many other officials have filled us with disbelief, terrible grief, and a quiet, unyielding fury.

&gt;A great people has been moved to defend our great nation. Terrorist attacks can shake the foundations of our buildings, but they cannot touch the foundation of our nation. These acts can melt steel beams, but they cannot dent the steel of our resolve. We were targeted for attack because we strive for freedom, peace, and unity in these trying times. And no one, no act, no foreign power will keep that light from shining. Today, our nation saw evil, the very worst of human nature, and we responded with the best of our hearts. With the daring of our rescue workers, with the caring for strangers and neighbors, and with those helping at home and abroad in any way they could.

&gt;Immediately following attack and its effects, I was sworn into office as Prime Minister. I then implemented our government's emergency response plans. Our military is powerful, and it's prepared. Our emergency teams are working in the city to help with local rescue efforts. Our first priority is to get help to those who have been injured, and to take every precaution to protect our citizens at home from further attacks. Our military remains on full alert across the nation and along our borders. The functions of our government continue without interruption. Our commitment remains unbroken.

&gt;The search is underway for those who were behind these evil acts. I have directed the full available resources of our intelligence and law enforcement communities to find those responsible and to bring them to justice, while we continue to defend our borders from foreign agents and armed insurgents. We will make no distinction between the terrorists who committed these acts and those who harbor them. Those responsible can expect the righteous fury that all those across the nation feel tonight. You have taken the lives of our friends, mentors, parents, and children. You haven taken the life of a man who dedicated himself to peace. You have taken your chance for mercy. It died in the square this morning, as much a victim of your attacks as the other innocents.""

Her steel grey eyes lingered on the camera, staring out to the world with all the anger, grief, and passion felt by the nation that night

&gt;""I appreciate so very much the members of Parliament who have joined me in strongly condemning these attacks. And on behalf of the Moldovan people, I thank all those around the world who have already expressed their condolences. We continue to stand with all those who seek peace, security, and prosperity in the world.

&gt;Tonight, I ask for your prayers for all those who grieve. This is a day when all Moldovans from every walk of life unite in our resolve for justice. We have stood before, with enemies at the gates, and we will continue do so this time. As the fires of war burn around us, and the clock ticks closer to the end than ever before, we stand together tonight. None of us will ever forget this day, yet we go forward to defend Moldova, to defend our freedom, and to defend and all that is good and just in our world.

&gt;Thank you. Good night. And God bless Moldova.""

tl;dr Terrorist attack in Moldovan capital. Prime Minister, majority of cabinet, and many civilians killed. Total death toll unknown but current estimates are between 100 and 150. New Prime Minister addresses nation on tragedy. Vows to find and punish attackers, no matter the cost. Anatolie the intern gains a promotion."

I'm a CS student that scored a summer internship with Cisco, in their office in Feltham. They're supplying some particularly nice accommodation, free of charge, near Brentford. 

I've got some relatives in Twickenham and have visited London a good few times, but never longer than a few days. In fact, this will be my first time living in a city at all, having grown up/gone to uni in mostly rural Welsh towns. I'm used to places you can cross on foot in 20 mins, max, where a fight outside a pub is local news for weeks.

I've worked out my commuting path and checked around the area in Google Maps, but still not 100% sure what to expect. Any tips, warnings or hellos would be helpful. 
When I was in London for my interview, there was a girl placing tissues on tube seats. A local guy who was in the interview as well explained, it's this sort of stuff I suspect will perplex me.

Thanks!"

 My wife was secretly involved with a degenerate for five years.  It was an abusive on-and-off affair.  He called her filthy names and laughed at her when she asked what their situation meant to him.  She was the backup to his real affair partner.

She grew up in an emotionally, physically and possibly sexually abusive home.  She doesn’t remember the sexual part, but the indications are that it happened early in her life at the hands of her father.   Her father is a dangerous narcissist and she’s got a handful of diagnoses including bipolar 2, borderline, and a dissociative disorder (not the Sybil one, though).  She’s a very sick girl and found a very sick outlet for her needs.

Four times in five years, they arranged to meet at her parents’ house when the parents where travelling.    She was to stay dressed, no kissing, no nudity that wasn’t absolutely necessary for the defilement.  She cried driving over there and cried all the way back.  She dreaded him asking for it again, but complied every time he did.  She at least got the humiliation she was after.

She says she hated him from the first.  She dreamed of making him fall in love with her and then breaking him.  He is a lowlife by every manner of estimation.  Dirtbag cop passed over for promotion for 20 years, still trying to get through junior college in his late 30’s, friendless, weepy, argumentative, just a pure lump of crap.  She says she was interested in having power over him because he was as low relative to her as she felt relative to me. 

She took him to her father’s bed and he raped her.  I guess it’s like “rape porn” must be (not familiar, not my thing) where its arranged and expected, but violent and cold in the moment.  She says she focused on her father’s headboard and wonders if it’s the same one from when she was little.  Again, she has no memory of sexual abuse.

 I’ve done some reading on “re-enactment of trauma” that says this sort of thing happens.  But, in agreement with the predictions of the literature, she lost her little game.  She was powerless, exploited and humiliated.  She didn’t re-enact her abuse and win.  She just re-enacted it.  Or “completed it” as she says when she’d doubting if her father abused her.

Two times five years ago.  One time four years ago.  Again this January.  I found out in March.

That was the sex.  And every time they were physically present, apparently.  She met him on an internship, but didn’t have inappropriate contact for several months after she left.  They never met in person but for the sex. 
 
But there were texts.  Thousands of them.  Him insulting her mostly.  “C_nt” was his noun of address.  “Do they know what a fucking sack of trash you are at your work?”  That sort of thing.  Beyond that, it was him complaining about his life, his wife, his work.  Him telling her what garbage she was and how unfair the world was being to him.  She says the texts were periodic.  He’d remember the little pet he liked to kick around and text intensively for a few days.  Then stop for a month or two or three.  If she texted him first she was ignored or threatened.

I caught her because of the texts.  I bumped into an unknown number hundreds of times in the phone bill.  I asked about it and she gave me a half-truth, but only for an hour or two.  I believe I have the whole story.

Her reaction was horror and relief.  She is deeply ashamed, but she feels freed.  She talks openly about having lived a part of her life as a “clown whore” and has never once sought to minimize, excuse, or obfuscate what she did.  She put everything on the table.  A couple of her friends were on the trashy side, and they’re out.  We don’t spend a night apart any more.  If I travel for business, she takes a vacation day and buys herself a plane ticket.  She reports everywhere she goes and every one she speaks to.  She was sick, she is sick, and she’s as contrite and remorseful and positive as she could be.  She’s desperate to rebuild and I’ve seen her more open and more available than ever before.

That’s her.

But me, I’m a different story.  I’m all over the place.  I hate this.  I have decided to try to make a go of this marriage, but I’m struggling.

Our marriage sucked before she started her ridiculous affair, and it was difficult during it.  I sure as hell don’t want that back.  She’s working hard (not as hard as I first hoped) to get through her stuff, but how do I get past this?  I don’t for a second think her affair was about me, but my choice to let the “clown whore” back in my home is entirely about me.  I get that piece of garbage’s left-overs?  I can disregard that when other things are going well, but my tolerance for any more trouble is zero. 
 
I’ve made a deal with my anger.  When she gives me someone new, and free, and focused and full of life, I have none of it.  When I see that same broken, pathetic, manipulative woman I was married to for 18 years, I have it.  She welcomes it.  I wasn’t good about it for the first few weeks, but we can now have civil, helpful conversations in almost any state.  She’s not afraid of my anger or my disgust.  But I’m not comfortable with it.  I can’t both participate in reconciliation and vent my anger and disgust.
We have four kids.  I have often felt like I have five, including her.

She’s doing better.  But for me, as our life moves on, the things that feel like normal, even “new normal” piss me off.  What goes through my mind is “If this is the new normal, I’m out.” 

But the new normal is pretty good.  If I’d had that without her defiling herself, I’d be pretty content.  And she’s growing all the time.  It can get better.  But my attitude is all over the place.   I may well kill this while pretending to forgive her.  If that happens, it happens.  But I’m trying to be honest with myself.

4m9ksx,39,2016-06-02,My original justnomil,crosscountryloves,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/4m9ksx/my_original_justnomil/,"As an infant, I was adopted. As a teenager, I searched for and met my biological parents. For my biological father, this meant exchanging e-mails for 5+ years before flying to a different country several time zones away to meet in person. 

Biodad had a wife (step-mom?) and three beautiful children. Biodad and Stepmom had been high school sweet hearts that took a break... and then I happened. Unfortunately for bio dad , he never thought that I would resurface, so he forgot/neglected to tell Step mom about me... until he was contacted about me when I was 16. 

Apparently the conversation and fighting that ensued wasn't as fun as it sounds.

I, however, knew none of this. bio dad  and I had a pretty good relationship which was developed primarily over e-mail, and then eventually over text messaging (think a wi-fi service like WhatsAPP) when I was older/in college/he was more sure of the relationship. I never really gave much thought to his family, as he would give updates on them and send photos. To me, this meant that he included *my* life with them, as much as their lives with me. 

bio dad and I, you could say, were pretty close. It does not help that we look pretty similar. Our facial features and even mannerisms could be used to say that everything is genetic, not environmental. It doesn't really matter. The fact is, step mom didn't know how close we were, or how similar we were. And that threw her off.

The night I arrived with my best friend, Step mom took us upstairs for ""girl time"". She proceeded to tell me about another child that  bio dad had fathered, but hadn't gave up for adoption. ""He loved that woman too much. He told me that your mother was just a mistake."" I didn't care much what she said about my biological mother, but I did care that he had never told me about another sibling, especially only a year and some change younger than me. bio dad and step mom fought that night, about whose right it was to tell me about the mystery sister. friend told bio dad  *exactly* what step mom had said about my biological mother, and the fighting continued. It continued for the whole week I was there. 

Any swipe she could get at my biological mother, at my upbringing (which was far better than I would have been provided with, had I not been adopted), at me in general - the words were there. Friend and I spent a lot of time outside of the house and away from Step Mom after the first couple of days. Bio dad and I struggled with our reunion because of all the hurtful things. 

And then, when I landed in my hometown, my phone let me know I had an e-mail from Step mom. It let me know that I was no longer allowed to contact Bio Dad. That because she had been excluded from our relationship for five years (unbeknownst to me), that all contact from him, or I, would go through her. That summer was the longest summer of my life. Friend moved across the US to start an internship, and she was the only person in my life who understood the devastation that I felt with these rules. Bio dad and step Mom reached out to her, numerous times. They let her know how proud they were of her internship, of the city she was living in, of whatever it was that she was doing. I received one e-mail from them, late in July. The next e-mail came around Thanksgiving.

Step mom stayed in control for quite a while longer. Bio dad ""got permission"" to come to my graduation from University. He saw his step-family for the first time in 15 years. His phone blew up via Step Mom the whole time, demanding to know where he was, and what I was doing. 

In August 2015, I took my husband to see them. He wanted to meet the famed  bio dad, and his family. Step mom didn't speak to me, or look at me. And when Bio Dad became too chatty and asked too many questions about what I was doing for work now, she asked for the check. Dinner with eight of us lasted little more than an hour.

Recently, I met up with Bio dad's brother for dinner. I had let Bio dad know I was going to, and that his family was invited... but we'd be in a bar, so it wasn't child friendly. Bio Dad said he'd talk to Step Mom about it. He showed up 45 minutes late and apologized; work has been busy, as of late. I get that. Over the course of an hour, I watched his phone ring with calls from Step Mom a dozen times. He forwarded each and every one of them, but there she is -- controlling as always. 

After everything that happened the first time I met Bio Dad face-to-face, I went to therapy. Step Mom was the evil step-monster from Disney. Looking back at all the ways she jerked me around, she was also the first real abusive mother figure in my life. 

This was just a brief history of Step Mom. Maybe someday I'll go through my mind of all the crazy things we did to each other (because I *know* that I was not an angel, especially when I was hurting) and write up those stories. Today - this just felt good to acknowledge that someone came before my husbands mother. And she taught me that NC is just fine by me."

I ask this because I'm currently learning about neural networks for an internship and have to choose what I want to implement my projects with.

I'm probably writing this in one of the lowest points of the past few months. 

I don't usually write, I really like reading the stories here though, so I thought ""hey, just give it a shot"". Probably nobody will care. I don't mind, I just wanna vent and see if someone reads me.

A little context; I'm currently a 3º year student on a 4 year career. I'm 21, will be 22 in a few months. And I've been fat all my life.

I'm now in Europe, but was born and raised in South America. Mostly Italian and Spanish family, so you'll guess that food is pretty fucking important in my household.

I don't remember a day I wasn't self-conscious about my weight. Everything to me is about my weight. It's fucked up. I feel I haven't had a single day that I didn't think ""See, if you weren't fat you would've been able to do THAT thing"".

I would have to write my whole damn life here for you to understand how I got to this point. But here is some trivia points about me. Get ready, this is some heavy shit coming your way.

• I've lost over 300 kg in the past 21 years. The thing is, I've never been thin. I got real close once when I was 13, I was about 1,70cm and weighted 83, and still was pretty fat, but not obese. From there on it's been a fucking yo-yo of hell.

• I'm sick. I got fatty liver, and apparently in a state that's similar to what heavy drinkers that still don't have cirrhosis have. I got diagnosed at 18. Because of a series of circumstances I ballooned up to 145 by the time I was 19 from about 105 from when I was 18. I know I'm not ""supposed"" to be fat, you can still see my collarbones at every weight and most of my family is thin, but man, I was then fat for at least 4 generations. I always had stretch marks, but during that year, I got some really deep ones on my arms. Imagine how fucking fat, and how fast you have to gain weight, to get stretch marks on your arms. It's disgusting. Add that up to the stretch marks on my back, shoulders, belly, chest and ass and you have a mess of disproportionate shit walking around.

• I'm an introvert. By decision, I assume. I convinced myself that I don't like dancing, or dating, or meeting new people. Who would wanna go out with me? The thing is, a lot of people. But I got a gift to self-sabotage every fucking relationship I have.

• I've got the calves of a fucking minotaur. It's ridiculous. Everything about my body is puny except for my legs. My thighs are massive and my calves are monstrous. I guess after years of cardio that's what happens. (Stats of the last year and a half http://imgur.com/Ltkfwjv). I've done over 4.000 km and burned over 400.000 calories in about 18 months. Extrapolate that to 10 years and get a lifetime of being too embarrassed to show your abnormally large, pale legs in public.

• I really like working out. It's weird, but I feel so liberated when I do it. I sing, dance and scream when I do cardio (I got a machine at home currently). I feel really small at gyms, and I actually feel better when I work out.

• I've had sex once. When I was 18. Haven't had again. Ready for the zinger? She was a slut. I paid for money because I thought nobody would ever fuck me the way I am. Ready for the bigger zinger? I've never kissed anyone. I fucked before I got a first kiss. And things are not looking promising.

• I'm an amazing student with great work ethic. I'm currently doing an internship in one of the biggest ad agencies in the world, they've offered me 3 different positions (which I had to reject because I'm still a junior), and the Creative Director literally told me ""We are just waiting for you to finish, we really want you to work here"". I've got another internship editing a book that pays a lot for few hours a month. I'm the top student in my class, I've won awards, been published as an illustrator and it's hard to find someone that I've worked with that has something bad to say about me. 
Why do I humble brag about this? Because it's all I have. Literally. I think there is nothing else good about me more than my work ethic and how responsible I am or how seriously I take jobs. I've convinced myself that ""anon, she is not talking to you because she likes you, she is talking to you because you are a fucking workaholic and she knows you'll do the job"" every time a girl talks to me.

• I'm going bald. Yep. At twenty-fucking-one. I never had a strong hairline, but boy, did mother nature decide to fuck me over. It's ridiculous. I look at baby pictures and look like a fucking cherub from the Renaissance and now I have everything to be a potential Danny DeVito impersonator. I've spent over 1k € in hair treatments (shitty ones, like Pilexil and Rogaine) which I know won't give me my hair back, but at least will kinda slow down the madness.

• I've dressed the same way for the past 3 years. Why? Because I've convinced myself I want to be as transparent as possible. Same combination. Every. Single. Day. For 3 years. Of course, being a fat guy that has to present constantly to clients and talk to a lot of people, I always have to smell good and not look like a hobo, so I found a uniform.
I feel odd every time I'm outside my uniform.

• In January of 2015 I decided I had to stop. I was 20, and weighed 145 kg (147 kg on the highest point during a certain day). I've done crash diets before, but I decided I was gonna turn everything around on this one. And I did. For 6 months I had a military regime for my body. Workout, count calories, don't over eat. EVER. I lost 30 kg. So in June I got stuck, and thought ""OK, kid, you can do it, you are about to complete your fucking dream, don't fuck it up"". During September I lost 15 kg. I was at 100. I felt amazing. Just a week for the doctor's appointment. Lost 2 more in a week. I'm at ninety-fucking-eight. It's been years since I was at a two digit number. Pants fit, shirts fit, girls look at me. I feel so good.

Doctor comes. I had been seeing her once a month for the past 9 months, and she said she had never seen someone lose so much weight so fast without any health issues.

""Fuck yeah, I'm amazing"". 
""Anon, you have to stop and maintain your weight for two years"".

Two years.

I'll be out of school and working by then. I've never gotten drunk or high in my life. I live in one of the most 'party' cities of Europe and never been partying. I don't even have a circle of friends. My senior year was gonna be the one. And she says ""two years""?. TWO FUCKING YEARS?. Then I realised. I fucked up. My skin is loose. I'm losing hair. My body is mismatched. I was too fat before, and now I'm trapped. I'll never live the student life.

I never ate so much in one night. I ate until I puked. And then ate some more. 9 months of military dictatorship with my body. All thrown away. I was gonna do it. My senior year was gonna be the one. Not this one, but the next, I'm sure of it.


• In January 2016 im at 107. Not too bad, I gained 9 kg, it's not the end of the world. Then I start noticing something. I'm never going to be fit by the time I graduate. It's impossible, not fit by my standards. I'll have loose skin, be balding and be a semi-virgin senior. I decide to go ""fuck it"" and bury myself in work. School, one job, two jobs, multiple projects. It's ok. I'm still working out everyday, but I eat a little more. I move a little less during cardio. It's ok. I gain it back. It's ok. I'm at 120 again. It's not ok.

• Then, last month, I get a call from the director of my school. 

""Hey, anon"". 

I'm at work. 

""Hey, can I call you back? I'm at work right now"". 
""Sure"".

""Listen, anon, there is this project"". 
""Yeah"". 
""It's the (let's call it Audion, a really large music festival that the city holds)"". 
""Oh, wow, Audion, that's pretty big."" 
""Yeah, well, we got a project that we wanna sell there and I want you to work on it."" 
""Really?.""
""Yeah, but only if you have time, I know you are busy.""
""Not too busy for this, I'll make time. Who else?.""
""Anondum from 3º year and Anonnete from 2º.""
""Anonnete from 2º?""
""Yeah, I know you'd like to work with her.""
""Sure, she is great, I was with her in 'x' class.""
""Ok, meet me when you can.""

Let's call Anonnete ""Y"" for short. Y is in a class that's one year younger than me. My class was in a mixed course with her class, and it was clear she was the 'me' of their group. Only stunning and filled with confidence.

I saw her present her first project with her group. Fucking amazing. The way she talks, she moves, it's insane. I don't know what she did, but she got me hooked. She can't be my age (21), she has to be older even thought she is in a younger course. She is too good.

The class passes, every time she presented I was more fascinated. Then I hear she wanted to work with me after the class was over. ""Hm. Must be that work ethic, man. She'll never be interested in a fat fuck like me.""

Then we meet for the first time for Audion. She is super nice and very flirty. I think ""if I was that hot I'd never stop fucking, are you joking?"". She says ""anon, we gotta stay in contact a lot, your part is super close to mine. I'm sure we'll talk a lot *touches my arm*"".

Wah.

She touched me? And she didn't want something? Something's EXTREMELY fucky here.

We go meet with the project manager. He has really low expectations. We get out of the meeting. We spend 15 minutes talking about how bad the meeting was. We have a good time and then decide to meet sometime else for the project.

We meet in a restaurant in front of school. We talk about the project for a little bit. I had class in 3 hours, so I should only talk to her for about 15-20 minutes.

Nope. The whole 3 hours. Talking to her. She talking to me. She literally says ""I love talking to you."" ""Me too.""

What. 

She texts me ""Anon, I loved talking to you… but now we gotta work."" I'm on fire. I'm gonna work like a psycho to impress her.

The other guy on the group is pretty nice, too.

We meet at my place. We work for like an hour and spend like 5 talking. It's insane. She left at 3am. I don't even want to fuck her, I just wanna talk to her.

We meet again. ""We gotta work this time"". We don't. Talking again. For hours.

I think ""this is insane."" Then something clicks.

Start again. Start losing weight again. You can do it.

(present) This past two weeks I've lost 7 kg, so I'm at 113kg right now.

We worked today together. She pulled something amazing off. With no budget, she produced a fucking video. I was the assistant. I don't care, I just wanna see her work. She knows so many people. So many people know her. She is incredible. One of those people you see and think ""this one is gonna be huge.""

And then it hits me. Again. Like a fucking bullet to the brain. You are now 113 kg. Your hairline has stayed pretty much the same. But you are so fat. You know your weight is at 70 kg at least. You have so much loose skin. So many stretch marks.

Something funny, my liver wants to kill me so bad I sometimes bleed from my belly button. I don't know what the fuck is wrong with me, but it happened with Y the other day. ""Um, Y, don't freak out, but I'm bleeding out of my belly button and I gotta change"". ""Ok"". ""What"". ""I don't wanna know."" ""Ok"".

The best thing she could've said. I was fucking bleeding from my belly button and she said ""ok, change.""

I'm never going to get her. Or someone like her. 

I looked at myself in the mirror today, as I do everyday.

I'm disgusting. Even after all this effort, all this pain, everything, I'm disgusting.

Why keep going? Why not let my liver just kill me and balloon up to a 170 kg and die at 22, fat but happy?

I know I won't fuck again. I had to pay someone to do it when I was 18. I've never had a girlfriend. It's not because I'm shy, it's just me.

Why keep going? When I graduate I'm gonna have so much loose skin that I'll look worse.

Tell me, loseit.

Read me and tell me if this shit is even worth it.

I know this sounds suicidal, but I'm not. I like life too much to lose it (no pun intended). Because I got to meet Y. And I lost weight after meeting her. And I know there many others like Y out there, amazing people that I wanna meet.

What would happen after I meet the best version of me? Does it exist? Did I fuck up my body beyond repair at 21?


Is this shit even worth it…"

I have just graduated with my masters in accounting to get my 150 credits necessary for the CPA certification and I am currently studying for the AUD portion of the exam. 

I was unable to get an internship at a public accounting firm during my undergraduate degree but I have experience doing tax work( mutual funds, 1120-RIC and personal 1040s) My goal is to work in auditing or consulting of some sort but I have had absolutely shit tier luck in getting hired at any of the places that I have interviewed with.

I have had interviews for many different positions ranging from IT consulting to tax at various companies that from my perspective all went well but not well enough to be extended an offer. 

My GPA in undergrad was 3.21 and Masters was 3.2 so not great but not terrible by any means. 

My current plan is to try my best to get as much of the CPA exam done this summer as I can and then go into my University's major accounting career fair in the fall looking for full time work. 

I am really burnt out by the whole job search process and due to the constant rejection and the stupid online applications that come along with any job these days. 

So the point of this wall of text is to see if there is anything that I could do to change my success rate for getting hired and if my plan of putting the job apps on hold until september to focus on the CPA exam is actually a good idea or not. 

thanks,

4ma03u,12,2016-06-02,I Have Horrible Driving Anxiety and I just drove for the first time in a year,ifuckinghatedriving,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/4ma03u/i_have_horrible_driving_anxiety_and_i_just_drove/,"This is my first time posting here, and I just recently found this sub. I had this account just to post this to be able to vent and see how many people out there are like me (I saw old posts about this, but I'm stressed and wanted to make my own).

I'm 21 and don't have my license. I loathe driving. It has given me massive anxiety ever since I first drove when I was 17. I have my temps right now (third time) and am home from college for the summer. I basically have to learn how to drive this summer because driving will probably be a necessity after I graduate. Already I've missed out on internships because I don't have my license. I can't miss out on jobs, too.

I just so afraid that I'm going to fuck up and end up ruining my life, or worse, someone else's life. If I were to hit someone or cause any damage to someone else in any way, especially if it were serious but even if I bumped a car and made a little dent, I would never forgive myself. I'd feel so unbelievably guilty for making this happen to an innocent person, and getting into an accident isn't just possible, it's probable. And there's so much to pay attention to on the road. It's so much responsibility and horribly terrifying. I 100 percent, absolutely, unequivocally hate driving.

And I've gotten so much pressure from people over the years to drive, too, which makes it worse. Everyone from my Grandma to my friends pressures me to do it. Whenever someone finds out I'm 21 and don't drive, they're floored, and then come the million and one questions about why I don't and the lecture about how it's not hard, it's relaxing, they love it, etc., as though they don't understand that we're two different humans and react differently to things. It makes me feel like I'm less than. Like I can accomplish all these great things in my life, but if I can't drive I'm useless. And at the same time, there's a voice in the back of my head asking myself why I can't do this thing that so many people find to be such a simple and routine task? This all just makes it even worse.

What prompted me to write all this out was that I just drove for the first time in at least a year. I drove around my residential area for about an hour or so almost exclusively on 25 mph roads. I didn't really do anything wrong (except almost running a run light and having to slam on the brakes), and my dad was good about giving me instructions and helping me and whatnot, but I was freaking out the entire time. I've lived in this neighborhood my whole life and have it entirely memorized, but I was so nervous I couldn't keep track of where we were going, so he had to give me directions everywhere. I hated every single second of it. Now that I'm done, I'm sitting in my room shaking. I still haven't recovered from the spike in anxiety. 

I'm sorry if anything about this post breaks the rules of this sub and I'm sorry for the wall of text. I just needed to write this all out and vent as soon as possible. Thank you to anyone who read this. If you have any tips or advice, it would be greatly appreciated, because like I said I'm going to have to get back at it soon since I have to learn by the end of this summer."
4ma1eo,0,2016-06-02,Please don't upvote I just need some advice and help.,extraaccount4,Overwatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/4ma1eo/please_dont_upvote_i_just_need_some_advice_and/,"Ever since 2 years ago when I saw the cinematic for overwatch I was really excited about getting to play it, and when the closed beta opened up and initial gameplay was released I instantly knew it would be a game I enjoy. But sadly I wasn't able to get any beta keys at that time so I decided to patiently wait for open beta or for the game to release. When May finally rolled around I was done with my finals and heard from a good friend that Overwatch was going into open beta. Since I had no obligations of studying for finals anymore I was ready to test out this game I've been longing to play. Now I finally get the chance to download the game and try it out for myself after waiting such a long time. But after I try to run the program my graphic's card wasn't able to handle it sadly. Since I have a laptop my graphic's card is integrated and I can't really upgrade it. It was really disappointing but I try to brush it off for now and play other games with my friend group to keep my mind off it. But when Overwatch finally released to the general public everyone in my friend group decided to buy the game. They all shared with me how fun it was and that it was a game I should buy, but again I can't really play the game. I tried not letting all their fun get to me. But everywhere I go I see posts on how amazing overwatch is on facebook, reddit, etc. Even on twitch when I watch my favorite streamer all they play is overwatch now. It's hard to not let this all get to me but I'm just feeling left out of all of this and really just want to even get a chance to play this game. The only option currently to play overwatch is to either A) buy a new laptop or B) buy a console and buy the game, but currently I have the funds for none of these things. My laptop is technically fine and I don't wanna ask my parents to buy me a new one as our financial situation isn't great. As for a job currently most of my time is spent working at an unpaid internship to get some experience and the rest of my free time is going to summer school to get some college credits. Is there any way I can play overwatch, or even get a chance to play it regularly with my friends?"
4ma36w,3,2016-06-02,"F4A - ""I bought you a gift...""",portiaDPP,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/4ma36w/f4a_i_bought_you_a_gift/,"""...to help with your stress at work."", my girlfriend says the moment I step out of the bathroom, my skin still rosy and steaming from my morning shower.  She sits perched upon our bed with that smile and twinkle in her eyes that is both sweet and absolutely terrifying at the same time.

""Oh?  Stress ball?""  I ask starting to dry off.

""Nope!""

""Punching bag?""

She practically bounces with excitement, pulling the gift from behind her back.  My face turns to one of horror, shaking a clear *Absolutely not!* when I see it’s one of those crazy new bluetooth enabled vibes.  Speechless, I turn from her, finding my way into the closet.  As usual, I pick a pair of tight blue jeans and a comfy t-shirt.  Bending over to slip my legs into my jeans, I feel her cool fingers caress over my behind making me jump before I stand up.  My mouth opens to say something, but I find myself distracted by her warm breath on my neck, the press of her lips over my carotid.  As always, I feel not only my knees but my resolve weaken as I fall back against her.

""I know you are well respected at your office and if anyone knew what a naughty girl you are it would jeopardize your position.  I also know how you love to bring some your naughtiness into your daily routine.  It's why you rarely wear panties.”  Her voice smokey against my ear.

Her cool hand gliding over my cheeks as she speaks, slipping between my thighs.  Agile fingers caressing over my lips bringing a low throaty growl from me.  My body instinctively reacting to her teasing fingers and words.

""I can tell the idea turns you on hon and don't worry, I've made sure that it's quiet enough.  Well at least at the lowest settings."", her calm voice buzzing in my ear.  Her lips arcing into a wicked grin against my neck.  My eyes widen in shock feeling the rose petal soft silicone push past my lips.

""Ok babe, funs over..."", my voice catching in my throat.

Before I can even finish though, she's yanked my jeans up, buttoned them and stepped away with a satisfied smirk.  ""I've already paired it to your iPhone and set up mine so I can control it all day.  You just need to sit back and relax!"", she exclaims all giddy like.  I turn slowly in front of the full length mirror happy to find that it’s completely unnoticeable, but lord am I aware of it with every movement.

""Turn it on, I need to gauge the volume."", I demand.  My voice nearly silent but calm and in control, giving in to this exciting adventure.

Her giggle is musical when she takes out her phone, turning it on it's lowest setting.  Gentle vibrations rumbling through me elicit a small squeak, but she's correct I can't even hear it.  ""Now for a medium setting!"" she chuckles fiddling on her phone.  A sharp intake the moment the more intense vibrations caress my walls and clit.  I have to reach out, brace myself to keep from stumbling.  Seeing my predicament, she quickly lowers the speed.

""Don't you dare do that while I'm at work!  Anyone in the same room would hear it!"", I growl at her.

""I would never..."", she starts in that sickly sweet voice, that is promptly followed by wicked giggles.  ""...at least when you are in a meeting.  Now you need to get going or you'll be late!""

I glare at her while completing my outfit before giving her a peck on the cheek and darting out.  Thankfully the drive is uneventful.  Just the lowest buzz keeping me constantly aroused.  Any movement making me shudder.  A peppy little import sports car cuts me off and shockingly, I don't even bother to scream obscenities.  Surprised, I think to myself *Well, as usual she correct, not only do I feel more naughty, I'm way more relaxed than normal.*

The morning is surprisingly uneventful, my girlfriend true to her word providing reprieve during the barrage of meetings.  Outside of my steadily growing need, the only frustration being my colleagues asking ""Are you ok?"" when they notice my pink cheeks and shallow breath.  Inside I'm thinking *No, I have a serious case of the hornies*, laughing to myself at my dorky joke but externally, I just respond flatly ""I'm fine.""  As the work day draws nearer to its end, I can feel her get more adventurous.  At times changing the pulse pattern or intensity.  Each tweak making me squirm at my desk and gasp quietly.  Tick tock the clock in my office screams, as if I need a reminder at how slow the day is going.  It doesn't help that my mind is perpetually filled with images of what activities will be in store when I get home.

My heart skips with excitement when the hands lurch to 5.  I leap from my chair, carelessly tossing my laptop into my bag when I hear his voice behind me.  My insufferable boss.

""Hey Portia, I know you aren't feeling great today, but I really need someone I trust to look at this tonight.""  Immediately my mind screeches *Oh hell no*.

“Sure”, I hear myself answering.  *WTF*

""Great, I'll expect a report tomorrow morning then!""  He says in his grating monotone on his way out.

Sighing in frustration, I plop my ass back down and start going through the report, watching everyone escape for the weekend.  A quick text to my girlfriend.  ""Sorry hon, I'm going to be late.  Shouldn't be more than an hour though.""  The low steady vibrations pervasive and distracting, relaxing and frustrating in the same moment.  Given the lack of response, she must be out with some of our friends or making dinner.  I'm almost relieved with the delusion I’ll complete the report and get home soon.  As soon as the thought floats out of my head, my phone chirps.

""Anyone left there?"", her text questions.

I scan through the list on the company-wide chat.  Offline, Offline, everyone is offline except me.  Just to make double-dog sure because I suspect she is planning on stopping over and lord knows what she will do, I peek out my office door.  As expected, the silence is deafening and every light is off.

""No"", I answer my hesitation obvious as mental images of what she might do tumble through my head.  ""Hmmm, maybe I was wrong"", I mumble slightly disappointed after another 30 minutes of silence.  My fingers flying over the keyboard, anxious to get this report done.  Her answer becomes self-evident as the intensity increases, stealing my breath, my need a persistent flame as I start to squirm.  Steadily the vibrations increases until I can hear the humming from betwixt my legs.  The sensations against my slick walls and throbbing clit forcing my eyes to glaze over blurring whatever I'm adding to the report.  I just hope it isn't the expletives rolling around in my head.

Right next door, in the intern quarantine, one of the college interns looking to get ahead is pulling a late night.  They pull one earbud out, shrugging at the low hum assuming someone has left their cell phone behind.  Plugging their reprieve back in, they continue reading through some paperwork in prep for next week.

My teeth gritting, trying to focus on my task. From the volume and speed of oscillations, it's clear my girlfriend has kindly passed the halfway mark.  My feet start tapping on the floor, hands trembling, hips rolling, breaths coming in short gasps.  Confident I'm alone, I let a single word explode through my grinding teeth.  Fuck!  Every nerve in my body is singing for me to let go, without even scanning my report, I punch the send button, collapsing back into my chair, eyes mostly closed, allowing myself to feel every exquisite sensation.

Next door, the quiet intern has decided to call it a day.  Their earbuds pulled, the humming quite obvious now.  Their steps completely unheard as they check the offices opposite mine before seeing me, writhing, hands clenching the arms of my chair.  Their mouth drops open at the sight, trying and failing miserably to match their knowledge of me and this vision.  Unable to formulate a single thing to say, they lean against the door watching intently.

I think I feel eyes on me and let mine flutter open halfway.  Through the blur of my glassy blues, I envision a figure in my door way when I hear my phone chirp again.  ""You cum yet?"" my girlfriend teasing.  I'm scared it is more than my imagination, that there really is someone.

""No"", I tap out, my hands quaking so much that I bump the send button before finishing.  Fully intending to warn her someone might be watching and to stop.  ""Oh god"", I squeal through clenched teeth, my walls shuddering around the rumbling invader.  My girlfriend clearly having set the intensity at its highest.  The sparks of pure unadulterated pleasure the only thing I can sense, focus on.  My nails dig into the arms of my chair, my back arching, heart pounding in my chest.  I'm gone, I want nothing but the euphoria, my body trembling as waves upon waves of pleasure batter my body.

""Fuck"", I hiss as she finally dials it down to 1, collapsing in my chair.  My chest heaving, gulping in air when I remember.  I look up quickly, my bright red face spelling out *Oh god, please say I was imagining things*.  I open first one eye.  So far so good.  Then the second to see my doorway still empty.  *Whew, I was just imagining it!*, I believe, relief washing over me and soon I'm up packing away my laptop again.  Adrenaline still coursing through my body enhancing my hearing.  “Oh shit!”, I growl, my eyes wide with shock.  That was most definitely the exterior door closing.  In a panic, I rush out hoping to catch them.  Naturally they have disappeared, but I rationalize that no matter who it was, my word will hold more weight if my actions were brought to light.  *Pretty difficult to convince yourself with a wet spot in your jeans though.* my mind chimes in.

I definitely could see this going in a blackmail direction, but I’m always open to suggestions.  If possible, I'd prefer something longer term or chain story-esque because real life has a horrible habit of whisking me away at the most inopportune times, which is frustrating for both of us.

I have been self-teaching for about a year on FreeCodeCamp primarily and am at an interesting crossroads. 


I am wondering what I should be diving into now that I have built about 7 things in React (2 w/redux, 1 w/router). I have finished the React portion of freecodecamp and next on the list is D3. However...I am thinking of diving into node.js a bit because I think that is more valuable than D3 looking at job prospects.


The other issue I am thinking about is that I am starting an internship soon at a company that uses plenty of PHP and jQuery (no React :( ). I have not learned PHP yet (they will teach us at the internship) and it has been some time since I used jQuery. 


With all that in mind, and considering I want a job as a JS developer...What do you think? Can you point to some good tutorials?


Thanks!"
4ma4ip,2,2016-06-02,My boyfriend (21M) got an internship and I (21F) miss talking to him,boredgf1,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4ma4ip/my_boyfriend_21m_got_an_internship_and_i_21f_miss/,"My boyfriend of 3 years got a pretty good summer internship in computer science.  He started a couple weeks ago.  I started my summer service immersion a week ago.  He's living with his parents in one state, and I'm in an apartment in the state where we both go to college.  

Early in the summer, when neither of us had any commitments, we'd text back and forth a bit during the day and call twice a week.  Those conversations were the highlight of my day.  They don't really happen much anymore.  My boyfriend is at work or commuting to work from 7 am to 6 pm, whereas my hours are only 9 to 4.  I text him during my lunch break and yearn for a response, and I don't get any.  He apparently leaves his phone off during the day.  Once he gets home, he has dinner with his family and spends time with his younger siblings.  If he gets back to my texts, it's way late at night after I've gone to sleep.  We haven't had a proper text conversation since he started his internship.  We've connected on the phone maybe once, on a Saturday.

I was especially lonely during the week before my service project, but even though my hours are now occupied, I can't stop thinking about him and how much I miss him.  I like my work, but I want to talk about it to someone and he just isn't there.  I'm lonely and don't really know what to do with all my social energy.  I have a couple friends in the area but they work during the day too and are only available on weekends, and they usually go out and do stuff I'm not interested in.  So, after work every day, I'm just sitting on my butt watching Family Feud.  It gets a bit lonely sometimes.

I feel like I'm stifling my boyfriend with a bunch of unanswered text messages.  I'm always looking at my phone hoping he'll answer.  I hate being so clingy and desperate.  What can I do?

   
**tl;dr**: I miss talking to my boyfriend while we're apart this summer and I don't know what to do."

4mblst,2,2016-06-03,inadequate flirting accompanied by weak game mixed with presumptuous young male tendencies (long read),Silas_Of_Ngerechmai,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/4mblst/inadequate_flirting_accompanied_by_weak_game/,"Background - 

I recently started working for a well known grocery chain in Southern California while I await my fall semester following my gap year. I had spent a large portion of my gap year overseas in the South Pacific as an intern at a production company. This goes without saying that I had not encountered nor talked to any American girls in person for some time, and that I had become accustomed to the straight forward no-nonsense approach of islander women. You can guess where this might lead already.

About two weeks into my bagboy job (yes I know) this new-hire girl gets put into the rotation. She immediately sticks out from the rest of the female staff because of her height, freckles and long braids (some of my weaknesses) plus she's my age. I know what you might be thinking from the jump, ""don't dip your pen into the company ink"" so-on-and-so forth. I am aware of the consequences that come with even chatting up a female coworker in today's society and how expansive the sexual harassment policy is at the company I work for. I have kept a constant focus in regards to my work and she hasn't become a distraction for me or kept me from doing my job well. I will admit however that whenever she is at work I try to see her or say hi at least once. 

Recently I was promoted to a different position in the meat dept. of the store so it has become even more difficult to see her or even talk to her. The only actual time I see her now is when I clock in or out, or when she sweeps the aisles and goes right past me. Bottom line: there are limited chances when it comes to interaction with her, unless I want to risk it and wait till the moment she gets off and just go for it on the spot. It's been about a year since I was close with a girl and I know for a fact that I have piled on significant rust in the game department. To put it frankly, when I see her my nervousness gets the better of me.

Just the other day my buddy and I were about to clock-in to work and she comes out of the door in front of us. I nod and say, ""Hey"". She looks straight at me then turns to my buddy and says, ""Hey (insertname)"" to him and walks away. I tried to play it off like I wasn't a little booty hurt off of it, but I knew my buddy noticed this savagery. Skip to tomorrow and I'm at work feeling down about what happened when as I'm restocking the refrigerated aisle I feeling something bump into my me. I turn around and see that she's pushed a broom into my leg. She smiles at me as she walks down the aisle finishing her sweep, leaving me questioning the true intentions of females worldwide. 

Later that day I get off work the same time she gets off and I see her about to exit the store. I have no idea what I was thinking, but I decided to jokingly (and a little seriously) say, ""pssst!"" and put a cliché handphone up to my ear and mouth the words, ""call me"". Almost instantaneously I realize the error of my ways and how I have just solidified myself as the biggest dork that she's ever seen when then she replies, ""I don't even have your number!"" and laughs as she walks into the parking lot. I thought to myself, ""Well that's gotta be better than, 'stay away from me you creep!'"".

That was last week and since then I have only seen her a couple times (clocking in and clocking out) where she will just smile at me as we pass by. She doesn't work that many hours so it's not like there are too many chances to make a fool out of myself again. To combat this I added her on Instagram, which any millennial with sense and a smartphone would do. Her page is the typical SoCal white girl layout with sunset pics and the obligatory dog filter for SnapChat stills (even one of her butt in high-waist jeans with the 'cake' emoji) . That's when I notice a video of her in a car with some guy using the aforementioned dog filter....posted a week ago. Boyyy....I sank a little bit deeper into my bed right then. I tried to piece it together and tell myself I'm just overreacting by assuming that this guy is Captain Boyfriend and there's no need to speculate, but it did little help to my psyche. Later that night I check again and she has deleted the video of her and mystery boy along with some of her riskier pics. I'm still quite puzzled by it all.

At this point I'm at a loss. How should I go about this? Should I try to get in touch with her at work or online, or just mind my own and ignore her flirting? I need some help here you guys, I've been on the bench for way too long.

4mcmfx,5,2016-06-03,"Me [22/F] with my boyfriend [25M] of 1 year 6 months, should I apologize again or let it rest?",throwaway02-06,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4mcmfx/me_22f_with_my_boyfriend_25m_of_1_year_6_months/,"Well r/relationships, I have a great relationship with a guy for the past 1 year 6 months. We met at work and hit it off quite well. He is my first boyfriend, I am his first girlfriend, so there were new feelings, realizations etc, adjustments, a little argument here and there sure, but he has helped me grow and learn so much since we've been together - I am incredibly lucky to have him in my life. He is my best friend, and rock. 

Now to the real deal. As mentioned above we worked together (in City A) till he quit around 2 months ago and shifted to his parents' place (in City B) to figure out what next. I was incredibly sad since I was staying on at said work place, but happy that he was moving on from a job where he was underutilized and unhappy. We decided to continue long-distance but were not sure when we would see each other next. It so happened that I was working from my home in City C this week, and on boyfriend's way back to his home (City B) from an internship in City D, he had a 8 hour layover in City C. This layover was unplanned and we found out about 3 days ago and of course I was ecstatic to see him! We planned for me to pick him up and take him to my house for breakfast where he would also get to spend time with my brother and mom, then for him to accompany me to my college for me to get some work done, and then for us to have lunch after which I would drop him to the station. 

Now everything went perfect till we left my house for my college, we were  roughly an hour behind time but still had enough time to finish everything. Now when I say 'college' note that I passed out two years ago and hadn't visited since. I asked boyfriend beforehand if he was fine with accompanying me to college since I would be taking a day off work the day he was in City C to spend time with him, and wanted to get the college work done too as it would be hard for me to take another day off to go to college (I am going back to City A in a day) - he was very positive about coming along and seeing the institution where I spent three great years. After reaching, my work was over fairly quickly, but I was very excited about being back in campus and revisiting my classrooms, hostel rooms, canteen, and the like, and showing boyfriend around the whole place. I bumped into many college staff and went a little overboard with meeting everyone. Eventually, I lost track of time and realized the time an hour before we had to reach the train station, with still another professor to meet - this meeting could not be postponed. After this meeting, we had no time left for lunch. 

While we were on the way to the station, I felt bad about not having time to catch lunch, but didn't realize how bad until be brought up that he was sad that we didn't get to spend much time together. Although I tried to defend myself a little when he first brought it up by blaming it on the delay created when leaving my house in the morning, I soon realized that I should have been more strict about my time and ensured we do lunch, and felt miserable about this and apologized profusely to him. Especially since he was going to leave in another hour with us again not concrete about the next meeting date. 

Frankly speaking, lunch was the part I was looking forward to the most as well, as it would be just the both of us like the good old days when we were in the same city. 

On one hand I am GLAD that he brought up his displeasure at the same time as he felt it because there have been cases before wherein he has not said anything at the time, and when he would tell me later, I was upset as to why he wouldn't share these feelings with me when they happened. On the other hand though, I feel like a horrible girlfriend for (kind-of?) ruining this day. I WISH I could get these 8 hours back and just be with him, and not have anything to do.

To clarify, boyfriend was extremely respectful while expressing his sadness to me, and hates it more when I go overboard with the apologies. He told me that he was glad that he got to see my college, and he was perfectly fine that I went there, but that he wished we could spend that time with each other. We hugged it out, and I was again incredibly sad to say bye to him, but content in the thought that we love each other.

I know that I am not great with apologies, and time-manager is not my forte either. So my question is Reddit, should I apologize to him again - should I do something - send him a message, get him a gift?  Or am I thinking so much and should just let it to rest and learn for the future?  

**tl;dr**: Long-distance boyfriend and I planned a perfect day together, a part of which didn't pan out because I lost track of time. Feel horrible about not being able to spend that time with him. Apologize more or let it rest and learn for the future? "

4md8j4,1,2016-06-03,F4M - Celebrity wins hot vacation,[deleted],AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/4md8j4/f4m_celebrity_wins_hot_vacation/,"""By ""raffle"", I won a trip to special vacation resort. This resort is unique because it’s ONLY for couples and no one seems to know much about it, as people who won tickets have to sign nondisclosure agreements. But the rumor is that it’s really great, and most importantly one of the most exclusive in the world. I really want to do that trip, but have nobody to go with, so I ""catch"" you and drag you into it so I can go.

In that resort, a lot of activities are organised for couples. We quickly discover that some are mild, and some aren't at all. Romantic dinners, massage lessons with other couples or just the two of us, sexy cooking lessons, but also more kinky ones. Moreover, some employees can give dares to couples every time they see them, from kiss and grope each other right here (“here” being anywhere from an empty corridor public places)or skinny dipping to have sex in that place without getting caught (or make sure you do get caught by somebody). Each couple can choose anytime between 3 categories and activities and dare at the beginning of the day, but won’t know any details until they start. You can be an employee or a fan, or some rich friend and you have to act like your bf. At the beginning You'd probably kind of shy/nervous because of all of this, hanging out and pretending to be with THAT celeb's boyfriend. On my side I'm having a blast, enjoying myself and keeping us from all the things you'd love to try.

And from here, the scenario can go differen ways depending on what you want to do, your kinks &amp; limits… So let’s discuss it

Do youstart to enjoy yourselfself and we both start to take part is more and more daring activities? Do you figure out that you can take advantage of the situation, start to get more and more touchy every time you can? Trying to get us into the hottest activities, and if I refuse to play along threaten to expose us as a fake couple? Or maybe you start to even blackmail me after getting some serious leverage, and get me to do everything you want.

LOTS of possibilities, with either a young celeb and an older employee, assistant, agent... Or an older one with the new intern or some fan she randomly picked, I'm open to suggestions !

4mdawm,3,2016-06-03,Being attractive/desirable and talented isn't a magic opt-out of depression.,Throwemway1,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/4mdawm/being_attractivedesirable_and_talented_isnt_a/,"I've seen people talk about how they are depressed because they are ugly, unsuccessful etc. I feel like you might enjoy this new perspective and I want to vent(to someone)

So why am I depressed? This might be a long read, but i will give a gift at the end!

Now the boring bit is that since like 12 or 13 I've always felt really fucking empty inside, I feel like I have very low empathy and have never let anyone be too close, enjoyment has always been very short lived, and of course I filled this in with vidya and weed. 

*sudden 3rd person*  
Until little /u/Throwemway1 started becoming a man, that is. Now his family moved to the capital because job opportunities and this little guy was very talented in basically everything he touched, he learned languages, maths&amp;sciences and arts at unprecedented rates and got very deep understanding of them, so he needed a better profile school, and so he did.

After a week of general awkwardness he started taking the school by storm, everyone loved him, teachers, classmates and other peers alike, he discovered that he actually wasn't a shut in or a loner like he thought, but something didn't sit right with him, it just didn't feel right, now fast forward couple of years he still felt awkward around girls, because he hadn't had very much contact before, but something  had changed, these crossing looks and 'accidental' bumps and invites to social events definitely weren't accidental, but something about him started changing, the young lass started feeling something sour in his mouth, the happy illusion shattered and he started noticing how fucking shallow this world is, how there are tons of outcasts that get 0 attention and are probably contemplating suicide every passing day, and everything started turning grey again, just like 3-5 years ago, and he couldn't take the psychological burden and collapsed, cut off all of friends and his grades dropped enough to get him expelled.

He got professional help by top psychiatrists and psychologists of the country and applied to a new school, and in this time he definitely started noticing a LOT of female attention, but the effects still lingered and he wrote it off with general anxiety(she'd look weird with me, she's a little weird) and paranoia(i can't ACTUALLY be attractive, right?), by now he was 17, could fluently speak in 5 languages, self taught 2 programming languages and acquired a library of scientific, literal and historical knowledge.

His dad had started drinking, and actually started showing emotions towards his son, and soon they started going to the gym three times a week as a family strenghtening excercise, they went fishing, did cool things with their Raspberries together and his dad got him in to a serious IT business as an intern, his grades started climbing back, by now female attention was almost obnoxious, he  almost couldn't stare at the ground and not get a stare back, so one day he grew enough balls to talk to a random cute girl on the train that seemed interested, he made up a random 'smooth' line and muttered it while his hands were almost visibly shaking, the girl smiled and they started talking, while the girl maintained constant eye contact and was playing with her hair, they exchanged numbers (and names, obviously) and he decided to look her up in social media, lo and behold, she was in a relationship, he felt almost like he was being the one cheated on, and decided to look up a girl he remembered being cute around him in school, and she was in a relationship as well, in fact he basically couldn't find anyone who wasn't in a relationship by now, and his emotions started collapsing again.

And I have been in this trough for about a half a fucking year and I've kept going by basically being 'strong' aka forcing myself to continue and not fail again, but apathy seems to be growing almost by day, and now it's actually hard for me to finish this wall of text off, i guess i'll leave off with no real closer, because i just don't fucking know(ANYTHING)

now if you've gotten through this without cheating here's the promised gift: [my kitten](http://i.imgur.com/Zs4ive2.jpg) just in case you needed some comfort(i know i do)"
4mdcac,12,2016-06-03,I just need to bitch for a second.,lakashhar,breakingmom,https://www.reddit.com/r/breakingmom/comments/4mdcac/i_just_need_to_bitch_for_a_second/,"UUUUGGGHHHH. okay this is long. you don't need to read it. I just need to get it out of my system. TL;DR nobody helps me with shit and I'm exhausted.

Okay so I work in business. I'm good at what I do, fucking great really, lets all pat me on the back! I chose to leave cooperate to work as the Vice President of a local all natural maid service company. For many many reasons, but partially cause I'm insane. When I got the company last March it wasn't functioning. They had a brand, a website, and supplies but no clients. I fell pregnant in May, and have been dealing with this company in the middle of horrible pregnancy nausea. I let NOTHING stop me. Because this is business. If you want to play with the big boys you don't get a work life balance and you sure as hell don't get time off because you got pregnant. Technically I have a boss (the owner) but he is basically uninvolved and gets mad if I ask him questions, so that was my own choice. I also chose to basically not have a maternity leave. I tried to but the company is too small to function without me so that lasted maybe 3 days.

The company is doing great now, I have 2 cleaners, hiring our 3rd, my own private office, and about 30 clients with more coming in daily. Pay is meh, I work a lot of hours I don't charge for because I want things a certain way but we can't afford it. This is why you work salary in my position, which has been discussed, but it's not yet sustainable (I wanted the private office more, where I can take my kid while I work).

With how fast we are growing I get a little stressed at times. Especially with a 3mo old. And I'm on call 24/7. But there is no one else dedicated like that. No one to talk to about the company direction, office set up, training aspects. It's all on me all the time. And I sooooo desperately need a right hand man. I have one cleaner that's super dedicated to the company, but she also has 2 kids (with 2 different baby daddies in separate homes so lots of court) and a wreck of a personal life which greatly limits her ability to work with any means of dedication. Plus she is a giant ball of anxiety. She wants to be in leadership so bad, and I think she would be great, but I look at her and see a project that I don't know if it will pay off or not (it's really down to her). I think about all the training she needs and get stressed the fuck out, but you can't buy loyalty and I'm not wasting it so she will get her training. We are going to discuss making her ""field supervisor"" which is basically a fancy word for you train and fire the maids for me, cause I dont have time. She trained our other maid and fucked it royally. So we have a long way to go for what is basically the easiest job in any company.

She doesn't understand the responsibility of leadership for one. She bitched and moaned about work to the new hire about hours and pay. So fucking inappropriate, especially since she's paid way more. It would be fine if she was bitching to a co worker but she wants to play boss she needs to act like a fucking boss.

She talks too much. Which is both good and bad. Her communication is fucking great, but sometimes she does hour long conversations about work crap and I just don't have time for that shit. Condense. Give me the foot notes please.

She is hyper clean. Which yay detailed, but booo taking way too long and then training all the workers to take way too fucking long.

She's spoiled. Admittedly this is my fault. When I was sick and prego I needed the help desperately so she got whatever she wanted. So she gets tons of special treatment. I don't mind it, but I worry about how she will train if she doesn't follow any of the procedures I have in place as is. She tries to take hours from the other workers when she doesn't have availability and tries to make customers work to her schedule and not the other way around. When I couldn't cover shifts this was necessary, but now not so much, and its rude to customers. She lost her privileges to see the other workers schedule. It was also pissing me the fuck off because she gets first priority on all jobs as long as shes available and she keeps acting like the other employee is stealing work from her....nope the customer just wanted that time slot and you were already working during that time.

She's so negative all the time. A lot of her complaints are money and it drives me up a wall. She's paid well above what people make in this industry. And half her problems are her availability. She wants 40h work weeks. But she also wants to work 9-5 M-F with holidays off and time off Tues 11am-1pm in an hourly business. I have straight up told her that we can accommodate a second job (the other employee does this, an internship, and childcare), or I would understand if she looked for a job that would pay more (this is a trick, she does not have the resume for a job that would pay more, I want her to look so she can realize she is being a dick).

I need a partner to help and this is the best I got right now. This business has high turnover and loyalty is hard so hiring out for what I need is unlikely to get the loyalty to a small business, but this girl is just....so far from actually being helpful. 

I'm having breakdowns daily as I try to accommodate pumping, having a newborn, shit options for childcare in his age group, and allll the motherfucking work shit. My husband is like oh you work part time you can handle the bulk of the chores cause I need ""me time"" (whatever in the loving fuck that is) cause he's burnt by the end of his work day. and yeah I only get paid for 20h weeks...but that's not counting all the time spent pumping. all the drive time. picking up and dropping off kid from daycare. driving by said daycare to nurse in the middle of the work day so I don't have to fucking pump in my car while driving all over kingdom come. all the unpaid hours of painting, shopping, taking phone calls, and planning for the business because I want shit a certain way. God damnit will somebody, fucking anybody just be my partner and help me take this shit on? Any of it? FUCK."

I'll just be improving the css &amp; html and making websites look nicer and work on mobile devices (which they currently dont), so how much should i estimate per hour? I dont expect to be working on backend databases etc. but I could should the need arise. When answering could you also please keep in mind that I'm in no way an expert and still pretty new to frontend development (3months experience)."
4mdykk,7,2016-06-03,I'm having trouble with powershell variables and array indexing.,InternServerQs,PowerShell,https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerShell/comments/4mdykk/im_having_trouble_with_powershell_variables_and/,"I just started using powershell this week. I started an internship and server management and automation is greatly encouraged. We are doing drive inventory and I found a way to get all the hard drive serial numbers (in non RAID 1 boot drives) without having to stop tests. 

I'm writing a simple script to do it on one computer before I start remoting. My problem is understanding really how the variables work. When I am getting the serial numbers and adding them to a list, my understanding is that it went into a string array. I have figured out how to modify the strings, but I can't figure out how to replace a value in the array so I can later print the array to a file. 

Here is my code:

    $serials = Get-WmiObject win32_PhysicalMedia | select Serialnumber -ExpandProperty Serialnumber

    foreach ($y in $serials) {

The medical examiner clarified Ashe died from traumatic asphyxia and suffered laryngeal fractures while lifting.

John Ashe was set to testify against Hillary Clinton."
4mex38,4,2016-06-03,Realized how much confidence I lack,InferenceEngine,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/4mex38/realized_how_much_confidence_i_lack/,"I never realized how much of a ""dork"" I guess I was until a week ago. Funnily enough it all happened in a matter of seconds.

I intern for a real estate company and there's this girl who I share an office with. She's a year older than me, at 23. For this story's sake we can call her Cammy. 

Honestly, I had/have (you'll see why later) a crush on her but I didn't really want to act upon it  because there was probably no way it would happen and we are at work. I would love to be friends with her though or anyone there if possible. 

The thing is despite everyone being friendly for the most part to each other, Cammy often seems pissed off when having to talk to me or cuts conversations short / giving quick short replies. I guess it's my fault because I remember when I first met her and shook hands I was verbally tripping over myself and shaking.( I was really nervous on my first day) I recall her smile changing to a look of disgust. 

Anyway last week I was walking out to get lunch and I saw her sitting down with 3 other women chatting. I decided to ask her if she wanted to go to lunch together.( Here's where I fucked up because I asked her with people around and I'm  really nervous around groups of people but all of them were girls. Probably shouldn't have bothered them to be honest) 

They all got silent and Cammy just stared at me with a pissed off look as usual. So reflexively I  said I'm sorry I can bring you something back, sorry.  and Cammy said ""Why are you such a dork?"" I literally couldn't think of anything to say other than sorry again. The worst part was her just turning around and ignoring me and then hearing her friends fight off laughing at me. I was so nervous I couldn't even think I just started inching backwards so I could walk away and I stumbled like a buffoon. They just couldn't let me get away. No instead one girl I see occasionally but don't really know said ""aww don't trip in your grandpa shoes"". Followed by another one commenting ""See you later diaper butt"". I couldn't even turn around to face them if I wanted to. I didn't understand what they were saying at the time with those comnents either I just felt insanely sick and disoriented. To be honest I was fighting back tears.

As I was back in the office Jess who had actually witnessed that tragedy, just decided to barge in and ask me a ton of personal questions which led to her giving some ""harsh sisterly advice"". Apparently A LOT of people make fun of me behind my back... A lot of it having to do with my clothes and the fact that I come off as nervous. The whole diaper butt thing having to do with my khaki pants. 

She said that she thought I was sweet and I don't really deserve any of that but since I'm  literally a confirmed  mama's boy according to her and based on what I told her. I need to grow a pair. I need  to actually ""LIVE"" for once due to not really having any friends and staying in on the weekends. To be honest I never really thought about these kinds of things but Jesus it's an eye opener... for one I've never kissed or hugged a girl outside of my mother and family.

I also don't have a single friend... locally speaking. I have 2 friends online that are great.

Long story short... Guess I'm having a quarter life crisis at 19 and need to improve myself. I guess I've been a mama's boy too because when I got home my gut reaction was to tell her but it went against the advice I was given. 

It's even more awkward at work now but I'm working making eye contact when saying hi. Even to Cammy. She rolled her eyes but smiled this time so that's an improvement."
4mf11w,1,2016-06-03,Need advice on getting an adult dog,slruppert,Pets,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pets/comments/4mf11w/need_advice_on_getting_an_adult_dog/,"Hello reddit, I need advice. I have been wanting a puppy for a few years now but I have decided getting an adult dog would be a better idea. I found a 7 year old golden retriever for sale that used to be a hobby breeding dog. But I have not contacted the seller yet because I am up in the air on whether or not I am ready or not. 

I have not decided because this summer I am busy and I would feel bad leaving him alone but I know that when the fall starts my schedule frees up. I'm worried about missing out on the opportunity of getting this dog. His personality was described as loving, and mellow which sounds great to me. While the summer might be hard at first it will get better in the fall. 

Here is some info about my life: 
* currently I have an internship about 4 days a week from 8am-4pm and I mostly work at home on fridays. They seem to be flexible with hours and working from home as well. 
* I also tend bar on weekend nights usually 8:30-2am, and then again on Sunday from 1:30-8:30
* I am a college student and will have class for 3 hours a day in the fall but will still have the bartending gig 
* I am always home and never go out because I take school seriously 
* I jog and love going hiking and walking around town 
* I do have neighbors and friends and a boyfriend that would be willing to help out occasionally as well but I do not want to take advantage of them at all

So please reddit, let me know what you think. I appreciate all answers and opinions.

4mfezo,2,2016-06-03,"I'm [21M/] with my Ex gf [22/F] It lasted a year(mostly long distance), my ex cheated on me and denied it. Need help moving on, some advice would be amazing.",drpepper400,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4mfezo/im_21m_with_my_ex_gf_22f_it_lasted_a_yearmostly/," I met this amazing Latin girl around a year and a half ago on a social app called Palringo. Started to engage in conversations with this girl and day after day I felt more attached and more so in love. Usually, I would spend most of my day texting and skyping her. Her passion, enthusiasm, charisma made me more and more fond of her. 

Nevertheless, after some time her personality started to alter, she started developing a lot of drama such as having a terminal illness and claiming that sometimes she is physically unable to communicate with me. (bear in mind she was my online girlfriend at the time, and loved her enough to trust her not to lie about something like that, because honestly who would do that? ) After a couple of months of this occasion, she got an internship somewhere far away from her home town. at the beginning of the internship she acted all normal, and then suddenly whilst still working there she decided to block me in most of the means that we can communicate with each other such as whatsapp/skype/Instagram/palringo... 

I started sending her emails as that is the only way, as her boyfriend I just wanted an explanation on why she would do that... she did not reply until a month later she told me she was almost put in a very indecent situation by one of her Co-workers. She claimed that her flatemate invited their co-workers over, they were then two guys and two girls. After sometime her flatemate excused herself with the other guy and they started having sex in the flatmate's room. My ex girlfriend ( lets call her X) went to her room to sleep and the guy followed her and tried to be intimate with her. I don't know about you guys, but this sounded so very dodgy to me.

Nonetheless, even though it was dodgy I still, accepted that fact and took her back into my life.Unfortunately, the drama does not end here...

So X later on moved outside of her country because of the bad situations there, she is a Venezuelan. Venezuela is having some rough times right now just in case you guys did not know. She then moved to Colombia and resided with her aunt and cousin. At this point, I decided to make my move and give her a visit in order to know what the hell is going on in this girl's mind. At the time I wanted to visit her in Colombia she told me she's going to go on a quick trip to Ecuador and wants me to meet her there. I agreed to that, and went there. Upon arrival in Ecuador and meeting her she seemed like the most ordinary, lovely, sane girl ever. We had the best two weeks together.
Before X had left back to Colombia, she asked me one of the oddest questions ever. She saw that I still had a couple of condoms left in the durex box that I brought with me and said. Can I keep two to remember you? I was like WTF lol why would you need a condom to remember me, and why the hell would you need ""two""? this was very odd, I refused but after she left I noticed that I had two condoms missing from the box lol.

I know what you guys are thinking, I am so stupid... an idiot that fell for a Latina online...she catfished him... she probably wanted money. When I finally left South America, it took me a day to get back to the UK. When I opened my phone and connected it to the internet she did not even bother saying have a safe flight or I miss you.. you know what normal couple would do...
So, I was thinking to myself.. should I stop being an idiot and leave her? The answer was yes I thought a lot about ditching this bird. But something always pulled me back to her, its like I have been enchanted by her controlling spells. lol. 

After a few weeks arriving back she started something knew claiming that she was pregnant.... we had sex a couple of times without a condom but I always pulled out ( I know there is a chance, but it was a small percentage. I had exams then during the time X was claiming that she was pregnant. ( I flunked both of these exams) because she was creating unnecessary trauma and misery to my life. Eventually it turns out that she has been lying once again.... not pregnant... Effing ****.

Anyways, even after this mishap, I still could not leave her until one day. A guy adding me on Instagram, this guy was familiar to me because she showed me a picture of him before and told me that he is her friend and her aunt's neighbour. However, on his instagram account the pictures prove otherwise, ""she had really close"" intimate poses with the guy and they were writing things like ""te amo mas bello"" "" te amo mucho mi esposa/esposo"".. which means I love so much you are the most handsomt guy .. the others mean I'm with my wife/husband. Surely, friends would never do intimate poses and say those things to each other? I was disgusted..... Utterly disgusted..depressed.. Annoyed...
In the end I broke it off with her, confronted her.. she created another situation in which she had her friend to pretend to be her boyfriend in those pictures to ""scare away an internet stalker"" COMPLETE BULLLL. I finally Ticked, used some abusive language, called her a puta one too many times lol. Left her dead-end life.
I'm only facing one problem, even though she was a psycho..and very ungrateful.. I still have strong feelings towards her, and I do miss her a lot. I always think about a scenario in which, she is having a good time with that guy while i'm miserable by myself. I've done everything I can for this girl, and this is how I got repayed. How can I trust another girl again? How can I move on? How can I forget?




   
**tl;dr**: Ex girlfriend messed with my life for a year, My assumption is that she cheated on me, found pictures on Instagram of her with another."
4mfi02,18,2016-06-03,How Reddit was Destroyed: The Making of a Propoganda Machine,BasedFaggotIsMyGod,The_Donald,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/4mfi02/how_reddit_was_destroyed_the_making_of_a/,"1) **The first thing they did was take away r/reddit.com.** 

This took away the only tool for communicating *with* reddit *about* reddit. If you had any concerns about the website as a whole, you could address them through r/reddit. Taking that away was the first step.

2) **The power now resided in individual subreddits, obviously the most popular ones. There was a power grab to become moderators of these subreddits.**

I remember as the upcoming election loomed, all of a sudden, r/circlejerk (one of the old default subreddits) became completely obsessed with bashing Ron Paul. I am not even a RP supporter, but that was definitely orchestrated, and NOT by some kids trying to be funny. Also, it coincided perfectly with this highly suspicious [campaign to filter him out of the election](https://archive.org/details/HowTheGovernmentAndMediaCheatedRonPaulDocumentary).

3) **Once the default subreddits were controlled, drastic changes began to occur.**  

I remember when r/IAma was open to anyone and the popularity was decided by voting. Now it is nothing more than a cheap place for celebrities to whore out their products and you need to be ""approved"". Someone named [Victoria](https://engage.vevent.com/index.jsp?eid=3110&amp;seid=111) is involved and how does that makes any sense whatsoever? Celebrities have entire teams of branding/PR/social media teams that work for them. Why do they need to be at reddit HQ and/or required to have a reddit rep? Because these AMA's are extremely organized and sponsored with money.

There are plenty of subreddits that are now covertly controlled. [Check out this post which was pushed into r/undelete for identifying a list of keywords banned from r/technology.](https://www.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/22yewf/i_have_identified_a_list_of_keywords_that_are/)

4) **The appearance of shills soon became VERY apparent.** 

All of a sudden new accounts started popping up out of nowhere. Cue the birth of r/HailCorporate. ""Feel good"" military posts started appearing, like a soldier coming home to his dog. New users entered AMA's to lob softball questions [""Mr Burns, your campaign has the momentum of a runaway freight train, how does it feel to be so popular?""](http://americablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/lisa-mr-burns-runaway-train1.jpg) From brand new accounts that *never* posted again.

[Eglin Air Force Base = Reddit's most addicted city!](http://www.redditblog.com/2013/05/get-ready-for-global-reddit-meetup-day.html) I would hate to be the poor reddit intern who got fired that day! ""Didn't you read the memo Billy. US military bases are *never* to be included in our yearly stats!!!""

[Anyone who tries to convince you that shills don't exist is either grossly uninformed or a liar.](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2hf77e/internet_trolls_may_be_trained_government_agents/cks8exy) **Protip:** the big political subreddits can’t seem to keep the seal on the circlejerk during weekends, almost as if an entire team of manipulators is suddenly on weekend hours.

5) **Now we have blatant censorship on r/news, r/worldnews etc... saying that X site is not allowed.** 

What ever happened to letting people vote on the content of this website? Trash tabloids constantly go viral on political subreddits due to sensationalized headlines and the fact that most Americans are unaware of different overseas publications.

Not to mention the fact that default subreddit rules are now completely refined, sophisticated and purposely worded to allow maximum mod-interpretation. Honestly, someone with a law degree with a proud.

Major politically-charged subreddits now insist on exact titles or quotes because that stops users from being able to post the important point summary of the article as the title . Using only official titles from only approved media has turned reddit into mainstream media. 

6) **Speaking of voting, they changed that too.**

We now have an entirely new way to view upvote/downvote scores. A user used to be able to see their score. But now, everything is fuzzed. For example, if you made a semi-controversial comment before, but many people agreed, you may have a score like (47/45), leaving you with a -2 next to the comment. Now you just get a -2 and nobody knows if *anyone* agreed with you.

7) **Hey guise, us nerds who run reddit have decided to shuffle all of the front-page subreddits, tee-hee we are so random** ^‿^ 

No more r/circlejerk, that pesky subreddit hits too close to home. Lets add 2X to the mix, (even though they wanted to remain an anonymous sub), fuck them, we need to show our shareholders we represent the female demographic. Lets also add a bunch of subs that we can use to share propaganda like r/nottheonion.

And speaking of the female demographic and ""gender discrimination"" being represented, that happened around the time [this person](http://www.reddit.com/search?q=ellen+pao&amp;restrict_sr=off&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all) took over as CEO of reddit.

8) **You are posting too much, please wait...**

It now doesn't matter if you have confirmed your email, or been posting on this site for years. If you anger the wrong mod/admin or your posts aren't doing ""well"", then you get benched.

Or you can always just have your comments deleted. You will not even know your comment is deleted. You will still see it. Only you. The only way to know is to be inherently suspicious, and sign out of your account after clicking on the permalink of the comment. 

A sneaky tactic, but hey, at least it is only your comment and not your whole account. Isn’t it great that we have [shadow-banning](http://www.webanswers.com/technology-computers/internet/web-sites/shadow-banning-on-reddit-997916) on a website that claims to support free speech.

9) **[Reddit is not a meritocracy](http://toddwschneider.com/posts/the-reddit-front-page-is-not-a-meritocracy/).**

**tl;dr**: **Your votes do not matter.** The front page is not decided on merit. Different subs are given different algorithms. There is a behind the scene ranking system that gives certain content a ""head-start"". As we have learned at r/conspiracy, if they don't like our sub, then we are banished from the front page, forever. Just like we were banished from r/bestof, after this [amazing comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1pvksy/what_conspiracy_turned_you_into_a_conspiracy/cd6kofo) that was gilden 8X and received over 3000 upvotes. [They actually gave that user the boot.](http://www.reddit.com/r/altnewz/comments/1q35an/just_for_archives_purposes/) How dare you bring your unique, first-hand perspective to a web-forum!!!

10) **The arrival and subsequent take over of r/undelete.**

Due to the now rampant censorship on the site, users took it into their own hands to bring the truth into the light. They created a part of reddit where users could see what was being deleted. [Nope.](http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2m6fsl/on_the_takeover_of_rundelete_and_the_subsequent/)

11) **[Now we are seeing a new site-wide trend that is designed to make it even harder to call out shills.](http://www.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/304uk6/the_reddit_trend_towards_banning_people_from/)** Which is interesting considering that nobody seems to care when the accusations are sponsored by the mob: “This guy is a Putin-bot! Everyone must think the *exact* same way about complex geopolitical events.”

12) **All of the proper ""checks and balances"" are now in place.** 

R/worldnews has become the ultimate modern-day version of the [Two-Minutes Hate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Minutes_Hate) from George Orwell's 1984:

&gt;a daily period in which Party members of the society of Oceania must watch a film depicting the Party's enemies and express their hatred for them.

But when we really want to drive a point home, the entire front-page gets in on the action!!!

Look what happened in the immediate aftermath of the Boston Bombing, while users were pooling resources, [the website was DDos attacked to stop the momentum](http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/19/reddit-ddos/). Good thing to, since moments later, our honest government said “Hey everybody, these two guys did it!” For arguments sake, despite anything that followed, it should be extremely alarming that millions of people suddenly decided they were guilty based on nothing more than a picture, the government’s word, and the ~~manufactured~~ consensus of their peers. I was on reddit in the exact moment the shift happened and NOBODY could tell me why they suddenly believed, **without any other evidence**, that two people attending the marathon with a circle around them was evidence of guilt. And I was gang-downvoted every time I asked.

And speaking of the BB, reddit will apparently never live down the fact that someone was wrongly accused. Why should a community be demonized for aggregating information and doing something that has proven to be successful in 90% of cases, particularly disasters? Why? Because the government can’t have people doing their own detective work, that would make their cover-ups way more difficult.

13) **Online guerrilla tactics.**

When reddit changed the voting system and people were on their last nerve with this site, a place called Whoaverse (now https://voat.co/) became popular overnight. It is basically a reddit clone and at the time was run by one guy. He was happy about the surge but mentioned it was going to be hard to keep up with, but was committed to making it happen. Guess what happened next?

Did you guess: “Thousands of targeted spam attacks to overload and destroy the website”? Then congrats, you now understand how far these fucks are willing to go to keep the herd in their pen. [Hijacking a cool brand and using it’s facade to conduct propaganda games is extremely profitable, just ask VICE.](https://independentaustralia.net/business/business-display/rupert-murdoch-and-vice,6483) And once you have the customer, [it costs much less to keep them than to acquire new ones](http://oursocialtimes.com/70-of-companies-say-its-cheaper-to-retain-a-customer-than-acquire-one/). So we are seeing online guerrilla tactics designed to destroy the competition by any means.

14) **Shark Shank's Redemption** (title credit to: u/Iridium777)

So I made this post and it went viral on r/conspiracy reaching +3500. I woke up the next day and by accident I signed out and saw my user page could no longer ""be found"". I then noticed that every comment I had made was stuck at 1. After over 6.5 years on reddit, I had received my first shadowban. 

So I made a new account and made [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/30hy5r/i_wrote_how_reddit_was_destroyed_and_it_went/) about it, it also went viral. I was given advice to message the reddit admins about my shadowban, I eventually received this message:

&gt;It looks like you got caught up in a vote brigade, but upon further investigation it looks like you were not part of it. Thanks for writing in so promptly. I've unbanned your account.

I have no idea what ""vote brigade"" I would have been a part of and you don't have to believe me but I have never been a part of anything that even vaguely resembles a ""vote brigade"". 

Anyways, the whole thing stinks to me. Like a canned response. The admin version of ""yeah, our bad"". Multiple years on reddit and I get my 1st shadowban ""accidentally"" within a day and a half of my most viral ""How Reddit Was Destroyed"". 
…………………………………….


It wasn't always like this. A few years ago, there were just as many disagreements and differences of opinion on reddit, but they were REAL. And the site was still a democracy. People voted and things swung from side to side, everybody learned in the end.

Now we have a completely one-sided mess that pretends to be democratic but is quickly becoming the Fox News of the internet. They designed a system that would take advantage of the [Eternal September](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September) syndrome and this manipulation has encouraged the retard masses to become their [useful idiots](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Useful_idiot).

**I believe this can essentially be boiled down to not just greed, but controlling and manipulating the information that the millions of people see on a daily basis. Reddit gets billions of views. [Manufactured consensus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing_Consent) is very real and doing it through social media is the gold standard because people are hard-wired to value the opinions of their peers.**

The people who run reddit are not the ""cool bloggers"" they try to portray themselves as. There is a head running things, and it is sinister and they are making A LOT of money, and have A LOT of power, and A LOT of influence. 

And they know it. You should too.

4mflpc,1,2016-06-03,"Me [22 M] with my LDR girlfriend [26 F] of 9 months, a whole bunch of problems + is she cheating on me?",relationshipthro1223,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4mflpc/me_22_m_with_my_ldr_girlfriend_26_f_of_9_months_a/,"Hey reddit,

I frequently come to or rather lurk this sub, because I think it helps me with being open and mature (and it really helped in the past reading about other relationships &amp; your advice). 

-----

I (European) am currently in a LDR with an Asian girl I met while I was abroad (she is a native). Before I left we built (in my opinion) a solid foundation for a relationship and continued with a LDR, even though I was VERY hesitant about it. In fact, I wanted to break up till the last evening, where I decided to say fuck it and just try it. 

While living in Asia, she was a bit needy and jealous due to her life chapter/living conditions at that point, but I didn't really think about it, because other than that she was a hoot to be around. She also told me that her bf cheated on her, so I understood where the jealousy came and still comes from. Furthermore, it is probably the first relationship where I can honestly and truly say I love you. 

Onto the LDR itself: The first few months were hard, but bearable because we both had a lot of free time. She was job searching at the time, while I was waiting for the next semester. As you can say from the flair, she is a tad older than me and was looking for strictly jobs, not paid internships. She found a paid internship in my home country with the promise of the company to extend the internship into a real job, if she performed well. The risk/volatility of the internship was too much for her, so she passed on it which I understand logically. At the same time I resent her a bit for reasons, which I will specify below. So i**ssue #1** arose from that situation. 

As far as my opinion goes, **issue #2** came up once she got a job. She promised me before getting any job, that she would take her time and come visit me in Europe. Because she was expected to work at the job 4 days after being accepted for the position, she wasn't able to come though. Which I again understand, but at the same time you shouldn't make promises you can't deliver. Besides the whole fact that it was quite awkward to tell my closest friends and family that she wouldn't be coming, I was ofc looking forward to finally see her again after 5-6 months with only Skype!

The past few weeks have been very turbulent for me. Working on my bachelor thesis plus working at a company part time and applying for internship makes my week 60-70 hours at least, which 
stresses me out a lot and I think also puts a strain on the relationship. Thankfully we still find the time to Skype at least 2 times per week, sadly without sexting each other like we used to. 

Because of this very emotional state, I am not sure if I am being irrational and controlling, or if she is really fucking with me. Let me expand a bit on the working culture of her country, so that you don't brand her as a cheater immediately: Apparently it's quite common for office worker to first of all work way more than the contract agrees to and secondly go for dinner and drinks with coworkers and bosses. Normally I don't worry about this stuff, but one incident sticks out in my opinion. She came home at 2 in the morning during a work day, which is even way too late for this culture. So I got wary about her behavior, but I raised my concerns and gave her the benefit of the doubt. She ofc denied everything and told me the reasons for it, which sounded plausible so we moved on with the Skype call. **(issue #3)**

Now onto my internship. Searching intensively for internships in Asia, I got a great offer in the country next to her (6 months). So my thought process was: That's great, I can be way closer to her and it will also be benificial to my career. The internship doesn't pay all the expenses I will have to make (like flights etc.), but my parents are very understanding and told me to not worry about anything. (I have great parents as you can see). Anyhow, I neither like using my money I saved nor mooching off my parents, so that was the first downside of the internship. Last week I got another great internship in my home country (also 6 months), which would be awesome for my career as well, because its in my relevant field of interest (automotive) and I would probably have the opportunity to do another internship abroad as well, if I decide to stay with this company. 

So with all issues in mind, making the decision isn't very easy. I love her with all my heart and the internship in Asia would be great for my career, but it is probably not something I am willing to do for multiply years. Which is even more annoying about this whole situation is the fact that she kind of demands or at least really pushes me to come to her home country before starting the internship. If I decide to take the internship in Asia, I would have like 8 days between my finals and starting work. So paying even more to fly to her home country and then to the country of the internship would be be obviously much more expensive, but I also wouldn't have time to say goodbye to my friends and family. So I would essentially take the risk to do an internship in Asia to be closer to her (while she didn't do the same thing, but yet is pushy about the whole ordeal). 

Onto today or tonight: She went out with her best friend (BFF) to celebrate BFF's birthday. So far, so good. The night progresses normally (atleast I thought so), when I get a message from her: A crazy funny story happened lol. Also so far, so good. So i asked her about it, she explained a bit about but not too much. What was really weird about the whole deal is that she said multiple times prior to this evening, that her BFF is not allowed under any circumstances to have friends or strangers in her room, even less so to sleep over. Her BFF would lose her room, if she did so. Thus, there is quite a risk attached to it since finding rooms in that city is a huge pain in the ass and very difficult. My girlfriend says that she is staying at her BFF's place (DAFUCK) alone, when I asked her for her BFF I didn't really get an answer. **(Issue #4)**

First of all, excuse this YUUUUUGE (sorry, could not resist) wall of text. My questions to you guys and gals of /r/relationship are if you 

* first of all have any general advice for me, because the LDR turns me (even I have to admit that) sometimes into the yellow beast of jealousy. 
* Second of all, I want to know If I am being too jealous or rather suspicious of the two incidents, or if you agree from my limited point of view?
* Last but not least, if you think I should take the risk and take the internship abroad. To be more fair, I quite like Asia and think that I would have a great experience there. However, due to the aforementioned, I am unsure if I should bite the bullet or na. 


TL; DR: Due to issue 1-4 I am unsure how to deal with this LDR and my future in general. While I am in love with my girlfriend, being in a LDR stresses me out way too much since I started working a lot for uni and work. I don't know if it is worth it to continue this relationship, if it doesn't make me happy like it used to.

PS: Please excuse any spelling and grammar mistakes. It's quite late here and I am neither from Ireland, nor the UK :P"
4mfo6l,38,2016-06-03,Having to keep your hours for the first time for a new summer job? my simple excel template makes it pretty easy.,pig_swigger,LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/4mfo6l/having_to_keep_your_hours_for_the_first_time_for/,"I had an internship last summer which was my first job where I actually had to keep track of hours. I tried a few different methods and hated them all. Paper sucked, I hated doing the math of amount of minutes translated into tenths of an hour, etc. 

So I designed [this spreadsheet](https://www.dropbox.com/s/pnahdujwgkimm7j/time%20sheet%20template.xlsx?dl=0). 

I leave this open all day at work and just keep the window as small as possible so it's easy to access and fill out. it's even easier if you use a simple program like textExpander (which I now can't remember how I lived without) or it's slightly less functional but only $5 cousin for mac, aText. i type ""ddate"" and out pops the date in that format. in the ""start"" column I type ""ttime"" and the timestamp spits out, and when I'm done, I do the same in the finish column. then the ""hours"" column does the math for me into the proper tenths-of-an-hour format. Each entry takes only a few seconds, and if you keep it in dropbox like I do, you can edit it from your phone if need be.

Once it's filled in you can email or copy/paste if your boss wants the whole thing, you can tally up the total hours if it's for a paycheck (which I did last week and it was awesome to get paid for the first time after a 5 month externship) or even do a sum for total amount of hours worked on a particular task so your boss can properly bill you out for that one client. 

A professor recently noted that even if you're normally doing work as an attorney on contingency, you may be called to give an account for the time you spend on a case. Doing it like this makes that easy. A lot easier than trying to remember hours (or days or weeks) later. "
4mfp2u,6,2016-06-03,critique needed,bellareed,KeepWriting,https://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/4mfp2u/critique_needed/,"I just started writing and i'd like a critique on what i wrote to see if it's any good at all and if it's worth continuing or not. Here it is: 

""We had left early in the morning at around 7. I could tell that she was upset. Her mouth does this thing where she bites the inner right side corner of her lip when she is. Her being the older one, she had contained any emotions that would show me that she was just as scared as I was, but I knew her too well. If anyone had seen us that morning, carrying our pink duffle bags and rolling our rainbow suitcases in the dirt roads, they would've thought that we were some rebellious teenagers escaping our horrible little lives. Maybe we were.

Luckily for us, Hannah was working at a hotel down in the city where we could both stay for a while, according to Patricia, her boss. My three months spent in that hotel were probably the best of my life. Ironic, given the reason why we ended up there. Every day I'd witness two different worlds; the first one being all the families that stayed at the hotel who fled their country and were granted a temporary home here by the government and the second one, all the wealthy business men away from their families, spending a night in this hotel for work. And then there was Hannah and I, not wealthy but then again not poor. Not fleeing but then again we too, were away from our family.

The very next day, just like nothing had happened, I had gone back to school. And just like every morning my friends would ask me how I was doing, and I'd reply with a usual fine. I don't usually express how I feel. Often my friends would ask me “But what about you Bella--How do you feel?” or say “Tell me more about that.” when i'd let a snip of my feelings out. That day was different. It wasn't just some other morning. The “shock” feeling was slowly leaving and more down to earth emotions were appearing. “I'm okay, I think.” and the series of questions began. “Yesterday my mom kicked me and my sister out.” I said nonchalantly. And just there, half a second later after saying those words, I realized why I never express my feelings. I can still picture their pitiful faces and hear the interminable “aw” sounds.

I had only told my two closest friends because I knew that after how they reacted, I didn't think that I could take any more “I'm so sorry for you” faces. The day went on as usual and eventually, an image of my normal teenage life had appeared. When I went back to my new home, the hotel, I fell back into the feelings of shock and sadness that I had felt earlier that day. In one night, I had left a three story farm house for a one bedroom hotel room. The size didn't mater much to me. It was only after opening the cupboards of the kitchenette and realizing that they were fully empty, as well as the bathroom ones, that the feeling of shock came back. We had no money, no food and not even a tooth brush to our names. “We need to do something about this” Hannah said while bitting her lip once again. “But how?” I thought to myself, how could we do something about “this”? I had then realized that my everyday belongings had become these things that I dreamt about having after being costumed to having them for so many years.

Hannah and I decided to talk to my school about our situation, since we were both teenagers without any money. I didn't have a job and Hannah was working as an intern for her school, and therefore wasn't payed. Once again, I had to go through the “I'm so sorry” face from the principal while Hannah explained what had happen to us. “I'd never put a man before my kids.” she said while rolling her eyes and slowly opening up a drawer from her desk. She then pulled out a little, white business card and slid it through her desk all the way to Hannah. “Call this woman, she'll help you a lot with what you are going through.” she said whispering; as if we were sharing secrets or as if the wrong person was listening to our conversation.

What she had handed us was actually the phone number to a different school district's social worker. “Pathetic.” I thought. It was hard for me to comprehend how we went from an “ok” family to what we had now. How can a mom pick between her own blood and flesh and her lover? I still don't understand.  I probably never will.

“So what exactly happened and when did this all start?” she asked us. Once again, Hannah had started to repeat the same words she had told my principal the day before. Our social worker's name was Ms. Morel. I've always wondered why a woman would choose to put “Ms.” in front of her last name.Why not just simply “Miss” or “Mrs.”? She was in her mid twenties and I could tell from the little glass cats on her desk as well as the fuzzy pink pens she was writing with that she was lodged between the two biggest stages of her life; being a girl and a woman. She was the reflection of a woman stuck in the middle of things. 

“Bella?” my mind had gone elsewhere before she had repeated my name that second time. “How do you feel about all this?” she asked with the face I dreaded. “Well, I don't really know how I feel to be honest with you.” The thing is, I don't think that she could understand how my sister and I could feel. The first reason of why she couldn't was that because, well, I didn't understand how I felt myself. Second reason is that just like my friends, and my principal, she had set herself up to failing to understand me by putting up that face, instead of having a clear and emotionless mind, that wasn't filled with pity for us. 

Eventually, she set Hannah up with “emergency grants” that were given from the government to young adults with a desperate need of money and that stayed in school. Slowly, our new home started to look more homely. The more we filled our small abode with food and necessities, the more my mind cleared up, and eventually I knew how I felt. I once heard someone say that there are different stages that a person goes through when one of their close one dies. What died in my case was the relationship I had with my mother. It was pretty clear for me at that point that I dealt with the “shock” and “denial” stages and had started the “anger” one.

Ms. Morel set up a meeting with my mom the next day and eventually I received a phone call from her. “She doesn't deny anything she did so that's a good start.” “Wow. What a dumb cunt.” I thought to myself. Why wouldn't she deny it? She had just walked into the lion's den on purpose. Maybe she felt bad but I didn't think that she was capable of that. What I thought was right--a few days later I had received my first email from her since the day we left. The email was full of accusations and it was obvious that she didn't feel bad for us. The truth is, my mother wasn't probably smart enough to understand that it would've been better for her to lie.

I remember all the stories my dad would tell me after they divorced. He'd tell me how much she used to read, how they'd play scrabble together, and that she'd always win even though english wasn't her native language. The truth is that my mom is the kind of woman who follows her men. She read books because my dad did. My step-dad listened to techno music, so she did. And maybe she wasn't smart at that time because well, my step-dad wasn't. I don't blame her for having a simple mind but I do blame her for having the wrong priorities in her life. She was the kind of mother to buy christmas presents but not wrap them. To buy diapers for her baby but not change them. You get the idea. She never put in the  what I call “parental effort”. The efforts you do; not because you want to but because you love your children and would do anything for them, regardless of what you want.

And of course, I knew that I wasn't the best daughter in this universe either and that she had the right to put me back in order at times, just like in any parent-child relationship. The only thing wrong about that was that she expected me to be respectful towards her while herself being disrespectful to me. “Why are you disrespectful towards me but not to your dad?” she'd ask me at times. I'd answer with a “I don't know” but deep down I knew that I couldn't be respectful to woman who called me “bitch” or “stupid” to my face.

The hotel life had started to grow on me after a while and eventually, I had gotten used to it. After two weeks I knew the names of most of the staff there and some of the residents. “They're all the same to me, look at them running around and breaking things. They should go back to their country.” Clement said after lighting his cigarette. Clement was Hannah's co-worker. Almost every night at around 8, he, Hannah and I, would hang out in the hotel courtyard for their evening break. Clement was a simple man in his early twenties, had two little stars tattooed on his left hand and liked saying racist things towards the Syrian kids staying in the hotel. He himself, was the perfect definition of the French “white trash”. 

“You know that we were born in America and that we are immigrants too right?” Hannah said with a confused tone in her voice. “Yeah, but you're different. You guys are cool and you can speak english.” He said, with a smile on his face. At the time, the average french person started growing hatred for foreigners after the “Charlie Hebdo” attacks in Paris. What most people didn't understand was that it had nothing to do with any individuals, and that Islam didn't equal terrorism. But, with the consumer's purchasing power going down and taxes raising, people had to find their scape goat. I could tell that Hannah was ticked off by his answer with the way she rolled her eyes. She didn't bother saying anything against what he had said because Clement also believed that Bush did 9/11 so she knew that he was the kind of guy that you couldn't contradict because he'd always have an answer to everything, even towards the most absurd things.

I wasn't surprised that Hannah didn't say anything. My sister is the kind of girl who never gets angry at anyone or anything, or at least doesn't show it if she is. When all of this happened a year ago with my mother, she was of course upset, but like I said before, she didn't show it--not like I did. Hannah actually kept a very civil relationship with my mother, even up to today. Both occasionally message each other with the most superficial attitude one can have. The only difference is that Hannah knows that she is being fake with my mother, but my mom hasn't realize yet that she is too. I can't be fake with my mother, that's a flaw I have.Whenever I start feeling sad about loosing her every now and then, and start writing her an email, I always stop half way through and realize that I don't actually ever want a relationship with her again and that I don't forgive her for what she had done to my sister and I.

I don't know why I would think about contacting her every now and then. Maybe just knowing that I had a mother, a good or bad one, seemed like the kind of “normal” structure I wanted. After having to leave the family house, I unconsciously searched for a new mother figure. The first motherly figure I encountered were the ladies that served us free food at the school cafeteria that the principal payed for out of the school's budget. Jasmine was my favorite lady out of all of them. She was aware of my situation, and would always scream through out the whole cafeteria, while all 400 kids were eating, and asked me precisely, if I wanted some more pasta. And I'd usually reply, screaming too, with a “Thanks Jasmine, but I'm good!”

Jasmine had become my new Moroccan mama. Every day, she'd remind me “Bella, it doesn't matter if I'm doing the ramadan, you know that you can always come by and i'll cook for you, okay? You know the address, just come by whenever.” with an almost angry tone to her voice. She was the kind of woman who was proud of where she came from and wasn't scared to show it. I could see in her sad eyes at times that the reason why she liked me so much was because she had gone through the same experiences that I did in life. She'd always tell me “Don't worry, it gets better.” or “I understand what you're going through, honey.”. All the other women were also extremely kind with me and I felt like their attitude was just rooted in their culture; they were kind to anyone who needed help.""

4mfwck,4,2016-06-03,Trying to figure out what a support system is when you have depression,nightshow,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/4mfwck/trying_to_figure_out_what_a_support_system_is/,"I'm not proud to admit that I've had depression in varying levels for the past 14 years. I also wouldn't say I had a very good childhood, in part because of it.

Family is the foundation that we're built upon, at least according to sociology. Makes sense, they're the first people we get to know, learn to live with, and the first people we depend on for survival.

Today, my family isn't around. Siblings have their own lives, parents as well (divorced), and I could not live with them anyway. I was homeless for a few months in 2010 because my parents threw me out. I don't know why I remember that episode as a ""traumatic"" versus the independence it forced me to find. I will admit that I was no prize child, I don't blame them.

I've had a few friends here and there but nothing big. I know you don't need a big group of friends to have support. My friends do have their own lives; significant others/families, jobs, the whole adulting thing. I have a job too (at least for now). I don't see or talk to them as often as I would like, but I respect their lives over mine. I do struggle with a sleep disorder on top of everything else, and I found it interesting when hanging with friends my sleep got better (evidence is from last summer).

Anyway, one person says that I always say that yet it's not true. So I decided to come here and ask, ""what constitutes as a support system?""

I hate the fact that I come home to an empty apartment, that I can literally go days without ever getting a phone call, and that I'm lucky if I see any of the aforementioned friends once a month. I'm also ""touched deprived"" which probably doesn't make thing better (so virtual hugs are welcome). How does one make an accurate judgment if they haven't seen a ""depressed"" person consistently over time?

I *thought* I did everything I could do. I went to college (commuted) and got a degree. I tried joining groups. I talked to classmates, just never was able to bring a ""friendship"" out of the classroom. I participated in some theater events. I've tried scoping out churches in my area. I've tried the meet shady people online for chemistry purposes route (no insult to anyone who has met partners that way, my hats off to you guys; I have not been so lucky and I accept that). Volunteer experiences. Internship. My job.

After all that, plus the struggles that I went through to try to keep moving forward; well, I just don't want to live anymore. It's an awful feeling I wouldn't wish anyone to have. I'm told I'm wrong for wanting to punch my own ticket. I'm just tired of fighting a losing battle."
4mg2ht,2,2016-06-03,3 Daily Responsibilities for Social Media Managers,joshcoastalcreation,smallbusiness,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/4mg2ht/3_daily_responsibilities_for_social_media_managers/,"
http://coastal-creation.com/2016/05/3-daily-responsibilities-for-all-social-media-managers/

Social Media Managers – an increasingly important and expanding position in many businesses. Similarly to the introduction of social networking to the world, social media management seemingly appeared out of nowhere and, before long, became a mainstay for Generation Y and Millennial business owners.

While the Baby Boomers and Generation Xers have not been as keen on the addition of social media managers, many have noticed the positive impact they have on their businesses brand visibility and brand awareness. This has eventually led to many Baby Boomer and Generation X business owners to invest in social media managers.

Of course, there are still several thousand of these older business owners that show absolutely no interest in social media, and prefer to stick with traditional forms of advertising – such as “word of mouth”.

Their skepticism generally lies in a lack of understanding on the subject, which is perfectly reasonable – what exactly do social media managers do? The chances are, at some point, you have felt skepticism on the need for social media managers. How important could posting and tweeting really be?

In my second year of college, I had been accepted for an internship position. Upon reviewing the job posting, I noticed that this posting was for a social media manager. With no prior knowledge, and an inherent skepticism on the topic, how would I succeed in this position?

Below are 3 Daily Responsibilities for Social Media Managers, which only scratches the surface. This information was gathered from my experience during my internship at mortgagestogo.ca (visit: facebook.com/motogoca), as well as my day to day responsibilities as the Head of Marketing for CoastalCreation Media &amp; Design. Let’s get started!

1) Being plugged in 24/7

At first glance, that may seem like an impossible task. In theory, it is. But with the right tools, and understanding, being plugged in to your clients social media accounts at all times is doable.

Posting and tweeting are the first things to figure out. Thankfully, Hootsuite provides excellent scheduling tools for posts. In many cases, I find myself scheduling posts 2 to 3 weeks in advance (with the exception of important updates that come from time to time). This enables me to focus on the most difficult task: staying constantly available.

The reason for staying available is to be able to answer all customer questions being asked, via social media. If a message goes unanswered, that likely can result in a lost potential client. Or worse, this lack of communication could aggravate the client into saying something harmful to the corresponding business, and post about it publicly.

But wait – how is being available 24/7 even possible? In the early &amp; slow stages, having your phone on at all times is essential and the best way to stay available. However, when managing multiple accounts for multiple clients, the only way to efficiently be available to your clients is to hire an assistant. Failure to do so would likely result in a decline in attention to detail, the quality of posts, and an eventual loss in ROI.

2) Posting, Content Creation, and Social Timing

These may be the most important parts of a social media managers job. Without posts, social accounts are empty vassals without content. Like I had mentioned above, scheduling tools for posts do exist, which does make publishing posts and tweets much more streamlined. However, the creating of post content, and knowing when to post it, is where things get tricky.

As mentioned in our previous blog “When is the Best Time to Tweet?” we discussed the science of social timing and why it is vital. Posting and tweeting randomly will achieve nothing for your business; as the social media manager, you will need to market research to find what your target audience actually wants to see, and when they want to see it. That can get as specific to which hashtags are used, to which photos are used, to even how a post is structured. Take a look at this:


You will notice the use of hashtags, photos, and a URL link. This, so far, is our most engaged with tweet. How did we achieve this? Simply by paying special attention to how well previous tweets have preformed, when they preformed the best, and how the tweets looked. Making a good post doesn’t happen overnight; it takes troubleshooting, research, and fresh ideas. Take a look at one of CoastalCreation’s first tweets, which was published without any regard to content or timing:


Not nearly as much engagement as our best tweet. However, through trial and error, us at CoastalCreation were able to grow &amp; understand our social better, which resulted in more successful posts. By testing posts and researching your businesses target audience, you will be able to improve your post engagement over time. Which leads us to our last equally as important topic….

3) Frequently Engaging with your Followers, Fans, and Target Audience

While being plugged in 24/7 &amp; posting correctly is vital to maintain and build your brands social presence, actually taking the time to engage with your followers is what really sells your brand on social; it shows a desire to speak to your clients, and that your business cares.

The fastest way to build a following on Twitter and Instagram (for example) is by rapidly following your target audience. For example, us at CoastalCreation target small business owners and entrepreneurs. Therefore, when growing our Twitter and Instagram, we searched for &amp; followed as many accounts that we could find that met that category. The fastest way to do this is to find out what your target audience is, and narrow it down to a hashtag; #smallbusiness or #entrepreneur , or #startup. Then, search that hashtag in your search bar and, like magic, you are presented with thousands of social accounts using that hashtag.

Pro tip: When your business is growing at the beginning, follow all those who follow you back. This will increase the chances of them continuing to follow you. However, down the line, your business should strive to have a higher Follower count over Following count. 

Be careful, though – building a following can not be achieved by simply following. You actually need to engage with your followers, and those who you want to follow. This is as simple as liking and commenting on Instagram photos, or favoriting and retweeting your target audience’s tweets. Watch out – being spammy with engagement can cause annoyance to many. So, be aware of how often you like one accounts content. A good rule of thumb that CoastalCreation has found to work is to like and comment on 1-2 posts per user you that you are targeting. After doing that, move on to another account. Before long, you will have engaged with hundreds of different accounts, which will likely result in them engaging (or following!) your business.

Pro tip: Public engagement is what every one wants, as it displays it to their followers. Instead of direct messaging an account, try commenting or replying instead! You will very likely get a response back, which will be an excellent indirect promotion for your brand! 

Conclusion

Whether your business is needing to build your social presence, or create one from scratch, having a social media manager is extremely important. Without it, no attention would be paid to client questions, the timing of posts, or content creation.

While many entrepreneurs take it on themselves to run their own social media, this requires a very strong understanding on the subject for it to work, and they likely would already have additional help. Moreover, the business would have to be relatively small, as a larger business (example: H&amp;M, McDonalds, Starbucks) would have very large followings, and would require a dedicated individual, or individuals, to social media management.

If you are a business owner, musician, or other entrepreneur, the chances are that you are very busy. Therefore, sufficient social media management is unlikely; you simply do not have the time. That is why our team at CoastalCreation recommends the hiring of a social media manager.

We offer rates entirely in regard to your budget, and will offer a customized package that will fit your business best. We will work directly with you to strategize, create content, and design advertisements.

4mgdgx,3,2016-06-03,When to take cs summer school considering co-op,ILikeMyWineWhite,UBC,https://www.reddit.com/r/UBC/comments/4mgdgx/when_to_take_cs_summer_school_considering_coop/,"Hola!

So I'm a 3rd year comp sci student who failed cs 213 last term. My plan for summer was to go back to China for internship, but I'm starting to wonder if it's better to take 213 summer school now and get it over with. The tricky part is that I'll be doing co-op next year, so depending on the offer I may be occupied for the next sumemr as well.

This summer's 213 course currently have **84 people** on waitlist.

So

1. Is there any chacne of me getting in to 213 this summer this late? I know the faculty is short-handed, but I'm wondering if my 3rd year standing have any effect on bumping up my waitlist (since they take this into account https://www.cs.ubc.ca/students/undergrad/courses/waitlists)

2. If I can't get in for this summer, is it wise to take 213 next summer by only accepting 8 month offer for a co-op? I'm not sure how strict employers are on how long co-op terms should be. 

3. tabs or spaces? (if you watch Silicon Valley)

Apologies in advance if this belongs better in Megathread"

**Age:**   20

**Resources/Assets:** Her family got a good net worth, and she's never without a buck or two.


**Species/Race:**  Candy Girl


**Physical Description:** [This](http://i.imgur.com/Ca00n8F.png)


**Mentality:**  Sugar, is a very rambunctious, slutty, charismatic girl. Sugar enjoys the company of people, but she lives for food. Sugar indulges in sweets. Even though she's young, she's intelligent and isn't afraid to show her opinion. She has a low attention span, which means that you have to explain things quickly or she'll fall asleep.

**Backstory:** Sugar was born in a fairly large city, known for its art, culture, and music. Her mother was a stay at home mom who made her children a priority (insert was a helicopter mom.) Sugar's father worked hard at his nine to five office job but tried to live vicariously through his children. With two opposing parenting styles always battling each other Sugar tried to take both as seriously as she could, but generally ended up siding with her father. Free spirited and usually regarded as a slacker, Sugar managed to graduate from her high school with average grades. She accepted a summer internship since it seemed like a good idea at the time and it slightly wasn't. She got turn into a candy girl and is dealing with her new life


**In-Character Reputation:** Marcus and friends know her but outside of that none


---


**Proposed Tier:** 3  

**Powers:** 

Candy Physiology: She is made of candy with a single solid core. She can effectively manipulate her form any way she wants as long as she stays in one piece. She needs no food, drink, or sleep (though she psychosomatically chooses to do them) and cannot die from bleeding, decapitation, or most other things that would kill someone. She can turn herself into any mundane candy, but when in the form of any non-goopy candies cannot manipulate her shape, just move herself. Her ""weak point"" so to speak is a 1"" tall and wide cartoon heart. She can move it around in her body, but it is her greatest weak point. If it is destroyed, she will die, and if it is wounded or even struck moderately hard (even a moderate-strength punch might work) then she is knocked out while it slowly repairs itself. Speaking of, her candy slowly regenerates itself too, and she can ""burn off"" her candy body for energy when she is running low.

Her other main power is the ability to convert matter into candy, this power has varying time and energy requirements depending on what she is trying to convert based on many factors. If a person or object is protected against magic, it can't be turned into candy.If a person or object isn't entirely turned into candy, it will slowly turn back to normal given enough time This also allows her to keep her candy body together in unfavorable circumstances. Namely, she can absorb candy to repair herself and can resist being dissolved by acids. The numbers behind her power usage can be found below: 

She has %100 ""energy"" for her powers usually, plus an extra %100 percent possible from burning off bits of her body (assuming she is fully formed and rested). Normal candification of something non-durable enough that a normal human could break it or rip it apart with their bare hands is %1 for 1 cubic foot for 1 second, durability would is multiplier based on what average tier would be able to break it with their bare hands (for example, some super material only a T4 could break with their bare hands, that's 4x energy and time), any magical items are a 2x, protection magic specifically is an additional 5x, sentience is 4x, biologicalness is 3x, having enough energy that it is dangerous to human contact flowing through it is 2x. These multipliers stack additively (a 2x and a 5x makes a 7x for example), making candying some objects very hard. Repairing her body is a straight percentage out of how much is destroyed in a way that it's no longer ""candy"" or is reduced to some piece below a 1cm cube of volume (so for example, if she turns into hard candy and part of her is crushed into dust, it no longer counts as ""her""). So, if you melt off 10% of her body mass, it would take 10% of her energy to repair it. Candy makes this cheaper and quicker, having enough candy in the area to repair it makes it cost 1/10 the energy to ""absorb"" that candy, raw sugar is much weaker, only 1/2ing the energy cost. She can reattach removed body parts with no energy needed as long as they are not ""destroyed"" as per the earlier description. Resisting dissolving depends on what is dissolving her, it takes about 1 point every 5 minutes of full submersion for every point below neutral pH (7) the liquid is, for example she would spend 6% of her energy every 5 minutes she spent submerged in stomach acid, which has a pH of 1, to resist dissolving. She regains about 100% energy over the course of a full 24 hours, meaning that if she was totally reduced to just her core with 0 energy (and for some reason wasn't then destroyed) it would take her 2 days to be back to full strength.

**Resources /Equipment:**  Candy. Loads of candy. Oh, and her smartphone.

**Miscellaneous Skills:** Good pole dancer and very flexible

**Strength:** each 1""^2 area ""tendon"" of her candy has the strength of a full-grown trained man, able to lift a bit about 200 pounds. This makes her rather strong, when in her normal human form she can lift almost a ton over her head, a fair amount more if she swaps to a different form.

**Movement:**  She can run at about 40mph max in human form, if she were to move more efficiently by becoming a candy blob and sliding around she would reach at least 80mph

**Defense:** Her candy is surprisingly tough, more so than normal candy. More elastic or traditionally weaker candies are slightly less than the strength of gold, too hard for a normal human to harm but easily ripped and cut by superhumans. Hard candies are as tough as steel, but more brittle. Her core is very tough, it would take a direct artillery strike to really *damage* it, but anything more than a strong punch directly to it will cause it to ""panic"", making her pass out. Repairing from any damage at all takes energy equal to over 200% her normal amount, meaning that repairing real damage takes several days of rest. If it is ever cracked in half or damaged that much, she will die no matter what, and high damage below that can cause her to become comatose. 

**Perception/Awareness:** She can see from any attached point of her body, but otherwise has human senses.

**Fighting Ability:** She has no training whatsoever, but is beginning to be trained so that may change soon.

**Danger:**  She is rather dangerous with both her ability to turn things into candy, her raw strength, and her ability to attack in unconventional shapes (for example, turning into many thin strands and either cutting someone or restraining them).

**Weaknesses:** Being melt-able and super flammable, dissolving easily if she doesn't use powers to keep herself together in some fluids, small children,  etc. While her core can move, it gives off a powerful heat and energy signature that can be found and targeted."
4mgy0e,1,2016-06-04,My GF [20 F] caught me [20 M] off guard with the suggestion that we go on a break,Epilecstasy,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4mgy0e/my_gf_20_f_caught_me_20_m_off_guard_with_the/,"My girlfriend and I have been together for almost 2 years now. She used to have a problem with distance, breaking down in tears missing me even if it was just a month we were physically apart. She's done better with distance since then, as we've been thousands of miles apart for months at a time. 

We've talked about life after graduation and we were both planning on being with each other for the long run. She would bring up marriage a lot more than I ever would, I imagined growing old with her but I never directly said ""marriage"" or ""wedding"", maybe because I didn't want to jinx anything or add pressure to the relationship, I have more of a go-with-the-flow attitude toward things. She likes to have a more definite plan for the future.

Anyway, we're at different internships this summer, a bit too far to visit for a weekend. During her internship, she's living with some family that she hasn't gotten to see in a while. She values spending time with family and has mentioned numerous times that she wants to move back to be with her little brother, at least until he graduates high school. We have a bit of an East Coast vs. West Coast debate that we get into, but I always viewed those as lighthearted. She will end up graduating before me, and I knew I was gonna find a job wherever she ended up (no shortage of demand in my line of work).

She's been staying with her aunt and uncle for about a week now and she's telling me how she loves her job, how it's great that she definitely knows this is the right career path for her, and I'm excited for her. She even mentioned something about extending the duration of her internship, and I say it's a great idea, it'd be more money and more experience. She later tosses me a hard curveball, she says that she doesn't think our futures align as much as we thought, and that she doesn't want me to have to compromise my career for her, and that we're still young, and she doesn't want to feel like she burdening me, and that having a boyfriend makes her closed off when meeting new people. 

Now the last part I get, I know I tend to draw it back when meeting new girls because I don't want anyone to get the wrong idea. I'm trying to tell her how I want to make that compromise for her, because I love her and want to be with her, but she tells me that she thinks we should try taking a break, that 6 months is a long time to spend apart, that her cousins took a break for a year and a half but now they're happily married. 

She still wants to be friends though, just not in a romantic relationship. Because we are best friends. So I'm humoring her. I'd rather be able to have a phone call a day than completely be cut off. But talking as friends is pretty limiting and I'm hurting inside. Text conversations are usually one word responses by her. 

She said she doesn't know how to feel or what she wants but she wants to try this ""break"" thing. I didn't have any doubts about our relationship before, but I'm definitely worried now. I don't want to be too pushy with insisting we be romantic again, but I also don't want to watch this relationship fade away (if that's likely). I'm just trying to be respectful and understanding, and cooperate with her as much as I can to hopefully show her that we're better off together. But as each day goes by, I become more worried that we might not be.

I just don't know where all of this came from. And I don't know what to do (or what not to do) to make it through this.

(A SIDE NOTE) Her friend did this same thing about two months ago with her boyfriend while she was at an internship and things got pretty ugly (but she suddenly had a fling with another guy right after they broke things off). I condemned her actions but my girlfriend seemed to take her side. 


TL;DR: Relationship going great, we take internships in different states, suddenly she wants a break (but to still talk as platonic friends). I'm really struggling with this and I feel like it's hurting me more than it is her, is there a way I can safely restore our relationship? "
4mh0pm,1,2016-06-04,"College Student From Eastern (too close to Detroit,MI) Michigan University. Looking to move out of state for internship, freelance, art, developing, and gaming jobs. Thank you",Chrieux,gameDevClassifieds,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameDevClassifieds/comments/4mh0pm/college_student_from_eastern_too_close_to/,"Hi, my name of Jalin Howard and I'm on the brink of destruction. A year ago I made my first mobile game my junior year of college at Eastern Michigan University. It's always been a dream of mine and when it finally happened it felt the same. After that I flipped my car five times in the winter coming off of the freeway. This damaged my GPA, and also left me bedridden for a semester. I had two black eyes until the beginning of the summer which gave me the time and patients to sit down and develop my second game. I'm from Detroit, MI right in the epicenter of madness and its hard for people to understand what I do. No one around has done anything like this from my neighborhood. I don't know anyone who has their own game and I'm on my second. In Detroit there is a huge grey area, and it can leave you lost. There are wrong turns everywhere, I've made it out of that grey area and I know I want to make games for the rest of my life. This is my passion I'm an artist I've taken figure study classes, and painting classes, and I hope to market myself along with my games. The first game I can remember playing is VectorMan on Sega, hence my beginning with platform games. I have character, the reason I'm on the brink of destruction is because I have mowed lawns for five years to survive in college. I won't cut grass another day of my life I promise you that. I'm a Computer Science Major and Art Minor I know Java, Html, C/C++, JavaScript, and a couple other earlier programming languages I'm also black. I say this because in the couple of internship interviews I have had for creative positions that has really out shined my talent. It's sort of the elephant in the room and I'm not pulling the race card it's just Michigan is a state for building cars. While it may seem to be a booming field (Computer Science) I don't feel as if these positions are fairly given in the state I'm in. I would love to go to Silicon Valley or anywhere else for that matter and pitch my million app ideas, all the while creating and marketing my own games. Help me get out of Detroit because we're crabs in a barrel here, I have a gift and summers are not too safe for young African american Detroiters.

4mh8ps,7,2016-06-04,Introduction and request: how to diet without being miserable,SomeOne10113,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/4mh8ps/introduction_and_request_how_to_diet_without/,"Hello all,

A brief introduction to me. I'm a 5'6"" 23 YO female mechanical engineering student (AKA unless I'm asleep I'm working). I m also clinically depressed and managing it with meds. I don't smoke, I drink some but not much (3/ week generally), no drugs, but I love food. Unsurprisingly, I love food that's bad for me.

Because I'm a student I'm stressed a lot and because I'm depressed, I need coping mechanisms. Toward that end I turn to food. I'm on a break from school to do an internship for the next four months (in already been there two) and I just weighed myself for the first time in months. I'm up to 175. My weight goes from 155 on a good stretch and has maxed out at 180 so obviously something needs to change, but I don't know how.

I try to diet but then give up because I get stressed and I need *something*. Dieting actually makes the stress worse because I have another set of numbers and variables to worry about. While I've been at my internship I've tried to eat tolerably well but obviously I'm failing at that. 

So how can I successfully diet and maintain without just being miserable?"

I've worked in support 2nd-line, no previous experience in the field.

Went to school and among other classes where a month long CCNA-course where I fell in love with networking :). Took my 8 weeks internship (it's required by the school) at the same company my CCNA-teacher works as an consultant. Got some experience over his shoulder. Bought VIRL and started practicing.

Because of other courses in school I had limited time to study so I really only got in to it, reading and doing practice exams from the Cisco CCNA book by Wendell, on Monday and did the exam Friday. So I'm happy about my score, considering the amount of time I had :).

Just wanted to thank you guys, all the resources I used from here and posts I've read helping me along the way was invaluable. 
Thank you, and to others who are thinking about taking the leap. Get som practice, do labs, then do some more labs. And really understand subnetting and route-summarizing. And set a date, book the test so there is a deadline.

Good luck everyone :D

4mhqze,1,2016-06-04,F4M - Celebrity wins hot vacation,[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/4mhqze/f4m_celebrity_wins_hot_vacation/,"""By ""raffle"", I won a trip to special vacation resort. This resort is unique because it’s ONLY for couples and no one seems to know much about it, as people who won tickets have to sign nondisclosure agreements. But the rumor is that it’s really great, and most importantly one of the most exclusive in the world. I really want to do that trip, but have nobody to go with, so I ""catch"" you and drag you into it so I can go.

In that resort, a lot of activities are organised for couples. We quickly discover that some are mild, and some aren't at all. Romantic dinners, massage lessons with other couples or just the two of us, sexy cooking lessons, but also more kinky ones. Moreover, some employees can give dares to couples every time they see them, from kiss and grope each other right here (“here” being anywhere from an empty corridor public places)or skinny dipping to have sex in that place without getting caught (or make sure you do get caught by somebody). Each couple can choose anytime between 3 categories and activities and dare at the beginning of the day, but won’t know any details until they start. You can be an employee or a fan, or some rich friend and you have to act like your bf. At the beginning You'd probably kind of shy/nervous because of all of this, hanging out and pretending to be with THAT celeb's boyfriend. On my side I'm having a blast, enjoying myself and keeping us from all the things you'd love to try.

And from here, the scenario can go differen ways depending on what you want to do, your kinks &amp; limits… So let’s discuss it

Do youstart to enjoy yourselfself and we both start to take part is more and more daring activities? Do you figure out that you can take advantage of the situation, start to get more and more touchy every time you can? Trying to get us into the hottest activities, and if I refuse to play along threaten to expose us as a fake couple? Or maybe you start to even blackmail me after getting some serious leverage, and get me to do everything you want.

LOTS of possibilities, with either a young celeb and an older employee, assistant, agent... Or an older one with the new intern or some fan she randomly picked, I'm open to suggestions !

Celebrities : Candice Patton (The Flash) - Natalie Dormer, Emilia Clarke, Sophie Turner (GoT) - Lauren Cohan (TWD) - Willa Holland (Arrow) - Chloë Grace Moretz (Kick Ass) - Evangeline Lilly (Lost) - Emma Watson, Scarlett Johansson (Never heard of them ? Seriously?) - Lucy Liu (Kill Bill) - Cobie Smulders (HIMYM) - Penélope Cruz (Vanilla Sky) - Rosario Dawson, Jessica Alba (Sin City) - Olga Kurylenko (Quantum of Solace) - Blake Lively (Green Lantern) - Kate Beckinsale (Underworld) - McKayla Maroney (Gymnast) - Natalie Alyn Lind (Gotham) - Alexis Ren (Model)- Your suggestion?

Kinklist : https://i.imgur.com/rGavWgZ.png

I'm also open to other stories involving celebrities, but I'm looking for something original :)

4migb9,2,2016-06-04,"Me [26F] with my Bf [25 M] of 1 year, feeling neglected lately",sholmes221b,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4migb9/me_26f_with_my_bf_25_m_of_1_year_feeling/,"My bf and I have been together for 1 year this month. We've had our ups and downs. For the better part of the year he was away at law school so we were long distance and making it work through facetime calls. This is my first relationship and I've had my screw ups (I've been needy in the past) but we worked out the kinks together to better accommodate each other.

I like to think I've been an awesome gf. I visited him twice in the last year for a week each time. Each trip cost me around 2-3,000 dollars. I don't care, I love him and want to see him. Each semester during finals I send him a care package which he gushed about. He can be sort of moody but during those times I just back off and he usually comes around back to me and everything is fine.

The problem is, he's home now for the summer. He made a promise to see me at least once a week, which shouldn't be difficult since he has no job or internship and lives 10 mins away. The first week he saw me about 4 times, all at night unless we were hanging with his family. 

The second week, we had a problem. I was on my period (which means I'm extra sensitive) and he was dealing with major family stress. He withdrew from me and I started feeling like he might have a problem beyond his stress with me. I would ask if I upset him and he'd say no and I dropped it. Well, on Thursday of that week (which was last week) I went to a convention and I bought him some gifts just to make him happy cause they made me think of him. When I got home and messaged him that I bought him something, it turned into a 3 hour long text rant from him. The first hour devoted to his anger at me which basically boiled down to him feeling jealous of my family (we are renovating our house which makes it seem like we are rolling in cash. We aren't. His family is having major financial issues, the magnitude of which I wasn't aware of until he ranted, wherein he's worried about putting food on the table and losing the house). He basically was blaming me for all the things he couldn't control in his life, and he realized this. The second hour was him beating himself up mostly for not being able to help his family more. The third hour he swung back at me telling me he really disliked me and that if he didn't love me he'd hate me. I told him ""I know"" because I understood his feelings at the time. I told him if he wanted to hate me then he could hate me if it made him feel better. He said he didn't want to but I was ""standing in his way"". When I asked what that meant he told me I was pissing him off by being neutral during his rant and that I wasn't letting him rage. Basically I think he was looking for a fight I wasn't willing to give because I was devoted to understanding his feelings.

He calmed down and it sort of came out that he felt guilty. He's more of a giver than a receiver and he hadn't even gotten anything for my birthday last month. I told him all I wanted was his time and love. He noted that he hasn't even been giving me his time lately. I told him I understood he was busy and that he had been giving his love. He said ""really? Because I've been pissed for the past week"". I asked if he had stopped loving me and he replied that he hadn't but he damn sure wanted to. The conversation dwindled into something light hearted but I of course have had it weighing on me. 

He didn't talk to me that Friday. Apologized for his lack of communication on Saturday and asked if I wanted to come over Sunday. We had a good night together watching tv with his family and he basically hints that I should leave at 1:30 am. I thought I was staying so I was visibly disappointed. At the door we kiss and say good night and because I was frustrated (sexually) and tired I wrongfully said, ""You know, a lot of guys would feel lucky to have me as a gf."" I was feeling unappreciated. He just told me to text him when I got home. I did. And he texts me saying that he was bothered by that comment. That ""lucky"" means that his luck could possibly run out (meaning I might leave him). And that he doesn't think he likes that thought. I told him I was sorry for saying it and being a bitch. That I love him and will be with him as long as he'll have me. He said he understands I was just frustrated. He told me he hopes I do know he actually appreciates me. Honestly...I don't know that. I don't feel it at all. He has still barely talked to me all week in text. I asked if he thought we'd see each other before saturday (today. I bought us tickets to an event that I knew he'd die to go to. It cost me $300. I bought it as an anniversary present for us) and he said he did think we would. The next day, this past Thursday, I said I hope I can see him soon since he made no move to arrange a time. He tells me that Saturday isn't but a day and some change away. OK...awesome. So we aren't going to see each other?

I know all of that was long. I just have nobody to talk to about this. I don't want to add more stress to him because I know he's drowning in it but it kills me to see that when he isn't helpng his family, he spends all of his time on xbox live playing games. I love him so much and, while he tells me he loves me everyday, it just feels like he could take or leave me. When we're together it's perfect but...I feel like he never wants to see me. I want to bring this up to him but I don't know how to do it without seeming needy based on my past neediness. I don't want to accuse or attack him because I know he'll shut down the conversation immediately if he feels against the wall. Please help!



   
**tl;dr**: Bf is under a lot of stress and is pulling away. Worried he doesn't want me as much as I want him, despite what he says. I rant and am longwinded about the past month's contributing factors"
4mijpa,4,2016-06-04,"I [23M] used to be a jerk to my Girlfriend(?) [21 F] of 2 years until I owned up to my mistakes, now she just yells at me all the time..",BernTheBurn,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4mijpa/i_23m_used_to_be_a_jerk_to_my_girlfriend_21_f_of/,"Hello anyone who read this. First time poster. 6 month lurker so I'm still fairly new. I'm not even entirely sure where to begin or how to start because I've never asked for help or posted even on my real account (last time i checked i had 1 link karma and 15 comment karma) so please be patient with me... I'll start with a backstory then go into mini chapters beginning with her Family

Me and my girlfriend have been dating for almost 2 years. We ended up breaking up because I was constantly drinking and angry and she felt she wasn't making me happy anymore. She may have been partially true if I'm being honest with myself. But I didn't care because deep down it wasn't such a hopeless pit of dispair that I wanted to break up. I would have rather worked through things and avoided conflict that stirs up now because of the break up. But anyways after the break up it seemed like nothing changed. We still slept in the same bed, still texted every single day, usual college romance stuff I guess. We just didn't call each other boyfriend and girlfriend but to avoid random drama she tells her family we are still boyfriend and girlfriend, which I am perfectly fine with. But once it gets closer for her to graduate college, this is where things start to get a little different.

Her Family

Her family, never liked me from the beginning. I've heard things like ""hes going to cost you your internship, your relationship with your family, he only wants sex from you (which me and her decided to not have sex until marriage and after 2 years the most we've done is hand stuff and oral). Her family even goes as far as to say that me and her don't even really love each other, its just infatuation. And my favorite thing they've said ""you can't date him because he is black"" which i feel this is where most of the hating of me comes from. They find any excuse to stir up drama and run my name through the mud. The bitter sweet part of this all is, is that ""becky"" knows they are like this. I try to tell her to stand up to her family, but she says things like ""I want things easy"", or ""I don't want to cause any drama with my family"". She says that she knows her family doesn't respect her and it upsets me that she chooses to do everything that pleases them at the expense of us fighting and never seeing each other... Since shes an hour away at her grandmother's because of her internship I can't show her that NONE of this is easy for me, and she says she realizes that her family is ""difficult"" but gets mad whenever I try to tell her THATS part of the reason why we have been having drama. I offer to get her a hotel so we can spend time together away from her family and just try to relax, Becky refuses because she says she needs a stove and oven and stuff to make lunch and breakfast for her internship in the morning...and shes worried about the cost (which I said I would pay for). I try to convince her to stay at my place on a different night where there will be a stove and itll be free, and we'll be alone, but she says that will cause drama with her grandmother to leave for a night. I tell her to just lie and make up an excuse (which she has done before just a week before I asked her to come spend time with me so its nothing new). Then she starts to yell and get angry at me instead of just speaking calmly about it...Then by this point were getting into one big loop of fighting about her family and eventually she just hangs up the phone and ignores me...which leads to the next chapter of constant anger and fighting..

Conflict 

Now before it gets to this point I try to tell her that emotions are getting high and that maybe we should hang up and call each other back in 5 minutes. She constantly says in a very loud voice that shes fine and we can continue talking. So instead of being argumentative, I reluctantly agree and continue the conversation. But then she gets mad and hangs up and ignores me...When she finally decides to call back or answer her phone she says things like ""I dont have time to hang up the phone and continue this conversation"" I try to tell her that hanging up and giving each other time is probably the best solution to keep our emotions down so we can have a productive conversation instead of constantly arguing in circles. She insists that she just doesnt have time so I tell her to take 5 minutes out of her day to make time...She then yells that she wants the fighting to stop. (instead of me being a smart ass and saying thats what the 5 minutes and calm voices would have been for) I tell her thats fine but since we just keep ending the fights without anything getting resolved they are likely to come back up again, and we can't just sweep them under the rug and hope they go away. Even today she got mad at me before her internship because she said ""I will call you later"" and I said ""I hope so""...She literally yelled at me for saying I hope so??? I told her I dont have her work schedule down in my memory because lately she hasnt been able to call me because she is training an intern. So I thought me saying I hope so wouldn't be a big deal because, well..I DO hope we can talk...some days we dont talk for 12 hours and when she gets home she goes to bed in 2 hours. On the outside looking in that may seem like a red flag but she really does have a stressful job and she likes to keep a sleep schedule so she can wake up at 630AM and do it all over again 6 days a week. So I try to be understanding...but I feel she is so focused on her needs that later on down the road she won't realize that you must think about your partner too..

Self-hate and Change

I decided since shes doing something productive at her internship, I would try to win her back and make changes to myself that have ruined our relationship. I cut my drinking from about 50+ beers a week easily to maybe 6 to 12 a week. I looked more into buddhist teachings and Christian parables to try to tame my anger. I've looked into ways of avoiding conflicts and stop being so jealous and insecure. So I'm making some changes. I'm so happy with my change to the point I feel like a little kid just wanting to show her how much I've ""grown up"". Thats why I'm so eager to see her and feel that ""i cant spend time in a hotel because there isnt a stove"" is a shitty excuse and it makes me feel like my change is for nothing and will go unnoticed... But lately it seems; the past 3 months. It seems like she is the one who is angry all the time and always yelling, and I don't know what to do? I hate to say it because owning up to my past mistakes and taking responsibility was part of my change, but I feel like all the problems are from her now. And she already seems really angry so I can't tell her that, not even in the slightest or else she would make everything go in one ear and out the other. 

Reflection

I look back on my anger with her and I feel that maybe this is all the negativity I threw out into the universe clashing with the positive changes I'm trying to make. So I suffer and endure it because I love her. I guess I don't really know what I want you guys to help me with...maybe how I can make this work? How to not lose her? How to end the suffering for both of us? its just I feel I'm at a point where I just need SOMEONE to help. I'm at an awkward age in my life where I wish I had some direction in life in general, not just the relationship, but thats another topic. This all sounds like some childish, high school mess to me, but again I love her and my bad Karma is coming back so I'm enduring it. I sort of blame myself for not having a place for us to call home since I am the man, but in college taking 18 hours a semester its hard to have a job that pays the bills (even though I have a crappy job that only pays about 435 a month)

But I'll end there and clear up anything that doesn't make sense. I'm just looking for help, and I really want things to work out between me and Becky

TL;DR I used to be an angry drunk until I get my crap together, my girlfriends family hates me because I'm black, I don't know how to not fight with my girlfriend anymore because she seems like shes angry all the time, and I want things to work out between us "

4mjc11,9,2016-06-04,Seeking advice about an unhappy hedgie and dog,tordster,Hedgehog,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hedgehog/comments/4mjc11/seeking_advice_about_an_unhappy_hedgie_and_dog/,"Hello fellow hedgie lovers! 

I have had my hedgehog Charlie since July, so its almost been one year. Charlie is a sweet hedgehog and even semi-acknowledged me as a human she likes. During the last year I lived in an apartment at college with no other pets. When I would go home over breaks (where my family has two dogs and two cats) I figured she would just freak out because of new surroundings. I recently moved to another state for an internship and took Charlie and one of the dogs (who was my childhood dog) with. We have been here since May and Charlie has not calmed down at all... I hold her everyday for at least an hour and nothing has changed. She stays spiked up and will not calm down. When my dog is present or even if he's in another room, she is terrified. I have been trying so hard because I love both my animals, but I think its getting to a point where its cruel to have Charlie here with my dog because she can never relax! Please, someone give me advice of what to do! "
4mjf17,1,2016-06-04,[F4A] Basic Protocol,CrowmeatDPP,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/4mjf17/f4a_basic_protocol/,"""War"" may be a bit of an exaggeration, but anyone who claims that Western society is living in racial harmony has their head buried in the sand. Just turn on the news, the US, Europe, it's the same story everywhere. It's not anyone's fault, really- we're genetically designed to associate with those like us. But we're also designed to compete and conquer...

Let's introduce the Black Broadcast Capitalist Enterprises. International underground firm that is part of almost every market imaginable. News broadcasting, commercials, auctioning, farming, construction, law, politics, the film industry, sports... Everything. Though they always have cover-ups, ghost companies used to hide them from true sight. Most of the world has slowly been taken over by BBCE, and now they control enough to start moving.

Nearly every employee for the BBCE and their underling companies is of African descent, and the ones that aren't are very attractive white girls. Well, they weren't very attractive white girls at the start, but the BBCE works in the research industry and the cosmetic industry, and also the plastic surgery industry. They are very attractive now. Though they don't date, they deny any man that talks to them. Apart from a black man. And then if a girl talks to them, well, they'll introduce them to that high-paying secretary job at BBCE, and the cycle continues...

Now, however, they can start their original goal. To make the Black Race supreme. They've always been working towards this goal. Money is funneled into interracial porn productions, sent as child support payments to Black men and the women they breed, used to fund tuition for Black students to attend historically white colleges and universities and support the propaganda spewing Tumblr blogs they write filled with smut. In fact, BC Enterprises is the largest source of funding for the advancement of the Black race the world has ever seen- and it's working. Only, they are ready to launch a new initiative.

the Basic Protocol. Designed to target basic white girls, ones that are cute and the ones that are stunningly hot, the goal is that by the end of the year, nearly every white girl will dream of BBC stretching them out and being filled with the superior sperm. Of course, that takes time... And testing. If people suddenly get suspicious of the copious amounts of interracial porn that they can watch, targeted towards them in particular... No, the BBCE got to where they are now by patience and waiting. They were slaves by these stupid white men, now they'll enslave them. Only, they won't realize they are being enslaved until all their women are breeding black children and every job is taken by the superior black race.

The BBCE control everything, as mentioned above. And when I say everything... I truly mean everything! Every market, every business, everything is managed and monitored. If the BBCE want a famous celebrity to go black, for example Kim Kardashian... They start to influence her. Replace her friends' thoughts and let her friends convert her. Whisper in her ear. And then they put down their hand-made celebrity Kanye West to sweep in and finish the job. Now, millions of teens on instagram look up to Kim, and her sexy black husband...

This is only an example. The first step to the project is to pick a fresh target. I am sure that you boys can find a nice picture of a pretty girl who is ready to be tested and moulded into her ideal image! Then, the influence begins. Start replacing boys in her school with black ones, have her watch her crush get beaten up by a gang of muscular black guys. Surround her with pretty black men and... Her friends. Her friends will be converted in advance, on a more... Enhanced version of the protocol. Sped up. Her friends already love black cock and eagerly work for BBCE. They giggle and point out things like how much bigger and more dominant black men are...

And then they steer it towards sexual conversation. Is it true that black men are bigger? Is it true that once you go black, you can't go back? Stuff like this. Questions that keep our target up at night, pondering about them... At this point, we'll begin to convert her family. Take the men of the house out, her brothers and father, replace them with a new black step-father. This is a long process, but the black agent who will play as the step-father will begin to play subliminal messaging and hypnotic videos that are disguised as films. Ones that get her horny as the sex scenes get steamier, the ones that make her close her eyes at night, but not for sleeping.

Then we amp it up after a few weeks of this. After this amount of time, she's into black guys. But still into whites... And that can't do. We'll make her give a BJ or have sex with a white guy and his tiny penis, and then afterwards, a few days later, have her accidently walk into her step-father, or maybe find a beefed out black guy in the gym showers... Maybe asked on a date from the basketball player in school. And they'll get it on, slowly but surely.

She should have her first black cock within two weeks of amping it up. Then, we give her more black cock, and tiny white cock as well. From there, she'll make her choice. We'll get her addicted to the stunning pleasure of BBC, and then the BBCE will give her an internship at one of their prestigious offices, far away from her family. There, they'll pump her up into an airheaded bimbo secretary and... Rinse and repeat. Until they get the formula for the Basic Protocol down.

Then... They can release it upon the world.

---

The best message to me would be starting off the roleplay by writing about one of the girls. You'll play any man that comes up, and the world and how it reacts to the Basic Protocol, but also about the brainwashing and the effects it has on the four girls! So mentioning how they find themselves thinking about black men... Stuff like that. I'm more likely to ignore you if you don't write a response to the roleplay and get stuck in straight away, just because I can see your writing talent and whether we'll be a good match! "
4mjokp,1,2016-06-04,F4M - Celebrity wins hot vacation,[deleted],AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/4mjokp/f4m_celebrity_wins_hot_vacation/,"""By ""raffle"", I won a trip to special vacation resort. This resort is unique because it’s ONLY for couples and no one seems to know much about it, as people who won tickets have to sign nondisclosure agreements. But the rumor is that it’s really great, and most importantly one of the most exclusive in the world. I really want to do that trip, but have nobody to go with, so I ""catch"" you and drag you into it so I can go.

In that resort, a lot of activities are organised for couples. We quickly discover that some are mild, and some aren't at all. Romantic dinners, massage lessons with other couples or just the two of us, sexy cooking lessons, but also more kinky ones. Moreover, some employees can give dares to couples every time they see them, from kiss and grope each other right here (“here” being anywhere from an empty corridor public places)or skinny dipping to have sex in that place without getting caught (or make sure you do get caught by somebody). Each couple can choose anytime between 3 categories and activities and dare at the beginning of the day, but won’t know any details until they start. You can be an employee or a fan, or some rich friend and you have to act like your bf. At the beginning You'd probably kind of shy/nervous because of all of this, hanging out and pretending to be with THAT celeb's boyfriend. On my side I'm having a blast, enjoying myself and keeping us from all the things you'd love to try.

And from here, the scenario can go differen ways depending on what you want to do, your kinks &amp; limits… So let’s discuss it

Do youstart to enjoy yourselfself and we both start to take part is more and more daring activities? Do you figure out that you can take advantage of the situation, start to get more and more touchy every time you can? Trying to get us into the hottest activities, and if I refuse to play along threaten to expose us as a fake couple? Or maybe you start to even blackmail me after getting some serious leverage, and get me to do everything you want.

LOTS of possibilities, with either a young celeb and an older employee, assistant, agent... Or an older one with the new intern or some fan she randomly picked, I'm open to suggestions !

We go to the same college and spend a great deal of time together studying and having fun. We're going to spend the summer together living in the same room in an apartment for summer internships.


10 months ago, she told me about her anxiety and how to best help her when isn't feeling well. I decided to share that I have someone close that has dealt with similar, but not the same thing. She was insistent in finding out who I was referring to, but I refused to tell. In the end, we hadn't been together for too long, so it blew over. It has resurfaced occasionally but I've held firm.

This has come back now and seems like a significant issue. I made some remarks about how starting pharmaceutical treatment is decision to be made carefully in a conversation we were having. I didn't reference that I thought this from any experience, but it brought the issue back anyway. She cried and insisted that I tell her. She told me that she doesn't feel like I trust her or want to be close partners and share with her. I have done my best to explain that I was told in confidence and that unless it effects myself or her directly or I have permission to tell others, that I can't tell her who I'm referring to. I even tried to tell her that I wanted this to demonstrate that she can trust me with personal information and know that I can be trusted with it. In response I get that I'm holding it over her head somehow.

This cycle has repeated itself a few times in the past couple days, and I regret mentioning anything 10 months ago. What can I do to reassure her? I really, really don't want to tell, but I also really dislike conflict, what is the best way to deal with this situation? Thank you for reading.

 I've recently become very interested in sales engineering, specifically with CRM software, from doing a LOT of reading on the subject. 

I've since come to the realization that programming is not my thing (though I am a comp-sci major), and I am not sure what do to plan out my career path. I'm feeling a bit lost.

I'm currently on the search for a summer sales job, as I have previously held a technical internship but believe it would be beneficial to get some sales experience.

With all the failure I am seeing with finding a summer job, would it be better to have a backup plan, or just keep searching for a job? 


I am too comfortable with life right now because it is the summer, and feel like I will never be successful if I don't push myself to somehow learn sales this summer. I am also worrying a lot about money, (i.e. will I be making as much as CS software engineer colleagues come graduation) as my parents are pressuring me to become a software engineer. 

I graduate next year by the way.


**TL;DR: computer science major being pressured into software engineering. How can I learn sales this summer if I am seeing a lot of failure with finding a summer sales job, and how should I be preparing to start my career in SE?**"
4mlm6g,42,2016-06-04,Losing my V-card: the whole story,begonedirtysecrets,SluttyConfessions,https://www.reddit.com/r/SluttyConfessions/comments/4mlm6g/losing_my_vcard_the_whole_story/,"So on Thursday I posted a bit of a tongue in cheek celebration post about losing my V-card ago to the day. The only reason I knew it had been a year was because of a Facebook memory reminding me of what I did the morning of. Some people asked for it so here is the whole story.

Background. I was almost 23, very pale, reddish brown hair, and a little bit above average weight for my height.


I had just moved to a major city for a summer internship on Tuesday so I was looking to have some fun and drink but I did not know anyone. I got the ""bright"" idea to use Tinder to find some people around my age to drink with me so I wouldn't be alone at the bars. I was not looking for a hookup or anything and tried to be very very clear with that.

I found someone who seemed very nice and agreed to meet a bar that was in walking distance from my place. I only had Tinder on an old iPod so I didn't see his last message which was saying he was only looking for a hookup. Once I got to bar things got very interesting....

I was mistaken for a lesbian for smiling at girl, was told I had lovely eyebrows that had to be fake, was hit on by a very drunk man, got very drunk myself (light weight) before my tinder ""date"" arrived and tried to get to me to sleep in the bedroom he and his roommates took turns using when they brought home girl...

Thats when I saw a nerdy guy across from the bar and started winking at him in vain to get away from the Tinder guy. Tinder guy finally gave up and the nerdy guy came over with his friend. The rest of the night we all laughed and talked. At one point I looked at the nerdy guy and said ""You know your friend is cock blocking you right?""... Alcohol mades me very bold and forward to say the least.

Anyways! It was almost 3 in the morning when I decided to go to sleep and the nerdy guy said he would walk me home. As we were holding each other up he made the comment that he wanted to sleep/cuddle and I drunkly told him if it was just cuddling to come home with me. 

Once home I got into bed fully dressed and we started to kiss which lead to him getting on top of me. At that point I knew I was going to be loosing my V-card soon but I wasn't sure to who or when. I did tell him I was virgin and he immediately stopped until I asked him to continue. He then says in a bashful but prideful manner ""I don't want to scare you but I have a really big dick"".... he wasn't kidding.... that thing was like the ones you see in porn! We tried to continue and it was not fitting until I found some lube I had for a toy.

The rest of night was spend eating, sucking, and fucking each other. I think he even spanked me at one point but it really is all a blur of just sex. The next morning we woke up hung over and I got to see his monster in the morning light. We fucked again and parted away. I called someone friends in shock, got plan B...., and continued to meet people on Tinder and bars which lead to an explosion of sex that summer.    

And thats how I lost my V-card in a drunk one night stand 3 days after I moved to a major city. "
4mlx74,0,2016-06-05,[20/M] Starting to dread spending time with girlfriend[20/F] of almost 3 years.,genericthrowawayacc5,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/4mlx74/20m_starting_to_dread_spending_time_with/,"We started dating in high school for a year before being in a long distance relationship for 2 years due to college. Obviously things can change a lot over 3 years, especially when you don't spend the majority of the last 2 of them together. But it feels like we have nothing in common now. We still care about each other(She still seems 100% into the relationship) and really like each other's families. When we aren't at a family event or some kind of pre-planned activity(Basically anytime we have to agree on something to do) we have nothing we both want to do. I try to give ideas but she normally either doesn't want to do it or wants to save it for a later day(The later day normally rarely happening. Example: I got her nerf guns as a fun gift over a year ago and just finally opened them myself last week when we were both bored out of our minds at her house. She at first told me not to open them yet because she wanted to save them for later but eventually joined in).

The majority of our time together this summer has been re-watching movies(and I'm the kind of person who gets restless after like an hour of TV). We don't have much to talk about besides work and our families. We had a really bad fight this past Christmas and one of the things that came up was how we don't seem to have a lot of things we like to do together. We agreed to work on it but not much has changed. 

I didn't realize how much I was starting to get tired of this until the other day when after I worked she asked me to come over and I didn't want to. I wanted to hangout with my friends or play video games or just nap or anything. I realized how much I started to not enjoy spending time with her. She still always wants to be together though, if we aren't at work or busy she wants us together(Which I know should be great she loves being with me so much). Obviously we aren't bored 100% of the time. We do have a good time together occasionally and come up with stuff we both really enjoy. But those times are becoming fewer and fewer. 

Just this alone wouldn't make me doubt our relationship too much, but a big problem is that last summer was really bad for us as a couple. We fought a lot, we never had anything to do but still were always together, and both have admitted we thought about breaking up multiple times. I asked my best friend if he would pick me up from the beach when I was on vacation with her family it was getting so shitty. He was willing to(He's the man) but I decided that I wanted to try to fix things and not just bail so I told him not to come.  We're not fighting now at least but other than that we haven't improved much. I'm terrified of my last summer before (hopefully) getting an internship is going to be miserable like last year. I've been making plans(Concerts, mini trips, seeing college friends, etc.) to try to make this a great summer, but the more I plan the more I realize that I want to spend the Summer with my friends and not my girlfriend. So if I don't want to spend time with her during the summer when the whole point of our long distance relationship is to suffer through the school year to enjoy summers together, then whats the point of being together?

Then a few other smaller things that have made me doubt us like very different sex drives(She's said her ideal amount of sex is once every few months whereas my ideal amount is once or twice a day. We've had very little action on the physical side in the past 2 years. Sex once the past year, and a half making out maybe 20 times the past year) so that's somewhat problematic. I also am not interested in having children in the future(Although obviously you can change your mind pretty easily at my age I'm sure) whereas she can't imagine a future without kids. We've talked about it but it was just pushed off to be dealt with when we can't really push it off any longer. Also, she doesn't seem to like or trust my friends. She says she does and I truly want to believe her. But anytime I hang out with my best friend I always get a text from her going ""Be safe, don't do anything you'll regret"". Literally every time, even if were playing video games at one of our houses. It's gotten to the point where I stopped telling her to try trusting me and just said ""goodnight"" and ended the conversation there. 

Finally, we have the new problem that is my fault and I'm not proud of it. At college one of my best friends is a girl(Lets call her Jane). We get along really well and she is absolutely one of my closest friends. After my GF and I had our christmas fight I talked to my best friend at home(We'll call him John) about how I was feeling just to vent. One of the things John said was that he felt like GF and I aren't best friends and he's noticed that Jane and I seem to have more fun just as friends than GF and I do as a couple. Recently(Like maybe less then a week) I have started thinking about Jane more in a romantic way and started thinking about what a relationship with her would be like. Obviously I wouldn't actually say anything to Jane ever while I'm with my GF but I still think that I cheated in a way on GF emotionally. 

Rereading what I've written so far I probably need to break up with her and just don't want to admit it. 

I care a lot about her. I hate the idea of having to hurt her even knowing it would be for the best. She is a great girl and I think that we are just incompatible no matter how much we care about each other. My family loves her and her family loves me. Just last week her Mom talked about how it felt like I was part of their family and how sometimes they forget to invite me to things until it was a few days before simply because they just assumed I was going. We've both become a big part in each other's life and after almost 3 years its hard to imagine not having her. She is a great girl and I know that she can find someone who will make her happier than I ever can.

 I'm scared of how she would take breaking up because she also doesn't have a lot of friends at home. Her best friend is across the country at school taking summer classes and she barely talks to any other friends at home. I hate the idea of her being home alone while her parents work and her sisters at school just having to sit there by herself after a breakup. She's had some self confidence problems that I think I've helped with but I'm afraid that us breaking up would hurt her a lot. 

So I think its somewhat clear to me right now that even though its going to be awful, I think I might have to do this. 
But hey, if anyone has any experience and this is completely normal(Or maybe just some outside perspective showing me I'm completely wrong) and just a phase go ahead and tell me. Or just comment. I like talking to people.
She's away visiting family for a few days but when she gets back I'll have to talk to her about everything I've written above, especially the Jane part.

If you made it this far thanks, your quite the trooper.

tl;dr: There's a lot of shit here can't you just skim or something? Our relationship is boring, last summer sucked, I don't wanna repeat, somewhat interested in female friend, etc. I don't want to hurt GF."
4mlztm,2,2016-06-05,[ROLEPLAY] The Escapee,TimeLord79,worldpowers,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/4mlztm/roleplay_the_escapee/,"Hugo Lachance collapsed against a nearby wall and watched as the smoke billowing up from the embassy. He paused for a moment to consider the shitty chain of events that had put him in this situation. So he had gotten a job in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs after serving as an intern for a while. It had sounded like it'd be fun. It was fun, until Hugo made the wrong joke at the expense of the wrong person and promptly found himself shipped off to Yemen. ""Unprofessional behavior,"" his ass. Still, that wasn't so bad, until of course the ARY stormed the embassy. And so, here he was, catching his breath as he watched the Québécois Embassy burn.

First thing to do was to get the hell out of Sana'a. That sounded so easy when said; if only it was that easy to do. Still, Hugo would figure something out. So the city was crawling with people who wanted to kill him. No problem. So he had an accent that would give his identity away the moment he opened his mouth. So what? He'd keep under cover until it was dark and then slip out of the city and sneak across the border to the DSRY or maybe to Saudi Arabia. Hell, maybe he'd hitch a ride on a boat across the Red Sea, it didn't matter to him, so long as he got out and far, far away from this hellhole. The one thing Hugo was sure of at this point was that if he somehow survived this mess he was *never* going to set foot in Yemen again."

***TL;DR: I Truly believe that my boyfriend and i can pull off an open relationship and am even slightly excited about the prospect, but hangups from my past combined with a bad/sad taste in my mouth from how this situation came to be are freaking me out. Help?*** 



Okay. So set up. ME, 21 and a rising senior. Him, 19 and a rising sophomore. I go to school in DC, originally from a small town in rural PA. My boyfriend lives in VA just outside of DC.  So this school year entailed me meeting  dating him.  We really click with each other and have such a good time within all facets of our relationship. I'm more than happy and proud to call him my boyfriend, we've been dating for about five months now and it's the most emotionally fulfilling relationship I've ever had. I love him and he loves me. We are both sexually open minded and have before discussed the possibility of threesomes although nothing came from it. I have a very low sex drive due to an antidepressant I take, and he has a high one because he is a young gay male. xD

So at the end of the school year I applied to internships and jobs like crazy. I thought that something would work out. I got a few bites and interviewed at a few places, and was getting really good signs and signals from one well paid internship that I interviewed for. I was so excited. I was going to have a productive summer together with my boyfriend. We were gonna go to our first pride together, and my first pride ever. It was going to be such a great summer. 

Well, everything fell through. I called him the other day to tell him, crestfallen. Now, my plan B was always to move to a local and far less expensive college town and just do my best to earn and save money then for the summer. And that's what I'm doing now. The same day I told him, he calls later that night. After having a normal conversation he himhaws around and eventually asks how I feel about possibly opening the relationship for the summer and having sexual encounters with other people, of course under the premise that we and we only were romantically and emotionally involved. 

Now we have both had casual encounters in our own respective pasts and we can both pull them off NSA and remain friends with hook ups, and as far as emotionally remaining loyal to each other I am not concerned. I know that we both can seperate casual sex and romantic relationship feelings and actions. But I do remain pretty unsettled...


Everything is just so different from how I fought and tried for it to be this summer. And the very day that I realize it would not go said way, he breaks this question. To me it felt like he didn't care that much that we weren't going to have this great summer together, so he already had a contingency plan set up and ready to go. 

Now I've always wanted to experience an open relationship because I treat life as one big experimental adventure, an exploration of human capacities, but the way this is panning out is really leaving me unsettled. I dont settle in to a relationship quickly despite any feelings, and he knows that. And after four months I was finally in a place where I felt comfortable, and had plans for the near future, and they all came crashing down with the job rejection that lead to this situation. 

We're both young and say that we know we have more life to live, but I know that I want to stay with him and him with me. I just have these fears for all the subtle implications that the way these things go carry. Are there implications? Are there not? I truly believe we can pull it off, but yet I'm so freaked out and kinda saddened by the notion that it may actually become a reality. 

Despite having a low sex drive, I am intrigued and excited at the idea of having more sexual experiences, but I can see myself trying and possibly it feeling wrong and not going through with it and just feeling upset at the situation, while I know he won't be the same way. (I still have some major religious cognitive dissonance from a very structural catholic upbringing that still plagues me to this day as an agnostic). I don't want to agree to this and then end up feeling hurt through no fault of mine or his, and have that ruin what we have. But then IDK if that is when what will happen. 

I want to pull this off. He does too. I trust his feelings for me and mine for him. But the suddenness and unexpectedness of this scenerio is freaking me out.

This resort is unique because it’s ONLY for couples and no one seems to know much about it, as people who won tickets have to sign nondisclosure agreements. But the rumor is that it’s really great, and most importantly one of the most exclusive in the world. I really want to do that trip, but have nobody to go with, so I ""catch"" you and drag you into it so I can go.

In that resort, a lot of activities are organised for couples. We quickly discover that some are mild, and some aren't at all. Romantic dinners, massage lessons with other couples or just the two of us, sexy cooking lessons, but also more kinky ones. Moreover, some employees can give dares to couples every time they see them, from kiss and grope each other right here (“here” being anywhere from an empty corridor public places)or skinny dipping to have sex in that place without getting caught (or make sure you do get caught by somebody). Each couple can choose anytime between 3 categories and activities and dare at the beginning of the day, but won’t know any details until they start. You can be an employee or a fan, or some rich friend and you have to act like your bf. At the beginning You'd probably kind of shy/nervous because of all of this, hanging out and pretending to be with THAT celeb's boyfriend. On my side I'm having a blast, enjoying myself and keeping us from all the things you'd love to try.

And from here, the scenario can go differen ways depending on what you want to do, your kinks &amp; limits… So let’s discuss it

Do youstart to enjoy yourselfself and we both start to take part is more and more daring activities? Do you figure out that you can take advantage of the situation, start to get more and more touchy every time you can? Trying to get us into the hottest activities, and if I refuse to play along threaten to expose us as a fake couple? Or maybe you start to even blackmail me after getting some serious leverage, and get me to do everything you want.

(Development, maybe Quad-core, Temperature) Tx60y",lifeishell42,thinkpad,https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/comments/4mn8py/is_there_any_way_to_find_happiness_development/,"I'm student trying to find notebook for development. I had quad Xeon on my dev machine on my previous internship with plenty of RAM and I don't want to go back after that experience. I previously had T520i which was awesome (except for i3-U) with keyboard from heaven (rest in peace).

The thing is I need some portability too (and balance budget as well). T460 is perfect (I already have SSD, will buy 16GB ram to upgrade to 20GB) in everything except for i5-U CPU (and i7-U is not worth the $). T460p gets super hot (I've heard). P50 are insanely expensive (I'm buying in Europe with VAT and no corporate discount). 


I looked at other computers (Latitude - ridiculous pricing, 2300eur (approx $2600 for you free citizens) for dual core i7 with 8G ram, 1440p screen - seriously Dell ?! Or I could go for i7-HQ with MBP but I think they are two(!) generations behind skylake, because they refreshed CPU in 2015 only for MBP 13. Also, I'm not fan of Apple construction / maintenance / keyboard / pricing / etc. 

Anyone in similar position? Can you use hungry IDEs on i5s? Or do you just connect to remote server for CPU intensive tasks?"
4mnadu,35,2016-06-05,I (25) and SO (28) currently trying to buy/rent a house for FIRST time! Need much advice.,ThrowsAwaysAccounts3,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4mnadu/i_25_and_so_28_currently_trying_to_buyrent_a/,"Ok so a little background: I stayed with my parents while I was in school to save money (my part-time job hours were cut, the whole town lost about 6 or more businesses in 1 year its been a hard recovery). I ran out of financial assistance for school in my last two terms and took a loan to cover the rest (loan for $16.5k ended up at $20k after interest and 6 month payment delay in contract), my SO has a smaller loan (about $10k or less now); between the two of us our loans total about $400 a month (mine about $230 and his $140). This is our main debt right now, I paid my car off while going to school and own it outright, so its just this and average expenses (insurance, grocery, gas,etc) that we pay for. I also give my parents $400 a month to help out  (we buy our groceries and all its more for power and water and stuff.)


So here are where the problems begin...


After my part-time jobs hours were cut to 0-5 hours a week if I was lucky, I graduated and attempted to get a better job. My degree is in social science and my career goal was to work in a museum. A local county position opened up and I gladly applied and got hired. They made me the curator (didnt ask and was under qualified) but I only work 40 hours a month seasonal (7/12 months) which is really bad but still infinitely better than the previous job hours. I have asked to make the position more permanent as have the committee members for the museum but its local government so if the money for the job isn't laying right there it doesn't exist and this is just an ""extra help"" job. Now I don't want to leave this job for a few reasons.


1. Its my career path, I have my foot in the door, most people at my level do unpaid internships for years so I should be happy that I am getting paid period.
2. I applied for literally thousands of jobs and this was the only one to ever call me back and give me an interview. The job market here is still crappy in recovery mode from losing old businesses and creating new ones years later. I feel like there must be over 1000 people applying for every job because many people in this town are in the same boat or worse off.
3. If I got ANOTHER job, I would be gone nearly every day (current job weekends only) and I did work multiple jobs while going to school and know it is soooo soul crushing and tiring,really not looking forward to going back but will, and do apply for part time jobs.

My SO has a great job in this city, typically county and factory work here are best paying/benefits and all that. He was a seasonal worker for a while (the job market here realllyy sucks) working and being laid off, then he managed to get a job at a paper product factory, so no more seasons which is great. The problem with finances isn't him it's me, I feel that if I contributed as much as he we wouldn't be struggling so much. But anyway, there is another issue...pets.


He had a dog (German shepherd) when we met, I had a cat. We are big animal lovers and In the course of our relationship we found a little dog and a kitten (and my families cat has adopted it as a child so now I can't separate those two) so now I have 2 dogs and 3 cats and renting is a problem. We could much easier afford an apartment or renting a house over buying but no one will take our pets. So we decided we will just buy so we don't have to part with them or wait for them to die. 
Now even though the job market here is terrible, buying a house is cheap (3bd-2bth for $140k, nice houses too). I have found some mortgage estimates put monthly payment for that around 600-700$. This coupled with the utilities and general expenses is doable for us (tight but doable).

So reddit, what did you do to change your finances? How did you save more? Should/can I refinance my loan/get cheaper payments based on income? Are there grants for people like me (usda, fha, etc)? Should I really buy a house (its a big purchase)?


Bottom line, I don't want to, and am nearing can't, live at home anymore. I need to start my life. I know it wont happen today but please help me get this ball rolling, thank you.

TL;DR: Living at home, want/need to move out, am in debt with little income and 5 pets so renting is hard. May have to buy a house, must organize finances/learn tips to save more. Help.

4mnfus,3,2016-06-05,Help dressing my office-inappropriate body type (instead of hiding it),BooksAndCatsAnd,femalefashionadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/4mnfus/help_dressing_my_officeinappropriate_body_type/,"Hey y'all... I really need some help. I'm very young to have my old school corporate, west-coast job (4 years younger than the next youngest, the intern is older than me...), and to boot I have a body type that is pretty much office inappropriate. Given the male-dominated, engineering/nerdy environment, I basically feel that if I don't hide my figure, I won't be able to do my job because I will be seen as inappopropriate. I already work with a really nice guy who can't talk to a woman without turning tomato colored, for example. It's just THAT male-dominated, at least in terms of the culture!

I'm built like a marvel heroine. I'm 5'5"", leggy/short waisted, normally fit best in a 4 on top and a 2 on bottom, 35-25-35.5 with approx a 28H bust (I know, sounds crazy, but it's legit, thanks a bra that fits).... I weigh something like 135lbs because I carry a good amount of muscle, but my measurements are really the relevant part to buying clothes.

I find it really depressing to hide my body every morning when I get dressed, and I'm hoping that you guys can help me find a way to wear a correct fit without feeling va-va-voom. That means no pencil skirts!

Right now, I pretty much have a uniform of express pants one size too big, with a cami that covers everything and stays put tucked into the pants, and then a loose blouse one-two sizes too big over, with either a cardigan or a blazer depending on how I feel that day. I literally use a belt to hold up my pants... Tailoring would just feel silly because the next size (or two) down in pants will fit me correctly. I just don't know whether a correct fit could ever be appropriate so I stick to what I know will fly -- an ill fit that's baggy enough to hide in.

That being said, some of the ladies at my office will ask me stuff like ""why don't you wear skirts or dresses"" or if I wear something that does fit (usually pants or a blazer) folks will say how good I look and how I look like I've lost weight, so that's what makes me feel that if I choose wisely, I can wear a correct fit. That being said, the women suggesting I dress in feminine stuff that fits have more athletic, ruler or pear body types. I just want to scream, if I dress like a lady I will look like a blonde Joan from Mad Men!

Ok enough ranting about the skin I'm in, in terms of style, I'm very european-inspired (partially because Euro brands usually fit me better!). I currently express my style through cute heels from brands like Vince, LK Bennett, Calvin Klein, and sometimes even Stuart Weitzman.
In terms of style icons, I've pretty much loved everything Blake Lively has ever worn (on Gossip Girl and in real life). My best colors are probably burgundy, army green, pale pink, and light blue. Grey usually makes me look like I'm dying, lol. I love Claire Underwood's looks, and I think I could really rock an hourglass-appropriate version of what she might have worn at the very start of her career, when she was in her 20s. 

I'm willing to pay for quality, and my most beloved pieces tend to be in the 200-300 range. That being said, I'm at the very start of my career, and I need a day-to-day wardrobe that won't break the bank or look cheap! My express pants totally look cheap, but they cover my shapely bum effectively and make me feel safer when I end up in a factory elevator with a bunch of manufacturing dudes. 

Tl;dr: busty, leggy, thin-ish hourglass working for a male-dominated engineering/manufacturing fortune 500 on the West Coast with a business casual dress code that she can't escape by dressing more formally would like to find a way to wear clothes that fit her style and fit her without making herself a target for sexual harassment.

4mnsau,0,2016-06-05,"I'[M,21] feeling very unsettled and unable to make a clear judgement as to wether to be open for the summer apart with my boyfriend. [M,19]",Thats_classified,nonmonogamy,https://www.reddit.com/r/nonmonogamy/comments/4mnsau/im21_feeling_very_unsettled_and_unable_to_make_a/,"I always start out these kinds of posts by saying that I am gonna try to keep it concise, but then I get invested and emotional and word vomit. So I guess this is a disclaimer. Thanks for listening in yall...

***TL;DR: I Truly believe that my boyfriend and i can pull off an open relationship and am even slightly excited about the prospect, but hangups from my past combined with a bad/sad taste in my mouth from how this situation came to be are freaking me out. Help?***

Okay. So set up. ME, 21 and a rising senior. Him, 19 and a rising sophomore. I go to school in DC, originally from a small town in rural PA. My boyfriend lives in VA just outside of DC. So this school year entailed me meeting dating him. We really click with each other and have such a good time within all facets of our relationship. I'm more than happy and proud to call him my boyfriend, we've been dating for about five months now and it's the most emotionally fulfilling relationship I've ever had. I love him and he loves me. We are both sexually open minded and have before discussed the possibility of threesomes although nothing came from it. I have a very low sex drive due to an antidepressant I take, and he has a high one because he is a young gay male. xD

So at the end of the school year I applied to internships and jobs like crazy. I thought that something would work out. I got a few bites and interviewed at a few places, and was getting really good signs and signals from one well paid internship that I interviewed for. I was so excited. I was going to have a productive summer together with my boyfriend. We were gonna go to our first pride together, and my first pride ever. It was going to be such a great summer. 

Well, everything fell through. I called him the other day to tell him, crestfallen. Now, my plan B was always to move to a local and far less expensive college town and just do my best to earn and save money then for the summer. And that's what I'm doing now. The same day I told him, he calls later that night. After having a normal conversation he himhaws around and eventually asks how I feel about possibly opening the relationship for the summer and having sexual encounters with other people, of course under the premise that we and we only were romantically and emotionally involved. 

Now we have both had casual encounters in our own respective pasts and we can both pull them off NSA and remain friends with hook ups, and as far as emotionally remaining loyal to each other I am not concerned. I know that we both can seperate casual sex and romantic relationship feelings and actions. But I do remain pretty unsettled...

Everything is just so different from how I fought and tried for it to be this summer. And the very day that I realize it would not go said way, he breaks this question. To me it felt like he didn't care that much that we weren't going to have this great summer together, so he already had a contingency plan set up and ready to go. 

Now I've always wanted to experience an open relationship because I treat life as one big experimental adventure, an exploration of human capacities, but the way this is panning out is really leaving me unsettled. I dont settle in to a relationship quickly despite any feelings, and he knows that. And after four months I was finally in a place where I felt comfortable, and had plans for the near future, and they all came crashing down with the job rejection that lead to this situation. 

We're both young and say that we know we have more life to live, but I know that I want to stay with him and him with me. I just have these fears for all the subtle implications that the way these things go carry. Are there implications? Are there not? I truly believe we can pull it off, but yet I'm so freaked out and kinda saddened by the notion that it may actually become a reality. 

Despite having a low sex drive, I am intrigued and excited at the idea of having more sexual experiences, but I can see myself trying and possibly it feeling wrong and not going through with it and just feeling upset at the situation, while I know he won't be the same way. (I still have some major religious cognitive dissonance from a very structural catholic upbringing that still plagues me to this day as an agnostic). I don't want to agree to this and then end up feeling hurt through no fault of mine or his, and have that ruin what we have. But then IDK if that is when what will happen. 

I want to pull this off. He does too. I trust his feelings for me and mine for him. But the suddenness and unexpectedness of this scenerio is freaking me out. I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with it yet, but as of now I realize I have absolutely nothing to relate it to...so I'm coming here for perspective.

4mpsd3,30,2016-06-05,"This time, I'm done for good",BluishBag,stopdrinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/4mpsd3/this_time_im_done_for_good/,"TL;DR: I've embarked on my third and final attempt to quit drinking. Below is a brief history of my experience that I am sharing mostly to get it off my chest. I've never talked about it in full, even at the AA meetings I occasionally attended during previous attempts.

In retrospect, I first started drinking differently than others in high school. As a shy, somewhat dorky kid, alcohol was like magic. I made jokes, and people laughed! I danced like a fool, and people laughed! All it took was a few drinks and my anxieties and insecurities melted away. But I quickly realized that a few beers didn't give me the boost I needed. The desire to get drunker faster gripped me from the start and I moved on to hard liquor. 

Things really accelerated in college. Armed with freedom, I went to as many parties as possible. My poison of choice was Evan Williams green label. As a pompous 18 year old I felt this was sophisticated and classy; the rubes can have their Bud Light, I'm going to enjoy distilled Kentucky bourbon. In reality, it delivered the highest dosage of alcohol in the quickest fashion, which is exactly what I craved. The blackouts happened weekly and sometimes several nights in a row. The college environment of the 21st century almost encourages binge drinking and my peers mostly let this slide. However, there were times when someone darkly said, ""You were really messed up last night. You scared some people."" And there were the many times I lost my phone, wallet, even glasses, and had absolutely zero ability to retrace my steps to track them down.

I transferred to a new school (Ohio State!) after my sophomore year. This did me a lot of good; while the drinking continued, my grades skyrocketed and I was more engaged in academics. The blackouts occurred less frequently...but they still happened. And they often happened after I had been drinking alone. One occasion stands out in my mind - I woke up around noon to 10 missed calls on my phone. My supervisor at an internship called over and over because I didn't show up at 9AM. I looked around and noticed the two empty wine bottles, my crooked glasses, my bed almost half on the ground. To cover my guilt and shame I told her I wound up in the hospital and didn't check my phone. One of many, many lies I have told over the years.

Fast forward to my first ""real"" job out of college. It was in an office full of young 20-somethings and near-nightly happy hours were the norm. Many of us lived and worked in the same neighborhood so no one thought anything of getting wasted and stumbling home. I can't tell you how many nights I said to myself, ""I'll have two or three beers and head home to clean the kitchen, make dinner, and get some sleep,"" and instead stayed out until 1 or 2 AM with nearly no memory of the events the next day. This led to a lot of uncomfortable mornings waking up next to acquaintances and co-workers, along with war stories at the office. ""Dude, you were so hammered last night...Mike and Tom had to carry you home!"" I just laughed it off and geared up for the next night of boozing.

At one point I had moved in to a beautiful apartment with a co-worker. All was going well and at dinner one night he said, ""Let's renew the lease for a year. We make good roommates."" We clinked our glasses together and went out for some celebratory drinks. I have a vague memory of running into some friends and moving from bar to bar. And then hanging out at my apartment with two women. My next memory is coming to in the morning and noticing my wallet, keys and computer are gone. Huh?

I texted my roommate and he said something along the lines of, ""You fucking idiot. You had two crazy women, probably hookers, in the apartment last night. They must have stolen your shit. I threatened to call the cops and then they ran out."" Fighting a tremendously painful hangover, I called the cops and tried to report the crime. The cop looked at me incredulously when I couldn't answer any of his questions about the night before. ""Umm...I was a little drunk."" 

My roommate shortly thereafter told me he wanted me to move and that the landlords supported him. I slunk home to my parents' house and vowed to stop drinking. I linked up with a friend who I knew was active in AA and started going to meetings. 6 months of sobriety ensued. I lost weight and began to enjoy the simple things in life: a quiet morning, a day cleaning the apartment, a big meal cooked over several hours. I had energy at last.

I had started drinking again last year and boasted about my moderation. A glass of wine with dinner, a couple of beers on a Friday night. I would adamantly tell my friends, ""That's it guys. I'm going home."" And it worked! Well, I thought it did. I've never been able to control my drinking and cannot know which night will be a two drink affair or a 10 IPAs and blackout mess. Fast forward to last weekend.

Attended a great outdoor concert with my girlfriend of 6 months, the first woman I've loved. She drinks very little and has seen me blackout drunk only once. It kind of scared her but, as alcoholics do, I brushed it off as a ""rough night."" At the concert I started drinking pale ales and it accelerated when the music started. I would run from our area in the middle of songs because the beer ran out and I couldn't stand to wait a few more minutes. The girl at the beer tent said, ""Woah, you're back again!"" Sure enough, I blacked out, and had on last Sunday one of the worst hangovers of my life. I wound up going to the ER because I could not stop vomiting and could barely stand due to dehydration. My girlfriend dutifully took me there and picked me up, but told me later, ""I need a week to contemplate the events of this weekend. I really need some space.""

I felt nauseous all week. The only thought going through my head was, ""I fucked this up. The best relationship I've ever had has been ruined by booze.""

So I told her what I am telling you guys: This is where it stops. This is where, at age 27, I stop boozing for good. I'm looking forward to visiting this subreddit for some advice and some support, and I encourage anyone who recognizes my story as their own to quit drinking."
4mpsg7,25,2016-06-05,"Me [26F] with my dad [53M] invited himself to stay for a week, need help telling him no",trickyturnip,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4mpsg7/me_26f_with_my_dad_53m_invited_himself_to_stay/,"Hi /r/relationships, can you please help me with this?

My father wasn't really around when me and my sister (24F) were kids. He was abusive to my mother, but she got out. We still saw him every week or so until I was 14. Then he took off to another state without ever telling us. It was hard on both of us to suddenly have no dad, as shitty as he was. Over the years he sent me letters talking about how he'd reconnect when I was 18 and ""free from my mom,"" as though her influence on me made me unbearable.

Well, I have been an adult for 8 years now and that's pretty much what happened. As soon as I turned 18 I visited him out of state and got to know him better. I decided to forgive him and try to have a relationship with him. My sister... not so much. She straight up disowned him. I don't exactly understand how, but a few years ago she took him back into her life on the condition that he helps fund her school/medical expenses/etc. Now, I know for a fact it isn't a ton of money, but it helps their relationship. I do not accept money from him.

This is relevant because ever since then, Dad tries to visit as often as he can to reconnect with my sister. She doesn't really want to as much as he does, and she has less resources than me (no car, less money, etc), so his visits are historically stressful because it all gets dumped on me. But... it's family, right? We survive.

Fast forward to last December where Dad decides he's going to stay for another week. We weren't prepared then for a new level of Dad-ness. He showed up a full day earlier than we thought he would and way overstayed his stay. He wouldn't give us any dates about leaving and assumed it was okay. In retrospect we should have been much clearer about our boundaries, setting dates, etc. but it was so stressful and my sister and I wound up turning on each other in the situation. (This happens every time he visits, but not like this.) It SUCKED. I can't emphasize that enough. My sister feels similarly about it.

Last week he texted us both with this out of the blue:

&gt; ""I'm taking the week of the 4th off. Headin out to see you girls!""

No calls before then, no asking what our schedule was like, nothing. The last I spoke with him was to help him with his taxes. Well gee, that's not going to work. My sister has a really intense political internship this summer and I have a new full-time job with no possibility of taking any time off. This isn't going to work for either of us; we can't even compromise the weekend with my sister's internship. It's a hard no.

I *know* I need to tell him no. But I don't know how. He hasn't demonstrated any consideration for our schedules in the past. He is very much a ""free spirit,"" ""I don't give a shit"" personality and does what he pleases. This makes me think I need to have a hardball approach, but... I don't know. I feel bad because he has good intentions trying to reconnect with us and build a better relationship.

Help? 
   
**tl;dr: My dad invited himself to stay for a week next month to visit my sister. No forewarning, just a text that it was happening. This doesn't work for our schedules but I don't know how to tell him no. How should I go about it?**"

We really love each other, we have common interests and he really is my best friend, we can share everything. Even with long distance, we did a lot of things together, travelled, spent Christmas in each other's families... we did not have a very good start, we were both lying to each other and it was hard to rebuild trust, and today I feel like he does not make enough efforts and he thinks I get angry for the smallest things... Sometimes we are really good together but other times it's really horrible. 

We've had lots of fights and often wondered if we should break up, but never went through with it.
 Last week we almost broke up and I felt like I was ready but we decided to wait and see. I just feel like it's too tiring to try again and again, I just don't feel happy. Sometimes I fear we only stay together because we are scared of being alone and not finding anyone else.

I'm really fed up with the constant fighting over tiny things, and I feel like I should be on my own and manage to be happy on my own: we're about to be doing internships in different countries and it seems like ""the right time"" to do it.

But I'm afraid to make a big mistake and regret it, and to leave ""the one"", and never find someone I'll get along as well with. This seems naive, I know, but I've had boyfriends before, but it was not comparable! 

Should I break up with him or try to make it work again? Thank you for your help!!

tl;dr: my boyfriend and I keep fighting but we are best friends; should we break up?"
4mpuie,0,2016-06-05,I [21/F] am thinking about breaking up with my high school sweetheart [21/M] of five years (3 years LDR) because I'm worried about the future and I might have feelings for someone else but don't know what to do,Throwaway_0071,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4mpuie/i_21f_am_thinking_about_breaking_up_with_my_high/,"My boyfriend and I started dating our junior year of high school and have been together for five years. We went to different college but maintained a long distance relationship throughout college (we both just finished our junior year of college). We see each other about two weekends a month, and I love him. He is very supportive of me and I don't know what I would do without him. We rarely fight and he is the person I am closest to.

However, lately, I've been thinking about life after college and it is stressing me out. We have talked about marriage, in a sort of vague far in the future way, and I feel like everyone expects us to get married. But I don't know if there's any guarantee we could get jobs near each other, and I don't want to do long distance after college.
Additionally, there are some things we disagree on that might seem petty, but are things that bug me and I worry they would be more of an issue if we lived together. Basically, he is very unhealthy, both in eating habits and lack of excercise, while I am very active and into excercising. He's gained a little bit of weight since starting college, but he's not overweight (yet). Also, he doesn't know how to cook or clean. I think he's gradually started learning to cook more though. He comes from a family where his mom did all the cooking and cleaning. That's definitely not what I want; I want to work and have a career. Finally, he can be very unmotivated sometimes; he ended up getting a great internship for this summer, but only after I pressured him to apply to some. I worry that he doesn't have the motivation to apply for real jobs next year.

Complicating things further is that I have a crush on another guy, a friend from college. This is the first time during my relationship that I've had feelings for someone else. 

The problem is, I really don't want to end things with my boyfriend. We've been together for so long, I can't imagine not being with him. And the idea of starting over with someone new is just overwhelming. Anyways, I really am happy with him, I'm not sure why I'm feeling so uncertain and weird about everything.

And then I have to think about the effect the breakup will have on him. I am his first girlfriend, first everything. And while I have a great support system of friends, he is more of an introvert and doesn't have close friends. I think he assumes that we will get married someday. I know he would be blindsided.

Basically I just really don't know what to do or even what I want. Any insights, advice, or similar experiences would be much appreciated?

I have a 2007.5 Chevy Silverado with the 6.0L V8 that absolutely drinks gas. 12MPG according to the computer although it feels as if it gets less. I love the truck for the power and the sound, although its only extended cab so I can fit 2 passengers (I'm 6'4"" and weigh 270 lbs). Selling the truck private party would probably net about ~$16,000 and my budget could extend to around $18,000 with the help of my mother. I'm in a fortunate situation with a single mother who makes good money to help me out on this. I live near Raleigh, NC so 4WD or AWD isn't necessary. I would be using it to drive to high school, my community college that i take additional classes at, and an internship that I'm starting this summer, and occasional road trips and hanging out with friends, etc. 

So here's what I'm looking for:
Decent MPG (would really prefer mid 20s, but realistically anything above ~18 would be an upgrade)

Fun to drive. The truck is no slouch in a straight line but the handling is as expected in a truck

Prefer a sedan, but definitely wouldn't mind a coupe or hatchback. Open to anything from muscle cars to JDM to BMWs.

Things I've considered are Dodge Charger R/Ts and Pontiac G8s however they are somewhat hard to find for some reason. Feel free to suggest anything as I'm relatively open to most things except for Mustangs (Chevy family and I personally don't like them)

Sorry for the formatting as I usually only use reddit on mobile and if there is any more necessary info let me know.

She just came back from South Africa after doing the final internship of her college degree there, as kindergarten teacher. This obviously already puts a lot of strain on the relationship, cause we basically have to find each other again to reattach.
So we talk a lot about how we feel etc, and we agree we can make this work, even if it is difficult right now.

And then she told me she wants children. And I've should have seen it coming from miles away. I was always clear about my child free status, and at first she agreed with no kids. Because her mom abused her and she might do so as well, because there are plenty of children already, and a few others.
But every time she sees a baby she fawns over it. She absolutely loves working with children. And she says she has discovered that she has a strong drive to have children while in Africa. My head was basically deeeeeep down in my arse.
Right now she is thinking about if it's possible for her to live without kids with me. I am not sure it is, but that decision is not mine to make. 

So here we are. With the huge ass elephant in the room. The sword of Damocles hanging above my relationship.
Realistically I know that a woman who wants kids can't be the woman of my life, because my life is without kids.
But it just sucks so fucking hard. There's no cheating, no abusing, no disrespect, yet there is the one major incompatibility that makes this... incompatible.

I am going to wait until she makes up her mind. I think... I've always adviced a break up in these kinda situations, but now I'm in one myself, I can't let go. What if she decides that she can live without kids and wants the life with me? But then again, the thoughts she might want kids will keep on lingering in the background.

We are both graduating uni in a month or two. We're both not from this city. He originally lives 3 hours away from here and I live a few neighboring countries away. After July, he'll go back and I'm staying to work in this city for one more year (or maybe more).


We met two weeks ago or something through a party. I was having the worst time with guys I don't find particularly interesting hitting on me. Hits 2/3am and this random guy was trying to kiss me and I was just dodging around when I saw him walk in. He was directly looking at me and I couldn't stop looking at him. He smiled and he went ahead and just came to the rescue.


Long story short, I ended up having a blast. We danced all night and we kissed and we went home together. He slept over at my place because I didn't want to go all the way to his (which is the same distance from the club to mine but will be 40 minutes away to my place).


That night we had sex 4 times. Once when we got home, once in the morning, right around lunch time, and right before he leaves which was like 4/5pm. We had brekkie together, watched a bunch of things, mess around.


Ironically, I broke up with my boyfriend of 2 years because I didn't enjoy sex and I couldn't give him enough sex. With this guy, I just feel like we're super compatible, sexually. I never had that and I am having the biggest crush on him because of so. I feel like I'm addicted to his kisses and I want to have sex with him every chance I get.


Anyway, he asked for my number before he left then after that he slept over like 3 more times from we met until today. We'd watch a bit of netflix on the couch and then I'd jump on him after like 10 minutes. We chill again, make out, then have sex, then cuddle on the bed, kiss, then sleep.


In the span of 2~ ish weeks he's slept over a total of 4 times (the last one being yesterday). I think that's a pretty okay number that says yeah, he's probably kinda interested and it wasn't a one time thing. But I talked to my friends recently. They were both there when I met him and he's met them as well. They were surprised to hear that he's still meeting me and my friend told me that, yo no offense but is he coming for you or is this a sex thing? Be careful not to get hurt.


Now ever since then I've just been coming up with all the reasons why this just about sex and it's messing with my confidence and it kinda blows. I feel like he's out of my league, we don't chat enough, we only see each other at night after he finishes his internship (which kinda makes sense, he finishes at 5pm then commuting takes 40 minutes, he drops off his stuff, packs his clothes, clean up, commute for another 40 minutes then he'll come around 8/9pm). And again, he's out of my league. He's insanely good looking, fit, polite, smart, and he can literally get any girl that he wants imo.


I complimented him a bunch of times because I couldn't keep it to myself and he's always saying no. That's not true. Only you think that etc. and my friend thinks that he knows he's pretty and he's probably just a fuck boy (lol). I don't know, I'm starting to kinda like this guy more than just a sex buddy. I mean if we do end up having a relationship, it's seriously not that hard to see each other. Travel is free within the country and it's only 3 hours away. But at the same time I'm starting to believe my friends and them saying that he's pretty and he knows it and he doesn't care for you, this is all fun and games.

  
**tl;dr**: Met a guy through a party 2 weeks ago. Super sexually compatible. Finds him super attractive and he's been sleeping over 3 more times after the first night. Friends says he's just coming over for sex. I'm starting to catch feelings. Unsure if I'm fooling myself and I should just stop expecting anything and start seeing other people whilst seeing him."
4mryzp,0,2016-06-06,"Questions about abandoning an apartment, getting my security deposit back, and not ruining my credit so I can take a job?",Glitterypuns,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4mryzp/questions_about_abandoning_an_apartment_getting/,"A bit of background -- I'm a first time renter, and my lease runs from May 1st 2016 - July 31st 2016. I have a short lease because I moved off my college campus for the summer to take summer classes. I'm living with four other people, and we each pay $600/month and split the utilities. I also put down a security deposit of $600 when I signed the lease. 

I'm taking a gap year to figure my college situation out (I should start my junior year this fall, but I'm still not sure what I want to major in), and I'm participating in an AmeriCorp NCCC FEMA program. The program runs for 10 months, and they pay for my food/housing, we get a monthly stipend and an education award at the end. 

I was originally supposed to leave July 19th, which would leave me eating less than half a month's rent, which I have accepted. My roommates and I worked out a deal that I'll pay half my portion of the utilities (I'm moving out in the 15th to spend time with my family before I leave). 

I got an email on Friday that offered up a potential opportunity to be promoted to a Team Leader instead of a regular Team Member. This would be great for my professional career, plus it comes with a stipend raise of $6,500. The only thing is that I'll have to be across the county on June 16th. I'll hear for sure Monday around noon if I have it or not, hopefully. The way it looks, I do, but it's still hypothetical.

Not only will I be SOL with the rent I already paid for June (if I get the position, I'm moving out of my apartment Monday night and have been home since June 2nd for my brother's graduation), as well as still having to pay July's rent. My one roommate said that she can take my rent money over for me on July first, and I fully trust her with that. 

There's no standing reason I shouldn't get my security deposit back, as we've done nothing to destroy the place in the month I've been there so far and I can safely say they won't without me.

I wanted to figure out how my security deposit was returned to me, so I was looking through my lease tonight and there's a section titled abandonment that says: The property will be considered abandoned by the tenant if: A) The tenant gives the LANDLORD notice that he will not return to the property; B) The tenant removes his personal belongings from the property, fails to pay the rent, and does not return for (15) fifteen days; C) The tenant fails to pay the rent and does not return to the property for one month; or D) The tenant leaves personal belongings in the property after the end of the lease *If the tenant abandons the property, the LANDLORD may enter and relet the property In this case, the LANDLORD may also remove and dispose of any personal property left behind by the tenant.

So, basically, if I abandon the property, which I will be doing technically, my landlord can re-let my apartment. I assume I'll lose my security deposit, which is equal to July's rent. My other issue is that I now have to purchase about $200 worth of stuff before I leave (that's a higher estimate, but still reasonably close), and I won't have my refund from dropping my summer classes (I had to quit them for reasons unrelated to this, but would have any way now) before I leave. I also don't know yet when I'm getting my first stipend, or how much it'll be, because all the information I have is about team member pay schedules. I might find this out when I find out about the position, but that's not a guarantee obviously. 

I'm just like concerned about a lot of things--should I *tell* my landlord I'm leaving? If I do, that constitutes abandonment and then I don't have to pay July's rent (but I think my roommates would have to come up with my portion?), but if I don't and she finds out when it's time for me to get my security deposit back, I'll lose the deposit AND July's rent. If I spent part of my rent money to pay for the things I MUST have before I leave and count on my stipend, I don't want to have to ask my parents to cover the portion that I won't have. 

I'm currently between jobs because my paid internship ended in April and no one wants to hire someone who's leaving in two months (trust me, I tried).

Does anyone have advice? Sorry that this is so long and convoluted."
4ms7lj,3,2016-06-06,How to stop the self sabotage?,Miertje,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/4ms7lj/how_to_stop_the_self_sabotage/,"So, a little over seven months ago I slowly came to the realization that my childhood had some pretty abusive marks and that my sadness and feeling of not belonging and anxiety and low self esteem actually did have a cause and I could not snap out of it. I moved out, fell in love, had a job for a while, and then found a great internship. The job was very tedious and downright soulsucking (call center, very repetitive, boring, having to be cheerful and chirpy all the time). When I started the internship I couldn't maintain the fakeness and quit the job (both were parttime). Now my parents are financially supporting me, but I hate it (duh).

They reluctantly agreed to support me until I start my MA in september, but I stated from the beginning that I will look for ways to support myself. They asked me how much I needed and when I told them sum x , they did not reply to the email and just transfered sum x - 100 euros to my account. Every month they will wait for my call to tell them it hasn't been transferred yet, basically making me stand in front of them with my palms up.

I hate to admit it but in the meantime I also haven't been that pressed to find a job. I want to do something that will fulfill me at least a little, but at the same time it's like I feel that I don't deserve that? My parents told me to just get a job (be a cleaning lady! work in a supermarket) when I think that with my BA I could get a more suitable job than that?! 

Yet I am now also failing at my internship, after having moved away and in w/ my boyfriend. It always goes like this. I always fuck stuff up. The first couple of months went so well and the people at the internship seemed really happy with my work, but now I find it hard to even respond to e-mails and the longer I wait the more I deepen and perpetuate my feeling of worthlessness. 

How do I get out of this abyss? I know I am just self-sabotaging, eating bad food, distracting myself etc. but the underlying shame and guilt and the thick layers of worthlessness are still there, while I thought they had melted away seven months ago. What is that?"

(Lengthy explaination included),throwaway_anon65,internetparents,https://www.reddit.com/r/internetparents/comments/4msaq9/my_life_is_going_downhill_fast_and_i_feel_myself/,"Before I start to elaborate, I am aware that maybe many of my problems rely on perspective. But that doesn't help with the fact, that I feel sick and worried almost constantly and in a way helpless.

Disclaimer: This will be a wall of text, so please bear with me. Also, I posted the exact same text on /r/Advice, but didn't get any answers. I hope /r/InternetParents may be more helpful.

Somewhat of a TL;DR at the bottom.

I am a 23 year old student, living in central europe, about to finish my bachelors degree. Well, that's what's supposed to happen. I am behind with both parts of my 2 part bachelor thesis and I'm missing some ECTS for me to actually get the diploma. So what this basically means is, I have to do a ton of work I am neither motivated for nor do I actually have too much time for.

I am currently also working as an Intern in a company and they will send me to China for the next 5 weeks, starting this wednesday. I don't know what I will do there, because I was not given almost any training whatsoever, but they trust that I will manage. I am not so sure and I am actually kind of terrified.

I was also an ERASMUS student in the previous semester and was living in a scandinavian country for a semester, half a year ago. I was somewhat depressed before I went there and I was hoping my mood and my outlook on life would lighten up while I was there, which it actually did. I did somewhat good in the social aspects of my life there, which was always a weak point of me. I also met a girl there and we fell in love. Everything good so far, right? I went home last christmas and she stayed there for another semester. We promised to stay in close contact and that we will meet up as soon as we can. We were skyping a lot at first, WhatsApp, SnapChat and all that. Over time i noticed that this didn't hold up. She found new friends among the newly arrived students, things happened. To cut this part extremely short: Where we all lived there was a scuicide, they grew very close, calling themself a family; I was somewhat glad, she had people there she liked/loved that cared for her and that everything was fine with her. But that turned against me as she got less and less time and interest for me. I felt that coming a long way. We went from sending each other loving and cute messages to barely any messages at all, and I was reluctant to give it up, so I almost desperately tried to keep up conversations. Usually those would be cut short after a few messages though with something like ""I have to go/I have to cook/I have to work"". I felt abbandonned. But we promised each other stuff before. So this friday I reminded her of one of the promises we gave each other: That we will always be honest with each other, if we ask each other stuff. I bit the bullet and simply asked her, if she still loved me as she did when I left. After a considerable break she answered, she loves me as a Friend. I was/am destroyed. I was quite invested in a relationship that was practically non-existant. I cried. A lot. I was frustrated and I wanted to talk, but she didn't. I wanted to know what happened, that I fell out of grace, basically begging her to talk to me, to at least call me on skype. She refused. I told her how I felt, that I felt left out; somewhat abandoned. She said I should stop, because it feels liek I'm emotionally blackmailing her and that it's just as hard for her.

I grew desperate. We were just freinds before we fell in love and I always promised, that I'll be there for her, whatever may happen. A promise I intend to keep. So far I didn't come to a resolution there. Being at work or around people in general is especially hard, because I have nobody to talk about any of this with.

I am somewhat hopeful that I may get to get a proper conversation; that I maybe find out what happened to her feelings for me. Maybe I was too clingy.

Did I mention I am pretty much a PC/Gaming addict? Whenever I try to sit down to do work, maybe write a paper (as in my Bac Thesis) I get distraced and procrastinate. It doesn't help, that my field is generally Computer Science. My room I live in with my Parents looks like a proper mess, beacue I either get distraced when I could dispose of simple stuff like empty bags of chips, or when I'm not playing and I see the mess I loose all motivation to clean and just lie down in bed.

On top of all that, I don't know where I can go, after I've finished my Bach. Degree. Originally I intended to move abroad and maybe settle down with her. But all those dreams I set up seem so foolish now. I got barely any freinds, none of which I feel are close enough to talk about stuff like this. I don't want to stay home or even in my current country, but moving abroad on your own and without anybode you know scares the hell out of me. I am trapped in a desperate mind and I don't see where I can go.

Well, basically this is the kind of emotional shit whirlpool my head is swimming it's rounds in. I don't see a ladder, I see no escape.
What I feel I really need right now is someone I can talk to; maybe some advice; maybe a friend. Hell if I knew I wouldn't be here. Venting all this felt somewhat good. But that doesn't solve any problems yet.

TL;DR: I am a young academic who probably lost his only opportunity to score with a gorl I really love and who has no perspectives regarding his future.
PS: I apologise for any spelling errors I may have made, but I wrote this quickly and emotionally laden and english is not my mother tongue."

His position and tenure had allowed him his pick of new interns and staff, every gung-ho MIT grad or high-school whiz kid gravitated to his team. He had also had some....latitude with his personal assistants. Not only did they make his reservations, take care of his calendar, and all the normal duties; they also saw to 'other duties as assigned'. This included a specific dress code (short skirts, stockings, stilettos), as well as a certain amount of 'hands-on' assignments after work hours.

However, Mr. Jones eventually tired of the parade of twenty-somethings that made up his past assistants. They were willing and eager, however, they usually required training and close supervision. How many times had he corrected a young girl about not having her stocking seams straight, or looked down during one of his evening blowjobs to see them on their cell phones, or taught them how to properly wear a corset?

This time, he wanted a personal assistant with some *experience*. Someone in their 30's or 40's, someone that might bring something to the table. Like they say about tennis; you can't get better unless you play someone better than yourself! He got the word out to one of his former assistants in HR, and they came up with a few candidates. He will be interviewing them today, and you are one of the candidates.

Mr. Jones is in his mid-40's, six feet tall, barrel-chested, with brown hair (that has some gray mixed in). He wears glasses and has a beard. He has a charming smile and a wicked sense of humor....

 I currently live with my parents but they themselves have no income at the moment, and collectively we have saved some money (which is enough to pay for my remaining tuition).  The main issue is cost of living here (which is not that compromisable) and in the remaining two years of studying, that comes to a staggering amount of at least 50k...which would NOT be within our means.

I will work as an intern during my upcoming summer vacation (for 3-4 months), having had my engineering diploma, but that's my last full break until graduation.

Thankfully I still have time before our funds run out, but how could I possibly earn any money while going to uni full time (which takes up most of my weekdays/weekends)? I'd greatly appreciate any help or ideas!

EDIT: the saving we have together is a secondary set...my parent have their own retirement funds which is just for them to live by themselves

4muitg,92,2016-06-06,Timothy Fosu-Mensah: From de Bijlmer to Old Trafford. Translated article from Voetbal International (Dutch football magazine),Allard1994,reddevils,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddevils/comments/4muitg/timothy_fosumensah_from_de_bijlmer_to_old/,"*Out of nothing he made his debut for Manchester United, followed up by an invitation for the Dutch national team, but Timothy Fosu-Mensah (18) says in his first big interview: “It’s not a fairytale. I’m not really surprised by it”*

The Coming Man of the Dutch football does not take a holiday in Dubai, Ibiza or Miami, but sits on the couch in Amsterdam-Zuidoost, on the seventh floor in an apartment overlooking de Bijlmer. Inside it’s cozy and warm, small is beautiful. There’s a prize cabinet, a huge smart-tv, and on the wall there are some photos. Just the flip-flops prove that we’re in front of a player from Manchester United. On those, Timothy wrote his kitnumber, just next to the logo of The Red Devils. “Ofcourse I am proud”, he says, “but I don’t flaunt with it.” 

De Bijlmer is for Fosu-Mensah the ideal place to unwind after a season that changed his life forever. Over here he isn’t a Mancunian but just Tojo, the boy from the hood, who played football down on the streets and football courts day and night.  De district has a bad reputation. Last week someone got murdered, but de Bijlmer is especially warmth, solidarity, homecoming. “I was born in this house and don’t feel bigger or better than anyone in the district. My friends from my childhood are my friends now. In Manchester I live together with my dad. The evenings are long. We watch football on tv, or play on the Playstation. Everything for peace and focus. Occasionally I’ll go into the city, drink coffee with Rodney Kongolo and Javairo Dilrosun who play at Manchester City, but they don’t live around the corner. That’s why I am here, and not on a holiday. I live a beautiful life, but one con is that you can’t go a few staircases up or down to be with your friends. Now I can do that for a few weeks, now I can be distracted. We hang out, do nice things, go anywhere we like, laugh, have fun. No, during those times we don’t talk about my career, then I am just one of the boys. I really like it, that is recreation for me.”

**Development; “It can’t go fast enough for me”**

Now he does talk, for once. He realizes that a star can rise fast, just like that he became famous in Holland after his debut for Manchester United. “People talk about a fairy tale, a child’s book.” Fosu-Mensah says. “They all ask me if I am surprised about my development, that I already made my debut for Manchester United, that I got an invite for an internship with the Dutch national team in Portugal, that it all goes so fast with me.. If I have to answer honestly, I would say no. I’m happy, not surprised. It can’t go fast enough for me. My whole life I have set goals for myself, This season I was with the U-21’s of United. In that case it only makes sense what the next step will be. The only thing you can do, is work hard. And that’s what I did. And then you wait for the opportunity to arise. Louis van Gaal did that. After that you will have to play well, and I did that too. I do however realize that there’s a lot of room for improvement.”

He tells his story on the day that Manchester United announced the arrival of José Mourinho to replace the sacked Louis van Gaal. Fosu-Mensah is quiet. “I’m going to call Van Gaal. But I’m going to wait for the right moment. Unfortunately, I did not run into him at United, but I did see Marcel Bout, the scout. I told him that I owe van Gaal for eternity. Same goes for the rest of the staff, like Ryan Giggs and Albert Stuivenberg. The former talked with me a lot, like after the semi-final of the FA Cup against Everton, when I played well but also caused a penalty. “Stay on your feet in situations like that”, Giggs told me. Learned so much from him. And with Stuivenberg I watched the footage of the things I did wrong.” He did, but according to the media the senior players of Manchester United went crazy because of Van Gaal’s approach. Fosu Mensah: “I can only speak for myself, and for me Van Gaal has been really good. Yes, he was present and talked a lot, but that’s how he treated everyone, with the aim to make you a better player. For me that worked out, I can feel it.” 

Now Mourinho has arrived, not known for his feeling with the youth, but a proven manager nonetheless. The Special One has already said that he is eager to work with Fosu-Mensah. Mohammed Sinouh is negotiating with Manchester United for a new and better contract. Fosu-Mensah realizes: “You’re 18 years old and you’ve already had Louis van Gaal and José Mourinho as managers. It’s simply unbelievable. I’ve never heard a player talk badly about Mourinho. I’m curious, under him I want to further develop myself into a top-player for Manchester United. That’s the next step in my plan.”

**AJAX: “There was no plan”**

Timothy Fosu-Mensah seemed destined for Ajax. The club who picked him up from Zeeburgia, another talent-factory. He sums them up: “Luciano Narsingh, Kenny Tete, Oussama Tannane… Zeeburgia has always had good youth. We won everything, except from Ajax. We always took a beating. Ajax had the likes of Abdelhak Nouri, Steven Bergwijn. Good players, but I stood out in those matches and was invited to join Ajax.” He passed the education with ease, same with the representing Dutch youthteams U-15, -16, -17 and -19. It was waiting for a reward, a contract, but that didn’t happen, while other players from his class did get them. 

At home it wasn’t cake and sunshine either. His father took another job to keep the family rolling. When Manchester United came knocking, it wasn’t just an improvement on a sports level. Fosu Mensah: “But let me tell you, I chose for my own development. United had a plan, so did Ajax, but only when I told them I was moving to England. Yes, there are enough experts out there that think players leave too early. Let me ask you: should you ignore a chance like that? Look at Jeffrey Bruma. He is probably going to make an amazing transfer. Karim Rekik plays at Olympique Marseille. Did they turn out worse? Nathan Aké played amazing for an entire season at Watford. Is that worse than playing in the Eredivisie? I can notice that I’ve become a better player on all fronts.”

“Especially on a physical level, regarding football the step wasn’t as big. I started with the U-18s. Marcus Rashford was the first to see to me and made me feel free. On the pitch it went without saying. Just like with Ajax, we did everything with the ball, but the biggest difference was with power training. That’s an essential part of the training at United. I noticed it right away when I entered the dressing room. All the English boys we’re muscular. I was tall and skinny. And look at me now, tall but strong as well. The training in the gym is tough, but if you want to play in the Premier League you need to gain some mass. You can feel the development pretty fast, and that motivates to keep going. You want to go with the flow, you want more, more, more. Another big difference with Ajax is the artificial pitch. At De Toekomst we played a lot on that surface. In England we do everything on real grass. The ball bounces and rolls differently. It’s not that I had a lot of trouble, but it was some getting used to. I think real grass is better for the development of a player. In England I have never played on an artificial pitch.”

**LOUIS VAN GAAL: “If he comes, you know that youth will get it’s chance.”**

He also had the opportunity to join Arsenal. “Talks were pretty advanced, but eventually I chose for United, because Van Gaal was going to be their manager. If he comes, you know that youth will get it’s chance. Now you can say I made the right choice. Van Gaal gave debuts to 14 youth players. Fourteen! Marcus Rashford, Jesse Lingard, me.. I owe everything to van Gaal. Just before my debut I had a chat with him. With the U-18s and the U-21s I played a lot in the midfield or central defence. Van Gaal said he had problems with the right-back position. He just knew I could play there as well. Van Gaal watched every U-21s match, he knew my qualities. And I trained with the first team when I was part of the U18s. On one day – I’ll never forget it – I was training for myself at Carrington in the indoor hall. Our coach Paul McGuiness entered, pointed to me, Marcus Rashford, Axel Tuanzebe and Devonte Redmond. “You! Report at the first team!”. That day Van Gaal wasn’t there, his assistants Stuivenberg and Giggs were in charge. Just like that I was on the pitch with all those stars, and they were normal guys who were willing to do anything to help you.”

“He’s a good listener”, Fosu-Mensah says. “To Michael Carrick, Chris Smalling, and to the Dutch guys Daley Blind and Memphis Depay. I sit in the dressing room and just listen to what everyone has to say. And especially to our captain, Wayne Rooney. I remember that in the semi-final against Everton I recovered the ball in the 44th minute. I crossed the midfield and tried to reach Rashford, but that pass was intercepted. Then Rooney approached me and said: “Timothy, 44th minute, keep the ball in the team.” Small things, but they make you a better player. And they all do it, Juan Mata, Marouane Fellaini; no one feels himself too big to help. I absolutely love that. And then you realize they have great banter as well. The dressing room from Ajax doesn’t differ that much of that of Manchester United.”

**DEBUT: “I didn’t sleep that night”**

In the living room Fosu-Mensah turns on the smart-tv and looks for Youtube videos of himself. “It just makes me happy”, he says. We see him dribble against Tottenham Hotspur, we see him give a great pass to Anthony Martial in the match with Everton. And we see him shaking hands with Marcos Rojo, before he comes on against Arsenal at Old Trafford. His debut. “That is the moment of my career thus far. I arrived at the club for the match on Saturday, did what I always do, got my breakfast, until Louis van Gaal asked me if I brought my club-suit. “No,” I said. About an hour later he came back and told me that I was in the squad. He asked if my dad could bring my suit. I didn’t sleep that night. All I was doing is visualize the match against Arsenal, I was that eager to play. Make my debut against Arsenal, that would be nice on my list. The next day I started on the bench, pretty nervous. During half-time Van Gaal said that I should go on the cardio, warm up my muscles. “You’re coming on soon.” When I did my warm-up on the sideline and looked around me, I got a warm feeling inside: Old Trafford, Arsenal, this was it. After that I also started in the semi-final of the FA Cup.”

Especially since the Everton match his life changed drastically. Fosu-Mensah played so well that Twitter exploded. On Instagram he has 230 thousand followers, but the fame has its cost. A player of United is as privileged as he is outlawed. The tabloids never sleep. Fosu-Mensah looks ahead. “You need to watch your steps, know who you hang out with, your world shrinks. When you’re in the city, on the airport, everyone wants something from you. That’s something you will have to learn to cope with.

**COPY: “My brother will be better than me”**

The sun dawns over de Bijlmer, Fosu-Mensah is heading out. He goes to the training of his little brother Paul. “He is fifteen and plays in the Ajax Youth. He’s like a copy of me, we play on the same position. He will be better than me. At least, I hope so. I really want it for him. Maybe one day we will play together at a big club, in the heart of the defence. Why not? If I learned one thing this season, it’s that everything is possible, as long as you believe.

4mvmhe,2,2016-06-06,[F4A] The Basic Protocol - New World Order,CrowmeatDPP,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/4mvmhe/f4a_the_basic_protocol_new_world_order/,"""War"" may be a bit of an exaggeration, but anyone who claims that Western society is living in racial harmony has their head buried in the sand. Just turn on the news, the US, Europe, it's the same story everywhere. It's not anyone's fault, really- we're genetically designed to associate with those like us. But we're also designed to compete and conquer...

Let's introduce the Black Broadcast Capitalist Enterprises. International underground firm that is part of almost every market imaginable. News broadcasting, commercials, auctioning, farming, construction, law, politics, the film industry, sports... Everything. Though they always have cover-ups, ghost companies used to hide them from true sight. Most of the world has slowly been taken over by BBCE, and now they control enough to start moving.

Nearly every employee for the BBCE and their underling companies is of African descent, and the ones that aren't are very attractive white girls. Well, they weren't very attractive white girls at the start, but the BBCE works in the research industry and the cosmetic industry, and also the plastic surgery industry. They are very attractive now. Though they don't date, they deny any man that talks to them. Apart from a black man. And then if a girl talks to them, well, they'll introduce them to that high-paying secretary job at BBCE, and the cycle continues...

Now, however, they can start their original goal. To make the Black Race supreme. They've always been working towards this goal. Money is funneled into interracial porn productions, sent as child support payments to Black men and the women they breed, used to fund tuition for Black students to attend historically white colleges and universities and support the propaganda spewing Tumblr blogs they write filled with smut. In fact, BC Enterprises is the largest source of funding for the advancement of the Black race the world has ever seen- and it's working. Only, they are ready to launch a new initiative.

the Basic Protocol. Designed to target basic white girls, ones that are cute and the ones that are stunningly hot, the goal is that by the end of the year, nearly every white girl will dream of BBC stretching them out and being filled with the superior sperm. Of course, that takes time... And testing. If people suddenly get suspicious of the copious amounts of interracial porn that they can watch, targeted towards them in particular... No, the BBCE got to where they are now by patience and waiting. They were slaves by these stupid white men, now they'll enslave them. Only, they won't realize they are being enslaved until all their women are breeding black children and every job is taken by the superior black race.

The BBCE control everything, as mentioned above. And when I say everything... I truly mean everything! Every market, every business, everything is managed and monitored. If the BBCE want a famous celebrity to go black, for example Kim Kardashian... They start to influence her. Replace her friends' thoughts and let her friends convert her. Whisper in her ear. And then they put down their hand-made celebrity Kanye West to sweep in and finish the job. Now, millions of teens on instagram look up to Kim, and her sexy black husband...

This is only an example. The first step to the project is to pick a fresh target. I am sure that you boys can find a nice picture of a pretty girl who is ready to be tested and moulded into her ideal image! Then, the influence begins. Start replacing boys in her school with black ones, have her watch her crush get beaten up by a gang of muscular black guys. Surround her with pretty black men and... Her friends. Her friends will be converted in advance, on a more... Enhanced version of the protocol. Sped up. Her friends already love black cock and eagerly work for BBCE. They giggle and point out things like how much bigger and more dominant black men are...

And then they steer it towards sexual conversation. Is it true that black men are bigger? Is it true that once you go black, you can't go back? Stuff like this. Questions that keep our target up at night, pondering about them... At this point, we'll begin to convert her family. Take the men of the house out, her brothers and father, replace them with a new black step-father. This is a long process, but the black agent who will play as the step-father will begin to play subliminal messaging and hypnotic videos that are disguised as films. Ones that get her horny as the sex scenes get steamier, the ones that make her close her eyes at night, but not for sleeping.

Then we amp it up after a few weeks of this. After this amount of time, she's into black guys. But still into whites... And that can't do. We'll make her give a BJ or have sex with a white guy and his tiny penis, and then afterwards, a few days later, have her accidently walk into her step-father, or maybe find a beefed out black guy in the gym showers... Maybe asked on a date from the basketball player in school. And they'll get it on, slowly but surely.

She should have her first black cock within two weeks of amping it up. Then, we give her more black cock, and tiny white cock as well. From there, she'll make her choice. We'll get her addicted to the stunning pleasure of BBC, and then the BBCE will give her an internship at one of their prestigious offices, far away from her family. There, they'll pump her up into an airheaded bimbo secretary and... Rinse and repeat. Until they get the formula for the Basic Protocol down.

Then... They can release it upon the world.

---

The best message to me would be starting off the roleplay by writing about one of the girls. You'll play any man that comes up, and the world and how it reacts to the Basic Protocol, but also about the brainwashing and the effects it has on the four girls! So mentioning how they find themselves thinking about black men... Stuff like that. I'm more likely to ignore you if you don't write a response to the roleplay and get stuck in straight away, just because I can see your writing talent and whether we'll be a good match! "
4mw2c4,2,2016-06-06,Transitioning from School to Working Full-Time,arcanition,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/4mw2c4/transitioning_from_school_to_working_fulltime/,"So, this might be a long-winded post as I'm pretty stressed out concerning my whole life situation. To sum up my history: I attended school from 3rd grade all the way through college in my current area. School was a great time, because even though I'm a pretty typical internet/gaming nerd and not extremely social, I had tons of free time to spend on my hobbies (mainly gaming/internet, but other things too) as well as time to spend with friends.

When I was about 15 I was diagnosed with depression, mainly due to my weight, and was put on two antidepressants (citalopram and buproprion) that I am still on. I've lost some weight over the years, put on some during the last year but I've hopped back on my diet (/r/keto) to try and lose more. For the most part my depression has been pretty well managed. I feel great most days, but rarely when I have stressful things going on I feel that depression feeling that I know well enough. I am not and have never been suicidal or anything, when I get depressed I just feel very sad.

Anyway, I had two full-time summer internships while I was in college which were great experiences. I wasn't terribly stressed out during either because it was a light at the end of the tunnel scenario, I knew it was only going to be 3 or so months of working 40 hours a week and then I'd have a bunch of free time again.

But now I've graduated and started a full-time job, this time for the long term. I know I've just started, but I'm stressed out because of this major change. It just seems so bleak, I get up early, go to work, work all day long, and then by the time I get home at 5-5:30 I'm exhausted and don't have very much time to do what I love before I need to head to sleep at ~11.

I realize working full-time is what 99.999% of people do, because you need to earn money, but how do I get out of this feeling? Is it just due to the massive shift in my life? I feel like somewhere down the line I made a wrong decision in my life path, even though I've always been an engineering-type and loved engineering, it feels like an engineering job is just slaving away. I work just yearning for free time to game, browse the internet, relax, and hang with friends... ugh. I know that life is never as bleak as I feel it may be, but it just looks bleak thinking about how I will be working 40 hours a week every single week (or most, at least) for decades to come.

Anyway, thank you so much for any who took the time to read this, and thank you for any advice you can offer."

I actually know why, and it's not what you might think at first. It's poor quality coders coming out of their degrees thinking they're Mr. (Ms.) Big and that they're the best. They're not - they're crap. I saw this the last year at MS when I had interns. OMG. I'm sure I would have left because of them if I hadn't have gotten married.

(If you don't want to read my whole spiel, the questions are at the bottom.)

 I recently graduated college, (last 4 weeks) and by the end of my college career I realized I wanted to be an iOS Engineer. 

Just a little background, I do have previous coding experience. I have completed different courses in iOS development:

* [**CodePath University**](http://codepath.com/iosbootcamp)
*  [**Stanford CS193p Course on the iTunes U Store**](https://itunes.apple.com/us/course/developing-ios-9-apps-swift/id1104579961)

Also, I have even successfully deployed an **[app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1118574083)** to the app store, and have a bunch of projects completed on my Github to back it up. Also, I've been doing freelance web development since I was 16. (I'm 22 now)

I started off majoring in a field that I really wasn't interested in, and wasn't able to change out when I realized what my true interests were. The main problem is, how do I find that **FIRST** job where I can show people my coding competency?

Every time I go into an interview, I seem to wow the recruiters, but I always hear back saying ""we're looking for someone with a bit more experience"" or ""we went with someone with a background in computer science"", always giving me no feedback on what I could've done to improve.

The questions that I have are:

**1. What did you do for your first iOS development job, and how'd you hear about it?**

**2. What main things should I understand before going into other interviews? (I have a solid understanding of UIKit, AFNetworking, and some other Cocoapod frameworks)**

**3. What advice can you give me about finding a job in iOS development? Should I be open to internships as well?**

Any answer really helps, thank you so much if you took the time to read all this!

We've done long distance a handful of times throughout the years, including this summer. Right now he has an internship across the country, and I am working a waitressing job where I alternate morning and evening shifts. 

During this time I have not been satisfied with how much we have been communicating. We don't get the chance to talk on the phone very often, so we mostly rely on texting. Today, BF has told me that he will be busy until 8 every weekday (9 my time) for the rest of the summer and won't be able to text me until after that time (he has work and then does interview practice with his friend after that). This makes me really sad because that means most days we won't be able to talk at ALL. I tried asking him to shoot me one or two texts throughout the day just so we can keep in some sort of contact but he pretty much told me he's too busy to do that. 

I don't really know where to go from here. Even on the weekends he doesn't communicate much. He's either doing work-related things or watching sports or recently going out with his friends. I have been feeling like the last priority on his list, especially since he couldn't compromise at all. I feel so frustrated and sad, what do I do?

4mx7pk,2,2016-06-07,Trying to save for an MBA - Need Advice,Walt96,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4mx7pk/trying_to_save_for_an_mba_need_advice/,"I recently started a new job in consulting and I am interested in pursuing an MBA in five years from now to continue in consulting. I am trying to save $200,000 prior to starting my MBA so I do not need to accept any sort of loans when the time arrives. My company does not provide any sort of MBA sponsorship.

[Here] (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mkl5NpqAVu3YOX1NmK5OkTN5nXqwzx37jKFm66Cqof4/edit?usp=sharing) is my budget along with a simple calculation describing my annual returns to savings. For tax purposes, I am single with zero dependents living in NYC.

A few questions:

**1.** My company offers a 401K matching 25% of the first 6% of base pay after one full year of employment. This match is vested immediately. I decided to maximize my contributions to a traditional IRA to leverage the tax benefits and because I am permitted to use these funds for the MBA if needed without penalty. However, after a year, I am unsure if I should begin contributing to my 401K instead of the IRA. This uncertainty stems from the fact that I can make distributions from my IRA penalty-free while I am unable to with my 401K given my goals. I cannot take out a loan against my 401K. 

**2.** I am considering positioning myself in my present company in such a way where I can deduct the full cost of my MBA as an unreimbursed business expense. This deduction will likely alleviate any tax liability I incur when I make the distributions from my retirement accounts and some income I earn throughout school, including internships. This is my rationale for why I am debating between a traditional 401K and a traditional IRA and not their Roth counterparts. Is this too risky?

**3.** I am wondering if it's worth contributing to a 529 plan. I am able to deduct up to $5,000 from state and local taxes if I contribute that amount, which is why I have it listed. Interested in hearing feedback.

**4.** For my projected budget, I have an effective tax rate of about 28 percent. Is this an accurate figure? It seems so high for an entry level position.

Thank you!"
4mx94h,3,2016-06-07,"Got an internship in Exton, need help finding a viable commute without a car",DidacticApple,philadelphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/4mx94h/got_an_internship_in_exton_need_help_finding_a/,"So I got an internship offer this summer at a company ~5 miles away from the Exton Station. 

The internship's a 6 week program, so it doesn't make much sense for me to get my car shipped out there, since it'd be ~$1000 one way. Car rental would also be cost prohibitive (~$2700) since I'm under 25. From what I've read biking from Exton Station is a bit of a nightmare.

My tentative plan right now is to find a sublet near UPenn or Villanova, take the train over to Exton Station in the morning, and take an Uber/Lyft over from there.

From my calculations this'll be an expensive commute (~$13 for the train daily, ~$25 for Uber/Lyft), but I don't see a viable alternative. It's a large company and there'll be other interns, so I'm hoping to find someone to carpool/rideshare with, but wanted to be prepare for a worst case scenario. 

So essentially my main questions are:

* Is what I've proposed feasible?

* Is there a more cost/time effective alternative to my plan?

* Would finding an Uber/Lyft around commute hours at Exton Station be feasible?"

I have benefits, he doesn't but his pay is pretty good. A month later we got married, it was small and we managed to pay off our student debt right afterwards. We are both in our mid-20's, have dogs and no kids. 

We were living in a spacious 1,100 sq foot apartment in the Midwest and spending less than 900 a month to live there in a nice neighborhood. Now we are paying over 1,500 a month to live in a studio that is about 575 sq feet and in a not so pleasant neighborhood. We have had a lot of safety issues such as car break ins, stabbings and so on right around us. I found a nicer, larger apartment on the outskirts of the city that would save us about 400 a month, but we'd have to pay a 4,000 dollar lease break fee for our current place. We originally signed an 18 month lease. To be honest, I'm not particularly crazy about the city we moved to, we could have moved other places in the country that are a lot nicer and cost of living is less. But I'm not sure if I just feel that way since I don't like where we currently live. 

We have been working on building up an emergency savings and a house fund. It became easier once my husband was able to get on my insurance after marriage and having no student debt. I have a decent paying job with good benefits, a matching 401K and education incentives. But the job isn't really what I thought it'd be. It's been 4 months since I started and I'm beginning to think about when I should look for a new job. I'm hoping in about a year to be able to move to a different position within the company and maybe move to a different location. It is a professional job and my previous jobs in the field were all co-ops and internships. My original hope was to have this company pay for me to get my master's, but my husband keeps saying that it may not be worth it. Meanwhile, people keep encouraging us to buy property in this city since ""it's only going to keep going up there!"" In about a year, we could save up enough probably to put a down payment on a condo. But is it really worth it  to look into making that investment if it's in a place I don't really want to live in? 

I think I would probably have a better attitude if I didn't feel unsafe where we lived. Is it worth it financially to stay in a place with these issues, in a job that I'm not thrilled with but has good benefits and to stick it out to have the company pay for my masters?"

Some T:

1) Pretty much all funny black queens that resembled or were similar to Bob were almost immediately cut.

2) Similarly only expect one NYC queen to be cast due to the 'overload' of NYC queens last season. BibleGirl666 and Erika Klash are the only two being considered.

3) Elaine Lancaster was requested by Ru, as she apparently just heard about the news story about Elaine saving a man's life from last year.

4) Cara Mel is going to be the 'Secret Asian Queen' for S9.

5) Laila McQueen and Sasha Belle applied for S9 and aren't 100% no, but were put aside as a ""maybe"" and are 'unofficially"" 26/27 on the shortlist.

6) The producer's want to try to recapture the ""Chi Chi Magic"" and are considering a handful of unknown queens on the shortlist from various parts of the country.

7) Amalara Sofía and/or Rochelle Mon Chéri are being considered for the official PR queen(s) of the season though there are some other PR queens from other parts of the country on the list.

8) The cast will be back to 14 this year with no AS2 taking away some of the budget.

We work for quite a large company but in our current work situation I wouldn't want to damage her career path or my own. Although we used to work on the same floor, I've moved into a position that isn't in the same office as her.

Everything about her is amazing, I am extremely attracted to her looks but also her personality is such a great match for mine. Does anyone have advice or a similar experience that they can share?

My BF and I have been LD for the majority of our relationship (6 out of 7 months) though I was going to Uni about 2 hours away from the city we lived in, and could usually manage a visit almost every week.

Summer came and I went back home, and he did come to visit but instead of 5 days like we planned it got shortened to only 1 (long story) and he's taken an internship in a different state putting us now at 7 hours away.

Probably won't be able to see each other until August and even that's iffy since I'm transferring to a different school (4 hours away from each other).

I realize my situation isn't nearly as bad compared to others with a much bigger distance, but honestly school and work take up so much times it's hard to find time to visit. We both miss each other like crazy, and of course we text, Facetime, and snapchat but it isn't the same...

1. Thank you for loving us Americans! Everyone I've run into and talked with has been happy to know I'm American and treats me well. I enjoy knowing the fact I don't have to worry saying I am American.


2: Beautiful countryside. Everywhere

3: It's not as dirty as I expected. I read that there's tons of trash everywhere, but that's not the case fortunately. Seems like sanitary services are cleaning up their act

4: Thank you for not having Mcdonalds or major food chains here, well, besides KFC (It's much better than the states!!)

5. Coffee here is GREAT! 

6: I love the colorful architecture. 

It seems like this country has great potential in it. I hope that it will become better and grow in the following years. I also hope to come back after my internship and perhaps live and work here (bless the visa free 1 year)"
4mya63,1,2016-06-07,I've been seeing my therapist for 9 months.,SoraRyuuzaki,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/4mya63/ive_been_seeing_my_therapist_for_9_months/,"And actually, I'm really happy with her. I love my therapist. She's helped me get through some really tough moments-- including a suicidal episode where I would have made an attempt if I hadn't had an appointment with her that day, the falling out of a 14-year friendship, and many other things-- and I'm so thankful for that. Because of her, I'm finally starting to feel better, and for the first time since the onset of my depression almost three years ago, I feel like this happiness is actually sustainable.

My only problem with my therapist is that in a few months, she'll be leaving. My therapist is a pre-doctoral intern for my counseling center and, because she's an intern, she is able to offer her services at a rate that I can afford. However, come August, her internship will end and she will no longer work for my counseling center. She told me that she doesn't really know what she's going to do afterwards. I'm really afraid and anxious about what this will mean for my therapy sessions-- I don't want to go through the stress of starting with a new therapist-- and I'm really sad that my therapist isn't going to be my therapist soon.

I'm afraid that this will mean my progress is going to stop and I don't want that. For once, I've gotten to the light at the end of the tunnel and am not anxiously waiting for the next tunnel; I'm basking in the light. I'm scared that changing therapists will disrupt my life again and throw me back into the tunnel.

I'm finally starting to feel truly better and I have my therapist to thank for that. I'm just afraid of what will happen when I can't have sessions with her anymore."

I'm currently doing a forensics as an intern (extremely new to this). I've been tasked to find out as much information as possible about a computer infected with ransom ware for one of my projects. Based on clues I suspect the machine has been infected with TeslaCrypt version 2, possibly 2.2 to be exact (although I find specific information on the versions hard to come by). I suspect these versions based on files having the "".vvv"" extensions and the “how_recover+gov” or “how_recover+xlv”.txt, .html extensions. The timeframe for infection is around November-December 2015. It was done through email, suspected attachment. I can’t seem to find any registry modifications or specific .exe files that were dropped. Basically, I’m curious to see if anyone has experienced this same scenario and happen to have a clue as to where the Trojan might be that originally infected the machine or any additional clues that would help me out.

Thanks!

4mztdj,28,2016-06-07,You are stuck. But that's okay.,haplothepatryn,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/4mztdj/you_are_stuck_but_thats_okay/,"I'm on day 43, something I had to look at the IMQuit app on my phone to remember. NoFap has been so far from my mind for the last month, and with good reason.

For almost as long as I can remember I've been suffering from depression. I was depressed throughout grade school and high school. The only good thing about my high school experience, was the fact that my classmates didn't bully me, and at the time that was the best outcome I could have imagined. So I locked myself in. I filled my spare time, my whole life, with the same small circle of outcast friends I went to school with and engaged in endless gaming nights, films, TV-shows and the like. Fiction was the only escape I knew, the only coping mechanism I had. I do have some good memories of that time, but most memories are of my confused and angry teenage mind. As I grew older, I envied the idea of the perfect high school experience. Partying, falling in love and discovering more about myself. It had never happened for me. I just slipped deeper into myself and eventually moved away from my parents so I could study at the university, all in an attempt to put off the inevitable breakdown. Moving away from home, I saw myself grow a little. I learned that there are legitimately good people in the world, but getting to know these people, I increasingly felt like I was broken inside. Like a piece was missing. There was a secret language, an aspect of humanity, that was mutually understood among my peers. People would call it by many names, in fact, most of them would never use the term 'sex' for it.

I still hadn't lost my virginity. I had never even kissed a girl. The idea frightened me even more than it intrigued me. The pressure of dating, being romantic and sexual was intimidating. I was expected to know things, and to have tried things. I felt blind to the feelings and sensations that everyone else seemed to take for granted. To admit that I'd never experienced these things, I figured, would no doubt send any woman into flight. And with every year it would only get worse, as my friends started getting into steady relationships and found themselves on their own career paths. And I found myself diving deeper. Not wanting to think about it, but instead using PMO as a sort of pressure valve, to keep myself from ever having to stare into the face of this problem. The fiction I used to enjoy started to feel more hollow, as my guilt pushed me further into depression.

And it drove me mad.

I was stuck not living my life. I was hiding from everything and everyone. And I didn't even have the guts to be honest about it.
Eventually, I hit something resembling rock bottom. I had finished my bachelor degree, last year, a year later than intended. All my friends were on track to finish their masters degrees by this summer and my various circles of friends seemed to have their collective ""shit together"".
I started seeing a psychologist, which helped a great deal. I went to an ACT depression therapy group, mostly made up of middle-aged house wives. I sat there and listened, rarely speaking. Dealing with my fragile mind, became my new job. I was able to admit to myself that something was wrong, and that my number one concern had to be dealing with it, or I'd never function again.
The problem was coined by my psychologist as ""The Wall"". An insurmountable obstacle that would keep me from making important decisions. Fears and doubts about making the ""wrong"" choice had crippled me. The pressure of measuring up to my friends and acquaintances was unbearable. And being alone had made me feel guilty too.
All of this made it necessary for me to retreat.

It's been about 4 months now. In that time, I've learned to put words to these feelings, and to accept my situation, and stop fighting it with denial. My latest ""project"", has been to start dating and stop jerking off. And by god has that paid off.
I met her on Tinder. My opening line was the beginning of a corny story, which she thankfully added to, and the exchange lasted only a couple of days, before I managed to secure a date with her. We've now been dating for a month, and with her help I've gone from being terrified and nervous of physical contact, to making innuendo and jokes about sex. I still have a lot to learn from her, but the pain I once felt in the pit of my stomach and the nervous shivering is all gone at this point. She still hasn't claimed my virginity, but the idea of it happening doesn't scare me anymore, as it has basically almost happened a half a dozen times by now.
And she really likes me. For some reason she really likes me. Maybe it's because I don't have any relationship bagage or it's because everything is exciting and new for me, and the smallest of things about her excite me. Either way, I try not think about and just enjoy it.

I start an internship on Friday. It's nothing of substance career wise, in fact it's about as far removed from my education as can be. But I don't really care about that. I just want to do something again. I want to keep seeing her and feeling what I'm feeling. It's the fucking summer and I'm in love and discovering my sexuality and all those things I didn't want to think about in the past.

So my point is this:
For those of you who can recognize something of yourselves in this. Know that it's okay to be stuck. You won't find your way out tomorrow, and you may never find your ""true calling"" or make other people feel envious of you, the way you feel envious of them.
But if you can love someone and be close to them and honest with them, then all this bullshit fear won't have the same power it has.

And don't worry about the possibility of getting hurt. You WILL get hurt. I probably WILL get hurt. But that's a part of it, and it'll suck, but it won't mean that it was a mistake. Just knowing that I'm not terrified of sex anymore, is worth any heartbreak.

If you need help the way I did, get it wherever you can. A professional can be great, and so can family and friends. Just remember that you only get what you give. Be prepared to talk about the deepest darkest things you fear with someone whom you know can help. But don't just tell everything to anyone who offers to lend an ear. You need someone who is qualified and you can feel comfortable with. Not someone who feels awkward talking about it.

PMO isn't the disease. It's the symptom.
But you don't have to find the cure on your own."

    06.07.16 Congress Cannot Be Complacent on Gun Violence
    
    Dear Friend,
    
    Last week, I announced my support for two commonsense pieces of legislation to address gun violence in our communities - one that would lift a de facto twenty-year ban on firearms safety and gun violence prevention research at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and another that would dramatically strengthen background record checks on all private and online firearm sales.
    
    The CDC has the potential to play a vital role in addressing this epidemic. It’s time to put politics aside and provide the agency resources and leeway to do its job. Additionally, a more robust background record check system would help prevent people who are legally barred from owning a firearm from obtaining one. Learn more about the bills here.
    
    Congress cannot be complacent when gun violence remains so prevalent in American society. These are reasonable steps for members of Congress to find common ground and move forward.
    
    Sincerely,
    
     Signature of Senator Tim Kaine

* *Background*

I'm a recently graduated engineer who is moving to Seattle with my partner, who is doing her post doctorate internship at UW. We only found out a few months ago, so I've been in a scramble to find a position (Were coming from the SouthEast), and I have applied to many of the big/medium sized companies in the Greater Seattle Area.

My work experience has included being a design member on a space program that sent a satellite into space. I specifically did equipment testing, analytics on test data, and provided direction over my responsible systems 

Secondly I was contracted by a local hospital as a process engineer; there I used extensive analytics on some large data sets, and designed solutions to improve outcomes for the patients- it has not only resulted in millions in cost savings, but my work there is also saving lives.   

* What I'm looking for

I am specifically searching for systems engineering, product engineering, management consulting, healthcare/biotechnology process improvement roles, and analyst positions. While these are my preferred areas, I'm willing to talk about any manufacturing/supply chain related roles.

I'm a 22 year old recent graduate working a relatively small paying full-time job and some higher-paying part-time internships. I currently have one credit card with a small cash-back bonus, and a checking and savings account with one bank. The checking account has no interest beneath 15,000 dollars (which I will not be able to have in there in the foreseeable future), and the savings account has .01% APY.

This credit card currently has 250 dollars of a 1200 limit, which will be paid off come next statement. My plan is to use this once every three months for my dog's medication, once a year for his check ups, 
and twice a month for his food. I will pay this off in equal increments, maintaining a low balance.

I recently applied for and was approved for one of the Chase credit cards, earning 5% back in certain areas each season (groceries, restaurants) and 1% cash back on all other purchases. My plan for this card is to use it for the qualifying 5% purchases and pay it back in full each statement. 

I already feel slightly stressed having two credit cards on top of my accounts. However, I recently set myself three goals:

* 1. Save 5,000 USD in an emergency fund.
* 2. Pay 350 a month to student loans (minimum payment of 0 for the next year).
* 3. Save 5,000 dollars by this time next year to upgrade from my 1995 car.

I've been looking into other savings accounts, specifically Ally Bank with an APY of 1%, to help save for a new car. However, based on my anxiety from opening a new line of credit, I feel very unsure about expanding and essentially having accounts with four banks.

In short, are there any downsides to having a diverse account portfolio? Are there any issues with my planned use of my credit cards?"
4n1cmg,12,2016-06-07,So I'm not sure any longer than I can do this...,misternm,socialwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialwork/comments/4n1cmg/so_im_not_sure_any_longer_than_i_can_do_this/,"Hi all, it's my first time posting here. I'm not sure what I'm looking for, maybe some advice, some support, someone else who feels or felt the way I do? It is a really difficult time in my life. I'm living with my parents again, and I feel that I dove back into grad school because my family kept encouraging me to do so. I come from a family of psychologists/counselors/social workers, so I'm worried that I just did what they said would be best for me without actually thinking about what I wanted out of life. I've realized I would actually like to be an artist, a writer, an actor, or work in creative field. That is neither here nor there, though, as far as this post goes.

I just graduated at the end of April with my MSW degree. I have been looking for a job, but it has been pretty tough. The one organization that keeps calling me back has been a place that pays a flat rate of $15 an hour, which yes is above poverty line, but also is a bit below what I was hoping for after getting a master's degree. I don't know if I should cave and take a job there just so I have someplace to go during the day and get some experience, or if I should hold out for a couple more months and keep searching. The work at this organization would be highly stressful (to me at least), so I think that part of what I'm doing is holding out for fair pay. Unfortunately in this field, low salaries seem like the norm.

Additionally, I am having major doubts about being able to do clinical work. While I was in school, I felt like I had some real clarity about what I wanted. I enjoyed my classes (though in retrospect I'm pissed because the majority of the classes were kind of a joke and did not prepare us enough at all for what it would be like actually working), I liked all my social work friends, and I connected with the mission of the profession as a whole. Multiple professors told me that I was talented and skilled at clinical work, and I don't think they were just saying it to massage my ego. After my second internship working in mental health veterans, however, I really felt my attitude towards this work really shift. I started to feel completely drained by the work, and dreaded going in every day. All these thoughts about making a career change were playing in my head constantly. I didn't feel rewarded by the work I did, I just felt damaged by having to listen to all these awful stories I was hearing from people and helpless with how little I could do with them. I felt very cynical about the organization I worked at, too, where the caseload was extremely high. I've now begun to believe that this is the posture of a lot of organizations. After all, if a place is only going to pay $15 an hour to work with the severely mentally ill, how much do they really value their workers?

Now I don't know what to do. I've realized I really care about helping people, and I think I would make a good counselor, but I don't know that I can handle the stress of it. I really care about the LGBT population, people living with HIV/AIDs, and numerous other social causes, but I don't know how to turn those interests into a job. 

As negative as I feel I'm coming off right now, I do not feel like social work is incredibly far off from what I want to do, I just don't know if I want to do the clinical work, or work with the ""mentally ill"". I mean, I've got my own damn problems, I can't be absorbing every body else's left and right.  

In graduate school, there was a social work track that involved policy/leadership, but I don't know how to find those jobs practically speaking. I was encouraged by a professor to look into the social work PhD program, and it is tempting because unlike a doctorate in psychology, a doctorate in social work would probably involve more research and teaching, both of which I really like. But as much as I love being in school, I feel it's the last thing I need right now.  I don't want to be four years into a PhD program and realize I can't handle that either. Would it  even make sense to get a PhD in social work if I felt like I was too sensitive to handle the actual practice of it? 

Ultimately, I'm feeling very scared right now, and I feel like in addition to being bummed out about being unemployed, I'm bummed out because I chose a very high stress career that won't pay off. If you've read any of this, I thank you, and applaud your tenacity for dealing with a boring whiner. 

Can anyone offer me any guidance?"

I'm torn between a messenger bag and a backpack because while I've worn both and prefer the looks and access of a messenger, the ergonomics of a backpack work slightly better for my body. Either case, I'm looking for something with

* Laptop compartment for a 13"" laptop, preferably with padding or a stretch compartment 
* A smaller compartment with holders/pockets in addition to the main pocket for all my little thingys and gadgets
* A water bottle pocket on the outside (preferably big enough for a Nalgene). 
* A nuanced/urban style and aesthetic (not necessarily canvas and tweed, but not something that looks like a climbing pack or something a tourist would tote around). 
* Some sort of features/concessions for commuter cycling, but not necessarily a cycling pack.

Ideally, I'd like to not pay more than $125, but if it has the durability and style to survive four years, internships, grad school, and endless commutes, then so be it, cause that's what this is all about."
4n1usd,1,2016-06-07,I [21/f] broke up with my ex-boyfriend (24/m) and don't know if it was the right move. HELP,lelife,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/4n1usd/i_21f_broke_up_with_my_exboyfriend_24m_and_dont/,"so, this guy and I met on tinder in late March. I know probably not a great way to start a relationship right? I'm super shy in person so I had to result to tinder lol. Well anyway, we talked for 2 weeks before we met. We are basically the same people, he loves everything I love shows, movies, music, etc. I was really into the guy but was cautious because after all I did find him on tinder. I grew a pair and we finally met up for coffee in early April and totally hit it off. We had the best date ever. We went out nearly twice a week for the first month that we were together. Everything was going perfectly fine. He even met my parents, which I know is ridiculously early but my parents are super strict and wanted to see who the guy I had been seeing was. He met them and my siblings and parents loved him. this made me feel stronger towards him, and I told him that and that freaked him out which he late revealed after we broke up. 

Anyways, I was truly falling for the guy. But there was always one problem: he's a foreigner (Italian) who was in America for an internship and once it was over in June he had to go back. Because things were going so well with us (in the beginning), he started considering staying in America for a year to see where it would lead, then as he started applying for more internships and not getting any call backs he started losing hope and losing interest in me. I felt him losing interest in me, and when i approached him about it he claimed that he still felt the same way towards me, and that his feelings hadn't changed. But I knew something had changed. There was a time where he finally admitted that he thinks he put way more effort into the relationship than I did. He came to see me by bus 3 times in a month (I live in NJ and he lives in NY) and said that he is always the one wasting money to come to see me. He said he was the only one proposing date ideas. What really put him over the edge is that same one time I made it seem (accidentally, long story) that I didn't want to take the bus on a late friday night to go to his apartment. He freaked out and said that he always takes buses to come see me and I couldn't take a bus to go see him that one time. Anyway after that fight there was an obvious change but he still claimed he felt the same way about me. But I sensed the difference, he stopped proposing dates, he stopped texting me in a sweet and loving way and calling me all the nicknames he used to call me. By this time it was mid-May and I was busy with finals and didn't see him for two weeks. He barely texted me, and when I texted him saying ""I miss you"" or anything like that he'd be distant. And again, I would ask if there was something wrong and he'd reply no every time. I kept hoping things would get better, but they never did. He barely even spoke to me anymore and I got tired of wondering how my own boyfriend felt about me and so I decided to end things. Things have been over for two weeks now and his internship ends this Friday and he leaves to Italy next week. Sometimes I feel like I shouldn't have gave up on him so easily, I should've waited a little longer to see if things would have gotten better but there was always a time limit on our relationship since day one and ultimately I think that is why our relationship was probably destined to end. But the first month we were together was amazing. We clicked immediately, I seriously thought he might have been ""the one"" but things started to change, as I said. And I was hurt that he didn't respect me enough to tell him his true feelings. During our breakup he said that meeting my parents so early freaked him out (which I get, TOTALLY UNDERSTANDABLE. I regret it.) but he never told me that when we were together. And then the whole idea that he said that I put no effort (which I still think I did, i got him gifts and was planning surprises for his birthday in late may, and went to see him in the city too, and came up with dates) stemmed from his past relationship where his ex didn't put as much effort as he did and so he was fast to judge me based on his past relationship. But I do believe I could've put a little more effort I guess, but I think he gave up on me a while ago and didn't tell me. I was constantly telling him exactly how I felt about him while he wasn't feeling the same way about me. When I broke up with him it wasn't because I stopped liking him, I still like him very much, I was just tired of the wondering and scared of getting hurt. I was hurting and didn't want to hurt anymore. 
SORRY THIS IS SO LONG. So basically he leaves to Italy next week. I haven't talked to him in like 5 days and I miss him so much. It hurt when I was with him, but it hurts way more without him. What if I made a mistake? What if I shouldn't have broken up with him? I keep thinking of our first month together and how good it was... But he leaves to Italy next week and I know there's no time to fix anything. But I was wondering if it's a good idea to reach out to him one last time and ask to meet at least to say goodbye? I don't want to leave it on a bad ending. I really liked him so much, I know it was just 3 months together but he really meant so much to me. He became everything to me. Because we were only together for 3 months I won't say I loved him because it was too soon to tell, but MAN I could've loved him SO much.
 I want to say goodbye, but at the same time I don't know if he'd even want to, I mean I WAS the one who broke up with him. But I don't want to regret not saying goodbye. Should I text him to see if he'd want to meet up one last time? 

I appreciate any advice on any part of the relationship. Thanks for reading all of this lol &lt;3 "
4n253y,3,2016-06-07,"I feel like my (21M) girlfriend (20F) doesn't realize how important my job is, and I'm starting to think about our entire relationship.",sonicsloth69,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4n253y/i_feel_like_my_21m_girlfriend_20f_doesnt_realize/,"My girlfriend (Let's call her J) and I have been dating for a little over a year now, and I truly believe that I love her, which is a big first for me. We met and attend the same college, so normally we are together almost all the time (we live in seperate apartments but she stays over almost every night) but we live in separate states so over the summer we're long distance. 

Some background, J is very kind, funny, and beautiful and I know she really does care about me a lot. But everybody has their faults and J is not without hers. She has a very ambivalent attitude towards school and work in general, and sometimes I feel like she can get clingy. I mostly can look past the clinginess though, she honestly just loves me a lot and wants to be with me all the time. I'm not without my faults either, I can be rather antisocial at times and J and my friends have to convince me to come out of my shell occasionally, and when I do I hardly regret it. J has really made me become more social and has really increased my happiness in general, and its noticeable to my friends and family. Sometimes we can clash, for example there have been multiple occasions where she has decided to get blackout drunk on a weeknight. She'll forgo studying to go party, but I usually stick behind to work. J will get upset with me when she goes out and I don't come with her, saying that I need to ""get out"" more and will poke fun me for being ""antisocial"". Usually I have actual work to do, and I go out on the weekends like most people, but occasionally I'd like a quiet evening to myself. On nights that I might want to stay in and watch a move/play video games with my guy friends she'll pout and mope until she gets her way, saying things that ""I just love you more than you love me, but thats ok"". On nights that she goes out (with or without me) she'll get unreasonably drunk (I drink socially and enjoy a beer once I finish school/work, but she'll blackout literally once a week) I'll have to take care of a crying mess at the end of the night, and she can get to the point where she can be quiet aggressive and say hurtful things.

This Summer I was able to get a very, very good internship with a company I hope to work for in the future, so I'm working my ass off 45 hours a week to try to impress my superiors and turn my internship into a full time job. I've already been told many times that this company likes to offer a job to their interns that preform well at the end of the summer, can you imagine what a relief it would be to have a six figure salary before your Senior year even starts? Obviously (at least to me) I am working my ass off, it sucks but I know it'll pay off. J on the other hand, is sitting at home for three months laying by the pool and texting me while I work (she didn't even look for a job), and she'll complain that I don't pay enough attention to her. I was (still am) planning to visit her, but I'm saving up my vacation time so I can spend an extended weekend with her. I have to fly to where she lives so I don't want to pay hundreds of dollars just to see her for 48 hours. After only three weeks apart (of three months) she is complaining that I don't talk to her enough (we facetime for at least an hour after I get home from work), that I don't want to visit her (I'm going to pay a lot of money to see her, but first I need to make that money), and she has even insinuated that I could be seeing other people because I go to bed early (I work 7-5, sorry that I want to get a good sleep). This all came to a head today when she called me when I was on a conference call today and I didn't answer, she went off on me talking about how I don't even care about her and that she ""is beginning to rethink our entire relationship"".

Ironically with that statement, I'm beginning to rethink our relationship. I'm a very straightforward and simple guy, and I'm not about to squander what could be a very successful job for a girl when I'm only 21. I know I have a long and hopefully bright future ahead of me, but I really see a future with J as well. But if she isn't willing to bite the bullet and compromise and be a little distant for three months (when we basically live together for the other nine months of the year) then we'll only run into larger problems if we continue to be together after college. I've also begun to realize that this issue is very similar to those that occur when we are together in school (such as her pressuring me to go out on nights when I need to study). I'm starting to realize that if I am willing to compromise for me when I am willing to compromise for her, that our relationship is unfair and that honestly, I could do better.

**tl;dr**: I've accepted a very, very good job over the summer, which prevents me from talking/seeing my SO as much as she would like. I've started to realize that I bend over backwards for her, but she won't support me when I really need it."
4n2mop,6,2016-06-07,"Me [27 F] with my former boss [60's M] - worked 1 miserable year for this man, but after being unemployed for a year, he's offering a job. Should I?",legalbeagle01,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4n2mop/me_27_f_with_my_former_boss_60s_m_worked_1/,"I’ve been unemployed for a full year, and I sort of got a job offer today and I’m really conflicted as to whether or not to accept. Any advice would be much appreciated!  

Backstory: I graduated from law school in May 2014. Where I’m from, one requirement to become a practising lawyer is that you need to complete a year of what's essentially an internship. Depends on the location, but pay is generally not fantastic, and it’s sort of a litmus test to see if you can survive. 

For mine, I was hired by a guy who offered me just over minimum wage for the year. I was getting close to the deadline for starting, so I accepted. Cannot blame anyone but myself for not doing my research, but my year with this guy was hellish. I was paid through a grant that ostensibly was to supplement 50% of my salary to bring it to industry standards and he would only have to pay 50%, thereby incentivizing hiring young graduates. Instead, he front loaded my pay so 30 weeks in to the year, I wasn’t paid again through my remaining 22 required weeks (even had the nerve to tell me he was giving me my legally required vacation pay as a “bonus for hard work”). 

Did not agree whatsoever with his approach to cases, arguments, clients, business practices – not at all the kind of lawyer/human being I want to be. All in all, the hours were long (minimum 10 hours/day in office with anywhere from 2-4 hours of phone calls once I got home, emails at all hours of the day) and tasks were insane, far outside of what's to be expected. He micromanaged literally every punctuation mark I made (even in documents only ever intended for his eyes), told me I had no idea what I was doing, that I should sue my law school for letting me leave with a degree, etc. – generally just a terrible year on top of the bar exam and anxiety of starting out in a high-stress occupation. 

Regardless, I made it through and started my own job hunt. Didn’t go well - I finished with this guy in June 2015 and here I am today, still unemployed. In recent months, I’ve been trying to get a job outside of the legal profession – obviously I’d prefer to be using my degree and doing work I love, but getting that degree was expensive and I have loans to pay. I applied for entry into a government grant program – approved employers are given a grant intended to supplement the income of a young recent graduate for a 6-month term, so long as the employer is willing to consider hiring the employee after the term has expired. I have a meeting with a career counsellor next week to discuss my options – things are looking up! 

Today I get a call from my former boss – turns out he is one of the approved employers for this grant program. He offered me a job with him – I’d maintain my non-practising lawyer status (which essentially means I don’t have to do annual seminars, pay monthly insurance, lower membership fees – but I’m legally bound to not engage in the practice of law until I declare as practising), do all of his legal research for him and prepare briefs. Rather than use the grant as a supplement to bring my salary up to industry standards, that would be my pay – so “minimum wage-ish numbers” was his quote today. I asked him for a few days to consider the offer and to coordinate with the grant program. 

After all this, my question: am I insane to turn this down? My gut is telling me this is bad, bad news. Regardless of the logistics of not legally being able to prepare any documents that would go before a court nor offering any sort of opinion when writing up the findings of my research, I would not be able to really count this as experience for future employers when looking for jobs as a lawyer, and the longer I remain non-practising, the more likely it is I’ll have to rewrite the bar exam to become practising again (definitely something I’d like to avoid). Any legal writing I did for this guy while I worked for him was an incredibly demoralizing experience – once I was berated for word choice of a non-legal term, saying a judge could vehemently hate magenta and my choice to use that word instead of pink would lose us a case. I am a more than competent legal writer, and with research and writing as two of my greatest strengths, regularly being torn down is emotionally exhausting.

I’m torn – I’m not in absolutely dire financial straits (my parents are incredibly supportive and have been letting me live with them rent-free while I try to get work), but the sooner I can get a steady income, the better. He is certainly the devil I know, and at least until I meet with the career counsellor next week, my current best prospect is a government call center. I just don’t know if (potentially) moving to another city and subjecting myself to his brand of insanity for what is likely to be less than minimum wage is actually worth it – it is a job, and it’s more in the legal profession than my recent prospects have been. Advice? 

TL;DR: Worked a year for a lawyer who made me absolutely miserable. A year after leaving and being unemployed, same lawyer offered me a job for minimum wage, sort of in my field but with no real hopes of furthering my professional goals. Possible job prospects on the horizon outside of this lawyer, but wondering if I should bite the bullet in order to get some admittedly sub-par reps in the legal world. Thoughts?"

4n3s14,5,2016-06-08,Looking for advice on a Masters in Shanghai,LordCreamCheese,China,https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/4n3s14/looking_for_advice_on_a_masters_in_shanghai/,"Hi guys

I'm 21 and just finished my bachelors from a Russell Group university in the UK, in History (I know, I know, it seemed like a good idea when I was 18. I love history but now I'm at a point in my life where I am facing reality) and I should graduate with either a first or a high 2:1. I'm interested in doing a Master's in Shanghai, but I hope my reasoning isn't naive. 

I've been looking at Fudan University, it seems quite prestigious? Is that correct? I'm looking at a business or international relations masters (trying to decide between reality and what I actually find interesting). 

Does anyone know how difficult it is to get the Shanghai municipal scholarship, and the general government scholarship? I would only go if I could get some form f scholarship, my family don't have the money to pay for me to go. 

Would you recommend me spending a year teaching in China first to see if I like living there, and to get a grasp on life in China first?

The main reason I would like to go is for the experience firstly, but also to increase my employability back home. I'm thinking that I speak English and French already, and if I could speak Chinese and had the experience of living in China too, that would be looked on well? Again, I hope I'm not being naive. I'd like to think I could try to get an internship back home over the summer in a business that has Chinese contacts with the experience of living in China. I don't really want to be rich but I have realised that you need to be making a comfortable amount to live a fulfilling and interesting life, which is why I'm trying to take my education in a more realistic direction.

There is also the option of doing a master's in a UK university (Leeds) which has a year in China as part of the course- do you reckon that is a better option? The idea of going and living somewhere completely alien appeals to me, but maybe it's better to go within a structure I already understand. 

The logic seems good to me but I am also aware that I am young and naive so any advice would be appreciated. "
4n3s5g,1,2016-06-08,ACoN has no idea on getting a paying job thanks to EMom.,EnigmaticWorld,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/4n3s5g/acon_has_no_idea_on_getting_a_paying_job_thanks/,"I've posted a few posts about my NParents on here although those were more about my past with them, now I'm gonna post some that I need a lot of help with. While I don't know if my EMom is a N herself or very FLEA ridden, it's hard to tell on one hand she infantilizes me (which is the problem here.), sorta spoils me and yet at the same time even though she ocassionally bitches about my NStepDad and his attitude, when it comes to his outbursts towards us she tries everything she can to justify them and hasn't left him yet in spite of the intense arguments they've had that gotten a little dangerous, not to add she's pretty pompus &amp; short-tempered herself.

Anyway like I said she infantilizes me due to that she has neglected in assisting me on getting the correct means in getting a job. For some more background, I'm a 19 year old student living in UK (don't know if the procedure to get a job in UK is different in US or anywhere else, but I'll put it here just in case.) &amp; I also have ADD &amp; Aspergers.

I might add some more background just in case I need anything else I forgot (I suck at this XD.) Anyway the reason why I added the conditions I have, is cuz my EMom has always used those disabilities I have as a excuse to me why I shouldn't bother attempt to get a job. She claimed they'd never take me because of the conditions I have, even though I'm fairly aware now on how I'd never be questioned about those things as I have been told constantly that questions about my disabilities in a interview is illegal. I really should've been skeptic about this claim of hers when I was younger, as a time when NStepDad was sorta decent asked EMom on my behalf if I could get myself a paper round job, she basically answered that if I wanted to earn some cash then it'll be by doing some work in the house. Reason behind that is due to the factor that she's one of those NParents who basically wouldn't let me outside when I was younger, not even to get a job. Sad thing is I did try the whole thing of doing chores to earn cash as she told me, and in the end I never got those savings even when I was made to wash all of the mountain load of dishes even though lots of times almost none of them were mine. I wouldn't mind either as they claimed I could earn some cash if I did these chores, which in the end I didn't see a penny. In fact the whole thing on how they said that is completely forgotten and I'm just expected to clean up their messes.

Moving on, I do admit I had gotten an internship job once but that was with my 6th Form with teachers who already knew me from Secondary School so I'm not sure if it counts, not to add it was only for a little bit in the Summer (fortunately NParents had no idea how my Internship ended so for a while I just made it seem like I was going to work when I was really in a cafe for a few hours on my laptop, cuz honestly you get more privacy with your computer in a public cafe if Ns are involved -_-. I know it might be a bad FLEA thoug.) And as of the present day my lease in my student hall is almost up (ends on 26th.) so I sadly have no choice but to go back to my Ns place for the Summer and I was hoping to get a job during that time to perhaps ease some of the stress by being away for a few hours. Any type of job will work for me even another Internship really as I find just being away working in a environment that's SUPPOSED to be a working environment instead of in a environment that's should be where I do things at my own pace is enough of payment for me.

Sorry about the inconsistency and ranting and I really should get to the main point, which is what do I need to do and what resources do I need to have to proceed in getting a job? I don't really know if I'll manage to get one, but maybe I can perhaps make it seems like I have a job to them like how I did when they still thought I had an Internship. Still I should still get the knowledge now before I end up in a spot where I'm utterly clueless on getting a job."

Feel free to point out where I'm being particularly insufferable. 

What a great few months it's been, and with all kinds of firsts too: First ime I've been involved in Greek life. First time I've gotten drunk and high at the same time. First time I've really been sexually active. First time I've gotten more than one C in a semester. First time my GPA's dropped below a 3.4. Accompanying this illustrious raft of firsts, however, is a discomforting amount of constants, of things that have stayed the same for far too long: not having a summer job or an internship, not being in shape, not being organized enough to function, and not being able to get out much as a result. I thought I left that nothingness behind in my old small town. It turns out that I just took it with me to college in my new big town. 

Another thing that hasn't changed? Being romantically involved with someone who makes me look like shit when I'm compared to them. He's in the same category as my ex-girlfriend in high school: incredibly talented, intelligent, hard working, good looking, far away, and somehow attracted to my lazy ass for reasons beyond my comprehension. My internal feelings are the same too: initially I'm star struck that they'd even consider me and flattered beyond belief. I reckon they'll work out similarly too: me going through an intense bout of motivation that burns off when we drift apart after getting serious about a relationship. 

My question to myself in all of this is simple: ""When will I learn?"" 
When will I learn that to do cool things you have to plan ahead? When will I learn how to get hired literally anywhere? When will I learn that things fall apart if motivation isn't turned into self-discipline? When will I learn to be comfortable in my own skin? When will I learn to get my shit together?

If this is simply regression to the mean, and that the good grades and hope and confidence I had during the end of high school and the beginning of college were flukes, then I'm not sure how long I can stay sane. It's one step forward and two steps back, if even that. 

How long can I keep filling in job applications and trying to keep my motivation up before I collapse? Out of boredom, hopelessness, and laziness? I'll do the best I can to better myself, but when I look back a month or so and realize that not much has changed, what's a guy to do? It's beyond frustrating and I'm not sure how long this status quo will last given the circumstances.

At first, when I went I had the typical fapper mentality, thinking about the office chicks who would be there. Once I reached the office everything changed. I see a solemn environment, people scrambling with papers, attending calls, typing away on the computer screens.
I was given work and I had no time that day to think of anything else. I have come to realize that life is not a joke, and there is no free lunch. 
There is no place for porn and no place for excessive M. It's time to wake up. "

So, I'm going to use the summer to get an internship at a local restaurant, and if it all goes well, I might go study Culinary next year, we'll see.

Anyways, I managed to get an interview with an HR person at the headquarters of this famous local chef that has some restaurants in the city I live in, one with 2 Michellin stars. They called me and the interview is scheduled for tomorrow.

Now, I'm super nervous with this. Any tips for the interview? They know I have no experience in the area, so they'll probably just want to get to know me and see if I'd be a good fit. The interview is going to be with an HR person anyways, so it probably won't focus too much on culinary terms, but I figure she might ask me what I like to cook at home or stuff like that. Any questions you think she might ask and I could prepare for?

I'll probably make another post if I actually get admitted to ask you guys about more practical things, but right now I have this interview ""step"" I need to nail and pass to make it happen!"
4n4rha,1,2016-06-08,F4A - The Dark Journey To Fame,Undisclosed_Desires7,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/4n4rha/f4a_the_dark_journey_to_fame/,"Katheyn or what she preferred to be called Katy was the new intern at the company. A big industry in downtown Los Angeles that dealt with many movie, tv and rock stars. Basically, offering rich and famous people services to handle their careers while also giving fresh faced wannabes the opportunities.

Katy was one of them, a young girl that wasn't even 21 yet dreams of making it in music, becoming a world known star. She had tried numerous times and had many meetings with companies to try and get her talent across to no avail. Eventually the money she saved up from her part time job while she was in school dried up and she had to pick up a job in L.A she she thought why not a business in a similar field to her dreams.

Katy remembered when she walked into the office for the first time, people couldn't believe what she looked like and you think they would be accustomed to seeing gorgeous people all the time. She had worn a pair of red 6 inch stilettos and a tiny pencil skirt that would of been the shortest a woman could wear. Thigh high stockings that hugged tight to her legs that were held up by clasps attached to a garter belt. The tight blouse she wore strained her rather biggest assets, her double DD breasts that were pushed up in her black bra. They bounced around as she worked around the office, attracting the attention of many guys. The man Katy worked for was always delighted to see her, his eyes filling up with lust as he looked her body over before leading her into his office and shutting the door.

Katy regularly wore clothes that brung her attention, it was always another pair of 6 inch heels, short skirts and stockings accompanied by a tight low cut blouse. Guys around the office started to talk about Katy, about how they would love to ram her as she bent over their desk. Many guys often tried to get with her but she always refused.

Soon Katy developed a reputation for being a strong feminist supporter. She thought that all men were pigs for treating women as nothing more than a pair of tits and ass with a pretty face. That's how Katy felt in meetings, guys would get sidetracked around her and just stare at her boobs or ass. They wouldn't take her seriously and thought that she was just a slut. She thought that guys only chatted to her because they wanted to fuck her and weren't even calling her by name around the office, she overheard them calling her by her big tits.

Though what Katy did, didn't always match up with what she said. She would scold men for staring at her body when she wore revealing clothing everyday. She would also find every excuse to bend over to give everyone a good look at her, regularly dropping things on the ground. She would get angry at guys all the time for flirting with her as they obviously wanted to fuck her but she would flirt with guys all the time brushing her hand near their groin and giving them a sexy, sultry look as she walked away.

One day the CEO came to the office and went to a meeting room with about 30 other businessmen. They were all aged between 50-80 years old. After about an hour, Katy was called into the meeting room. Jason, a fellow coworker had a desk right in front of the room, he watched her strut in their, clad in her tight clothes. She closed the door behind her. It must of been 4 hours until the doors opened again, with the old guys walking out with satisfied looks on their faces. They talked about how great that was and how they must do it again soon. Out Katy stepped as they finally all left. Her hair was disheveled while she was fixing her rumpled blouse and rolling down her skirt while carrying her stilettos. As she walked she pulled out a curly hair from her mouth and wiped away a bit of stickiness from her lips. Going to her desk and continuing work like nothing happened.

-------------------

I want this role play to involve scenarios following the womens career such as trying to break into the industry (a lot of time spent as the secretary), dealing with the sudden fame, hook ups with celebrities, sex tapes, paparazzi, fans, relationships, becoming addicted to drugs and alcohol and turning into a nymphomaniac.

Can be different and have a male celebrity and their journey.

I want to play the males the celeb will encounter. I want someone to play the main lead which will be the young female starlet. I would love for the young starlet to be Katy Perry or Kylie Jenner but I like a lot of other celebs as well such as Taylor Swift, Iggy Azalea, Ariana Grande, Scarlett Johansson and Jessica Alba.

I prefer to roleplay on Google Docs and use messengers to chat and set things up such as K , skype, yahoo msger and google chat/hangouts. Want this to be a long term rp

If you are interested and wish to talk about this further send me a message. Please make your message to me detailed and include any character/ scenario ideas, which celebrities you like and what platforms you use.

4n5o5k,10,2016-06-08,I'm getting clean,throwaway515415,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/4n5o5k/im_getting_clean/,"I'm not sure where to post this but here it goes.

I'm 23 years old and I realized I've had a substance abuse problem for 5 years. It started with just fun cannabis but gradually became harder things like opiates and alcohol.

My father was an abusive alcoholic and I swore to myself that I'd never end up like him. So I figured that if I smoked weed everyday I'd be chill and not angry. Then weed became vicodin and Valium. Over time, I was stealing so many pills from my parents house that I tried so many opiates and benzos. Oh how I loved oxycontin....

I always did these drugs to cope with social anxiety and depression. Sometimes I even became suicidal to the point where I had the barrel of a loaded gun in my mouth. After a suicide attempt a few months ago I threw away all my weed and the rest of my pills in an effort to get clean and get my life together.

That was working... sort of. After some time of sobriety, I was still anxious and depressed. So I started drinking by myself a lot. This is where I started playing mental gymnastics with myself.

""It's just one beer tonight. No big deal!""

""Two beers isn't bad. I've earned it!""

""I'm not an alcoholic if I'm just drinking beer!""

12 beers later and I wake up on the floor of my apartment covered in sweat with my dog licking my face at 5:00 AM and I've got work in a few hours. Sooooo many days of work hungover.

The point where I realized I needed help was when I had a panic attack at work. I went out to my car to decompress and instead started crying. That's when I went home right then and there at around 2:00 in the afternoon to go home and drink to feel better. I'm an addict.

I worked it out with my work and soon I'll be taking a leave of absence for a couple months to go back to my home city with my family and get help in a program. I've been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and will be going through DBT treatment.

The funny thing is that I never realized I had any sort of problem through the years. I graduated from college near the top of my class, held steady paid internships during college, won several academic awards, stayed physically fit for the most part (though I've put on some weight), and even got a really high paying job in my field right out of college. I was even high on percocet during my interview for this job. I figured that since I'm so successful I can't possibly have a problem.

I guess I was wrong. I need help and I'm excited to get it."
4n5ozb,70,2016-06-08,"Men of Reddit, how can I negotiate a significant raise this year?",[deleted],AskMen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/4n5ozb/men_of_reddit_how_can_i_negotiate_a_significant/,"Good morning guys, I've been working at my current job for two years now. I started off as an intern and did that for a little over a year and will have been working full time for the company I work for about a year soon. I'm 25, and I graduated last year with a degree in Engineering Technology. (I was done the year before, just wrapping up one class). 

I'd like to negotiate a raise. While I'm paid decently, I am underpaid for my level of education, and based on some of my research, underpaid for my position as well. After looking at the salaries of some of our competitors online it would seem their employees are making significantly higher salaries that what I am making. I'm talking $5,000-$10,000 or more higher than what I'm making right now. 

I like my company, and I don't mind working for them but unfortunately I have a lot of debts to pay and making a competitive salary would really go a long way towards knocking that out. So I'd like to negotiate my salary up to the point where it's at least in the ballpark of the industry. At the moment I've nabbed a nice little packet of professional certifications in the products that we sell, and they are widely used in my industry (engineering). I'm also the only person at my company who knows one of the lesser products that we sell, but we don't sell much and our competitors seem to do a lot more work with it. They also seem to be hiring, and I was considering sending them a resume to test the waters. 

I've heard it's bad form to bounce out of a job too quickly after starting, and I do feel some loyalty to my company because they hired me out of school and helped train me up. However, it's been bought out by another company as well as the guy who hired me (solid dude) also left shortly after I was hired. So things are changing, I'm not working for the same people I was last year. 

This place does offer some nice perks like the office being close to where I live, and travel etc. so I do like those. However the debt monster is starting to eat me alive and I believe that I'm underpaid.

Men, can you give me your pro advice?

This is what I've come up with so far, please correct me if I'm wrong...

Net Earnings = (Pay check amount) - (*Expenses)
* I am a bit confused as to what I can count as an expense... but I assume things like gas spent on getting to and from work, office supplies, lunch, etc.? 

Taxable Income = (Net Earnings) x (92.35%)

Self Employment Tax = (Taxable Income) x (15.3%)

Amount of Tax That Qualifies for Deductions = (Self Employment Tax) x (1/2)


I know this is pretty general, but am I at least going in the right direction?  Also, I'm only going to be working here for 4-5 months but should I worried about quarterly taxes as well?

4n6b3u,912,2016-06-08,[Text] Impact statement from the Stanford Rape Victim. May be upsetting.,wowjiffylube,Frisson,https://www.reddit.com/r/Frisson/comments/4n6b3u/text_impact_statement_from_the_stanford_rape/,"Your honor,

If it is all right, for the majority of this statement I would like to address the defendant directly.

You don’t know me, but you’ve been inside me, and that’s why we’re here today.

On January 17th, 2015, it was a quiet Saturday night at home. My dad made some dinner and I sat at the table with my younger sister who was visiting for the weekend. I was working full time and it was approaching my bed time. I planned to stay at home by myself, watch some TV and read, while she went to a party with her friends. Then, I decided it was my only night with her, I had nothing better to do, so why not, there’s a dumb party ten minutes from my house, I would go, dance weird like a fool, and embarrass my younger sister. On the way there, I joked that undergrad guys would have braces. My sister teased me for wearing a beige cardigan to a frat party like a librarian. I called myself “big mama”, because I knew I’d be the oldest one there. I made silly faces, let my guard down, and drank liquor too fast not factoring in that my tolerance had significantly lowered since college.

The next thing I remember I was in a gurney in a hallway. I had dried blood and bandages on the backs of my hands and elbow. I thought maybe I had fallen and was in an admin office on campus. I was very calm and wondering where my sister was. A deputy explained I had been assaulted. I still remained calm, assured he was speaking to the wrong person. I knew no one at this party. When I was finally allowed to use the restroom, I pulled down the hospital pants they had given me, went to pull down my underwear, and felt nothing. I still remember the feeling of my hands touching my skin and grabbing nothing. I looked down and there was nothing. The thin piece of fabric, the only thing between my vagina and anything else, was missing and everything inside me was silenced. I still don’t have words for that feeling. In order to keep breathing, I thought maybe the policemen used scissors to cut them off for evidence.

Then, I felt pine needles scratching the back of my neck and started pulling them out my hair. I thought maybe, the pine needles had fallen from a tree onto my head. My brain was talking my gut into not collapsing. Because my gut was saying, help me, help me.

I shuffled from room to room with a blanket wrapped around me, pine needles trailing behind me, I left a little pile in every room I sat in. I was asked to sign papers that said “Rape Victim” and I thought something has really happened. My clothes were confiscated and I stood naked while the nurses held a ruler to various abrasions on my body and photographed them. The three of us worked to comb the pine needles out of my hair, six hands to fill one paper bag. To calm me down, they said it’s just the flora and fauna, flora and fauna. I had multiple swabs inserted into my vagina and anus, needles for shots, pills, had a nikon pointed right into my spread legs. I had long, pointed beaks inside me and had my vagina smeared with cold, blue paint to check for abrasions.

After a few hours of this, they let me shower. I stood there examining my body beneath the stream of water and decided, I don’t want my body anymore. I was terrified of it, I didn’t know what had been in it, if it had been contaminated, who had touched it. I wanted to take off my body like a jacket and leave it at the hospital with everything else.

On that morning, all that I was told was that I had been found behind a dumpster, potentially penetrated by a stranger, and that I should get retested for HIV because results don’t always show up immediately. But for now, I should go home and get back to my normal life. Imagine stepping back into the world with only that information. They gave me huge hugs, and then I walked out of the hospital into the parking lot wearing the new sweatshirt and sweatpants they provided me, as they had only allowed me to keep my necklace and shoes.

My sister picked me up, face wet from tears and contorted in anguish. Instinctively and immediately, I wanted to take away her pain. I smiled at her, I told her to look at me, I’m right here, I’m okay, everything’s okay, I’m right here. My hair is washed and clean, they gave me the strangest shampoo, calm down, and look at me. Look at these funny new sweatpants and sweatshirt, I look like a P.E. teacher, let’s go home, let’s eat something. She did not know that beneath my sweats, I had scratches and bandages on my skin, my vagina was sore and had become a strange, dark color from all the prodding, my underwear was missing, and I felt too empty to continue to speak. That I was also afraid, that I was also devastated. That day we drove home and for hours my sister held me.

My boyfriend did not know what happened, but called that day and said, “I was really worried about you last night, you scared me, did you make it home okay?” I was horrified. That’s when I learned I had called him that night in my blackout, left an incomprehensible voicemail, that we had also spoken on the phone, but I was slurring so heavily he was scared for me, that he repeatedly told me to go find my sister. Again, he asked me, “What happened last night? Did you make it home okay?” I said yes, and hung up to cry.

I was not ready to tell my boyfriend or parents that actually, I may have been raped behind a dumpster, but I don’t know by who or when or how. If I told them, I would see the fear on their faces, and mine would multiply by tenfold, so instead I pretended the whole thing wasn’t real.

I tried to push it out of my mind, but it was so heavy I didn’t talk, I didn’t eat, I didn’t sleep, I didn’t interact with anyone. After work, I would drive to a secluded place to scream. I didn’t talk, I didn’t eat, I didn’t sleep, I didn’t interact with anyone, and I became isolated from the ones I loved most. For one week after the incident, I didn’t get any calls or updates about that night or what happened to me. The only symbol that proved that it hadn’t just been a bad dream, was the sweatshirt from the hospital in my drawer.

One day, I was at work, scrolling through the news on my phone, and came across an article. In it, I read and learned for the first time about how I was found unconscious, with my hair disheveled, long necklace wrapped around my neck, bra pulled out of my dress, dress pulled off over my shoulders and pulled up above my waist, that I was butt naked all the way down to my boots, legs spread apart, and had been penetrated by a foreign object by someone I did not recognize. This was how I learned what happened to me, sitting at my desk reading the news at work. I learned what happened to me the same time everyone else in the world learned what happened to me. That’s when the pine needles in my hair made sense, they didn’t fall from a tree. He had taken off my underwear, his fingers had been inside of me. I don’t even know this person. I still don’t know this person. When I read about me like this, I said, this can’t be me.

This can’t be me. I could not digest or accept any of this information. I could not imagine my family having to read about this online. I kept reading. In the next paragraph, I read something that I will never forgive; I read that according to him, I liked it. I liked it. Again, I do not have words for these feelings.

At the bottom of the article, after I learned about the graphic details of my own sexual assault, the article listed his swimming times. She was found breathing, unresponsive with her underwear six inches away from her bare stomach curled in fetal position. By the way, he’s really good at swimming. Throw in my mile time if that’s what we’re doing. I’m good at cooking, put that in there, I think the end is where you list your extra-curriculars to cancel out all the sickening things that’ve happened.

The night the news came out I sat my parents down and told them that I had been assaulted, to not look at the news because it’s upsetting, just know that I’m okay, I’m right here, and I’m okay. But halfway through telling them, my mom had to hold me because I could no longer stand up. I was not okay.

The night after it happened, he said he didn’t know my name, said he wouldn’t be able to identify my face in a lineup, didn’t mention any dialogue between us, no words, only dancing and kissing. Dancing is a cute term; was it snapping fingers and twirling dancing, or just bodies grinding up against each other in a crowded room? I wonder if kissing was just faces sloppily pressed up against each other? When the detective asked if he had planned on taking me back to his dorm, he said no. When the detective asked how we ended up behind the dumpster, he said he didn’t know. He admitted to kissing other girls at that party, one of whom was my own sister who pushed him away. He admitted to wanting to hook up with someone. I was the wounded antelope of the herd, completely alone and vulnerable, physically unable to fend for myself, and he chose me. Sometimes I think, if I hadn’t gone, then this never would’ve happened. But then I realized, it would have happened, just to somebody else. You were about to enter four years of access to drunk girls and parties, and if this is the foot you started off on, then it is right you did not continue.

The night after it happened, he said he thought I liked it because I rubbed his back. A back rub. Never mentioned me voicing consent, never mentioned us speaking, a back rub.

One more time, in public news, I learned that my ass and vagina were completely exposed outside, my breasts had been groped, fingers had been jabbed inside me along with pine needles and debris, my bare skin and head had been rubbing against the ground behind a dumpster, while an erect freshman was humping my half naked, unconscious body. But I don’t remember, so how do I prove I didn’t like it.

I thought there’s no way this is going to trial; there were witnesses, there was dirt in my body, he ran but was caught. He’s going to settle, formally apologize, and we will both move on. Instead, I was told he hired a powerful attorney, expert witnesses, private investigators who were going to try and find details about my personal life to use against me, find loopholes in my story to invalidate me and my sister, in order to show that this sexual assault was in fact a misunderstanding. That he was going to go to any length to convince the world he had simply been confused.

I was not only told that I was assaulted, I was told that because I couldn’t remember, I technically could not prove it was unwanted. And that distorted me, damaged me, almost broke me. It is the saddest type of confusion to be told I was assaulted and nearly raped, blatantly out in the open, but we don’t know if it counts as assault yet. I had to fight for an entire year to make it clear that there was something wrong with this situation.

When I was told to be prepared in case we didn’t win, I said, I can’t prepare for that. He was guilty the minute I woke up. No one can talk me out of the hurt he caused me. Worst of all, I was warned, because he now knows you don’t remember, he is going to get to write the script. He can say whatever he wants and no one can contest it. I had no power, I had no voice, I was defenseless. My memory loss would be used against me. My testimony was weak, was incomplete, and I was made to believe that perhaps, I am not enough to win this. That’s so damaging. His attorney constantly reminded the jury, the only one we can believe is Brock, because she doesn’t remember. That helplessness was traumatizing.

Instead of taking time to heal, I was taking time to recall the night in excruciating detail, in order to prepare for the attorney’s questions that would be invasive, aggressive, and designed to steer me off course, to contradict myself, my sister, phrased in ways to manipulate my answers. Instead of his attorney saying, Did you notice any abrasions? He said, You didn’t notice any abrasions, right? This was a game of strategy, as if I could be tricked out of my own worth. The sexual assault had been so clear, but instead, here I was at the trial, answering question like:

How old are you? How much do you weigh? What did you eat that day? Well what did you have for dinner? Who made dinner? Did you drink with dinner? No, not even water? When did you drink? How much did you drink? What container did you drink out of? Who gave you the drink? How much do you usually drink? Who dropped you off at this party? At what time? But where exactly? What were you wearing? Why were you going to this party? What’d you do when you got there? Are you sure you did that? But what time did you do that? What does this text mean? Who were you texting? When did you urinate? Where did you urinate? With whom did you urinate outside? Was your phone on silent when your sister called? Do you remember silencing it? Really because on page 53 I’d like to point out that you said it was set to ring. Did you drink in college? You said you were a party animal? How many times did you black out? Did you party at frats? Are you serious with your boyfriend? Are you sexually active with him? When did you start dating? Would you ever cheat? Do you have a history of cheating? What do you mean when you said you wanted to reward him? Do you remember what time you woke up? Were you wearing your cardigan? What color was your cardigan? Do you remember any more from that night? No? Okay, we’ll let Brock fill it in.

I was pummeled with narrowed, pointed questions that dissected my personal life, love life, past life, family life, inane questions, accumulating trivial details to try and find an excuse for this guy who didn’t even take the time to ask me for my name, who had me naked a handful of minutes after seeing me. After a physical assault, I was assaulted with questions designed to attack me, to say see, her facts don’t line up, she’s out of her mind, she’s practically an alcoholic, she probably wanted to hook up, he’s like an athlete right, they were both drunk, whatever, the hospital stuff she remembers is after the fact, why take it into account, Brock has a lot at stake so he’s having a really hard time right now.

And then it came time for him to testify. This is where I became revictimized. I want to remind you, the night after it happened he said he never planned to take me back to his dorm. He said he didn’t know why we were behind a dumpster. He got up to leave because he wasn’t feeling well when he was suddenly chased and attacked. Then he learned I could not remember.

So one year later, as predicted, a new dialogue emerged. Brock had a strange new story, almost sounded like a poorly written young adult novel with kissing and dancing and hand holding and lovingly tumbling onto the ground, and most importantly in this new story, there was suddenly consent. One year after the incident, he remembered, oh yeah, by the way she actually said yes, to everything, so.

He said he had asked if I wanted to dance. Apparently I said yes. He’d asked if I wanted to go to his dorm, I said yes. Then he asked if he could finger me and I said yes. Most guys don’t ask, Can I finger you? Usually there’s a natural progression of things, unfolding consensually, not a Q and A. But apparently I granted full permission. He’s in the clear.

Even in this story, there’s barely any dialogue; I only said a total of three words before he had me half naked on the ground. I have never been penetrated after three words. He didn’t claim to hear me speak one full sentence that night, so in the news when it says we “met”, I’m not sure I would go so far as to say that. Future reference, if you are confused about whether a girl can consent, see if she can speak an entire sentence. You couldn’t even do that. Just one coherent string of words. If she can’t do that, then no. Don’t touch her, just no. Not maybe, just no. Where was the confusion? This is common sense, human decency.

According to him, the only reason we were on the ground was because I fell down. Note; if a girl falls help her get back up. If she is too drunk to even walk and falls, do not mount her, hump her, take off her underwear, and insert your hand inside her vagina. If a girl falls help her up. If she is wearing a cardigan over her dress don’t take it off so that you can touch her breasts. Maybe she is cold, maybe that’s why she wore the cardigan. If her bare ass and legs are rubbing the pinecones and needles, while the weight of you pushes into her, get off her.

Next in the story, two people approached you. You ran because you said you felt scared. I argue that you were scared because you’d be caught, not because you were scared of two terrifying Swedish grad students. The idea that you thought you were being attacked out of the blue was ludicrous. That it had nothing to do with you being on top my unconscious body. You were caught red handed, with no explanation. When they tackled you why didn’t [you] say, “Stop! Everything’s okay, go ask her, she’s right over there, she’ll tell you.” I mean you had just asked for my consent, right? I was awake, right? When the policeman arrived and interviewed the evil Swede who tackled you, he was crying so hard he couldn’t speak because of what he’d seen. Also, if you really did think they were dangerous, you just abandoned a half-naked girl to run and save yourself. No matter which way you frame it, it doesn’t make sense.

Your attorney has repeatedly pointed out, well we don’t know exactly when she became unconscious. And you’re right, maybe I was still fluttering my eyes and wasn’t completely limp yet, fine. His guilt did not depend on him knowing the exact second that I became unconscious, that is never what this was about. I was slurring, too drunk to consent way before I was on the ground. I should have never been touched in the first place. Brock stated, “At no time did I see that she was not responding. If at any time I thought she was not responding, I would have stopped immediately.” Here’s the thing; if your plan was to stop only when I was literally unresponsive, then you still do not understand. You didn’t even stop when I was unconscious anyway! Someone else stopped you. Two guys on bikes noticed I wasn’t moving in the dark and had to tackle you. How did you not notice while on top of me?

You said, you would have stopped and gotten help. You say that, but I want you to explain how you would’ve helped me, step by step, walk me through this. I want to know, if those evil Swedes had not found me, how the night would have played out. I am asking you; Would you have pulled my underwear back on over my boots? Untangled the necklace wrapped around my neck? Closed my legs, covered me? Tucked my bra back into my dress? Would you have helped me pick the needles from my hair? Asked if the abrasions on my neck and bottom hurt? Would you then go find a friend and say, Will you help me get her somewhere warm and soft? I don’t sleep when I think about the way it could have gone if the Swedes had never come. What would have happened to me? That’s what you’ll never have a good answer for, that’s what you can’t explain even after a year.

To sit under oath and inform all of us, that yes I wanted it, yes I permitted it, and that you are the true victim attacked by guys for reasons unknown to you is sick, is demented, is selfish, is stupid. It shows that you were willing to go to any length, to discredit me, invalidate me, and explain why it was okay to hurt me. You tried unyieldingly to save yourself, your reputation, at my expense.

My family had to see pictures of my head strapped to a gurney full of pine needles, of my body in the dirt with my eyes closed, dress hiked up, limbs limp in the dark. And then even after that, my family had to listen to your attorney say, the pictures were after the fact, we can dismiss them. To say, yes her nurse confirmed there was redness and abrasions inside her, but that’s what happens when you finger someone, and he’s already admitted to that. To listen to him use my own sister against me. To listen him attempt to paint of a picture of me, the seductive party animal, as if somehow that would make it so that I had this coming for me. To listen to him say I sounded drunk on the phone because I’m silly and that’s my goofy way of speaking. To point out that in the voicemail, I said I would reward my boyfriend and we all know what I was thinking. I assure you my rewards program is non-transferable, especially to any nameless man that approaches me.

The point is, this is everything my family and I endured during the trial. This is everything I had to sit through silently, taking it, while he shaped the evening. It is enough to be suffering. It is another thing to have someone ruthlessly working to diminish the gravity and validity of this suffering. But in the end, his unsupported statements and his attorney’s twisted logic fooled no one. The truth won, the truth spoke for itself.

You are guilty. Twelve jurors convicted you guilty of three felony counts beyond reasonable doubt, that’s twelve votes per count, thirty-six yeses confirming guilt, that’s one hundred percent, unanimous guilt. And I thought finally it is over, finally he will own up to what he did, truly apologize, we will both move on and get better. Then I read your statement.

If you are hoping that one of my organs will implode from anger and I will die, I’m almost there. You are very close. Assault is not an accident. This is not a story of another drunk college hookup with poor decision making. Somehow, you still don’t get it. Somehow, you still sound confused.

I will now take this opportunity to read portions of the defendant’s statement and respond to them.

You said, Being drunk I just couldn’t make the best decisions and neither could she. 

Alcohol is not an excuse. Is it a factor? Yes. But alcohol was not the one who stripped me, fingered me, had my head dragging against the ground, with me almost fully naked. Having too much to drink was an amateur mistake that I admit to, but it is not criminal. Everyone in this room has had a night where they have regretted drinking too much, or knows someone close to them who has had a night where they have regretted drinking too much. Regretting drinking is not the same as regretting sexual assault. We were both drunk, the difference is I did not take off your pants and underwear, touch you inappropriately, and run away. That’s the difference.

You said, If I wanted to get to know her, I should have asked for her number, rather than asking her to go back to my room.

I’m not mad because you didn’t ask for my number. Even if you did know me, I would not want [to] be in this situation. My own boyfriend knows me, but if he asked to finger me behind a dumpster, I would slap him. No girl wants to be in this situation. Nobody. I don’t care if you know their phone number or not.

You said, I stupidly thought it was okay for me to do what everyone around me was doing, which was drinking. I was wrong.

Again, you were not wrong for drinking. Everyone around you was not sexually assaulting me. You were wrong for doing what nobody else was doing, which was pushing your erect dick in your pants against my naked, defenseless body concealed in a dark area, where partygoers could no longer see or protect me, and own my sister could not find me. Sipping fireball is not your crime. Peeling off and discarding my underwear like a candy wrapper to insert your finger into my body, is where you went wrong. Why am I still explaining this.

You said, During the trial I didn’t want to victimize her at all. That was just my attorney and his way of approaching the case.

Your attorney is not your scapegoat, he represents you. Did your attorney say some incredulously infuriating, degrading things? Absolutely. He said you had an erection, because it was cold. I have no words.

You said, you are in the process of establishing a program for high school and college students in which you speak about your experience to “speak out against the college campus drinking culture and the sexual promiscuity that goes along with that.”

Speak out against campus drinking culture. That’s what we’re speaking out against? You think that’s what I’ve spent the past year fighting for? Not awareness about campus sexual assault, or rape, or learning to recognize consent. Campus drinking culture. Down with Jack Daniels. Down with Skyy Vodka. If you want talk to high school kids about drinking go to an AA meeting. You realize, having a drinking problem is different than drinking and then forcefully trying to have sex with someone? Show men how to respect women, not how to drink less.

Drinking culture and the sexual promiscuity that goes along with that. Goes along with that, like a side effect, like fries on the side of your order. Where does promiscuity even come into play? I don’t see headlines that read, Brock Turner, Guilty of drinking too much and the sexual promiscuity that goes along with that. Campus [Sexual] Assault. There’s your first powerpoint slide.

I have done enough explaining. You do not get to shrug your shoulders and be confused anymore. You do not get to pretend that there were no red flags. You do not get to not know why you ran. You have been convicted of violating me with malicious intent, and all you can admit to is consuming alcohol. Do not talk about the sad way your life was upturned because alcohol made you do bad things. Figure out how to take responsibility for your own conduct.

Lastly you said, I want to show people that one night of drinking can ruin a life.

Ruin a life, one life, yours, you forgot about mine. Let me rephrase for you, I want to show people that one night of drinking can ruin two lives. You and me. You are the cause, I am the effect. You have dragged me through this hell with you, dipped me back into that night again and again. You knocked down both our towers, I collapsed at the same time you did. Your damage was concrete; stripped of titles, degrees, enrollment. My damage was internal, unseen, I carry it with me. You took away my worth, my privacy, my energy, my time, my safety, my intimacy, my confidence, my own voice, until today.

See one thing we have in common is that we were both unable to get up in the morning. I am no stranger to suffering. You made me a victim. In newspapers my name was “unconscious intoxicated woman”, ten syllables, and nothing more than that. For a while, I believed that that was all I was. I had to force myself to relearn my real name, my identity. To relearn that this is not all that I am. That I am not just a drunk victim at a frat party found behind a dumpster, while you are the All-American swimmer at a top university, innocent until proven guilty, with so much at stake. I am a human being who has been irreversibly hurt, who waited a year to figure out if I was worth something.

My independence, natural joy, gentleness, and steady lifestyle I had been enjoying became distorted beyond recognition. I became closed off, angry, self-deprecating, tired, irritable, empty. The isolation at times was unbearable. You cannot give me back the life I had before that night either. While you worry about your shattered reputation, I refrigerated spoons every night so when I woke up, and my eyes were puffy from crying, I would hold the spoons to my eyes to lessen the swelling so that I could see. I showed up an hour late to work every morning, excused myself to cry in the stairwells, I can tell you all the best places in that building to cry where no one can hear you, the pain became so bad that I had to tell my boss I was leaving, I needed time because continuing day to day was not possible. I used my savings to go as far away as I could possibly be.

I can’t sleep alone at night without having a light on, like a five year old, because I have nightmares of being touched where I cannot wake up, I did this thing where I waited until the sun came up and I felt safe enough to sleep. For three months, I went to bed at six o’clock in the morning.

I used to pride myself on my independence, now I am afraid to go on walks in the evening, to attend social events with drinking among friends where I should be comfortable being. I have become a little barnacle always needing to be at someone’s side, to have my boyfriend standing next to me, sleeping beside me, protecting me. It is embarrassing how feeble I feel, how timidly I move through life, always guarded, ready to defend myself, ready to be angry.

You have no idea how hard I have worked to rebuild parts of me that are still weak. It took me eight months to even talk about what happened. I could no longer connect with friends, with everyone around me. I would scream at my boyfriend, my own family whenever they brought this up. You never let me forget what happened to me. At the of end of the hearing, the trial, I was too tired to speak. I would leave drained, silent. I would go home turn off my phone and for days I would not speak. You bought me a ticket to a planet where I lived by myself. Every time a new article [would] come out, I lived with the paranoia that my entire hometown would find out and know me as the girl who got assaulted. I didn’t want anyone’s pity and am still learning to accept victim as part of my identity. You made my own hometown an uncomfortable place to be.

Someday, you can pay me back for my ambulance ride and therapy. But you cannot give me back my sleepless nights. The way I have broken down sobbing uncontrollably if I’m watching a movie and a woman is harmed, to say it lightly, this experience has expanded my empathy for other victims. I have lost weight from stress, when people would comment I told them I’ve been running a lot lately. There are times I did not want to be touched. I have to relearn that I am not fragile, I am capable, I am wholesome, not just livid and weak.

I want to say this. All the crying, the hurting you have imposed on me, I can take it. But when I see my younger sister hurting, when she is unable to keep up in school, when she is deprived of joy, when she is not sleeping, when she is crying so hard on the phone she is barely breathing, telling me over and over she is sorry for leaving me alone that night, sorry sorry sorry, when she feels more guilt than you, then I do not forgive you. That night I had called her to try and find her, but you found me first. Your attorney’s closing statement began, “My sister said she was fine and who knows her better than her sister.” You tried to use my own sister against me. Your points of attack were so weak, so low, it was almost embarrassing. You do not touch her.

If you think I was spared, came out unscathed, that today I ride off into sunset, while you suffer the greatest blow, you are mistaken. Nobody wins. We have all been devastated, we have all been trying to find some meaning in all of this suffering.

You should have never done this to me. Secondly, you should have never made me fight so long to tell you, you should have never done this to me. But here we are. The damage is done, no one can undo it. And now we both have a choice. We can let this destroy us, I can remain angry and hurt and you can be in denial, or we can face it head on, I accept the pain, you accept the punishment, and we move on.

Your life is not over, you have decades of years ahead to rewrite your story. The world is huge, it is so much bigger than Palo Alto and Stanford, and you will make a space for yourself in it where you can be useful and happy. Right now your name is tainted, so I challenge you to make a new name for yourself, to do something so good for the world, it blows everyone away. You have a brain and a voice and a heart. Use them wisely. You possess immense love from your family. That alone can pull you out of anything. Mine has held me up through all of this. Yours will hold you and you will go on.

I believe, that one day, you will understand all of this better. I hope you will become a better more honest person who can properly use this story to prevent another story like this from ever happening again. I fully support your journey to healing, to rebuilding your life, because that is the only way you’ll begin to help others.

Now to address the sentencing. When I read the probation officer’s report, I was in disbelief, consumed by anger which eventually quieted down to profound sadness. My statements have been slimmed down to distortion and taken out of context. I fought hard during this trial and will not have the outcome minimized by a probation officer who attempted to evaluate my current state and my wishes in a fifteen minute conversation, the majority of which was spent answering questions I had about the legal system. The context is also important. Brock had yet to issue a statement, and I had not read his remarks.

My life has been on hold for over a year, a year of anger, anguish and uncertainty, until a jury of my peers rendered a judgment that validated the injustices I had endured. Had Brock admitted guilt and remorse and offered to settle early on, I would have considered a lighter sentence, respecting his honesty, grateful to be able to move our lives forward. Instead he took the risk of going to trial, added insult to injury and forced me to relive the hurt as details about my personal life and sexual assault were brutally dissected before the public. He pushed me and my family through a year of inexplicable, unnecessary suffering, and should face the consequences of challenging his crime, of putting my pain into question, of making us wait so long for justice.

I told the probation officer I do not want Brock to rot away in prison. I did not say he does not deserve to be behind bars. The probation officer’s recommendation of a year or less in county jail is a soft time-out, a mockery of the seriousness of his assaults, and of the consequences of the pain I have been forced to endure. I also told the probation officer that what I truly wanted was for Brock to get it, to understand and admit to his wrongdoing.

Unfortunately, after reading the defendant’s statement, I am severely disappointed and feel that he has failed to exhibit sincere remorse or responsibility for his conduct. I fully respected his right to a trial, but even after twelve jurors unanimously convicted him guilty of three felonies, all he has admitted to doing is ingesting alcohol. Someone who cannot take full accountability for his actions does not deserve a mitigating sentence. It is deeply offensive that he would try and dilute rape with a suggestion of promiscuity. By definition rape is the absence of promiscuity, rape is the absence of consent, and it perturbs me deeply that he can’t even see that distinction.

The probation officer factored in that the defendant is youthful and has no prior convictions. In my opinion, he is old enough to know what he did was wrong. When you are eighteen in this country you can go to war. When you are nineteen, you are old enough to pay the consequences for attempting to rape someone. He is young, but he is old enough to know better.

As this is a first offense I can see where leniency would beckon. On the other hand, as a society, we cannot forgive everyone’s first sexual assault or digital rape. It doesn’t make sense. The seriousness of rape has to be communicated clearly, we should not create a culture that suggests we learn that rape is wrong through trial and error. The consequences of sexual assault needs to be severe enough that people feel enough fear to exercise good judgment even if they are drunk, severe enough to be preventative. The fact that Brock was a star athlete at a prestigious university should not be seen as an entitlement to leniency, but as an opportunity to send a strong cultural message that sexual assault is against the law regardless of social class.

The probation officer weighed the fact that he has surrendered a hard earned swimming scholarship. If I had been sexually assaulted by an un-athletic guy from a community college, what would his sentence be? If a first time offender from an underprivileged background was accused of three felonies and displayed no accountability for his actions other than drinking, what would his sentence be? How fast he swims does not lessen the impact of what happened to me.

The Probation Officer has stated that this case, when compared to other crimes of similar nature, may be considered less serious due to the defendant’s level of intoxication. It felt serious. That’s all I’m going to say.

He is a lifetime sex registrant. That doesn’t expire. Just like what he did to me doesn’t expire, doesn’t just go away after a set number of years. It stays with me, it’s part of my identity, it has forever changed the way I carry myself, the way I live the rest of my life.

A year has gone by and he has had lots of time on his hands. Has he been seeing a psychologist? What has he done in this past year to show he’s been progressing? If he says he wants to implement programs, what has he done to show for it?

Throughout incarceration I hope he is provided with appropriate therapy and resources to rebuild his life. I request that he educates himself about the issue of campus sexual assault. I hope he accepts proper punishment and pushes himself to reenter society as a better person.

To conclude, I want to say thank you. To everyone from the intern who made me oatmeal when I woke up at the hospital that morning, to the deputy who waited beside me, to the nurses who calmed me, to the detective who listened to me and never judged me, to my advocates who stood unwaveringly beside me, to my therapist who taught me to find courage in vulnerability, to my boss for being kind and understanding, to my incredible parents who teach me how to turn pain into strength, to my friends who remind me how to be happy, to my boyfriend who is patient and loving, to my unconquerable sister who is the other half of my heart, to Alaleh, my idol, who fought tirelessly and never doubted me. Thank you to everyone involved in the trial for their time and attention. Thank you to girls across the nation that wrote cards to my DA to give to me, so many strangers who cared for me.

Most importantly, thank you to the two men who saved me, who I have yet to meet. I sleep with two bicycles that I drew taped above my bed to remind myself there are heroes in this story. That we are looking out for one another. To have known all of these people, to have felt their protection and love, is something I will never forget.

And finally, to girls everywhere, I am with you. On nights when you feel alone, I am with you. When people doubt you or dismiss you, I am with you. I fought everyday for you. So never stop fighting, I believe you. Lighthouses don’t go running all over an island looking for boats to save; they just stand there shining. Although I can’t save every boat, I hope that by speaking today, you absorbed a small amount of light, a small knowing that you can’t be silenced, a small satisfaction that justice was served, a small assurance that we are getting somewhere, and a big, big knowing that you are important, unquestionably, you are untouchable, you are beautiful, you are to be valued, respected, undeniably, every minute of every day, you are powerful and nobody can take that away from you. To girls everywhere, I am with you. Thank you."

It was a series on long train rides that were around 16 hours total. The first train ride gave us one last opportunity to hand out with a Czech team that we befriended and worked with during the race.
We arrived in Serbia early Thursday morning and when we were finally able to check into the hostel that we staying in we napped for a bit. We met up with Bojan, our country leader, for lunch and he showed us around Novi Sad, the city we arrived in, for a couple of hours before he had to head back home. We went back to the hostel where we practised the camp dance and had some quality team bonding time before going to bed.

Friday morning the two girls had to go to Sremska Mitrovica. The boarder guards ran out of ink, so the stamps didn't shown up in the girls' passports from when we entered Serbia. This meant the Novi Sad police didn't want to register us. Bojan was able to get everything sorted out, so that is all fine now. While the girls were on their grand adventure, the guys stayed back and did a little camp prep and had some heart to heart talks about how we want to grow and develop over the course of our internship. That afternoon and evening was spent hanging out with some of the local students that we will see and be working with at the Novia Sad camp. One of them likes to explore and map some tunnels that the Austro-Hungarian empire built to defend a fort in the city from the Turks and he took us on a tour of them. They were quite cool. There was an small hole in the wall, and naturally I was the one to crawl through it. Since I was the biggest person in the group, we felt that made the most sense. We made it out of the tunnels alive and went and got dinner with the Serbs before we went home for sleep.

Saturday was all camp promotions. We went to Novi Sad's university to invite students to camp. We set up our base camp in a café and then went out on the campus to talk to students. We made groups that were an American (or Northern Irishman) and a Serb and just walked up to people and asked them if the spoke English. It felt like ambushing people since ""Do you speak English"" usually proceeds a plea for help and directions. That being said, we got some good responses and found several students who seemed interested, so it was worth or time no matter how awkward it seemed. We called it a day rather early and went back home for some team bonding before bed.

Sunday morning we went to the beach. Serbia is landlocked, so the beach was on the Danube. It was a lot of fun just hanging out and getting to know some the the Serbs we will be working with this summer. They invited us for this adventure. We had a guys versus girls sand chair building contest that they guys totally one no matter what the judge and the girls would say. After lunch I got to hang out with some Serbian boys who are probably too young to attend camp. They didn't speak much English but we did speak the universal language of soccer. After all of our beach fun we went home to change and get ready for church. We got to worship with they church that is sponsoring the Novi Sad camp. It is always a good experience worshipping with different churches around the world. After church we spent some time just talking and hanging out with students from the church's youth group. We spent and hour or more talking in a park. We took a group photo before the Serbs walked us home.

Monday morning was spent preparing English lessons. Afterwards we packed and went out to meet Danilo, one of the youth who will be at camp. He showed us some of the more peaceful places in Novi Sad that are away from the hussle and bussle of the city. One them was a swampy and the other was on the Danube across for the beach area. We met his friend along they way and got to hang out with both of them for a while. They walked us back to the hostel, and we caught a taxi to the bus station where we caught a bus to Sremska Mitrovica where we are now staying with the Browns'. We got dinner with Steve, our intern leader, and his family and Bojan. After dinner we spent some quality time talking together.

Got disqualified because of un-correctable vision problems. Tried pursuing a spot in probation/parole, same result. Crap. 

I've got about a year and a half, maybe two years left in my program. Criminal justice major and I'm going to be declaring a minor in either finance or computer science this coming semester. Since it's pretty obvious a ""field"" position is out of the question (I also can't drive because of my vision, so that limits the pool as well) I'm hoping to get into a field like cyber security or possibly financial crime. Here are my main questions:

-For anyone who works in these sorts of fields, what would be better for my career prospects in the long run, minor in finance or comp sci? 

-What jobs or internships should I be trying to get in the meantime to boost my resume?

-What sorts of people should I be getting in contact with to start networking, or just making connections at all? 

Sorry if these questions seem kind of all over the place, I'm still getting used to my career plans changing so suddenly. If being a patrol officer had been plan A, I'm on plan...G I think? If this doesn't work I'll take the hint life is giving me and tap out, maybe find some office job somewhere that hires half-blind people. "

You established in the back of your mind that we are all worthless, spoiled, a bit dumb and it’s your job to make us grow professionally. Our lack of self-discipline annoys you more than you care to admit.

I am not like them. I mean, I am just beginning, of course, I have so much to learn. I am not hipster looking, as matter of fact, I present myself as your typical lipstick femme. Wearing heels makes me slightly taller than them. I do respect authority and do accept your insane concept of discipline. I strive for your validation.

It’s just… you don’t really like me. There’s something about me that you just don’t get it. I have all the ingredients to make you like me more than the others, but you don’t buy it. It intrigues you. You reject all my ideas. Morning monday meetings are the worst, as you watch me presenting the evolution of my work, you just really need to hold my throat until I shut up. You do nothing. I am allowed to make my pitch, you say it’s not an acceptable idea and move on to the next intern acting as cold as you possibly can without being rude.

Today I had enough. I entered your office, after you said you couldn’t receive me, and I stand before you asking why you always reject my ideas, always act so intolerant towards me, always dislike my notes.

You’ve made a decision. You need to put me in my place.

I always go through these ""funks"" is what I like to think of them as. Some weeks I'll be happy and fine and then something will hit me. Like oh so and so hasn't talked to me in awhile they probably forgot about me.

When I was in high school I went through a rough time relationship wise. I was good friends with a lot of girls but they either weren't interested or I just was too awkward once they got to know me. I did have a nice relationship my senior year of high school, but that only lasted 10 months. It just turned into a physical think with messing around on dates, she broke up with me and I've been single ever since. 

I get very jealous..if I see another happy couple I just think to myself oh I bet they'll break up soon, and somehow this brings me  a sad moment of happiness. Why am i happy at thoughts like that. Going back to the friends in high school I had this really good friend M. M and I hung out a lot, but M had a boyfriend. Long story short M just quits talking to me because boyfriend X was jealous. He sent me threatening and degrading messages that really messed me up, especially when M cut me out completely. Even to this day if I say hi to M through a text or Snapchat X tells me to quit talking to M or I will get beat up. (He cheats on her by the way). 

I suppose how I'll tell how I know he cheats. I catfished him into thinking I was some hot girl and even got X to send inappropriate pictures. I sent M the evidence anonymously but she ignored it, which made me sad for her more than anything. Anyway thats my life today, I have friends, we hang out alot, and I have a supporting family. I just feel so empty though. I have this facade of achievements but what am I really? I'm just an awkward loner who is stumbling through life trying not to get hurt.

Thanks for reading if you have gotten this far, it means a lot. Even writing this down has helped me, but I just needed someone to tell my story too. Any advice or comments are welcome, good or bad.

I ended up not liking Accounting as much as I thought I would, but that could be derived from my shitty A/P internship that I had (and put a bad taste in my mouth) + cramming in all of my high level Accounting courses to graduate on time (which was hell).

The bottom line is, I have second interview (if I want to) for an A/P position with potential for Staff Accountant growth, but I like working with people, traveling, and not being stuck in a cubicle all day.  Considering the work environment I'm looking for, would going back to get a MBA or MAcc and going into Audit be a potential fit?

I am the only girl on our team. And one of only a few female engineers in the entire place. 

Maybe I am dumb, maybe it is mental health issues (I have an issue where I idealize people then trash them the second I perceive they have wronged me)... or maybe he really doesn't like me (as a person or just because I am a girl). 

I want to re-iterate, I like him as a person. I don't want to internally trash him or call him out (which I think would basically put a target on my back, in my opinion). But at the same time, I feel like I am treated differently from the rest of the team (of which now includes multiple interns and two more jr engineers, all dudes). 

He just seems short with me but jovial with everyone else. Maybe I am stupid, maybe he doesn't like me as a person. 

So I kind of feel like grass is greener (plus, greedily, I believe I am underpaid) but at the same time I like the freedom of how we work and I really love the company mission. But I dread coming into work. Today I just felt like laying in bed and crying but I had to drag myself to work. 

What does it normally 'look' like when you """"""aren't a culture fit"""""" (*wink* *wink*)? Should I jump ship?

It's early in the process, but it's so obvious to see the rhetoric has remained the same with NHL. You claim that your ""most played game mode"" is HUT. Yet, you cryptically mention in your answered questions that there won't be too much additional solo challenges. The card re-designs are subpar at best. 

There's no innovation. There's nothing unique about NHL 17 or HUT. You borrowed the draft champs idea from FUT and MUT. I would be willing to bet there won't be anything more than head shots on special edition cards in HUT 17, I'd bet the auction house is going to remain mostly the same. If the menu music stays the same, I might explode.

I love hockey. I was a top 50 player in NHL 08. Usually play close to 500-1000 games a year. NHL 16 was the first time I truly felt disappointed in an NHL game, and NHL 17 is on that path. 

I can only imagine how much money HUT brings in for you. Seriously, how much would it cost to bring in a couple part-time employees, an unpaid intern or two, and take some devs off of a totally useless ""create an arena"" mode and actually make HUT an enjoyable game mode with plenty of content? Frankly, compared to other ultimate teams, HUT is a complete and total embarrassment. I realize your staff is a fraction of the size, but myself (and a lot of the community) is not asking for the world. Madden has 5 journey challenges, I'd just like one. Madden has 40 or so special edition cards, I'd just settle for one type of card that has anything more than a different color background. Madden constantly has new types of packs coming out, I'd settle for anything with a guaranteed type of card. Give us SOMETHING, other than these minimal updates. 

As of right now, I will not be buying NHL 17. I understand not everything has been released so far, but if this is what they chose to feature during the initial reveal, I'm not gonna hold my breath for the rest of it. "

My boyfriend and I have been dating for one and a half years. Things have been going really well, up until this summer. My boyfriend is 21, and I am not. As we live in the US, this means I cannot accompany him to bars/clubs/places that serve alcohol. This wasn't too much of an issue when we were on our college campus, however this has been starting to cause a problem. 

My boyfriend has started an internship in NYC for the summer, while I live in a nearby city (about 3 hours away). Because his job is so much more time consuming and stressful (he works in finance), I go and visit him each weekend, instead of him coming to see me. While a 3 hour bus ride each way isn't great, I don't mind it if I get to see him! We had this same arrangement last year, and it caused no issues. 

This year, however, I have begun to feel like a pain because of my age. Most of his friends are 21, and enjoy going out on the weekends. He is always invited, but turns them down as I would be left alone in his apartment with nothing to do. It also seems like a waste for me to spend so much time on a bus if we don't even get to see each other. Because of bus schedules, we only get an hour or two Friday, Saturday, and a few hours on Sunday. 

While he has never outwardly complained about this issue, he has commented how he feels like he doesn't get to see his friends enough. He has said that he doesn't enjoy drinking/partying (which was true during the school year), but I know he is very social. He does spend evenings with them during the week, although I'm sure it is cut short by needing to go to work the next day. Some of his friends have even commented ""Oh, why are you coming every weekend?"" to me when he explains the situation. 

I guess I was wondering how you all think I should go about this: should I not go every weekend? Encourage him to go out on Friday while I stay at his apartment? Ignore them?

4n8rfg,2,2016-06-08,[Help] 3F Lab mix does NOT like 2 visiting dogs (both 5F),LizEnFrance,dogs,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/4n8rfg/help_3f_lab_mix_does_not_like_2_visiting_dogs/,"I'll make this as succinct as possible. My family (3 adults) has two dogs. Lady is a 3yo female chocolate Lab mix (about 60 lbs) we adopted from a rescue at 8 weeks. Maisie (about 40 lbs) is a 9-month-old female flat-coated retriever mix we adopted from a rescue at 4 months. Generally they get along very well. There have been a few spats since we got Maisie, but nothing serious -- just boundary-setting, very brief, kiss-and-make-up-right-afterward stuff. Both are spayed and in good health. 

My sister is visiting from AZ for a month to do an internship, and she brought her two stepkids and two dogs, both spayed females about 5 years old; Zoe is a big (85 lbs) retriever mix, the other a medium-size mix (40 lbs) that might be a Carolina dog. Both are pretty mellow. We have a large house where there's always at least one person home and a big, securely fenced backyard that backs up to a greenbelt -- it's basically doggie paradise.

Lady had met my sister's dogs on a camping trip 2 years ago and they got along fine. Maisie was a little nervous at first -- she's wary of big dogs at the dog park and wasn't sure what to make of Zoe -- but the visiting dogs have coaxed her out of her shell. Lady, however, is Not Happy.

I picked up every treat-dispensing/high-value toy, antler, etc. before the new dogs got here so that wouldn't be a point of contention. We introduced them on a walk in what we thought was neutral territory. Things seemed OK at first. Then Lady started attacking the new dogs, mostly Zoe, for no apparent reason. Once or twice it was probably resource-guarding, but often it happened out of nowhere, or so it seemed to us. She also went after Maisie once, which she hasn't done in months. 

After a day or two of this, we realized it wasn't getting better, so Lady has been kept apart from the other three because we don't want to risk their safety. I contacted our trainer, and she said there's not much we can do in terms of behavioral adjustment that would have any effect before the visiting dogs leave at the end of the month.

Lady is clearly anxious and disconcerted by all the sudden changes, which I think is understandable. She hates being left out when the other three are playing in the backyard, but we just can't take the risk. She's been fine with the humans.

The visitors will leave in a few weeks, but I am now afraid to bring Lady and Maisie to the dog park together because Lady's behavior has become so unpredictable. A few days before the visiting dogs arrived, in fact, Lady went after Maisie in the back of the car several times, and now Maisie will not get in the car if Lady is already in it. I worry that this is developing into a long-term issue. We've tried having them all sit and get treats one by one, taking turns; we've tried ""relax on a mat""; my parents got a ""command collar,"" about which I have deep misgivings (they got one for Maisie too, but I put my foot down on that), but I've read that those can make aggression worse. We have only used positive reinforcement before, so it's painful and bewildering for Lady.

What should we do in the short term and in the long term? Keeping Lady separate from the other dogs is a logistical challenge, but it's doable, and she seems to have mellowed toward Maisie since we implemented that separation. Should we try to work on Lady's aggression while the visiting dogs are here or wait until they leave? I'm open to any ideas. Thanks!"

The problem is I am not at all confident in my choice of medicine as a career. I love the idea of being a physician but I also love the idea of what feels like every other career out there, and I can't narrow my focus when it comes to extracurricular activities/internships/jobs and the like. Like, I would love to do research and volunteer in clinical settings and work as an EMT, but I'd also love to write on a student newspaper and intern with a political thinktank and start an a cappella group and conduct research in the humanities rather than medicine and study abroad and etc.

Am I fucked? Should I limit my involvement in non-med extracurriculars, do my best in medical related shit, and pray that come senior year I still want to be a doctor? Or should I get as deeply involved as I want in whatever I want and hope that works out?"

Instead after reading our broadcast of the United States Constitution they want to join as the 51 state and have brought a small planetoid into orbit to serve as the 51 state.  
  
***

""In what has been deemed a ""monumental achievement"" by scientists the world over, Planetoid US-51, or 'Nutroid,' will be anchored directly to Earth in twenty-four hours via the world's first space elevator. As you may recall, Nutroid was admitted by both the Senate and the House, by over 92% of the vote in each house, to become the USA's fifty-first state at approximately this time last year. Various government officials, including several from the United Nations, have already traveled via spacecraft for the world's first off-planet press conference, along with journalists from every major news outlet in America. We will now be turning to one of our many first-ever Interplanetary On-Scene Reporters, Aurora Marks. Mrs. Marks, are you there?""
***
The Pandora Research Industries' Superluminal Communications Establishment had been abuzz with activity for the last forty-eight hours. In a space the size of a college football stadium (and this was just the production-control room), all posts were manned with the best and brightest of audio-visual engineers, camera operators, and astrophysicists. They watched their monitors intently as interns zipped around the room with coffee orders and flash drives of sensitive data covering everything from orbital pattern adjustments to a severely detailed pre-broadcast report from no less than forty-seven hair and makeup teams.

Today was the most important day in space history since the Apollo 11 moon landing, and was projected to be the most-watched television broadcast in America since Super Bowl XLIX by more than 96%. This was no run-of-the-mill story, and would not be treated as such, which was why PRI was tasked by the American government to operate the planet's first faster-than-light communications array. Every byte of information, from the video being broadcast by each camera, to the tiny blue logos of Twitter and Facebook, was being routed through the SCE at such high speeds and definition, it would be as though each reporter and microblogger were conducting their interviews mere footsteps away from the viewers.

Liam Jankovich, Head Production Engineer for the SCE, flipped through the inter-establishment communication lines until he found the one for the official Pandora News Channel. He put on his Whitetooth^TM headset and queued up the live feed. This would be the first channel to output a live broadcast. So far, all that had been transmitted to the public consisted of text and static images. Private testing had gone well, however, and there was no doubt the transmission would go smoothly.

""Transmission stability at 100%,"" said the voice over the headset. ""FTL communication is a go. Sector One, switch to Camera Prime-Alpha.""

""Camera Prime-Alpha is a go. Transmission stable.""

""We're live in ten... nine...""
***
""I'm here, Ellis."" Over her own Whitetooth, Aurora could hear the Sector One Ground Team cheering over the successful broadcast. She smiled broadly in Nutroid's artificial atmosphere, knowing her face was being transmitted to televisions and computers in every country on Earth. The show had begun, and soon every other news station present on the planetoid would be linked to the SCE to begin their own broadcasts, but at the moment the spotlight was hers and hers alone.

""I'm standing on the surface of Planetoid US-51 right now. It's a balmy seventy-four degrees, thanks to Nutroidian life-support technology, and we are currently less than twenty-four hours away from our final landing in Earth space. We are traveling at over four percent the speed of light, and if you'll look closely, you can see the rings of Saturn as the Nutroidians conduct the first of several gravity-assisted deceleration manuevers.""
***
""Sector One, switch to Camera Prime-Epsilon.""

""Camera Prime-Epsilon is a go. Spectral filter engaged and ready.""
***
The fifth cameraman turned Camera Epsilon upwards, enabling the spectral filter as he did so. The filter acted as a compact telescope observatory, bypassing the Nutroidian atmosphere and providing the closest, clearest images of Saturn since the Voyager 2.

""As you can see, we're moving very quickly, and Saturn will only be viewable by the naked eye for a few more hours. By then, however, we will begin our flyby of Jupiter, and we may even be able to get a closer look inside Jupiter's atmosphere using a new prototype of PandoraTech Palladium Frequency Cameras.""
***
""Thank you, Aurora,"" said Ellis. He turned to the main camera in the SCE Home Base studio. ""Up next, we'll be conducting an interview with Amal Nejem, one of the pilots of the faster-than-light spacecraft responsible for bringing Aurora and every other Nutroidian visitor out to space. But first, a quick break and a word from our sponsor.""
***
Aurora took off her headset. It would be a few hours before she was called on for another report. Each major radio and TV news channel were scheduled to have the world's first live interviews with Nutroidian diplomats as soon as their uplinks to the SCE were established. She would rest, get something to eat, then travel across the planet to a mountain-esque peak where they would set up the PFC. She bounded over to meet the camera crew, enjoying the effect of the planetoid's weak gravity. Two of the cameramen stood over both of the PFCs, looking confused.

""What's wrong?""

""Minor malfunction,"" said Damien, who was in charge of Camera Prime-Delta, the backup PFC. ""Shouldn't be a problem, but it's best to get this sorted out before we go offsite.""

""Okay,"" she replied. ""Let me know when you're finished.""
 
""Actually, can you help us with this?"" asked Vega, the Alpha cameraman. ""We need an extra set of hands, and the others are packing the rover.""
 
""Oh. Sure thing."" Aurora bent down over the camera's protective case. ""Just tell me what you need.""

The PFC was an unwieldy device, even considering the reduced gravity, so it took both Damien and Vega to hold it upright as Aurora searched the various panels and components. She had been briefed on the inner workings of the camera, though not to the same degree as the operators, so they took turns pointing Aurora to what needed checking.

In essence, the Palladium Frequency Camera was a highly sophisticated X-ray. Unlike an X-ray camera, however, it could see deeper into any given surface, even across multiple atmospheres. It streamed at high resolutions, and was far less radioactive. Its primary components were a palladium-based film (hence the name) and an integrated lens, which together could perceive almost the entirety of the electromagnetic spectrum.

After five minutes, they had yet to find the problem. ""Well,"" Vega huffed, ""I give up. Pack it, and let's get some lunch.""

""You still haven't even told me what's wrong with it!"" By now, Aurora was invested in figuring out the problem, despite the fact that she had no idea what she was looking for. ""Everything looks like it's working!""

""Yes, but the video we're receiving is all wrong. Here, I'll show you."" Vega brought out a tablet and scrolled down to a grainy-looking video. ""We pointed the camera down at the surface to test it. All we should be getting is scans of solid rock. Instead, we got this.""

Aurora watched. The video showed figures moving in a fairly regulated manner. ""What am I looking at?""

""Best we can tell, the PFC is picking up movement on the other side of the planet. But we only set it for five miles, which means the calibration is off.""

""What did the other camera pick up?""

""Pretty much the same thing,"" said Damien. ""Why? What are you thinking?""

It was too organized. Aurora got a sense of unease just from looking at the video. The way those little dots on the screen moved with near perfect synchronicity, and in neat rectangular shapes. It reminded her of...

""Turn on the other camera and try again."" When the men stared at her, she stamped her foot, and nearly fell over after misjudging her strength on the planet's surface. ""Just try it. I have a hunch.""

It took them another three minutes to unload the other PFC. By now, the other cameramen were finished packing, and were able to help set up the camera the same way it had pointed for the first test. Aurora and Vega stood, holding the tablet, as the live video began to stream in.

""Well?"" asked Vega.

Aurora turned to him. ""There's nothing wrong with the camera. There really is something down there.""

""What?""

""It reminds me of...""
***
""An army?"" Liam twisted his Whitetooth deeper into his ear. ""Did I hear you right?""

""Yes! A giant army, below the surface of Nutroid,"" Aurora replied. It had taken over an hour, but she had finally gotten a direct link to the head of the SCE. ""Look at the video we sent you!""

""I see it."" Liam shook his head. ""But why would they need an army? There could be any number of reasons Nutroidians are below the surface.""

""Not if they're moving the way they are. My father was a sergeant in the Marines. Those are American military formations, like we sent the Nutroidians in the Constitution Broadcast."" Liam started to speak, but Aurora talked over him. ""You know the story of the Trojan Horse?""

""Yes...""

""This entire planet is their Trojan Horse. We think it's a gift, but it's full of aliens that will open Earth up to an attack. And they have the upper hand, because half of our planet's leaders are here with them!""

""Mr. Jankovich, sir?"" An intern on the floor caught Liam's attention. ""I just spoke with Broadcast Team Beta. They're saying they have a problem with their PFCs picking up strange movements...""

Liam paled. ""Mrs. Marks? I'm going to have to call you back.""

4n937d,2,2016-06-08,"Want to live in Spain for 3+ months, but not sure what to do while i'm there.....I need advice!",Lord_ranger,spain,https://www.reddit.com/r/spain/comments/4n937d/want_to_live_in_spain_for_3_months_but_not_sure/,"Hi all....prepare for a long post, tl;dr at the bottom.

I am a recent high school graduate that is looking to take a gap year before going to college and one of the things that I am hoping to do during that time is to travel and learn spanish! Spain has been at the top of my list of places to visit to learn Spanish at because its located in Europe and would allow me to visit other parts of Europe in addition the culture, villages, and scenery interest me. 

My main goal with traveling is to learn Spanish ""mostly"" fluently, I currently only know a little Spanish after taking 2 years of high school Spanish, but nothing anywhere near a conversational level. Currently I am looking at travelingJanuary 2017 - April/May/June/July/August....not really sure yet. Although leaving earlier is not out of the question the main reason I've set a tentative date of departure to January is because I want to make sure I have ample money saved up so that I am not dependent on getting a job while traveling.

I am pretty open to almost any area in Spain as long as it meets a couple criteria.

* Primary language is Spanish
* Not oversaturated with tourists
* Not oversaturated with English speakers

Other than that, I am open to anywhere in Spain, although Andalucia and Asturias look especially nice! 

What I am really stuck on is what to do! Personally, I don't think it would work for me to live Spain for 3+ months without a job, volunteer opportunity something to occupy me. I need SOMETHING to do, although maybe I am wrong about this? I am not an overly outgoing person, but I would not consider myself extremely shy or reserved. But I am definitely not an extrovert. Thus, not having anything to do while I am there I do not see as a good idea.

Whatever I do in Spain I want to make sure it does not severely hinder my goal of learning the language since that is my main goal. I have an Idea of ""dream"" things to do in Spain but I am not sure how realistic they're.

* Audio Technician for theater, live music or similar(this one is a BIG stretch)
* IT Services, preferably something above support level
* Programming, also a stretch since I do not have a lot of experience
* General techy job

Now I fully realize these jobs/internships/volunteer are a HUGE stretch and probably won't happen but I am putting them out there as a stretch goal. I just want to make sure I have something to do while living in Spain.

Lastly, not sure if this helps but, even though I live in the US I actually am an EU citizen as well! So I don't think  I need a working a visa or anything to be able to work in Spain. Although I do think I need some sort of private insurance...gotta research it a little more.

tl;dr

Want to live in Spain for 3+ months starting in January. I want to learn the language ""fluently"". Don't know what to do while I am there. Would be fine with a either Job, Internship, or volunteering. Prefer something in tech area such as IT, programming, Audio Technician etc. Want to live somewhere not saturated with English speakers and tourists. I am also an EU citizne which I hope helps with finding something to do.

I want to learn Spanish!

Thanks in advance, any input would be highly appreciated."

Hoping to get some guidance.",bca33,MSAccess,https://www.reddit.com/r/MSAccess/comments/4n967f/has_anyone_created_an_application_involving/,"I'm a systems analyst intern this summer, and I have a relatively interesting project. Basically, my company has a ton of scripts that automate just about everything technical. They have an Excel sheet that is updated automatically when scripts are added, changed, or deleted. It also shows other scripts that are dependent on the success of the current script's success. The sheet has description/geographies/other info. 

In a nutshell, they want to have a db (Excel is getting to clunky) that has a front end app to search for descriptions/categories/etc and view the flow of the scripts (think flowchart).

I think it makes sense to go with all microsoft products for connectivity purposes and the fact that I have more VBA experience than I would like to admit. 

My Questions:
-Does anyone have any experience automating data dumps from Excel to Access? From what I'm seeing there's limited functionality built in. I just did a basic macro and found you can't really specify a sheet inside of workbook (unless maybe you can do that in the range parameter?). They have weekly releases that effect what scripts are live (and should be in the db).

-Is it possible to automate the creation of diagrams in visio based on some sort of input queried from the Access db? (something like make a circle, put the job name, then create an arrow to new circle with that job's name in it)? I tried googling it but there were very few articles/support.

Hopefully this wasn't too vague, and posted in the right sub. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated. Thanks."

A lot of the T-shirts are quite nice in terms of quality and I feel a little bad about getting rid of them. What should I do with all of them? Donate them? Make a tech t-shirt quilt?"

I'm struggling with two things right now that I could really use prayer for.

First.  My ex broke up with me about 6 months ago.  We met on a mission trip in South Dakota and quickly hit it off.  I grew very close to her and really appreciated the ways she would challenge my perceptions on faith and Christianity.  

These past months I've just felt a void in my life where she once was.  I've been going to counseling to try and gain perspective on where things went wrong and how to better myself for the future.  Though I'd like to start dating again it's difficult to view myself with anyone else but my ex.  It's especially difficult as we were beginning to talk about engagement as I will be graduating soon.  Commitment means a lot to me and it's hard to let go.  

Second.  I've had issues with my family that are impacting my faith.  Last December, my family had a major fight that culminated from some poor decisions made by my father and poor reactions on everyone elses part.  I feel like I've been driven out of my home and I feel unloved.  My parents are very strict Christians and the way they are handling this situation and the stuff they are saying makes me doubt greatly.  

Overall I just feel lonely.  I miss my family and I miss my ex.  I'm stuck at my university for the summer and most of my friends have graduated or at internships.  My university is in a tiny town too, that's isolated so there's not a ton to do up here.

Anyways thanks for reading this.  I appreciate it."

The last time I talked to her was almost a month ago when I called her at 2am and told her I was still in love with her after we both had started seeing other people (the new girl I was seeing and I decided to cut it off shortly before this after realizing that neither of us was emotionally available, but we remain friends). She shut me down, told me she wouldn't consider being back with me.

Since then I've been on no contact for almost a month. Deleted her phone number and all of our texts. Still have her number from memory but there's nothing I can do about that. Anyway, I just now went the full 9 yards and blocked/removed her from Facebook. I've done some reading on the NC subreddit (very helpful by the way, highly recommend it for anyone trying to get on with their life- I know I used to spend alot of time on this sub to try and work through repeated breakups with this same girl) and decided that full removal from social media was the right way to go. Part of me didn't want to give her the satisfaction of making her realize how much it hurt that she rejected me, and another part of me was worried there are other social repercussions to blocking her on Facebook- being the crazy ex, things of that sort. But I think it was the right call. My other concern is that if she were to realize I blocked her on FB that might prompt her to get upset and contact me. I decided that the chances of that must be pretty slim though, and that it would be much better if I didn't have to deal with seeing her with someone else.

I'll admit to a possibility that I'm still holding on to. I had this weird sort of anomaly a few days after starting NC- I got a phone call from a blocked phone number- didn't end up answering because I was in class. Anyway, she has blocked my phone number in past breakups so it's very possible that she was calling me from her phone while she still had my phone number blocked. I know I'm only holding on to this possibility because the idea that she would want me back was really encouraging at the time. After some reading (thank you again NC sub) I've realized that it doesn't really matter whether she did or didn't call, or even whether she did or didn't want to get back together. She wasn't willing to put the work in that our relationship needed, and that's really all things come down to.

A couple more things- I still think about her every day, for decent lengths of time. I was downtown with some friends tonight and was a little bit worried I would run into her. Definitely not enough to mess up my night though. I started to cry about our breakup most days for the past week or so, but I suspect this is pretty natural and just part of the process. I haven't wanted to call her, talk to her, see her, anything. I think space just has that effect, so I'll take that as my small victory. The hardest part is that lots of little things remind me of her- I'm strong enough now where I can move past them, but it's still difficult dealing with the thought of her as often as I do. Any advice on moving past these little things that bother me?

I'm going to be leaving town for 3 months for an internship starting on Monday. I never see her around anyway but the space will be nice. By the time I'm back I'm hoping to be well over this nightmare.
   
**tl;dr**: First month of no contact after a breakup almost two months ago- things are going better! What's the best way to move past the little things that keep reminding me of her?"

They're a huge tech company and I was so excited to work for them. Because I got this role and had a signed contract, I stopped looking for other roles and planned around this one.

&amp;nbsp;

I am supposed to start in October, but yesterday, HR called me to tell me that they've pushed my start date back to March 2017. I don't know how they expected me to take this news, but I am devastated. Basically, I've planned my entire next few years around this company. They are sponsoring me for my UK visa (my student visa expires in October) and the pushed back start date means that I will have to go back to Canada for 4-5 months.

&amp;nbsp;

They conveniently waited until just a week after all other job applications have closed. I was a highly sought after candidate, because I have good marks and did a Google internship. But now all the other roles I was in contention for have filled, and I am left with basically two choices - go to Canada until February/March and stick with this job, or withdraw my acceptance and try to find another job that will sponsor me before October.

&amp;nbsp;

I was so excited for this. They were giving me a signing bonus in my first month, and I was going to take my partner to Japan for two weeks. He's been amazing and supportive while I've been studying, and I wanted to do something nice for him. He's Irish and has an amazing job here. He couldn't come back to Canada with me. I can try to apply for an EEA family permit through him because we've been together for 6 years and have been living together for 4, but to get that permit I'll still have to fly back home to Canada. 

&amp;nbsp;

I just don't know what to do. I chose this role because I wanted to experience lots of different areas of the tech industry and not start into a specific area straightaway. The only roles that are still hiring in London are mostly start ups (no visa sponsorship...) or companies that I could not work for (security clearance etc). I went from having my pick of amazing jobs with companies (like Google) to having to scramble to find something last-minute.

&amp;nbsp;

They just do not seem to care how difficult a position they've put me in. I have a partner here. I have rent and loan payments that I'll have to make in the UK regardless of whether or not I'm here. I can't just hop on a plane and go live with my mum for 4-5 months. I'm a mature student and I'm in an incredibly difficult position now. My sister is a lawyer and she's trying to look into UK law about this sort of thing, but she's a criminal defence lawyer in Ontario, so it's not something she knows about already.

&amp;nbsp;

I was in such a good place. I finished exams on Monday, my little sister is here to visit, I'm going on a holiday to Spain for a week on Saturday... and now I am just devastated. My depression is hitting me like a ton of bricks. I am just at such a loss."

Smear Campaign in British Labour Party

Imperialism, Zionism and Anti-Jewish Bigotry

The following was written by our comrades in the Spartacist League/Britain.

In the run-up to the 5 May local and Welsh and Scottish assembly elections, the left-wing leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, was subjected to a vicious smear campaign spearheaded by Labour’s right wing with the aid of the Tories (Conservatives) and the capitalist press. Corbyn was elected as party leader last September based on talk of socialism, trade-union rights and immigrant rights and is also a forthright defender of Palestinian rights. The get-Corbyn cabal, which reached all the way to Zionist New York Times columnist Roger Cohen and Israeli opposition leader Isaac Herzog, shrieked that the party under his leadership has become a haven for “leftist anti-Semites.” To hear Tory swine like Prime Minister David Cameron and then-mayor of London Boris Johnson sanctimoniously bemoaning racism in the Labour Party was truly sickening.

The right wingers of the Labour Party, successors to former prime minister Tony Blair, have been manoeuvering to oust him. Most recently they looked forward to removing him in the event of a Labour defeat in the elections. In the upshot, Labour pretty much held its own. Underlining the cynical character of the witch hunt, the “discovery” of ever more “anti-Semites” ceased even before the ballots had been counted, to be replaced by a new “scandal” that Corbyn’s Labour Party was supposedly rife with woman-haters. The latest smear was based on specious claims, quickly proven false, that many of the 35,000 signatories to a petition urging the BBC to remove Laura Kuenssberg as its political editor had made misogynist comments. Kuenssberg has consistently hounded Corbyn, seeing in him a representative of the working masses the establishment so loathes.

The supposed evidence of anti-Jewish bigotry ranged from the trivial to the stitched-up, much of it coming from the notorious right-wing bottom-feeding blogger who goes by the name “Guido Fawkes” and dating back to well before Corbyn became party leader last September. The witch hunters were joined by the successful Labour candidate for London mayor, Sadiq Khan, a Muslim who had himself been pilloried by the Tories for allegedly befriending “Muslim extremists.” Corbyn strenuously rejected charges that Labour was full of racists, but he did acquiesce to the suspension of a number of party members. Worse yet, his chief lieutenant John McDonnell volubly endorsed the crusade to hunt down “anti-Semites” in the party. Those suspended included Muslim MP Naz Shah, who was also forced to resign as McDonnell’s parliamentary private secretary, and sometime left-Labourite Ken Livingstone. These suspensions should be rescinded immediately.

Livingstone has much to answer for to the working class. As mayor of London he faithfully served the City bankers, he urged Tube [subway] workers to cross RMT picket lines and defended the role of the police in the cold-blooded execution of Brazilian electrician Jean Charles de Menezes in 2005. As a Spartacist League placard at the London May Day rally read: “Ex-Mayor Livingstone: Pro-City, Pro-Police, Anti-Union, but NOT Anti-Jewish!” A second placard read: “No Vote to Blairite Stooge Sadiq Khan!”

To his credit, Livingstone rightly stated: “If you look at what this is all about, it’s not about anti-Semitism in the Labour Party.... What this is all about is actually the struggle of the embittered old Blairite MPs to try to get rid of Jeremy Corbyn” (BBC News online, 30 April). Indeed, a spokesman for the Zionist Britain Israel Communications and Research Centre (BICOM) admitted as much when he ranted, “Save your pitch fork for Corbyn.”

As we documented in our article, “Britain: Banana Monarchy” (Workers Vanguard No. 1082, 29 January), since Corbyn’s election, the Tories, Blairites and the bourgeois media—especially the liberal Guardian—have waged an unrelenting class war aimed at removing him. Only days after Corbyn took over as Labour leader, the Sunday Times (20 September 2015) published a warning from an unnamed “senior serving general” that Corbyn would face a “mutiny” if he tried to act on his commitment to scrap the Trident submarine nuclear missile system or pull out of NATO. This coup threat was echoed two months later when the head of the armed forces, General Nicholas Houghton, in full military regalia, effectively declared on TV that Corbyn’s opposition to nuclear weapons made him unfit to be prime minister. Houghton was immediately backed up by Corbyn’s defence spokesman, the Blairite Maria Eagle. Barely a week has gone by without some overt attack on Corbyn by Blairite plotters. But as the outcome of the latest vendetta shows, every plot to remove him comes up against the stubborn fact that he is more popular than ever among the party membership, which has doubled in size since his campaign for party leader.

Corbyn is hardly a revolutionary; he is firmly committed to a parliamentary path to what would effectively be a new version of the old Labourite “welfare state.” Nonetheless, Corbyn’s election as Labour leader came as a nasty shock to the bourgeois establishment, and especially the right wing of the Labour Party. His campaign set in motion a process to restore the party’s historic links to its working-class base, reversing the direction the Blairites had taken towards becoming an overtly capitalist party. As we wrote in “Britain: Banana Monarchy”:

“Any move that weakens the grip of the Blairites within the party is in the interests of the working class in its struggles against the capitalist class. As the Spartacist League/Britain has stated from the beginning, we have a side in the class war raging in the Labour Party. Against the right-wing attempts to oust him, we say: Defend Jeremy Corbyn’s right to run the Labour Party, and in his way!”

Zionism: No Friend of the Jewish People

August Bebel, a central leader of the pre-World War I German Social Democracy, pithily described anti-Jewish bigotry, which whipped up populist venom by singling out “Jewish bankers,” as the “socialism of fools.” But those who today promiscuously toss around unfounded accusations of anti-Semitism are sinister enemies of all who solidarise with the Palestinian people and of the left and workers movement as a whole. The campaign to neutralise and silence international solidarity with the besieged Palestinian people is orchestrated from the highest levels of the Israeli state, with support from its imperialist patrons in Britain, the U.S. and Germany.

In 2011, the Israeli government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu enacted a law that criminalised advocacy of a boycott of Israel. And at a March 28 conference in Jerusalem to plot strategy against the pro-Palestinian Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, Intelligence Minister Yisrael Katz called for “targeted civil eliminations” of BDS “leaders.” Coming from a government that has killed some 200 Palestinians just since last October, and slaughtered more than 2,300 during its July 2014 onslaught on Gaza, this is not idle chatter.

Within the Labour Party, there is considerable overlap between Labour Friends of Israel and the Blairite Progress grouping. In early April, Progress head Richard Angell issued an “action plan” involving the Jewish Labour Movement to deal with “antisemitism within [Labour’s] ranks” (mirror.co.uk, 5 April). The Jewish Labour Movement is affiliated not only to the Labour Party but also to the World Zionist Organization, which finances the expansion of Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank.

This provides some context for the recent raft of “anti-Semitism” smears in Britain. In February, Alex Chalmers, a BICOM intern, slandered the Oxford University Labour Club for having “some kind of problem with Jews” after they voted to endorse Israeli Apartheid Week on campus. When Malia Bouattia, a Muslim woman of Algerian origin who supports the Palestinian cause, subsequently ran successfully for the presidency of the National Union of Students, she, too, was accused of being anti-Jewish. Vicki Kirby, a Labour candidate in Woking [outside of London], was suspended for a 2011 tweet that Guido Fawkes dug up and doctored to make it look as if she promoted racist caricatures of Jews. As Jewish writer David Baddiel attested, Kirby had simply quoted some lines from his 2010 comedy film The Infidel.

Fawkes likewise “outed” Naz Shah for a 2014 Facebook post, before she became a Labour MP, that depicted a map of Israel superimposed on a map of the U.S. Ironically, those who maligned Shah for allegedly supporting the forced transfer of the Israeli Jewish population are the very people who apologise for an Israeli government filled with open proponents of the forced transfer of the Palestinian population from “Greater Israel.” It turned out that the map was originally posted by American Jewish academic Norman Finkelstein, who pointed to the obvious dark humour intended: “So, we have this joke: Why doesn’t Israel become the 51st state? Answer: Because then, it would only have two senators” (opendemocracy.net). The Zionists hate Finkelstein, the son of a concentration camp survivor, not least for his indictments of how they cynically wield the Nazi genocide of the Jews as a bludgeon against those who speak out against Israeli atrocities.

Ken Livingstone was accused of being anti-Jewish because, in defending Shah, he had the chutzpah to say that when “Hitler won his election in 1932, his policy then was that Jews should be moved to Israel. He was supporting Zionism. This was before he went mad and ended up killing six million Jews.” Sundry critics tried to dismiss Livingstone’s statement by pointing out how his facts were mangled (Hitler never won an election, etc., etc.). Despite his glib reduction of the Holocaust to a product of Hitler’s madness, his point about collaboration between Zionists and the Nazis is correct. Livingstone cited Lenni Brenner’s Zionism in the Age of the Dictators (1983), a book the Spartacist League/Britain drew on for the article “Zionist Big Lie targets Perdition” (Workers Hammer No. 88, May 1987). The Zionists prevented that play, written by Jim Allen and directed by Ken Loach, from being staged in London because it was based on the true story of Zionist collaboration with the Nazis in facilitating the deportation to the death camps of more than 400,000 Hungarian Jews in 1944.

Hitler’s ultimate aim was the extermination of all Jews, Zionist and non-Zionist alike. But in its first years, the Third Reich frequently accepted the proffered assistance of the Zionists in helping make Germany “Judenrein” (cleansed of Jews). As documented by Yeshiva University historian Lucy Dawidowicz in The War Against the Jews 1933-1945 (1975), only months after Hitler came to power, the Zionist Federation of Germany (ZVfD) “proposed that the ‘new German state’ recognize the Zionist movement as the most suitable Jewish group in the new Germany with which to deal” and “that since emigration would provide a solution to the Jewish question, it should therefore receive government assistance.” The ZVfD welcomed “the foundation of the new state, which has established the principle of race.” Two months later, the Jewish Agency signed the secret August 1933 Ha’avara (Transfer) agreement with the Hitler regime, which allowed wealthy German Jews to move to Palestine (and only to Palestine) with part of their capital in order to provide an outlet for German exports.

In turn, the Nazi state granted special status to the Zionist movement, which was far smaller than the non-Zionist Jewish organisations. In January 1935, Nazi chief Reinhard Heydrich, head of the Gestapo and second-in-command of the SS, told the Bavarian political police that “the activity of the Zionist-oriented youth organizations...lies in the interest of the National Socialist state’s leadership” because they were preparing Jews for emigration to Palestine (quoted in Dawidowicz). While active socialists and communists were thrown into Dachau, the Zionists were for some years the only non-Nazi political group allowed to function legally, the Zionist banner the only flag aside from the Nazi swastika to fly on German soil.

There was more to this than Zionist Realpolitik in the face of overwhelming Nazi repression, as latter-day apologists would have it. As the revolutionary workers movement grew towards the end of the 19th century, so did organised anti-Jewish bigotry. Overwhelmingly, the Jewish workers, and a significant layer of the Jewish intelligentsia, sought their salvation through the struggle, alongside their non-Jewish class brothers and sisters, for socialist revolution. It was to stanch this movement and to incite pogroms that the tsarist secret police propagated The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, a crude forgery that conjured up an international Jewish conspiracy to take over the world. But when rumours of a pogrom spread through St. Petersburg at the height of the 1905 Revolution, the workers’ soviet mobilised some 12,000 armed workers to fight the reactionaries; likewise in Warsaw, integrated workers defence guards were set up to patrol Jewish areas and ward off pogromist mobs (see “Revolution, Counterrevolution and the Jewish Question,” Spartacist [English-language edition] No. 49-50, Winter 1993-94).

In his 1958 essay “The Non-Jewish Jew,” Marxist historian Isaac Deutscher accounted for the disproportionate role of Jews in the socialist movement:

“They were a priori exceptional in that as Jews they dwelt on the borderlines of various civilizations, religions, and national cultures. They were born and brought up on the borderlines of various epochs. Their mind matured where the most diverse cultural influences crossed and fertilized each other....

“Like Marx, Rosa Luxemburg and Trotsky strove, together with their non-Jewish comrades, for the universal, as against the particularist, and for the internationalist, as against the nationalist, solutions to the problems of their time.”

Zionist founding father Theodor Herzl (1860-1904) despised the assimilationist and pro-socialist Jewish proletariat. Rather than fight anti-Jewish bigotry and repression, Herzl and his fellow Zionists used it as an excuse to separate Europe’s Jews from their compatriots and mould them into a nation with its own homeland, in Palestine. Ideologically nurtured in the cradle of German national “awakening,” Zionism embraced the reactionary ideals of Blut (blood) and Volk (nation). Born long after the bourgeois nation-state had outlived its historically progressive role in the era of capitalist consolidation, Zionism distinguished itself in being a particularly venal and racialist brand of nationalism. The Zionist leaders raised the battle cry, “A land without people for a people without land,” knowing full well that to make Palestine a land without people would require the expulsion of much of its Arab population.

The Zionist project could only be realised with the support of a powerful imperialist patron—be it tsarist Russia, the Kaiser’s (or Hitler’s) Germany, Britain or the U.S. The Zionists peddled their wares with the claim that they could neutralise Jewish support for the revolutionary socialist movement. As Winston Churchill later ranted, the Zionists could help in defeating the “sinister confederacy” of “International Jews” who conspired “for the overthrow of civilization” (“Zionism versus Bolshevism, A Struggle for the Soul of the Jewish People,” Illustrated Sunday Herald, 8 February 1920). While Zionist leader Chaim Weizmann looked to the British or U.S. imperialists, the Revisionist right wing inspired by Vladimir Jabotinsky gravitated towards Mussolini’s Italy and even Hitler’s Germany. As late as 1941, a Revisionist splinter calling itself the National Military Organisation (NMO), better known as the Stern Gang, appealed to the Third Reich:

“Common interests could exist between the establishment of a New Order in Europe in conformity with the German concept, and the true national aspirations of the Jewish people as they are embodied by the NMO.”

—quoted in Zionism in the Age of the Dictators

It was such “common interests” that led Herzl and his followers to find allies among the more reactionary elements of the bourgeoisie, who wanted to rid themselves of “their” Jews. Weizmann managed to secure the 1917 Balfour Declaration, with its vague promise of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. The British imperialists aimed to establish a bulwark of support in the region, pitting Jews against Palestinians. They also hoped to undermine Jewish support for Bolshevism on the eve of the victorious October Revolution in Russia, then Britain’s ally in World War I.

In this latter aim they failed. In the course of the Russian Revolution and the civil war against imperialist and domestic counterrevolutionary forces, which carried out pogroms against Jews and reds wherever they went, the dispossessed Jewish masses flocked to the Bolshevik banner. The Jewish nationalist and pro-Zionist socialist groups in Russia and the Ukraine became empty shells. As the Third All-Russia Conference of the Jewish Communist Sections declared in 1920:

“The Jewish workers and the poorest of the Jewish people understand quite well that only the communist order will put an end to all pogroms, will root out all nationalist prejudices, will erase all national restrictions and install over the whole face of the earth a genuine brotherhood of peoples.”

—News of Central Bureau of the Jewish Sections (October 1920)

The Bolshevik Revolution and the early Soviet state under Lenin and Trotsky were a beacon to workers and the oppressed everywhere, including the Arab masses subjugated by British imperialism in the Near East, who suffered under the barbarity of capitalist “civilisation.” The overthrow of capitalism and the institution of a planned collectivised economy opened the road to the liberation and development of all the many Soviet peoples. Even after the reactionary and nationalist Stalinist bureaucracy usurped political power from the working class, it was the proletarian class character of the Soviet Union that allowed it to save well over two million Jews fleeing the Nazi murder machine and to smash Hitler’s Third Reich. In contrast, the imperialist “democracies” turned back all but a handful of Jewish refugees. Many of the Jewish refugees who were allowed into Britain were detained as so-called enemy aliens during World War II and thousands were deported. Most notorious was the ship Dunera, which was packed with 2,000 mostly Jewish refugees along with 450 Italian and German prisoners for the two-month voyage to Australia.

For a Socialist Federation of the Near East!

Young activists who solidarise with the cause of the Palestinian people in the face of Israeli state terror would do well to consider the words of the Jewish Communists in 1920. Revolutionary proletarian internationalism is the only road to the national and social emancipation of the Palestinian people. This may seem far-fetched in an age when the opportunist “far left” sneers at the Marxist goal of an egalitarian international communist order and even class struggle seems a thing of the past. However, if the past decade has demonstrated nothing else, it is that catastrophic crises are endemic to the capitalist profit system. The same holds true of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, as the current strike wave in France and years of protests and strikes in Greece demonstrate, notwithstanding the stranglehold of the reformist, pro-capitalist trade union bureaucracies.

The capitalist state of Israel is no exception to this Marxist understanding. While Israeli society has moved steadily to the right in recent decades, the historic interests of the Israeli Jewish working class run counter to those of their capitalist rulers and exploiters. So long as the national rather than the class axis prevails, the Palestinians will lose out to the overwhelming military superiority of the Zionist state. It is only the working class of Israel that has the capacity and historic interest to shatter the Zionist state from within. In fighting for the creation of revolutionary internationalist workers parties in the Near East we struggle to win the Israeli Jewish workers away from their Zionist rulers, to recognise that their class allies are the working people of the Arab countries and to champion the national rights of the Palestinians. Likewise we seek to break the Arab toiling masses from Arab nationalism and Islamic reaction (see “Defend the Palestinian People!” Workers Vanguard No. 1089, 6 May).

The 2011 Egyptian protests did find an echo in the mass protests in Israel that summer, showing the potential to undermine the garrison mentality drummed into Israeli Jewish workers by the Zionist rulers, who tell them that they are surrounded by a “sea” of hostile Arabs. However, the uprising in Egypt did not present a challenge to capitalist rule by the proletariat; rather, it was dominated by bourgeois nationalists and Islamists. For their part, the Revolutionary Socialists (RS) in Egypt, associated with the British Socialist Workers Party (SWP), simply capitulated to these forces. From pushing illusions in the army to backing the reactionary Muslim Brotherhood and, ultimately, the coup that brought the military to power, at every stage the RS helped to ensure that the Egyptian proletariat would remain tied to its class enemies.

In Britain, the reformists of the SWP prate that the liberal BDS movement is “the potentially most serious challenge to Israel’s position and to the continuance of its long-term policy of piecemeal and de facto annexation of the whole of Palestine” (Socialist Review, July/August 2013). The BDS campaign is based on the bankrupt assumption that the Israeli state can be pressured by its “democratic” imperialist paymasters to halt the oppression of the Palestinian people. The notion that the (admittedly well-funded and powerful) “Zionist lobby” is responsible for imperialist support to Israel is ludicrous. It is in pursuit of its own geopolitical interests that U.S. imperialism pumps some $3 billion a year in military aid to its Israeli gendarme.

According to the Palestine Solidarity Committee, the boycott strategy “exerts moral pressure on the British Government by giving expression to the desire to move towards a more ethical foreign policy.” “Democratic” Britain, as much as, if not more than, any other country, bears the burden of historical responsibility for making the Near East the slaughterhouse that it is today. At the start of World War I, Britain sought to encourage an Arab revolt against the Ottoman Empire, then Britain’s enemy, by promising that the Arabs would be granted freedom at the war’s end. Two years later, the British imperialists and their French allies, in the secret 1916 Sykes-Picot agreement, carved up the Near East for themselves. This was followed by the pro-Zionist Balfour Declaration. Thirty years later, the Clement Attlee Labour government presided over the bloody partition of Palestine (and the far bloodier partition of India). Divide and rule—that is the “morality” of British imperialism.

While defending BDS activists when they come under attack by the state, we oppose this strategy, which looks to the supposed “humanitarian” instincts of capitalist governments, campus administrations and corporate giants to pressure Israel. Ongoing economic sanctions serve mainly to weaken and undermine the workers and oppressed of the targeted country, not its capitalist rulers. Particularly odious are academic and cultural boycotts, which equate Israeli scholars and artists—such as the integrated West-Eastern Divan Orchestra set up by Palestinian scholar Edward Said and Jewish musician Daniel Barenboim—with the chauvinist Zionist rulers. In contrast, Marxists assert the need for international working-class solidarity with the Palestinians. A standing boycott by British and U.S. dock workers, for example, refusing to handle military shipments to Israel, would strike a powerful blow against Zionist state terror.

Marxists reject the notion widely held on the left that an oppressor nation forfeits its right to self-determination. This is a species of nationalist moralism, which ends up mirroring the lie that equates Zionism with the Jewish people. As we explained in “Birth of the Zionist State: A Marxist Analysis” (WV No. 45, 24 May 1974):

“Out of the destruction of European Jewry by Hitler (without whose aid the Zionists would have gone the way of the Shakers and other utopian sects) and at the expense of the Palestinian Arabs, a settler colony was transformed into a nation....

“This Hebrew nation came into existence through force and violence, through the suppression, forced expulsion and genocide of other peoples. Communists must oppose this brutal national oppression. Yet once this historical fact is accomplished, we must certainly recognize that nation’s right to self-determination, unless we prefer the alternative, namely national genocide.”

We defend the Palestinian people against the Zionist state down the line, even when that means taking a military side with Islamic fundamentalists like Hamas in Gaza. But we recognise the right of the Israeli Jews as well as the Palestinians to national self-determination. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is at bottom a situation of interpenetrated peoples. Both peoples lay claim to the same small sliver of land. Under capitalism, the exercise of national self-determination by one side necessarily comes at the expense of the other. There can and will be no just resolution to the conflicting national rights of the Palestinian and Israeli Jewish peoples short of the establishment of a socialist federation of the Near East, requiring the overthrow of all the bourgeois states of the region through proletarian revolutions.

For revolutionaries in Britain, solidarity with the oppressed in the neocolonial countries must start with opposing our “own” ruling class and fighting to bring down British imperialism through socialist revolution at home. Leftist youth who seek effective solidarity with the Palestinian people against Zionist terror need to study the lessons of the Bolshevik Revolution, the greatest victory for the working class and the oppressed to date. Based on those lessons, the Spartacist League/Britain, section of the International Communist League, fights to cohere a revolutionary workers party as part of a reforged Trotskyist Fourth International. It is only through the worldwide victory of the socialist proletariat that all manner of exploitation, oppression and imperialist barbarity will be overcome.

Trying to rank importance I'm thinking:

1. Studying: I'm trying to spend at least 8 pomodoros per day. Which is a lot considering all my schooldays start at 08 and end at 16. I use Anki on the tram so that I can do spaced memory stuff I don't count this as part of my pomodoro.

2. Formula 1: This I consider part of studying, like I consider school as a way to get me to a team and I guess I need to look out for internships of some sort. But I wonder if I should start learning CAD software before I get to university? Will I even have time for that?

3. All physical activities, I'm considering doing physical stuff 3X a week so running on Tuesdays, dancing on Thursdays and longboarding on Sundays?

With all this in mind I feel like I have too much stuff going on, should I sell my longboard, stop dancing and maybe stop music production and pick up CAD software instead?

***

The lone gunslinger swayed in the middle of the road, blood trickling from his forehead. All around him, the Blacksand Bandits lay dead: sprawled out on the dirt, hanging from windows, dangling from the roofs and even sticking out of barrels. Smoke curled from the mouth of his revolver as he lowered it slowly.

“There’s only one type of justice when you attack the innocent,” he drawled. “Gunpowder justice.”

“Cut!”

The director hopped from his chair and hurried over to the gunslinger as the crew, like a well-trained army of ants, descended on the set to clean-up. Horace yawned and looked at his watch. Six past two in the morning. It’d been a long day. He was horribly sleepy even without having to use his power.

“Oh for Pete’s sake, they won’t bite you,” snapped Sandra the props manager as a pair of interns eyed one of the corpses with distaste.

“It smells really bad,” one of them said. He nudged the head with his foot. “How did you even make them so real?”

“Yeah, why not have the actors play dead?”

“Shut up and do your job.” Facing Horace, she whispered, “Couldn’t you do anything about the smell?”

He shook his head. “These are as fresh as I can make them.” One of the men gave a high-pitched scream. Horace didn’t have to look to know that one of the corpses had fallen apart.

“Don’t get me wrong, I really appreciate your … ability. But we’ve had six massacre scenes and if we can’t keep reusing them … well, people are going to ask questions.”

He nodded as he gathered his things. One of the perks of his job was not having to clean-up. But Sandra was right; the smell was becoming unbearable. Even the real actors lying among the dead had trouble keeping straight faces. Vomiting was becoming frequent. “I’ll try.”

“Thank you,” she said in relief. “See you tomorrow.”

Horace turned to go, but the director caught up to him, an energetic fellow named John. One of the few who knew about his power, and the only one who thought it was a great bit of fun, John slapped him on the back and said, “Leaving so soon? Join us for a couple of beers, man.”

“I need sleep.”

“You can sleep when you’re one of your creations!” He laughed. “Okay, kidding, need you here tomorrow at eight. I’m making a change to the explosion scene. Instead of a house, we’re blowing up—”

“Bodies,” Horace said wearily.

“That’s right. We can use these babies, I’m sure no one will notice. But just in case … might need a few more fresh ones. Y’know, for those framing shots. Actually, that got me thinking, about the second battle of Hogtown …”

At some point, Horace finally managed to shrug the director’s arm off his back and hurry away before he could be called back. For some reason, the director’s enthusiasm only made him more annoyed at his gift. Sure, his salary was much higher than the average prop assistant’s, and certainly higher than when he was a haunted house decorator or a cadaver procurement officer (medical students loved him), but he was only in it to make a living. The director, however, thought it was art.

What the hell was so artful about making corpses appear from thin air?

Thanks to the schedule, he’d missed both lunch and dinner, and now there was a nasty, burning sensation his belly. The sooner this project was over, the better. Maybe it was time to start looking at museums next. Madame Tussauds was a good idea.

He stopped by a convenience store on the way home for a meal. The cashier didn’t even look up when he entered, engrossed as she was in her comic book. There was only one other person in the store, an elderly lady tottering in the dairy aisle. Her leathery face reminded him of some of the corpses he’d conjured, making his stomach squirm for a moment.

While he was picking out frozen pizzas from a fridge, he heard the ring of a bell signalling the door opening. And then a muffled voice said, “Give me all the money. And everyone here, move out where I can see you, now!”

A gunshot went off. Horace dropped the pizza he was holding and shuffled toward the front of the store, where a man wearing a ski mask was pointing a gun at the cashier.

“On the ground,” he said. “You too, granny.” The old woman standing nearby had gone white, clutching her purse tightly. “Down, or I shoot you.”

“Are you really going to hurt an old lady?” Horace said.

“Shut up, wiseass. I’ll kill you. I swear.”

Suddenly, an alarm began blaring from the ceiling. The robber looked around frantically before turning to the cashier. “You gonna die for that.”

The gun went off as she screamed, but the bullet slammed into a corpulent, blue-tinged body that had appeared in front of her. Both went tumbling behind the counter as the robber stared. “What was that?”

Horace lunged at the old woman and pulled her aside as the robber began firing indiscriminately. Bullets tore into shelves, tinned food and bags of sweets. Knowing they were still in danger, Horace summoned several more corpses behind them for protection. On an impulse, he closed a hand over the woman’s eyes.

The robber was now yelling, high-pitched and frightened. “What’s going on? Who are these people?”

Peeking over the small wall of bodies, Horace focused on a spot above the robber’s head. Instantly, two bloody halves of a body appeared and fell onto him, drenching him in blood. The man shrieked, dropped the gun, and began clawing at his own body, even as thick, putrid fluids flowed into his mouth and eyes.

Five minutes later, the police arrived to the scene. Though they were businesslike in cuffing the suspect—who was raving with insanity—most of them couldn’t hide their repulsion. Horace merely shrugged when interviewed and said, “He killed them all. It was horrible. Horrible, I tell you. I feel numb.”

They released him not long later. Two pizzas and a bottle of grape juice in his hand, Horace resumed his journey home, the robbery already fading from his thoughts."

Age:12

Sex/Neuter status:female/spayed

Breed:Chihuahua mix

Body weight:10lbs

History:hepatocellular carcinoma 2014

Clinical signs:Hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence may 2016

Duration:2 and a half years

Your general location: Toronto, On

My dog has been diagnosed with a cancer on her liver that is most likely a recurrence of the one from 2014. I've been devastated for the last couple weeks that I have been trying to gather as much information as possible, from multiple specialists and I think it's only making matters worse because they are all so different. 

Shortly after her second surgery in feb 2016 to remove what turned out to be hyperplasia and inflammation of the liver (we thought it was a tumour first), I was expecting only good news from there on. The surgeon explained usually two years of no recurrence, there is nothing to worry about, and the original cancer shouldn't come back.

May 2016 b/w at 700 ALT and 400 ALP
Ultrasound done: 3x4 cm mass found on top of the staple lines where the original cancerous tumour was back in 2014

When the surgeon first spoke to me, he explained that it could be hyperplasia and that we can potentially just leave it in. Advised on a biopsy to see what it is. I asked if it was a tumour what do we do? He told me we would do surgery. I asked if it would be an easy procedure and he said not easy but moderate.

Next day, I find out its Hepatocellular Carcinoma and his intern tells me they would only debulk it and would be leaving microscopic disease. Leaving me no options, and here I start to cry and think this is the end. Starting my depression.

The surgeon calls me the following day and explains that he would not be able to remove it all and that the best option not is to try palladia. Maybe do surgery before Palladia, or after Palladia. And confirms the surgery is very possible to do and still on the table. But speak to the internal specialist that performed her ultrasound first. Tells me he has had good experience with Palladia.

Next day I meet with the internal specialist, and he explains to me that he does not recommend doing surgery at all. Tells me leaving that much microscopic disease is just gonna have it come back within months. Says my only real option is try palladia. 50-70% of the time it works. 30% of that time it actually shrinks. I asked about doing surgery first then start her on palladia, he tells me it's risky and his recommendation is to not do it. Explains he had two dog of similar situation on palladia. One for 3 and a half years, and the other for 1 and a half years. I agree to put her on palladia and accept that she cannot do surgery.

Somewhere down the line, about a couple days later I get into deeper depression and cannot except her fate. I get angry that they cannot do surgery and call my local vet asking for a second opinion, where she suggested me going to an oncologist that she knows very well.

I go and see him and he is not what I expected. He was extremely disgusted because my dog accidentally tried to bite her. Aside from that, he told me no to surgery and that there was no point. Based on reports palladia will hopefully give her only 6-12 months. Tells me she most likely wont be living after  a year. I am again devastated and go to work thinking about this. (I told him how the internal specialist told me that he had a patient on it for 3 years, and this oncologist basically said I must have misunderstood 3 years for 3 weeks.) 

I call the surgeon and I tell him how upset I am, he told me surgery is possible and he was so optimistic, why is this oncologist giving me that negative feedback. He then said, that he spoke to the internal specialist and they both agreed that Palladia can give amazing results. He told me his cat was on it for over 2 years. He just thinks with palladia there is no need for surgery. But if it doesn't work then we can do surgery and put her on it again.

I am seeing a different oncologist on Wednesday (located where the surgeon and internal specialist is).

I am confused more than ever, I don't know whose word to take. Everyones is completely different. What do I do? How do I go forward? My family vet thinks I should go to a therapist soon, because she is telling me I'm grieving before anything has happened, and I'm just gonna get myself so deep that I might have a really hard time getting out of it. 

I cannot concentrate on work, I cry every day, I just want to sleep. I post on here almost daily!!! 

I am lost. "

It started when I was 18. I was a freshie, excited for college &amp; wanting a new beginning. I was never particularly popular in highschool, so I really wanted to have some degree of social life in college. I met this one girl back then. She was just an average girl, not so different from myself. Actually, she was very similar. We were both from the same town, and now we were both in the same faculty in the same school 3000 miles away. We had many of the same interests. We had some mutual acquaintances. We frequented the same malls. Freshman Week was the only time I ever interacted with her.

My interest was piqued. So I began to research her. My curiosity knew no bounds. I found videos of her on Youtube. I found her tumblr and her pinterest and the hair salon she frequented. I know who her parents are. I know where she buys her makeup and has sunday brunch. I found her reddit account and a couple of her throwaways. I tracked down an old blog she kept using an internet archive that I paid money to get access to.

The years have gone by, and she has become majorly successful, both in terms of popularity and professionally. I have mostly just floated by. I have kept track of her FB public profile/twitter/instagram this whole time. 

Today at breakfast, while I was looking through her latest tweets, it hit me. I have been obsessing over this person for 5 years.

I know everything about her, and probably wouldn't even recognize me at this point.

I'm not sure why I do this. But I think it's because I saw something in her.....a certain determination. She was determined to go from being a random, slightly overweight nerdy girl to the kind of person who earns six figures - the professional who drives a Bimmer (she actually bought one with her internship money) and has a dating history that sounds like it's straight out of a drama show. And I've never had even 1 boyfriend and have graduated with a completely average GPA and 1 unpaid internship.

I think she gives me hope. One day, all the insight I have gained from her will simply click and I can do something with my life. But until that happens, her FB profile will continue to be on my ""Most Visited"" list on Firefox."

(returning college student),NewThrowAway90000,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/4nc08r/can_depression_be_retriggered_by_returning_to_a/,"This is my first post on this sub in nearly two months, so I'll start off with the good news. Two months ago, I was a friendless, depressed college student at the end of my junior year skipping all my classes and feeling completely lost and hopeless. While things are not perfect, I'm happy to say that I am feeling much better at the moment. I finally opened up about my struggles to my parents, somehow managed to finish my classes with As and Bs despite skipping most classes due to depression, reached out to my doctor and started taking zoloft, found a great therapist, spent a lot of time with old friends who I had previously written off, and even landed an internship related to my major. Honestly, things are going much better right now than I ever would have imagined two months ago, and I'm not even sure if I can say that I feel depressed anymore, at least for now. I need to find a paying job for the summer (my internship is unpaid), but even that is not stressing me out as much as it was a month ago, and I've been surprisingly motivated to fill out applications. All this sounds great, and it mostly feels great too, but I am worried about going back to school in the fall...

This is where the post relates to the title... has anyone here had depression come back because they returned to a place where they were once depressed? In my case, for example, that place would be my college. I realize that just because I've spent the majority of my college years depressed doesn't mean that I need to be depressed during my last year, especially since my life seems to be improving. But I still don't have a single friend at school (I tried very hard to make friends for my first two years, but ultimately failed) and that often causes me to feel very lonely. I also have some doubts about my major and often feel like the only reason I go to college is to satisfy my parents, not because I want to do it myself. These thoughts lead me to feel like everything is pointless, which also caused depression in the past. Luckily, my internship has been going very well so far and that has made me feel a bit more confident about my major, but I still worry about losing motivation and falling back into a hole. I've thought of some ways that I could get through my last year without being depressed, including saving up money for a car so I can visit my other friends and my family more often. But part of me also feels like that would be a way of avoiding my problems, and I really wish that I could have an enjoyable college experiences with memories and new friends (I've known all my current friends since high school and they go to other schools). But at the same time, I already tried joining clubs, going to parties and events, trying to make plans with people at school, and for some reason it never works out for me. So maybe I should just try to make the best of this situation by spending more time with my real friends off-campus...??? In all honesty I would like to transfer to a school that is a better fit for me, but it's too late at this point. Most colleges only accept a certain number of transfer credits, so most of my hard work thus far would go to waste if I did that... Anyway, enough about me and my situation.... I just want to know if anyone here has had depression brought on again by returning to a place where they were once depressed. It doesn't need to be a school or college, that's just my example from my life. Or what are some ways that you have avoided letting depression come back into your life? Thank you very much for reading this, any responses will be greatly appreciated!!"

I had been accepted to Tisch School of the Arts Dramatic Writing Program, the most prestigious undergraduate writing program in the country. I had big dreams, eyes filled with stars, and very small pockets.

I worked double shifts at the local Greek diner back in the suburbs of Chicago to cover what tuition and expenses weren't paid by loans, grants and scholarships. That extra $200 was everything I had in the world; I immediately started waitressing forty hours a week, to supplement my financial aid package and make a life in NYC. I remember taking twenty one credit hours my first semester, and sleeping an average three hours per night.

I was eighteen years old, financially independent, and learning how to write in one of the most expensive cities in the world. 
There were days I paid for my subway fare in pennies. I worked hard, ate light, and made it through three years; I even managed to study abroad in Florence, Italy for a semester, at NYU's La Pietra Program. Upon my return to the great (and increasingly expensive) NYC, I was told by NYU's Financial Aid Office that I owed tuition and fees which my aid package did not cover. I was unable to earn my degree. On my way home from the Financial Aid Office, I joined the work force as a stage hand at a lighting and stage rental facility in Queens. I figured if I couldn't get a degree in my chosen field, I'd slowly learn the ropes from the ground up. I learned a lot - still, I yearned for that degree. I wished to be immersed in the theory of my area of study, and to study alongside like minded students with similar aspirations and various wonderful talents.

Too often, students with similar stories simply do not have parental support or the means to support their dreams and are left behind. People give up and surrender to careers they don't really love; the world is robbed of talent, and filled with angry and bitter people doing things they hate for money. Precious potential with life altering effects is continually lost to a vicious cycle. It took me twenty years to earn my degree. In May of 2015, I finally earned my Bachelor's in Mass Communications, from SUNY Oneonta. I did so with more pride and joy than I can possibly express. I loved and valued every minute I spent in my classrooms and on campus. 

During my years at SUNY Oneonta, I founded and grew my production company, Certain Grants Creative, and spearheaded a thriving internship program.

I was also a very proud recipient of the Jan Ashley award at SUNY, an opportunity offered to non-traditional students in need of support during the staggeringly expensive university years for those of us without expense accounts. 

In my letter thanking Ms. Ashley for her generosity and general awesomeness, I promised that I would work hard to one day pay it forward. My friends at Burnout Italy made it possible for that day to come sooner than later. Together we have created a $500 opportunity for a student to apply toward living or tuition costs. 

While a $500 award is not enormous, it sure would have helped me to buy train fare, groceries, and books back in 1994. My hope is that we inspire others to reach out in their communities and support a student in need. There are plenty that need it. 

If my story speaks to you, consider sponsoring a student. There are a lot of local banks and even businesses in our communities that would match gifts offered to students in need - get involved, start a fund.

As a business owner that often works with non profit organizations, I know of much need in several critical areas; this is a gentle reminder that our future needs for us to be present, needs our support. 


There is a student out there paying for train fare in pennies that could one day solve the world's energy crisis or find a cure for Parkinson's. 

If you can't afford to donate toward a scholarship fund, donate your talents or time to a student that needs it. Check out www.burnoutitaly.com/scholarships for more info about the opportunity, and to get inspired to start your own!"

What we both don't know is our mutual desire for each other. We both take secret peeks at each other in our moments of undress during the morning and night and I could've sworn I saw your reflection in the mirror when I was showering. Finally one night it all comes to a head during a power outage and you need your young strong nephew to build a fire and keep you safe.

You all are about to have the most definitive, comprehensive, best organized O&amp;A clips collection available to you for stream/DL! A huge TL;DR full of back story and info in the comments.",braunheiser,opieandanthony,https://www.reddit.com/r/opieandanthony/comments/4nd1l9/the_rosiebun1_collection_has_finally_arrived_in/,"**EDIT: New updates and stuff at the bottom of the thread, and so far these are mostly complete besides a few files to be added soon -- [Anthony](https://archive.org/details/anthonycumia) // [Staff, Interns, and Friends](https://archive.org/details/oastaffandfriends) // [Jim Norton](https://archive.org/details/jimnorton) // [Opie](https://archive.org/details/oaopie), and instead of ""over the next few weeks"" I am pretty sure they will all be up by the end of the weekend

For almost 1 year now, I have been searching everywhere far and wide, in every single nook and cranny of the O&amp;A internet universe, for a collection of clips that used to get released every single week on BiteMyTorrent, an old-timey private O&amp;A torrenting website.

These packs were created by Rosiebun1. Each week, he would go through each show and chop out anything and everything that was notable, everything from hour+ long stories all the way down to 30 second clips where Opie / Anthony / Jimmy would totally bomb a joke and then they would embrace the bomb in the way that only O&amp;A show could. He even went as far as to clip little soundbytes for ringtones, and if they referenced a clip from the past, he would also go find that clip and include it in the folder (for example -- One time in 2008 Anthony went on a rant about how broadway musicals and plays sucked ass, but Rosiebun1 also included a clip from 2005 where Anthony goes on a rave saying that broadway musicals and plays are great.)

The packs also included the Foundrymusic.com videos from that week, pictures of things that were talked about on the air (for example there's a segment where Anthony talks about purchasing a new gun, included in that folder are the 2 Foundrymusic videos posted that week of him USING the gun at a range, etc. etc)


Unfortunately, BiteMyTorrent has been indefinitely down and none of these files were being seeded by anyone anymore.

The only files that were available were on http://spreadtheonavirus.com -- they included some from 2007 and all from 2008.

The rest of the files were not available anywhere on the internet except for the ones that uploaders had put on YouTube when they came out years ago (you'll see pretty quickly how many O&amp;A YouTubers have literally just copy pasted these edits into movie files and put them on YOuTube!).

So in order to get these things back there was only 1 thing to do, find the man who created them. After doing some Googling, I finally got around to finding an active Twitter account. Messaged him and explained the gist of things, showed him the Archive.org page, and he was totally in. The only problem was that his internet speed was incredibly slow and he wasn't going to be able to get them up himself. So I gave him my address, and after a few months (he works 60 hours a week and probably had other stuff going on) he finally sent them.

6 DVD discs/15 gigabytes in the post and a few days later we are GOOD TO GO!

The only problem is that the packs are unfortunately not organized in their original folders. That means that I don't have the chronological order done for them.


So.... I am still trying to figure out how I am going to release these things, but I am going to start up doing it ASAP! So you'll see some posts going up with the prefix ""Now on Archive:"" ~~during the next few weeks.~~ this weekend

The best idea I have so far is to do a huge tribute to Opie, Anthony, and Jimmy, seeing as how a huge majority of clips are titled in a way that they are the center of attention during them. Then maybe do a mega-pack for the Staff / Interns, a pack for fights, one for Guests, one specifically for the Comics, etc.

Currently I am copying all the files over to my hard drive so in a few hours I am going to come back here and post a huge ass pastebin of every single file that's in here. If you guys have any suggestions on how to go about putting them together I'd love to hear them!

I will be putting them on ARchive.org and I haven't even talked to /u/CCred95 just yet, but I am willing to bet we can come up with a way to really enhance the ""experience"" within his site for this  (Archive is good for quick streaming / downloading, but with CCred's site we could neatly combine the video and audio files or the pictures and audio files or just organize it better in some way) so I am willing to bet we can mostlikely get them up on http://opieandanthonylive.com too!

Paste-bin ~~coming this evening~~ [here](http://pastebin.com/ArPTe83X), uploads start this weekend

**EDIT** 

Full file lists for the categories so far:

* [Anthony](http://pastebin.com/UwLPwSTE)

* [Jimmy](http://pastebin.com/dkwH2VGV)

* [Opie](http://pastebin.com/HVYm3cLu) 

* [Comics](http://pastebin.com/P54c01dU)

* [Staff, Interns, and Friends](http://pastebin.com/ZVCNdRTL)

* [Guests](http://pastebin.com/iZejbje3)

* [Files from 2011 I still have to go through](http://pastebin.com/enUYNJZq)

* Clips, Bits, and Segments: TBA

* [Then there are 600 left](http://pastebin.com/Fs5i91rw) which is kind of overwhelming all in 1 archive, so still trying to figure out some ways to break these down more

Also there will be some repeats like the bombs for each individual person in their archives, but also a separate smaller archive for [Bombs &amp; Flubs](http://pastebin.com/JU3kSPZk) that way we could just press play on Track #1 and have it play through all the bombs back to back. Definitely going to make one specifically for all the videos. and since Antholini saga is so amazingly well documented within this, it probably deserves its own archive dedicated to it too.

~~First one going up now~~ [Anthony Cumia collection](https://archive.org/details/anthonycumia) is good to go minus the Ant clips from the 2011 files or if I find any others I missed

**EDIT2** [Jimmy Norton clips are up!](https://archive.org/details/jimnorton)

P.S. Thanks for leaving all the nice comments I am glad you guys are looking forward to these like I am! Ive been going through them organizing it's amazing how many titles I see that I want to hear right away.  Should be cool to have these back permanently and for easy download if you want to save some data on the phone, or just have them stored away to come back to later.

Last but not least

Apps: 

* [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.internet.archive&amp;hl=en) / [alternative](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.internet.archive&amp;hl=en)

* [Apple](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/internet-archive-companion/id617179709?mt=8)

and they are definitely going to go up on O&amp;A Live, but in the meantime there's some pretty nice apps for streaming from Archive.org on both Google Play store and Apple Store (make a custom playlist, listen in background etc)

4ndc45,0,2016-06-09,In college and moving out: What do I need to know and plan for?,hannahhelp1997,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4ndc45/in_college_and_moving_out_what_do_i_need_to_know/,"I am currently in college in Fort Worth, Texas. I have been living at home for my first year since my family is close; however, they still live about 45 minutes away from the school. With traffic and I-35, it ordinarily takes me upwards of an hour to get to my morning classes. Because of my major and when certain classes are offered, my classes are at scattered times throughout the week, so it is near impossible to arrange a schedule to accommodate commuting. So, I have decided to move into an apartment with one of my friends near campus.

**Things I need to know:**

-If me and my one friend are splitting an apartment, how much apartment can we afford?

-What monthly expenses should I be planning for and roughly how much are they going to be?

-What initial move in costs are there for a typical apartment?


**Picture of my situation:**

Current Amount in Checking/Savings: ~6,000 (Wells Fargo)

Current Amount left in College Savings fund: ~10,000

Current Job (Which I have a contract for throughout this entire school year and summer): $15/hr Software Validation Intern. I work remotely and have VERY flexible hours I set myself that will definitely work around my school schedule. During the summer I can work up to 40 hours a week (since I am living at home right now, I am saving every bit I can), but once the school year starts, my limit is 20 hours a week.

Since I am still in school, my parents are still paying for my car insurance, cell phone, and health insurance.

I own my 2013 Nissan Versa outright, so I do not have any car payment.





My roommate and I have been talking about getting a 1 bedroom instead of a 2 bedroom to save some money (one of us sleeps in the living room and one of us has the bedroom), but we are flexible. I just want to be comfortable and safe.

I have already been collecting furniture and have enough to furnish the entire apartment (thanks to my generous parents who have been kind enough to give me some of their old furniture).


That's everything I can think of. Thanks so much in advance!"
4ndgol,5,2016-06-09,A Few Questions,Ninzex,rit,https://www.reddit.com/r/rit/comments/4ndgol/a_few_questions/,"Hi! I'm going to be a freshman at RIT this fall majoring in Software Engineering and I have a few questions about my major and RIT in general.

1) I read on some thread that I can't find that CS/SE majors have a huge dropout rate (like over half) the first year. How accurate is this? And if it's true, what can I do to better prepare myself in the next 2 months? The only experience I have is a basic coding class, AP CS (both on Java), and an internship in web dev.

2) I took the AP CS exam and I'm confident I'll get a 4 or 5. Should I get credit and skip the first CS class? I'm not sure if I'll be learning the same things I did in AP CS or if it's a different class altogether.

3) Are freshman allowed cars on campus?

4) I'm considering choosing a room in Fisher dorms since there's a lot of available rooms. How's the situation there (proximity, laundry, bathrooms, etc)?

5) Any other advice you'd like to offer?

Thanks guys! I really appreciate it."
4ndhck,96,2016-06-09,Out of Ammo - Feedback on Pricing towards 1.0,rocketwerkz,Vive,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vive/comments/4ndhck/out_of_ammo_feedback_on_pricing_towards_10/,"**Background**

Internally in the studio we have had a huge amount of fun making [Out of Ammo](http://store.steampowered.com/app/451840/), although it has been a challenging experience that we've learnt a huge amount from. We're a new studio and the core team (Jayde and Francis) both started with us as interns. Excluding myself; this was the first shipped title for everyone on the team! It was also the first title of the studio but only a small part of the development as we hadn't made a major commitment at the studio due to the uncertain market of VR for the next few years.

A quick overview and shout-out to the Out of Ammo team (in order of appearance):

* Stephanie (Producer)
* Jayde (Programmer)
* Francis (Programmer)
* Virgil (Designer)
* Connor (Artist)
* Aaron (Additional Design)

**VR Skeptic**

I'd consider myself a bit of a ""VR skeptic"", at least from a developers economic perspective. I decided that we should really test some of my assumptions so the studio committed to small scale VR development and Out of Ammo was the result. Largely the experiment has confirmed my suspicions; the market is small and studios &gt;10 people need to assume they are not going to make money in the ~~long~~**short** term. We went into the release expecting that the product would not make money but to play the ""long game"" and gain some experience in developing VR games. The potential of making VR games is certainly there and it's an exciting emerging market - but that is going to take time and studios need to make sure they have the ""runway"" to survive.

**Progress**

As we progress through our period of Early Access we would like some feedback on our approach to pricing. We're at the price we released at (USD 14.99) which we felt was a good compromise between lack of content and polish, and a small market size. 

Some new developments coming:

* Our progress towards Coop Multiplayer has progressed very well (development version currently allows a non-controlling player to view another player play the game) to the point we expect a version of this as early as next week. 

* A new mission mode complete (but not released - maybe today) that has you in first person as a sniper, providing overwatch for a downed helicopter rescue.

* More attachments for our attachment system; such as scopes, bayonets, M203.

**Pricing**

There is consensus among the team here that we are light on price. We actively wanted to run the project at a loss initially because we weren't sure how much resource to commit to the game, size of the market, and what the reception would be. However long term we can't keep running the project at a loss.

We've been throwing the idea around that we would raise the price of the game from **USD 14.99** to **USD 19.99** upon release of the Coop MP, and then again to at least ~~USD 25.99~~**USD 24.99** upon ""final"" release of the game (dependent on other content included, maybe more MP modes). Thoughts on this?

**Additional Content**

Beyond 1.0 we expect to continue to release some new maps occasionally for free, but also want to think about how we can extend the game. We have an idea for an expansion of the game that would involve a new scenario/environment. Appreciate thoughts from the community on what approach we should take with this.

**tl;dr**

Would love your thoughts on:

* Pricing for Out of Ammo

* Approaches to expansions of the game (paid? how much?)

EDIT: fixed longterm &gt; shortterm and USD 25.99 to USD24.99"

You're telling me some intern or staffer managed to read the G-E's initial tweet, come up with that reply on their own, get it approved by their superior and then tweet it... all in 5 minutes? Please.  

It stands to reason a response issued so quickly was premeditated. This was the byproduct of the collective brainpower of all 832 $hills on her staff - and it flopped imediately upon his retort. Like a dying fish, desperately flopping around for oxygen and relevance.  

This was, quite possibly, the best social media moment that campaign will have until November 8, 2016 when she tweets: **""Congratulations on your victory, G-E Trump. I disavow myself. Please, please, please pardon me.** "
4ne5gz,8,2016-06-09,"6 weeks in, need some support",HazedAndEschewed,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/4ne5gz/6_weeks_in_need_some_support/,"I made the decision to quit because while I loved the feeling being high brought I knew it was no longer worth the detriment to my university career.  In the throes of my addiction I couldn't see that I was also suffering from severe mood swings and generally being upset when I shouldn't have been.  I decided to quit at the end of the semester, after all my smoking friends went home.  The day after I smoked my last bowl my girlfriend of 15 months and my primary support system dumped me unexpectedly.  

I've never faced anything worse than that first week.  I had been smoking a gram or two a day, and I couldn't sleep and I sweated through tee shirt after tee shirt.  Couple that with my first relationship ending so abruptly and I was a mess, once even crying during my research internship and having to leave.

Right now I am in a very good place.  I have read more books in these last 6ish weeks than in my entire year and a half of smoking.  I have seen huge changes in my ability to speak properly and in my short term memory.  

My main issue is all the regret I feel about how far I let myself slip.  My grades got so bad that I lost my scholarships.  I  truly felt as though my ex was the love of my life, and I couldn't see how she just dumped me so cruelly.  I see now why she did.  I wan't the girl she fell in love with.  I had become selfish and irrational.  I would pick fights and 10 minutes later have no idea why it had even started.  I wasn't smart and compelling anymore, I was emotionally weak and I had let my depression make me a shell of a person.  I think that if I had caught this sooner I would still have her.  I feel over her, but I'm not over being in love and having a companion, and I feel guilty for treating her the way I did for both of our sakes.

I don't know how to forgive myself."
4ne68y,1,2016-06-09,"college student, needs car, but can't buy with cash and has no credit...advice needed please",cookie9147,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4ne68y/college_student_needs_car_but_cant_buy_with_cash/,"So I'll be going into my senior year of college this fall and I desperately need a car. So far I have absolutely no debt and since I wanted to keep it that way I began searching for a car that was relatively cheap, but reliable. I originally wanted to pay cash for the car so I shopped around and I decided that I would like to get a 2009 Toyota Corolla since they range from about 6-8 thousand on Craigslist. Here's my dilemma however. I have about $1800 saved up and I'm currently working as an intern making $520 a week for 12 weeks. At the end of my internship I would be able to pay cash for the car, however I'm hesitant because I would practically have no money left over, and I have other expenses that need to be paid for such as phone bill, insurance, gas and just general expenses. Another issue is that I need the car about a month before my internship ends so that cuts out about $2000 from my budget. So because of these two issues I thought that it would be smarter to get a small loan from a credit union. I was thinking that I could take out an $8000 loan or smaller (depending on the deal I find) and then for my first payment, pay a large chunk like $3000/4000 so that technically for the next year or more (depending on the length of the loan) I wouldn't have a car payment. This way I could keep the remaining money from my internship for myself for extra cash and by the time my next car payment is due I would more than likely have a full time job or the money to just completely pay off the rest. I also thought that this may be a good way to build my credit since it's non-existent right now. So my question is if this would be a smart move. I'm 20 years old and I really would like to be financially responsible however buying a car with cash right now isn't realistic since I won't have steady income coming in after my internship, unless I get a part time job which I can't guarantee with school right now. Any help/advice is greatly appreciated!
Other helpful info:
1. my mom could possibly cosign
2. I'm a 20 year old female, new driver, first car so I'm guessing insurance will be expensive.

TLDR: want a 6-8k car but can't buy in cash, so is it smart a take out a small loan, and pay big payments in order to build credit and pay off loan quickly."

4nf7ev,47,2016-06-10,"Didn't mean to write this much, but I guess I needed to...quite long, sorry",Nyctophileo,exchristian,https://www.reddit.com/r/exchristian/comments/4nf7ev/didnt_mean_to_write_this_much_but_i_guess_i/,"Long story very, very condensed and still very long,

I was raised in a fundamental Christian household, forced to say the Sinner's Prayer when I was 2 or 3. I was too young to understand and I very distinctly remember feeling overwhelming fear when my mother sat me down on a dining room chair and explained what Hell was and how Jesus would save me from it. 

A few years later, when I was about 5 years old, I was told it was time for me to speak in tongues, and coached on how to become fluent in ""my prayer language"". This was also a terrifying experience, because if I wasn't able to speak in tongues, I wasn't a real Christian, and if I wasn't a real Christian, Jesus wouldn't love me, and Jesus would send me to Hell. At least, that's what my mother planted in my young, impressionable mind.

After my parents split up when I was 8, my mother became abusive and my father turned to alcoholism. She still denies that any abuse took place, although family, friends, and my own memory say otherwise. My school investigated a time or two, but in a hands-off, rural town, when dealing with a child who has no mental framework for communicating what verbal, mental, or psychological abuse is, nothing was done. If anything, they made it worse, because they told my mother that I was upset and she only escalated further.
 
At 15, I was dabbling in Wicca and curious about Paganism, partly out of teenage rebellion, partly because I felt that it was purer and felt more right than the idea of a vengeful God that needed constant affirmation and repentance for normal human behavior, My mother found out and hurt me severely for it, so out of necessity and also because I felt great guilt over having turned away from my faith, I rededicated myself to Christianity.

When I was 16, almost 17, I formed an online relationship with a 21-year-old who wanted a BDSM relationship. Obviously, I see the error of that now, but at the time, I was looking for someone to just care about me enough to protect me and he promised to be that person. I ran away to be with him, but didn't get far and was picked up by police, who questioned me about things going on at home. I felt I couldn't safely  talk about the abuse, and still had no words for it. I was never introduced to the idea that verbal, mental, or psychological abuse was even a thing. As far as the physical abuse, I thought it was normal, or at least, well-deserved, since I was always being told how bad a person I was. And even if it wasn't, who was going to help me? I was a nobody. No one cared. No one was going to save me.

 My family was rightfully concerned for me after discovering explicit messages between me and the 21-year-old I previously mentioned, so, after much discussion, I was given an ultimatum. I could go to rehab, or go back to my mother's house. I was struggling with severe depression, self-harm, and suicidal thoughts, and I knew that moving back to that house would be a death sentence, either by her hand or my own.

I was sent to a Christian rehab center that was part of Teen Challenge for about a year after its founding. After that year, it broke off from Teen Challenge but was still attached to the founding church that my family (mom's sister and brother in law)  owned and operated, They appointed another woman in charge of day to day operation of the center, which housed somewhere between 8 - 15 or up to 20 women at the time.

I have so many stories from that center, I still have nightmares  as recently as a couple of weeks ago about being forcibly taken back there. Every time, I wake up shaking, sweating, sometimes crying or even screaming.

There was a dog at the center, Judah. He was a beautiful Doberman Pinscher that had suffered a head injury as a puppy that gave him seizures. (He tried to jump from a vehicle, from what I was told, but I wasn't there, so I don't know for certain.)  He was kept inside during the summer months and chained up on a too-short lead in the main room. No one was allowed to unchain him, or I would have done it so many times. 

The woman in charge would get annoyed at Judah him for whining and barking, distracting from the classwork we were meant to be doing, and she would come yelling out of her office with a riding crop to hit Judah until he yelped and turned on his back in submission. About a week ago, I swear I could hear her clear as day, and the riding crop making contact with that poor dog is a sickening sound I will never forget.

Later, I joined the International House of Prayer as an intern, hoping to leave the abuse and violence of my home life and the church behind. I encountered a more subtle version of the same thing. I paid over $1000 for 12 weeks of living in their culture. 6 hours a day after breakfast were spent in their 24-hour prayer room, then lunch, then classes, then a bit of free time, then dinner, then bed, I was part of what is known as the Nightwatch, populating the prayer room between midnight and 6am. During this time, we were loosely supervised by core leaders, who were responsible for making sure we didn't burn the place down.

During this time, my father died. I left for 5 days to attend his funeral and make arrangements for him, and when I came back, it was time to start fundraising for the second half of the internship, Track 2, which would be another $2,000. The church owned by my family had promised me help, which they did not follow through on. I was denied a scholarship for the second half, which was given to a girl I roomed with, who was a little less broken and a little more useful to the IHOP-KC community. So I had to find a place to live there and continued going to the prayer room for 6 hours a day, keeping the Nightwatch hours, volunteering at a local homeschool co-op with my landlady, who let me stay in her furnished basement with my cat in exchange.

I was stuck in Kansas City, torn between what I believed God wanted me to do and an inability to provide even food for myself. I lived on Panera Bread donations that were made every 3 days at the complex. I would take home a couple of baguettes and ration them out to last me until the next ones. I stayed for a total of 8 months, including my internship, and finally left because I was starving and I realized that nobody cared.

After I left, I abandoned Christianity again. I tried to live the life, walking the walk, so to speak, and it just didn't work. My problems with the doctrine aside, the emotional and mental toll all of it took on me after 20 years of abuse and damage was enough to finally show me that I had to walk away for my own sanity.

Because of my mother, and the rehab center, I can't have anyone standing behind me, ever, without trying to re-position myself to guard against a sudden attack. Loud sounds produce an almost panic attack inducing startle response. The sound of my own full name gives me anxiety. I go by a shortened version. I have nightmares and flashbacks with no clear trigger. My boyfriend told me earlier that he doesn't like leaving me alone these days because the flashbacks are coming more frequently lately and are totally debilitating when they do. Today one happened while I was playing Minecraft and listening to Lana Del Rey (don't judge me, you have your guilty pleasures, too). 

 I was prompted to write this out of desperation for someone, anyone, to listen and understand and to tell me that I'm not crazy or destined for damnation for feeling the way I do.

I have overwhelming guilt and I am afraid to die for fear that all those people were right and Jesus is still going to throw me into Hell. I can't be a Christian for my own sanity, but I feel like I am going insane anyway. "

Happy Friday folks! I hope this week has been going well for all of you, and that perhaps there has been some leisure (or otherwise) reading in your life.

I've not been the most active reader this week, as we started training interns this week and switched to unofficial 'summer hours' at work, which take up an inordinate amount of time and leaves very little for me to indulge in reading. However, I did manage to find some time to finish up *Old Man's War.* I really enjoyed the crap out of this book. I know I was pretty bummed out by it in last week's thread, but it really picked up and I was in a much less sad state of mind this week, so it was much more of an enjoyable ride. I am excited to continue reading through Perry's story and have books two and three lined up. 

However, I actually am reading *The Handmaiden's Tale* right now. I'm pretty early on in the book, so I don't really have many thoughts on it. I figured I'd switch gears over to this since I want to get through some of the books that have been on my 'to read' list for quite some time, before I go back and finish out some series. Plus, I have this thing where I don't get maximum enjoyment out of a series if I read them all back to back. I find that I get burnt out pretty easily.

What are you guys reading?"

I was tired of being a fucking twig and I knew I was the only one to blame. My dad was pushing a job at a medical pr research firm. My father has been super controlling my entire life and lost it on the daily, saying I was throwing my life away if I didn't take the job. My whole family on his side said I would kill myself from disappointment of not getting a job. 

I wanted out. 

I fled to live with my grandmother down south and focused on getting into the gym mentality. I always got scared of going to the gym and I needed to fucking get over it. I was scared of being the skinny little bitch in the gym and it only perpetuated my attitude. 

But I did it. Left home, went down south to enjoy my 6 day a week gym cycle, and eat as much home cooked food as possible. My grandfather had just passed away, so my two months down south was extremely beneficial for both of us. I put on 8lbs in 2 1/2 months and was happy to finally have the excitement to go to the gym. It worked.

I got back, found an internship, and continued my gym routine with my best friend into the fall. 2 shakes a day, eating as much as possible, just going for it. I kept gaining and felt happier. 

Until i screwed up on a level I've never experienced before in a professional setting. My stress picked up, my gains went down, my gym time dwindled. I was so worried that I would not get the full-time position that it consumed everything else in my life. 

Come december, I lost the internship and took time away from everything. I hadn't been to the gym in a few weeks and got scared at how quickly my body let go of the progress I had made. 

In January, I went snowboarding and fractured my scaphoid bone in my wrist. I was devastated. The gym was completely out of the picture. Most depressed I've ever been in my life. I dropped back down to nearly my starting weight over the next two months. 

This time in bed allowed me to ready myself for job applications and interviews. I landed the entry level job of my dreams at a super cool young tech company and rested my wrist through the end of March. 

March 28th, I was ready to get back at it. Gym 4-5 times a week + free breakfast and lunch at work + good home cooking = great success. My roommate and I got back into the flow and haven't looked back. 

TL:DR -&gt; Went to live with G'ma to eat a lot of food and get into the right mindset. Became depressed after a failed internship and fractured wrist. Put the weight back on and going beyond. 
_________________

No tips and tricks to what I'm doing. Back bi, chest tri, shoulders, legs. Super regular muscle focus workouts. Bench, curls, machines, super normal. But the key word is consistency. Not calorie counting because I have such a hard time getting food down. It's just me eating as much as I can throughout the day. Working out is easier than eating food for me. Still a big hurtle to get over.

Goals moving forward:
1) Legs - I have the skinniest legs imaginable and its absolutely dreadful for me. Just recently got into deadlifting and squatting. I wanted some size on the upper body first just so I could live with myself and my body. Now I neeeeeed to fucking make gains on my legs. I'm not a man until I do so. 

2) My neck is so skinny, making my whole head and body look disproportionate. My pictures will show good progress on my upper back. But my lower neck is so hard to hit. I'm like a giraffe. Any tips on hitting back neck?

3) My right arm and shoulder have always been bigger and progressed faster than my left side. It's been very hard to push the left arm harder to bring it up to pace with the right but I really need to equal the sides out. 

4) Confidence has to match my gains. I still don't like where I am and don't give myself enough credit for the work I've put in. My confidence is still very low on a social level and I need to work towards bettering my outlook. It's because I know I can go so much harder and I have so much more to accomplish. This is the deep underlying factor. Despite my efforts, I'm still not happy with my body. Totally not the right mindset, but I'm still able to appreciate what I've done.

This post was just a shitshow of my brain getting everything out there. Not editing anything; just sending it out. Coming back from a night drinking. 

I'll be happy to further expand on my 1 year journey and where I plan on going from here. Absolutely looking for new routines to switch it up for my muscles. Any recommendations welcome. "

I come from a really poor family (my parents have been basically destitute and in massive debt my whole life) and have worked hard to get where I am education and skills-wise, but I am still learning how to manage my finances like a successful adult should. It is not easy. My parents are horrible with money and have taught my siblings and me no financial competency (on the contrary given us a lot of anxiety about it), though in the periods when I was working full-time I always managed my finances very well and was quite stable and happy. I have even successfully served as Treasurer of several school-related organizations to develop accounting skills. But I have weird anxieties I have when dealing with my own debts.

I am trying to get my student debt under control but I'm not making enough money to make payments right now and my forbearance period will run out soon. I have so much anxiety about the situation that I haven't sent in all the right paperwork yet and the account is past due. I tried to, and spent hours trying to correct the situation not once but twice, but in the end somehow failed to finish the final step of sending in some particular documents. It's really stupid, I know. I think people that know me would be really surprised to hear about it because I'm otherwise so responsible. By far the most responsible in my family. 

I have always filed timely tax returns but this year I'm unable to make the (unexpectedly high) payment, so I have to pay in installments.

Is my financial situation going to prevent me from getting a security clearance? I truly am working on getting better at all this -- it's just very difficult because I'm having trouble finding enough work right now and I don't have anyone to fall back on financially or even talk to for advice or encouragement. 

I am pretty confident all my ref's will say that I'm an extremely ethical and dependable person, to the point where it has caused friction dealing with an employer who wanted to play fast and loose with reporting obligations and another who was hitting on young female interns. The money is really the only thing causing me to worry. I'm confident that I'll get a hold on it quickly once I have the money to do so again.

What do you think? What can I do to increase my chances of passing? "

4nidjn,1,2016-06-10,I [24F] am the awkward coworker,cantpeoplewell,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4nidjn/i_24f_am_the_awkward_coworker/,"Hi /r/relationships,

**tl;dr** I am the awkward person at work, or maybe paranoid. Either way, I feel like my coworkers don't like interacting with me and it's making me sad. What do I do?

For background: after graduation, I moved to a new city where I didn't really know anyone for a job. For the kind of job it is, it has a pretty good office culture - I think people are pretty nice, generally cooperative and helpful and friendly and so on. I have always been kind of awkward and introverted, and have been making an effort (maybe not enough?) to interact with people in generally a positive way. I think sometimes I tend to put my foot in my mouth in the process - trying to get involved in conversations where I'm not additive, telling stories that are really boring, saying things that are unintentionally kind of annoying (i.e. ""Hand it to me"", when a coworker is trying to get something to show up on the screen and tbh probably had it under control). My approach to this has generally been to try and mean as well as I can, and hope that people take it the same way. Sometimes they'll ignore me if they don't feel like engaging, which is perfectly fine with me, but generally they've been pretty friendly.

Recently, though, I've started worrying more about whether my coworkers... don't like me? Disdain me a bit? Which I guess isn't really a problem in the long run - my friendships and relationship don't really overlap with work - but it can be an immediate mood deflator, keeps me up at night worrying about why I can't interact with people, and so on. None of it's, like, I-caught-my-coworkers-badmouthing-me stuff - just little things. 

Like, a group of us will go get ice cream and a girl will ask me what flavor I got, and when I tell her (it's the weirdest flavor on the menu) her response is just the most condescending *Oh* that I've ever heard (or maybe that's just the way she talks? I mean, it is the way she talks, but is it *only* the way she talks?). 

Or these two snippets within conversations about intern hiring:

1 -
Me: I mean, I tried to make him comfortable and see if he came up with anything better, but he just wasn't good. Although it could be that I'm just not any good at that, haha. (which, okay, implicitly referencing my own dislike of doing things like talking to people, probably not setting myself up well here)

Coworkers: (Very quickly, skeptical face) Yeah, that's probably it haha.

2 -
Coworker: ""Are you going to take [new intern] around the office and introduce him to everyone?""

Me: ""Yeah..."" 

Coworker: Haha, that'll be funny. 

(What does that mean? Is it because me introducing people is funny? Is it going to be funny because new intern is kind of an awkward dude? Is it going to be funny because I'm an awkward person? Maybe it's something else entirely? *Why is it funny?*)

It's really only a few of my coworkers that are dropping things that actually hurt my feelings, and I'm pretty certain that no one probably spends very much thinking about how annoying or pathetic I am, but the result of all these little interactions is that *I* end up thinking about it a lot, which is just not a pleasant way to spend my time. Reddit, what would you say is the best way to not end up doing that? Stop being oversensitive? Pay more attention to what I'm doing socially? Leave the office holiday party early, so that I don't end up standing around feeling so awkward that people give me pitying faces and tell me it's fine to leave early if I'm not feeling well? (Which - I wasn't feeling well, but I  was trying to have fun/socialize and the net effect was that I ended up walking around a strange city at night crying because I couldn't even do that right.) Or something else entirely? Curious to hear what you have to say."
4nieqr,1,2016-06-10,Me [32 F] was dumped and ghosted by my boyfriend [32 M] and now he's engaged to someone else after saying he wasn't built for commitment!,wingeyes,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4nieqr/me_32_f_was_dumped_and_ghosted_by_my_boyfriend_32/,"
Now, let me preface this by saying that my x is a narcissist and prob a psychopath... However maybe u guys can give me some perspective on this.


A year ago my boyfriend broke up with me in the most cowardly and heinous way with no real warning . The day before he did this we were at his friend's house at a superbowl party, the day before that we were blissfully baking cookies. A week before I had gone to the hospital and he had taken care of me. He had invited me over to his place for three days during a snowstorm after that... while he wasn't very affectionate this was a pattern he had... incredibly affectionate and then he would "" withold "" affection and be standoffish. He would constantly talk about his exes, even right after we were intimate, at one point he would be buck naked right after and he would immediately go to his computer to write to his ex on fb over an internship with one of his students. since I am not jealous at all, I wasn't phased by this. I should have... but figured if he was going to cheat he would and nothing was going to stop him. He would enver take down his profile on dating sites even though I told him that I didn't understand why he kept talking to those girls even if it's only because he was "" bored"". He would constantly tell me how popular he was on those sites.
He lied about his past, said he was homeless as a kid to garner sympathy yet his brother said it wasn't true. He would say he was broken hearted over some girl he had dated right before me for a year yet I found out it was a month.


When we first me he was so into me, thought I was amazing and beautiful and couldn't keep his hands off me. He was talking about how he could see YEARS in the future with me after just one date. Now, that freaked me out , I am not one to believe anything anyone says. As far as him calling me beautiful... it's not the first or last time someone said it and again I am pretty cynical.
So it took him awhile to garner trust, but when he was so sweet andkind to me, and clearly seemed into me i finally gave in more. I did things I never did with him sexually because he wanted it and he appeared so sad... stupid i know.


I believe now his constant mood upswings are what made me on edge, as I never knew when he was going to be sweet or when he was going to be withdrawn or passive aggressive.
Long story short, this brings us back to him breaking up with me ( after 40 min in the bathroom) walking out and telling me that we were nothing special. I told him no one could make him happy but himself. He told me that he wasn't meant for more than short term relationships , and it wasn't his ""nature"" I tried to talk to him, literally the last thing he said to me was "" Make suer I don't drive on your foot"".


Ten minutes later he had blocked me from FB, and his phone. A week later, i find that he is with another girl and a month later he is with his current fiancee. Within a week of them dating he had up a pic of them together blissfully happy. She was nothing like me, physically or otherwise. She was not conventionally attractive ( which was a BIG part of why he appeared to be with me) and now after a couple of months of no contact with him, I find that he is engaged to her. his actions still stung , and despite me giving everything to him ( including my virginity) he did not treat me with empathy or respect .


logically i am thinking this is just him, he was like that before me, he's like that now. He hasn't changed even if he is engaged. It's still a show. But a small part wonders if it was just tht I wasn't good enough. But it's hard not to feel like somehow it was on me. I have so many guys blowing up my phone... but I just am afraid to be hurt.

   
**tl;dr**: My x is engaged how can I just move on and trust again?"

4nj293,4,2016-06-10,Should I[21F] try to be friends with my ex[21M]?,mstrashpie,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/4nj293/should_i21f_try_to_be_friends_with_my_ex21m/,"Okay, so this person is not technically my ex. 
He was a friend from school that I met last year. We just talked in class. 
I slowly started developing a little crush on him, which blew out of proportion after the first time we hung out alone. Nothing physical happened the first time we hung out, not until later. The lines in our friendship blurred. This situation isn't special or unique, no big deal.

Soo it went like this:

- we kiss
- we kissed again
- I ask him what he thinks of us kissing, he says ""he can't have a relationship right now, YOU'RE GREAT AND CUTE THOUGH""
- we stay friends til the end of last year
- I leave on an internship at beginning of this year
- Internship happens, and I don't hear from him, despite all of the stupid charades from above
- I return from internship.  

(NOW WHAT. CONFUSED. DO I ACT LIKE I WANT TO HANG OUT AGAIN? DO I IGNORE HIM IF I SEE HIM? WAT DO)

We had different priorities. I wanted to spend more time with him, he didn't.

He never initiated seeing me on his own accord but if he ran into me in class he would unload his problems or thoughts, which is what a friend would do, but I think I really put too much stock into our interactions after he turned me down. (I can't decide if he really turned me down though.. Let's see, I wanted to develop a closer relationship, not necessarily have labels, but date, and he didn't. He was still respectful and honest. Did he turn me down? Yeah.)

Anyway....... I leave for an internship out of town. No contact. I guess he HAD NO REASON to talk to me. I think I said things like ""I'll text you if I'm in town"" but I never did. I was tired of trying to be friends with someone who had pretense and hesitation within our friendship because I used to want to date.  

It is now summer. Sometimes I think of trying to reach out. 

I mean, there was a connection. I enjoyed his friendship. I also don't have many friends. I don't even know if it's the right thing to do. I don't think I'd be disappointed if things didn't change, meaning ""I only ask him to hang out, not the other way around, then I won't see you for another month"". 

Do I really want a friend who only wants to see me every X amount of months, though? Is a good connection useless if the desire to maintain that good connection isn't mutual, or maybe that ""mutualness"" isn't important?

 ***Key thing to remember is that I was emotionally interested/invested before anything ever ""happened"" between us. Before we were really friends or got to know each other. So like, was our friendship doomed? It was probably doomed.
It was one of those, ""Wow, this person is great, did we really just stay up talking for 6 hours?"" type of connections. My crush wasn't totally off base. I wasn't bored. I was excited. That connection was there. Also, this is all now probably irrelevant. 

ALSO, is it possible that maybe HE thinks that I wanted to stop being friends with him? Which is why I don't hear from him? 

If you have at all identified some key elements in this post that sound like I would get hurt if I tried, please let me know. I know things wouldn't be the same, but I'M LONELY AND I MISS MY FRIEND ACK."
4nj84o,2,2016-06-10,anxiety is ruining my life,rodentface,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/4nj84o/anxiety_is_ruining_my_life/,"I've had anxiety ever since I was really young, had my first panic attack in first grade. I'm twenty now. I've been to a lot of therapists and psychologists and haven't liked any--I tend to get uncharacteristically angry and argumentative and I'm not sure why. I have a psychiatrist and am currently prescribed lamictal for bipolar disorder, hydroxyzinepam and propronalol for anxiety, and adderall XR for ADHD. The XR has been the best at fending off the anxiety but someone stole my script during finals the day after it got filled so I've been without it for a month (finally get it refilled again on Monday). I'm hoping that'll take some of the anxiety away. I was sexually assaulted a few months ago so that's probably the cause of some of it, but most of this has been here for my whole life so it's not like it caused anxiety, just exacerbated what was already there. 

But it's so bad, so bad I can barely write or read. To give a few examples:

* Sometimes when people talk to me it sounds like they're speaking in tongues because I'm panicking too much to process it. 

* I can't open my email because I'm afraid someone will be angry at me for not answering their emails (and they probably are but it's been a week since I checked), and I can't check the syllabus for my internship coursework because I haven't done it and it makes me nervous.


* I no longer have the physical ability to yawn because I'm too anxious to take such a deep breath. You know the feeling of air circulating when you breathe deep? Mine doesn't do that, it just comes in and out. 


* I've never gotten a grade below an -A on a paper I've turned in on time, but I've barely passed multiple classes because I've been too anxious to turn papers in, even papers where there was only a page left to do. I'm at risk of being kicked out of school because of this and because sometimes I'm so nervous in class that I have to throw up or faint.


* When I try and do something I'm afraid of like check my email, I get the sensation of utter fear, like I'm drowning in boiling water, but instead of passing it just stays there. This happened during the last email I wrote and to make it go away I had to close out of the program again.


* I regularly have panic attacks in my sleep, and wake up still having them. Needless to say I also have them during the day. They last for hours or days. I've been prescribed doxepin for this, but sometimes a small dose will knock me out and a big one won't do anything at all, it's inconsistent.


* Sometimes the feeling is so much that I have to find somewhere remote and scream for 20+ to make it go away temporarily.


* I cry constantly, both about real possibilities and about ridiculous scenarios that could never happen (like, ""what if someday I get married and my spouse gets a job in another country and then dies in a tsunami and I see them dead on TV before anyone can tell me?"" when I don't even have an SO). 


* I have to write 20+ pages by Monday to not flunk out of school and I'm sitting here on reddit doing none of it because when I open the word processor I don't understand the words I've already written, they're just squiggles, just like the words I've already written here, the only thing I understand is what I'm writing right now. 


* I frequently dissociate, sometimes staring at my own face in the mirror for literal hours not recognizing myself.


* I'm so tense that my muscles are incredibly tight and I've tried to get massages only to be told I need physical therapy.


* At night I grind my teeth so hard that I wake up with a sore jaw in the morning.


* I exhaust myself and sleep 12-14 hours a day after a very bad panic day. The anxiety is always there, it just ranges from bad to very bad.


I don't know what to do. Like I said I've tried multiple kinds of therapy, I have a job which requires physical labor and I jog so I'm getting my exercise in, I try to eat relatively well, I take all my meds on time, I have a lot of friends who live in my building and when I'm with them the anxiety cloud tends to (but doesn't always) lessen slightly, when I'm alone it's all-consuming, this feeling of being so terrified of dying that I almost want to die, but don't. I'm almost not posting this here thinking that people will be glad they're not me, and that's not wrong to do, but I don't understand why I'm hung up on it. I guess what I'm asking is what do I do? Did anyone else have these problems? I took klonopin for a while but I stopped because it made me feel sleepy and stupid. 


I just want someone to help me. It feels like I'm being eaten alive and I don't know what to do anymore."

However, the way the apartment was advertised and what we found when we arrived was very different. When we found the site for the apartment it was advertised essentially as a tech co-op for extremely affordable pricing. The website looked quite legitimate and under the specific apartment it even listed the names and pictures of the tenants residing there, which made us think it would be safe to reside there. The pictures of the rooms looked acceptable, if tiny, so we signed individual leases for 3 months.

Upon moving in I discovered many things about the room were not as the landlord had described to me through email. Furniture did not match up to what I had been promised, my room number was different from what I'd been initially told, and my window would not lock. The bed frame also broke immediately upon moving in. Despite being advertised as a tech co-op the house had no common spaces at all. The place also definitely houses people that were not listed on the website and their behavior thus far makes both my co-intern and I feel unsafe to the point that we've essentially locked ourselves in our rooms (I believe we are also the only two girls in the building). The building is also just very run down and dirty- the stairs are poorly maintained and there is even a garbage can in the middle of the hallway teeming with fruit flies. I feel like I was extremely misled and would not have signed a lease with the landlord if I had known about any of these issues prior. Do I have any legal grounds to leverage? How can I go about minimizing my monetary losses and terminating this lease? "
4nk89w,18,2016-06-11,[Request] [Steam] Someone nice enough to spare a copy of Stardew Valley for a stranger?,Portaladdict1,GiftofGames,https://www.reddit.com/r/GiftofGames/comments/4nk89w/request_steam_someone_nice_enough_to_spare_a_copy/,"Hey everyone! 
Thanks for checking in! Let me tell you a little bit about why I'd like Stardew Valley:

My first gaming console my dad ever bought me was an Atari. I am not that old, so the console was pretty outdated, but my dad explained that this console was how he got sucked into gaming. I started playing it, and I loved it(naturally)! I loved it so much I slowly started getting bored with the simplicity of it, enough to the point where I begged my dad to get me a updated system within the week. Luckily, he saw how much I loved it, and it was still within the window to return it for a full refund, and so that's what he did! Then, he did research and decided the next logical option was a PS2. At the time, I was maybe 10 or so and, it was pretty current. The very first game that was bought with the system was Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life. And, I was instantly hooked with how complex but relaxing this game was! I played it and played it and was able to beat it multiple times, playing different ways, befriending different people, or relying heavily on certain crops or animals. It was exactly what I felt video games should be, something you are able to learn quickly, but take immense amount of time to master. That game sparked my interest in modern gaming, and set the bar high enough that I havent found a game that can be on the level it was, physically and emotionally. Now, onto why I want Stardew Valley. 

As of recently, I was going through my old stuff to sell at a garage sale, and I found the old pamphlet for the game, and was caught up in the moment of being stressed with finals, as I am an incoming Senior in High School, but was a Junior at the time, and almost broke into tears thinking about the simplicity of life, and how this game was about as big apart of my life as a video game could be at the time. It represents a time when the most I had to worry about was if I was going to be able to make it out to the swings before my friends did, or if my sister was going to be watching TV, or if not, and I would be able to play this game. Now, I have to worry about Finals and if I am going to graduate on time, and where I'm headed after that. 

Now, onto the game:
Based off of what I have watched and read, it is as closest to Harvest Moon as it can be, without it actually being the game. There are the same, plant, harvest, sell sort of mentality Harvest Moon had, as well as the deep character interactions, and being able to develop romantic relationships with some of them. The style isn't quite the same, but I hope it doesn't stray too far from this sort of simple, focused more on game play than graphics sort of genre of games. You are left with the deeds to a house that you move to after being unable to handle all the stresses of working and doing the same, mundane routine everyday, without breaks. 

For a little more info on myself:
I am going to be a senior in High School, but, at the moment, I am enjoying the quite-ness of summer. I am really into Photography (my instagram is zombipwnr365, come say hi!) and music! I love gaming, and experiences things with the people around me, as well as capturing it with my camera. Unfortunately, I am only an intern in this field, and I don't get paid enough to buy many games, only enough to buy Taco Bell once in a great while after school... I would be forever grateful for the person that would be able to make this ""want"" a reality. Bringing back those, sit and enjoy a game for a while, and reflect on the past, and what games like these represent for me. My friend was actually nice enough to get me both Modern Warfare 2 and Rocket League for me as a late birthday present, after I paid for some gas, as he is one of my only friend that drives, so you'll see that on my profile.
Anyways, thanks for taking the time to read! I appreciate it. 

TL;DR: I'd like Stardew Valley to bring back the memories of my childhood, and what games like this and Harvest Moon represent in my life. 

Thanks guys. Here are the links:

I'm currently just under halfway finished with a month-long span on the road. There's another intern[21,F] who happens to be one of four people on our crew that are traveling for that full month.  She's a little preppier than I usually like, but something about it with her causes me not to care. She's very pretty, athletic, somewhat wealthy, and definitely not what I would call ""in my league"". So if course, I was instantly attracted to her at the start of the internship, two weeks before we left. I was actually fairly surprised when she started being flirty with me after the first few days. We got along fantastically, got to know a lot about each other, and everything seemed to be working out well. Soon after she started sending Snapchats of herself clearly topless (only shoulders and up), texting me very frequently, and one night while she was at a bar with friends in another part of the state told me she wished I was there. Unfortunately due to our schedules we didn't have a chance to spend much time together away from work, so things progressed much more slowly in person. After we left for this month-long trip, things seemed great. We sat together for most meals and car rides, with a lot of light contact (legs touching, leaning against one another, grabbing hands, etc.). One day last week, during a break in that week's event, we went to a secluded and private part of the venue and napped together (most days are 14+ hours of work, we needed as much sleep as we could get) while cuddling. I was still nervous because I still couldn't believe that a girl like this would be even remotely interested in me, and I locked up and couldn't pull together the courage to go for a kiss. Two days later, she started to act cold towards me. She would shy away from any physical contact, would sit away from me, would rarely speak to me unless it was something pertaining to the job. That was over a week ago now, and if anything, the situation has gotten worse. I know that I've had problems with being too clingy, over excited, and over-available with girls in the past, and they tend to get bored with me. I was determined to try something new and do something different this time. To try and win her interest again, for the past few days I've been (for the most part) acting aloof, not showing that I'm frustrated about the situation, having fun with other crew members, and honestly not paying her much attention. The latter has been difficult, and I haven't done great at it some days, but in general I feel like it's been the right choice. I've noticed a little change, she seems to be somewhat less distant, but that changes throughout the day and day to day. It's frustrating to spend 12 or so hours with or near her every day and not be able to have the closeness that happened so naturally. Does anyone have any experience with this kind of situation or any advice that might help? I'm not necessarily looking for a long term relationship with her, especially since we'll be living in different states once the internship is over, but I would really like to spend what time I have with her as something special for the summer. Any tips would be appreciated. 

Tl;dr:
Crushing on a girl I work with 12+ hours a day, 7 days a week for most of the summer, thought she looked me, not sure how to give her space bc we're stuck with ravisher for the next two weeks. "

I'm a 2nd year Computer Science student. I'm reasonably high up on the food chain for my field and age group, having got an offer to Amazon as a co-op software developer (yearly comp well north of 6 figures USD) among other things. I've also got several other interviews lined up with names like Dropbox and Palantir. They're the tech industry equivalent of Wall Street firms is the best comparison I can make. I've done well for myself, I'm proud of myself. 

I'm also profoundly deaf (from birth) with about 99.99% hearing loss on both ears, and a son of immigrant Chinese parents (both hearing). They were very laissez-faire in the way they raised me, none of that tiger mom/dad parenting. I got my first cochlear implant at the age of 7-8, and I learned my first words of English from re-runs of Dragonball Z. My comprehension isn't very good, even with lip-reading.

As the title implies, I don't really belong anywhere. I'm not a part of the deaf culture, and not really a part of the mainstream society that I want to be successful in. So it's hard finding people that I can really relate to, and it doesn't help that I'm part of such a narrow and tight demographic.

So I've started up this 10-post blog series, to reach out to people like me, people who are young and hard of hearing that want not only to succeed, but to excel in mainstream society. I've drawn upon my own experiences, and the experiences of older, successful profoundly deaf people that I've had the good fortune to have talked to.

Please don't hesitate to comment on it, what's good, what's not so good, and if you've got anything to contribute, please do.

The brash tone is a carry-over from the other deaf people I've been interacting with as of late, mostly hard-asses, but they wouldn't be successful if they weren't hard-asses.

You'll notice that I've got links to website templates for the remaining 8 posts that I've planned out. I'll be filling them out over the course of the year.

**My first two posts:**

**1. thedeafpill.com/posts/affirmative-action.html**

**Addressing the moral/internal perils of affirmative action policies and how best to combat it.**

**2. thedeafpill.com/posts/on-the-job.html**

**Addressing the ceilings a deaf person will encounter in a corporate environment, working with hearing people (that I've encountered in my past 2 internships and that other, older, successful deaf people have encountered), and why they ought to realign their priorities and/or consider other possibilities.**

Best,

4nkx52,2,2016-06-11,[F4A] Basic Protocol - New World Order,CrowmeatDPP,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/4nkx52/f4a_basic_protocol_new_world_order/,"""War"" may be a bit of an exaggeration, but anyone who claims that Western society is living in racial harmony has their head buried in the sand. Just turn on the news, the US, Europe, it's the same story everywhere. It's not anyone's fault, really- we're genetically designed to associate with those like us. But we're also designed to compete and conquer...

Let's introduce the Black Broadcast Capitalist Enterprises. International underground firm that is part of almost every market imaginable. News broadcasting, commercials, auctioning, farming, construction, law, politics, the film industry, sports... Everything. Though they always have cover-ups, ghost companies used to hide them from true sight. Most of the world has slowly been taken over by BBCE, and now they control enough to start moving.

Nearly every employee for the BBCE and their underling companies is of African descent, and the ones that aren't are very attractive white girls. Well, they weren't very attractive white girls at the start, but the BBCE works in the research industry and the cosmetic industry, and also the plastic surgery industry. They are very attractive now. Though they don't date, they deny any man that talks to them. Apart from a black man. And then if a girl talks to them, well, they'll introduce them to that high-paying secretary job at BBCE, and the cycle continues...

Now, however, they can start their original goal. To make the Black Race supreme. They've always been working towards this goal. Money is funneled into interracial porn productions, sent as child support payments to Black men and the women they breed, used to fund tuition for Black students to attend historically white colleges and universities and support the propaganda spewing Tumblr blogs they write filled with smut. In fact, BC Enterprises is the largest source of funding for the advancement of the Black race the world has ever seen- and it's working. Only, they are ready to launch a new initiative.

the Basic Protocol. Designed to target basic white girls, ones that are cute and the ones that are stunningly hot, the goal is that by the end of the year, nearly every white girl will dream of BBC stretching them out and being filled with the superior sperm. Of course, that takes time... And testing. If people suddenly get suspicious of the copious amounts of interracial porn that they can watch, targeted towards them in particular... No, the BBCE got to where they are now by patience and waiting. They were slaves by these stupid white men, now they'll enslave them. Only, they won't realize they are being enslaved until all their women are breeding black children and every job is taken by the superior black race.

The BBCE control everything, as mentioned above. And when I say everything... I truly mean everything! Every market, every business, everything is managed and monitored. If the BBCE want a famous celebrity to go black, for example Kim Kardashian... They start to influence her. Replace her friends' thoughts and let her friends convert her. Whisper in her ear. And then they put down their hand-made celebrity Kanye West to sweep in and finish the job. Now, millions of teens on instagram look up to Kim, and her sexy black husband...

This is only an example. The first step to the project is to pick a fresh target. I am sure that you boys can find a nice picture of a pretty girl who is ready to be tested and moulded into her ideal image! Then, the influence begins. Start replacing boys in her school with black ones, have her watch her crush get beaten up by a gang of muscular black guys. Surround her with pretty black men and... Her friends. Her friends will be converted in advance, on a more... Enhanced version of the protocol. Sped up. Her friends already love black cock and eagerly work for BBCE. They giggle and point out things like how much bigger and more dominant black men are...

And then they steer it towards sexual conversation. Is it true that black men are bigger? Is it true that once you go black, you can't go back? Stuff like this. Questions that keep our target up at night, pondering about them... At this point, we'll begin to convert her family. Take the men of the house out, her brothers and father, replace them with a new black step-father. This is a long process, but the black agent who will play as the step-father will begin to play subliminal messaging and hypnotic videos that are disguised as films. Ones that get her horny as the sex scenes get steamier, the ones that make her close her eyes at night, but not for sleeping.

Then we amp it up after a few weeks of this. After this amount of time, she's into black guys. But still into whites... And that can't do. We'll make her give a BJ or have sex with a white guy and his tiny penis, and then afterwards, a few days later, have her accidently walk into her step-father, or maybe find a beefed out black guy in the gym showers... Maybe asked on a date from the basketball player in school. And they'll get it on, slowly but surely.

She should have her first black cock within two weeks of amping it up. Then, we give her more black cock, and tiny white cock as well. From there, she'll make her choice. We'll get her addicted to the stunning pleasure of BBC, and then the BBCE will give her an internship at one of their prestigious offices, far away from her family. There, they'll pump her up into an airheaded bimbo secretary and... Rinse and repeat. Until they get the formula for the Basic Protocol down.

Then... They can release it upon the world.

---

The best message to me would be starting off the roleplay by writing about one of the girls. You'll play any man that comes up, and the world and how it reacts to the Basic Protocol, but also about the brainwashing and the effects it has on the four girls! So mentioning how they find themselves thinking about black men... Stuff like that. I'm more likely to ignore you if you don't write a response to the roleplay and get stuck in straight away, just because I can see your writing talent and whether we'll be a good match! "
4nlg3x,9,2016-06-11,Me [24F] with my boyfriend [27M] of 3.5 years - no affection and no intimacy and it's killing me.,no__love,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4nlg3x/me_24f_with_my_boyfriend_27m_of_35_years_no/,"Looking for some advice on how to handle this and how to properly bring this up in conversation when I talk to my boyfriend tonight. Without seeming like I'm being accusatory and pushy. Just how to phrase my wording more effectively... 

There is some **NSFW** sex details in here, as a warning.

We've been together for 3.5 years. We have the same life goals, ambitions, etc so that all lines up well. We've discussed marriage and kids and we're both on the same page. Now I'm not sure anymore and I'm at the brink of breaking up. We finally moved in together 3 months ago. We were so excited about it. 

Now that we've moved in, there is zero intimacy and affection from his end. I am hurt and constantly wondering what I'm doing wrong and it's draining me. I know it's normal for sex and stuff like that to dip, but to completely disappear?

Before we moved in, we always had sex every time we were alone together. He was affectionate and sweet. Now, it's absolutely nothing. We both have high libidos so I don't think that's mixmatched.

He still masturbates frequently. Daily. I constantly walk in on him trying to be ""sneaky"" when he's jerking off in bed watching porn on his phone. He stops and pretends he's not doing anything (like I'm fucking stupid) and will continue when I walk out, usually frustrated...

I give him affection all the time. Kiss him, touch him, etc. He's usually on his computer playing games or doing work. I'll come up to him and kiss him, try to get him to say something to me - and he just ignores me. He tries to humor me and talks to me but I can tell I'm just annoying him. So I just leave him alone.

I try to initiate every once in awhile, but again, he just ignores me or brushes me off. But he has ZERO issue with accepting blowjobs, if possible. I used to love giving them. But since they've turned into the only thing he'll do with me, I've lost interest in giving them because this seriously hurts my feelings. 

Couples that move in together for the first time - uninterrupted sex was the thing I was looking forward to. How many times have we had sex since we've moved in?

Once. If you even count that as sex. I basically rode him for a while (I hate this position) and I asked him if we could switch to doggy (my favorite - which he NEVER wants to do - he only ever wants cowgirl). He flat out told me no and then he chided me for 'not putting enough effort in getting him off'. I climbed off of him, pretty upset and took a shower. He didn't care.

After this I realized that he's just fucking lazy when it comes to sex. Loves blowjobs (aka he does no work), loves cowgirl (barely does any work). When I suggest something else he just tells me no and wants me to continue what I'm doing. 

After this incident, we've had zero sex. There have been several blowjobs since then, in my stupidly foolish hopes that this could turn into sex - and I'm wrong every time. 

Several weeks ago, I flatout asked him if we could have sex. He said 'maybe this weekend'. 

:l

There was no attempt at sex that weekend. But that week, literally right when I walk in the door after work with intentions of a nice shower, he initiates. Which I'm excited for, but it's the worst time. I was grimy and sweaty and feeling fucking gross after a day of work. My period had just ended (sorry TMI) and I wanted to freshen up. I told him I would take a quick 5 min shower to freshen up for these reasons and we could continue OR he could hop in the shower with me, etc. He got angry and just walked off and told me not to ask him ever again then. 

I rethink this incident a lot and wonder if I was in the wrong? He made an effort and I didn't shoot him down, I just wanted a quick shower because I was gross. Should I have just done it? Because ever since that incident, he's never initiated again. I didn't shoot him down, I didn't mean to ruin his spontaneous moment - but out of simple courtesy, I wanted 5 mins to clean up. Was I in the wrong here or mistepped?

Sometimes when I walk on his trying to be sneaky and masturbate, I'll ""join"" in, seeing it as an opportunity. Nope, just wants a blowjob. I'll text him when I'm at work about how much I want him. He just ignores them. But responds to everything else. 

I passed out of the couch last night watching TV. I woke up at like 5am this morning and got up to go sleep more in our bed, and he was awake and obviously masturbating. He stops, I climb into bed, and feel he is hard. I touch him, kiss him, try to initiate, etc. He rolls over and passes out. 

Here I am, hurt, frustrated, not sure what to do. I'm fed up. I can't think of the last time we had decent sex. I can't even think of the last time he laid a hand on me gently or touched me in ANY way. Or initiated a kiss.

I don't think he is depressed. We both have full-time decent paying jobs so money isn't an issue - all the bills get paid and we both always have a nice amount of spending money. He is extremely ambitious and excited about his career in programming and landed a great paid internship this year and hopes to get hired on in a few weeks.

So he's extremely happy with his job. His face lights up when he talks about it. He acts completely normal in every other aspect of our lives. Has normal convos with me on everything else. He'll still mention kids and marriage and passing like our relationship is 100% okay. So it seems like he's fucking oblivious to this, when at the same time, he seems to actively make an effort to not doing anything sexual with me.

It's just this pretty fucking big glaring aspect that he's suddenly shut me out on and I don't know why.

He masturbates frequently and will gladly accept a bj at any time (of course...) so I don't think it's a libido issue. 

What am I doing wrong? Am I pressuring him too much? At this point I don't even want sex, I want a kiss. I want him to touch me. Anything at this point...

I'm bringing this up tonight because I'm fed up. I'm about to break up over this. But as a last ditch effort, I want to try to repair it first and find the issue. How should I word this? Without putting more pressure on him or make it worse? 

Thank you all.

   
**tl;dr**: Boyfriend gives me zero affection or intimacy. I'm frustrated and about to break up."

During my anniversary with my gf this year I proposed, she was expecting it and bought me a XBOne knowing how much I missed Halo.

Unfortunately only one of my friends is on XBox now, and Warzone is pretty terrible solo (and Halo 5 seems weighted towards Warzone), so I've come here looking to find people to play with.

I love arena, feels a lot better than H4, I mostly stick with SWAT and Slayer, though I'll venture into BTB after I get a rank in both. I'd love some more people to try out Warzone with.

Right now I have a full time job, class, and an internship, so I mostly play at nights or on my few days off.  I try to win, but I can't stand the people who require you to join their club and have level requirements and all of that nonsense.

So feel free to send me a friend request or leave your name and I'll send one to you. Thanks!"

BUT ITS ALSO A HUGE CHANGE FOR ME TOO.
I now HAVE to do daycare drop off and pick up plus cook all the meals (we used to share that but now he gets home to late to cook). Since he isn't home afternoons anymore to help with any chores I have to do it all.  And I get to do it all with the five month old attached to the tit. And two days a week with our almost four year old up my butt trying to help.  I work 24/7. I don't at all. But also:

I told him last night I needed his help moving some furniture and cleaning today. So far he has sat on his ass playing video games.  When I ask for help ""just a minute"" except by the time a ""minute"" is up I've found a way to do it myself and gotten it done.

4nlo6r,193,2016-06-11,My wife is an underachiever,TheosThrowaway,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/4nlo6r/my_wife_is_an_underachiever/,"I've been with my wife for 11 years, married for about two. We have an elementary-aged child and a newborn. To be honest, there have been several moments where I think the only thing that keep me from leaving are my sons.

I love my family, but I don't think I like my wife very much.


If you're doing the math, yes, our first child was born well before we were married. We've been together since high school, then got pregnant in college.

And I guess that's as good a place to start as any: college. We've been pretty damn fortunate in that we have an amazing support network. Our families really rallied behind us when our first son was born and insisted that we both finish school. They gave us a place to live, babysat when we had class or work - we've been in a good situation for years and it's thanks to them. Their support has given us a golden opportunity that not many others in our circumstances are afforded.

I was going through a bit of a personal struggle when our first baby was born, and it resulted in me changing my major to something completely different. Great timing, right? Either way, I was able to transfer to a good school where I'd be able to commute, then essentially start over and still manage to receive a bachelors in 5 1/2 years. I worked a couple of McJobs during this time, which didn't make ends meet but helped, then a couple of internships in my degree field, a part time job relevant to my degree during my senior year, then finally landing my career job about a year and a half after graduation.

That year and a half between graduation and landing a solid job in my field ... that was eye-opening. It's where the support started to fade. Not for my wife (more on that in a second), just me. There were hushed conversations that ended as soon as I entered rooms, conversations about my personal business with complete strangers, unsolicited advice and offers for  assistance that felt more like judgement and ridicule than sincere help. Everyone was questioning why I was taking so long to finish school and thought I should be a real man, and quit with a semester left to go work in a factory. 

I made all the right choices, and I was being doubted by a bunch of people that had never even been to college. My wife joined in too, making snide comments about how I need to ""get a real fucking job,"" as I sent out two dozen job applications a week.

Oh my wife... During those years between the baby's birth and my graduation, my wife made a lot of poor decisions. Rather than attend the affordable state school that was closer to home, she opted to go to a more expensive private university that was a 40 minute commute one way.

That lasted a semester and added around an extra $10k alone to her student loan debt. After she realized that finishing her degree there would eventually land her in six figures worth of debt (... For a teaching degree), she bit the bullet and decided to slum it at the inner city (yet more highly touted) state school with me.

And speaking of finishing, that still hasn't happened yet. While I did a 180 in my career path and was put on an accelerated clock, my wife has taken almost a decade to get her teaching certification. She only took a semester off from school when the baby was born, so what the fuck is the hold up? Remember, our parents will still watch the kids whenever we need them. We've been able to go about our studies relatively uninterrupted. 

Accept for for that time I had cancer. Yeah, second semester senior year, I was diagnosed with cancer. My prognosis was great and I never needed chemo or radiation - it was removed via surgery. But yeah, imagine taking classes with THAT hanging over your head. Kids, work, school, and cancer. To this day, the word ""remission"" has never been used. My tests have been ""clean"" for a few years now, but for some reason the doctors won't use terms like remission or ""cancer-free"". I mean, I am cancer free, but c'mon.

I had no emotional support during that time. I was alienated, only to be spoken about rather than with. My situation was only addressed when I wasn't in the room, and no one ever asked how I was feeling. Not even my wife; shit, people were more emotionally supportive for her regarding MY ILLNESS than they were for me. It was fucking gossip.

But I finished school anyway.

Back to her - she never took school seriously. She'd sign up for a full class load then drop half of her classes a week into the semester for reasons like ""not liking the professor."" I recall one argument we had over a class she took that she didn't even need - it was an elective outside of her degree program! She still had requirements to fulfill! We had a child to support and needed to finish school as soon as possible. She didn't listen, and her parents only enabled her; ""Do what makes you happy."" What the fuck? 

And then, she'd drop these classes and not use that free time to pick up extra shifts at work. If you're not progressing toward your degree, you could at least help put food on the table, right?

Fast forward a little bit, and I'm finally graduated and approaching my first work anniversary at my career job. Things have died down in terms of pressure on me, and everyone is getting along very well. We decide we're finally stable enough to get married, so we set a date. It looks like she's finally going to earn her degree and teaching certificate after 8 1/2 years of undergrad. She finally passed her state exam after needing to retake it twice, and she was finishing up her last semester of student teaching - things were looking good.


Wrong. She failed her second semester of student teaching - completely blindsided. They wouldn't even let her return to the school after deciding not to pass her. It was a crisis. She would be able to graduate, but without that state required amount of hours in the classroom, there'd be no teaching certificate, which made her degree useless.

If you'd asked her, the whole world was against her. It was a conspiracy, and her mentors at the school she was student teaching with had an axe to grind! I supported her through it all; she had nothing but good things to say when I asked how things were going. And then I read the review forks from her mentors: mostly negative, from the moment she started there. They started off as saying that she showed potential, but she only regressed from there. It was plain in writing, the feedback progressively got worse as the semester went on and she was too thick to see the writing on the wall. Had she even bothered to read her monthly reviews?

I scrambled. There was no way my wife was going back to her old minimum wage job for however long. We couldn't take that both financially and mentally. My workplace and its sister companies have a great internship program, and unlike many in the area, it not only pays, but shift rate of interns are brought on full time. The industry and her background didn't match well, so it was a long shot. However, I was able to ask around and find a team in need of an intern with her skill set.

She was down on herself, and I needed to pick her back up. She was hesitant to pursue the internship, as she could go back and retake her student teaching (while paying the university for the credit hours while working full time at no pay), but she said she'd try it out for the summer and see where it went. (She was awfully confident that she'd get the job, which was a long shot)

I spoke to directors and got feedback on what they'd want to see out of such a candidate, coached her on our culture and standard interview questions and what they'd be looking to hear. I did everything I could except take the interview for her, and she nailed it.

She loved working there, and again told me things were going well. There were rumors she was being considered for a full time role, and the rumors were confirmed when she was asked to interview for it.

In our personal life, the fact that things were going well and there seemed to be a job for her on the horizon had us more optimistic than ever. We could finally get our own place (we rent), have a second baby - we could finally start living our lives how we envisioned it. 

We got a little carried away and got pregnant again. It was fine though, we were happy. Things were going our way, and everything was going to be fine.

She bombed the fucking interview. Again, she took it as the world being out to get her. She gave me the feedback she reviewed as to why they didn't pick her.

It was nearly identical to why she failed her student teaching. Different people, different circumstances, same results. ""When everyone is an asshole no matter where you go, maybe you're the asshole,"" or something like that.

I tried to reason with her. Explain that, since this wasn't the first time she'd been told these things, maybe there was some truth to it. She denied it at first, but seemed to later accept she had some things to work on. 

She phoned it in her last few months of her internship. They hadn't filled the position she interviewed for and left the door open for her if she showed positive growth. She squandered that second chance. Her attitude and effort she was putting in had me convinced she was looking to get fired. I got on her ass about that - you don't fucking burn bridges, and especially not if your husband still has to work there!

She declined the opportunity to interview again, staying she was going back to finish her student teaching. She asked for my advice beforehand, and I was supportive even though I didn't actually agree. If I had given my real opinion, she wouldn't have listened anyway and would've accused me of trying to control her.

That's what it always comes down to when we don't see eye to eye in these situations - I'm trying to ""control her."" This is of course ignoring her habit of brash and poor decision making.

So some months pass, she substitute teaches for a while and we get by. Baby is born and she's ready to go back to school in the fall. (...which will involve dipping into our savings for a house to pay for her tuition.)

But wait! Not so fast! She has to submit an appeal to be allowed to finish. Another blindside, she tells me. No one told her there'd be an approval process for completing the process of getting certified. (Personally, I don't believe that - she has a nasty habit of not listening when it's important she does) And what happens if the appeal committee says no? Is that 8 years of undergrad and tens of thousands of dollars of student loan debt for a degree she can't actually use? 

That was a few weeks ago. Has she started writing her appeal? No. Has she sought guidance from her academic advisor, who offered to help? No. Has she even bothered to contact the department head to inquire what her options are should her appeal not go through? Nope.

Does she care? I don't know. She's dragging our family down, and I don't think she's given any of it a second thought. She's pushing 28 and has never had a full time job, and I don't think she sees anything wrong with that. I'm looking for a second job so I can support us, and she doesn't bat an eye.

What matters to her? It sure as hell doesn't seem to be our future. 

For the last week, she's put all of her time and effort into a garage sale she's putting on with her mom. A fucking garage sale. She has to write an appeal and go in front of a committee, and she hasn't even gotten started writing it yet.

This isn't 1950s leave it to beaver suburbia. We're both decent parents, but we can't give our kids the lives we want them to have on a single income. That isn't what we agreed to when we said ""I do."" I'll bust my ass to make this work, but I'm not a fucking sugar daddy.

I don't know if I have it in me to continue being supportive. We're going nowhere, and it feels like she's the anchor. There's moments where it feels like she's still the 16 year old girl I met in high school - she hasn't grown, and I don't think she intends to. 

I don't know what to do. 

Edit: sorry for the typos, I'm on mobile.

They never called, so I called them asking about the position and they said they were still going through candidates and would let me know within a week. Never heard from them again. 

Since then, I've applied at a LOT of places for internships and rarely do I hear back from any. I've got good experience working in PR and the corporate world in general and a good amount of useful and unique skills. 

Am I just striking out and getting unlikely? Or is my resume, experience, and skillset simply not as impressive as I thought it was?

What more can I do, if anything, aside from emailing resumes and cover letters to these places?

By the end of my college career, I'll be in over $120,000 of debt for going to a state school. My parents helped me my first year by paying my interest off my loans (~$60/month per semester. So currently at $120/month just for interest), but they won't be able to pay more than that. I want to move out, but I'll have to suck up my grievances at home since I would rather pay this loan off. 

I have a paid internship as a software developer for a local company. I started at $10 an hour and have gotten a few raises for a current wage of $20 an hour. I've been working there for over a year and half, so its an unusual internship that I'm grateful to have. In the summer I work a little over 40 hours a week, and during school I worked 10 hours a week during freshman year. I want to bump that up to 20 hours a week sophomore year. I can work remotely, so transportation isn't an issue (my car also broke down so I have to borrow my parents).

What should I do to get rid of these loans? I have about $1,500 in a ROTH IRA account I started in High School and would like to continue contributing to that. I would like to get a car, but my school is in a city so it's not needed. But every time I need my parents car, they get annoyed because I'm putting miles on it, so I am restricted in that regard.

If I put *all* of my earnings after taxes into my loans, I would pay off about 1/3 of my semester loans a year (about $5,000 per semester of $15,000 debt). But I have other expenses, so that's a **very** high estimate.

**Condensed Info**



**Current Debt:** ~$30,000 accruing at a rate of $15,000 a semester, or $30,000 a year

**College:** Going into my Sophomore year of college at a state school

**Total estimated Debt after college:*** &gt; $120,000

**Major:** Computer Science

**Current wage:** $20 an hour

**Workable hours:** 40 hours a week in the summer, 20 hours a week during school

**ROTH IRA:** ~$1,500

**Main Questions:**

* How should I go about getting rid of this loan?
* What's a good percentage to put into loans if I don't have many other expenses?

EDIT: Thanks for all the help! I've just applied to a local state school that I can commute to easily. After searching other posts about college debt and the degree, I would rather not start off my post-college life with over $120k in debt. I can't get back the first $30k, but I'll thank myself 5 years down the road."
4nmrbg,2,2016-06-11,"Me [24 M] with my (ex) SO [25 F] 8 Months together, she abruptly ended things with me after I tried to discuss our relationship.",gameofthrowns12,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4nmrbg/me_24_m_with_my_ex_so_25_f_8_months_together_she/,"Hello Reddit, prepare for a somewhat long post, but I would like your input on this matter.
Me (24 M) and my (ex) SO (25 F) have been dating for 8 months, we met at uni and I recently graduated while she still has one more year to go. We'll call her Emily. Emily is working for a big firm in a major city for the summer, as that is her internship. She loves what she does and she's very passionate about her career and future. Emily recently (in the past year) lost one of her immediate family members and this has fueled her desires and passion to make something of herself with her career. I have been thoroughly accommodating of her situation and for the most part she does fine. We met at the beginning of the school year, last september and I had just gotten off a relationship so she was pretty cool and we hit if off and started dating.  
Our life at uni was pretty simple, we spent almost every day together, she slept over, we did hw together (we were in the same major) and we became pretty close and went on trips and getaways during breaks together. I have been fully supportive of her passion, her goals, and her work and our relationship seemed to be going fine all the way up until last May, when I graduated. We moved back home and she lives in this big city while I live in the suburbs about 40 min out because my job is out here and I want to save some money.  
Our communication at school was pretty great, we texted and talked every day and we planned things out accordingly including our trips and events and whatever dates we went on.  
Coming back home, that has gone a full 180 and ever since she moved to the city (she's lived there before uni and knows it pretty well, its her natural habitat, and is working at the same place as last summer). Our communication has dropped significantly and I understand shes busy and I try to ask her about her days and how her work is going but when I initiate conversations she tends to ignore my messages even though I know she looks at them and doesn't tend to respond.  
Making plans has been a hassle as she usually responds with an ""idk well see"" and doesn't text me back or message me back so I often leave two or three messages as to whats going on because I do not hear from them. From this, she gets defensive and says she's at work and can't text although shes on FB ALL THE TIME on her phone. I do not get it, texting back is common courtesy just in general. I have been trying to be a good bf wishing her a good day and a good night almost every day without any response, and when she does conversations are brief and then she ceases to respond.  
Last Thursday, we got into an argument via text (which I hate) in which she said she couldn't be texting as much and that it actually pissed her off when she saw multiple messages from me at the end of the day (wtf?). I told her I understand, that she has to do what she has to do but that simple communication throughout the week is definitely needed, as it is odd that you can go on 2-3 days without speaking to each other. I do not like that.  Furthermore, I told her that we could compromise, that I would back off if she met me halfway as in like communicating about making plans and when we can see each other and just basically having a basic conversation with your SO, it shouldn't be that hard.  
She didn't reply after I asked if we were okay and even after I wished her a goodnight and good luck with her work (she has had some tough deadlines at work which she didnt inform me about so I had no idea how swamped she was until the day of). Friday, we didnt speak at all so that bothered me because I had no idea what was going on. This morning, i texted her asking if everything is okay that I am confused as fuck as to what is going on and she didnt reply. However, she went on FB and I know she saw my msgs, so I proceeded to please get back to me because I want to resolve things as grown adults instead of her ignoring me. I proceeded to call her, she ignored and texted me back saying to stop and that we weren't working anymore. I urged her to talk to me in person, then she dropped a bomb on me saying that she has to work (goodbye plans I guess) and she is still ON FB ALL THE TIME, i do not get it. Anyways, I convinced her to have a face to face to discuss things with her after work (if she's even at work) to hash things out.  
So my question is, is this a dealbreaker? Should I just end things with this person? What are your thoughts on this matter reddit. I would hope a relationship is a give a take, a two way road where we communicate with each other and figure things out together, not just jump to conclusions and assume we are okay with each other's job situations and distance. We never discussed how it would be long distance, I thought it would be okay because at school she seemed fine and I've asked her multiple times if this is something she can handle as I have serious feelings for her, she has replied with saying she is on the same page, but it does not feel that way. We haven't discussed how living apart after being together for a year would affect our relationships and how it would change the dynamic of the relationship so that we can work out the technicalities as to how we can be a successful couple. I have tried to talk to her about it this morning, then she told me it wasn't working anymore and she didn't even want to discuss as to why she made such an abrupt decision. I'm not sure if there is anyone else she met at work, or if she's just not into it, but I hoped we would be honest with each other. I am talking to her tonight as I convinced her that we both owe each other a conversation about the relationship and how we view it.  
Sorry for the long post reddit, it has been a stressful week figuring this out, I would just like some closure.  
Thank you all!

TL;DR: My (24 M) SO (25 F) met at uni this past year, had a great time together in the past 8 months. I graduated in May and she has a year left, she works in a bit city, I in the suburbs of it, communication has dropped significantly and she thinks its okay and gets mad/defensive when I try to talk to her and discuss the matter. She ended things abruptly but I convinced her to have one last talk to figure out what is really going on. Thoughts?

I have a substantial savings account and I need guidance.,Charmacker,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4nmri7/i_just_turned_20_i_have_a_substantial_savings/,"So I am a young 20 year old. Just finished my second year of college. Currently working 40+ hours a week (more on this later). First real Reddit post so please be kind :)

Right now I have $8,000 in my savings and another $4,000 invested into various stocks in an E-Trade account. My investing hasn't gone great *(around -20%)*, mainly because I haven't put the time into trading routinely. My trend has been to find a good stock with a good dividend and buy $500 worth of it. I like stocks and the ideas of investing on my own, but I just don't have the time right now to make careful decisions about my investments.

I am currently working as an intern full-time this summer for $12/hr. I also have a second part-time job on the weekends roughly 8 hrs a week for $10/hr.

I'm making good money right now and I have been more modest than most about spending habits. I am very fortunate to be in a family where my mom makes meals everyday and we do almost everything together. So I have never really needed to spend my own money, I've just been saving it.

Right now I'd like some advice on how I should move forward with finding a more stable account that I can put most of what I'm earning into. I'd like to put about 50-75% of what I have into some account. My dad has given me some advice and thinks I should talk to a financial advisor from our church and get in with his company.

I am open to any advice or suggestions you might have.
Thank you!

4nndrs,30,2016-06-11,"In regards to ""Crystal Farming"" (From the author of the guide)",Soapbox_Dre,BleachBraveSouls,https://www.reddit.com/r/BleachBraveSouls/comments/4nndrs/in_regards_to_crystal_farming_from_the_author_of/,"So I feel like this has been a long time coming, and the fact that I'm just now getting to it further reinforces my rationale.  

If you don't know who I am, I'm u/soapbox_dre, and I created the original crystal farming guide.  

**A lot of what comes next is gonna be backstory, so feel free to skip that if you want**  

So, I started playing B:BS not too long after the initial global release in January. I saw an ad for it on facebook and, completely out of character, I clicked on it, because bleach is one of my favorite Manga/Anime. The thing is, when I started playing the game, my life was a bit different.  

See in January of this year, I was not-so-fresh out of college, unemployed, and starting to get down on myself.  

Having been out of college and unemployed for about 6 months at the time, I was beginning to go through a spell of depression. I had been doing nothing but sending out job applications and I was getting no responses. None. Nada. Zero. It got to a point where I was starting to lose hope and shit. I withdrew, stayed home more, didn't talk to my friends, didn't go out, because I didn't want to be a burden to them, or a buzzkill. So when I found B:BS, things kinda started to change. I found this subreddit and was instantly doing something I enjoyed and was a part of a community that didn't cost me anything to be involved in.  

I started getting callbacks from jobs, and going on interviews. Even though I was still spending most of my days at home, things were looking up. Around the end of february, I got an internship offer and was able to start working. It wasn't much, but it was something. I no longer felt like a useless piece of crap, and I wasn't embarrassed to be seen in public. And while all this was happening, I was still relatively active on the sub, and regularly playing B:BS. I was content.  

However, as time went on and I started doing more things in real life, I became less and less involved with the B:BS community. As my time was eaten up by other activities, something always had to give. At first it was post maintenance, then it was posting threads, followed by commenting on interesting (to me) threads, then even just reading what other members of the sub were posting. B:BS was slowly being phased out of my life. I still played (at work, thank god for the auto feature), but I was virtually non-existent in the community.  

As I looked at the sub more and more sporadically (because at some point, the tab got unpinned from my browser) the messages started piling up. Especially as new chapters started being released. I honestly tried to keep up with updating the ""Crystal Farming"" guide as new chapters went up, but then it all came to a head, when I started trying to add levels from chapter 5, and then chapter 6 dropped. By this point I realized that I wasn't gonna be able to catch up.  

**end of backstory**  

Because of how I used to go about adding chapters to the crystal farming guide, I can no longer do everything that I need to do in real life, and keep the crystal farming guide updated with the same quality that it had when I started. It's just not feasible for me with all I have going on. So to everyone who was hoping that they'd show up one day, and the thread would be up-to-date, I sincerely apologize.  

My true hope in writing this long ass post is that hopefully, a user (or group of users) will dedicate themself(ves) to creating a new, better maintained, and up-to-date version, of the crystal farming guide. Because I know that, if well done, it would become an invaluable resource to the members of this sub.  

If you read all the backstory, thanks. If you read the post at all, thanks. If you've ever used my guide, you've made that work worthwhile for me. Now I'm hoping to pass the torch.  "

This is entirely on my own which is why the company didn't provide me with any leadway, but I hope to present this idea to them and see what they think.

So at the chemical plant I work at, we produce thousands of gallons of wastewater, full of heavy metals, specifically, copper and nickel.  What we have to do with it is fill up a big 10,000 gallon tank, get it hauled off as hazardous waste and pay (in my mind) an overly excessive amount.  

My thoughts are, why can't we just process it on our plant, but I've been doing a lot of reading on wastewater processing, but am curious as to what experienced workers in the field had to say about this. 

Basically, what is the quickest, cheapest, and easiest way to filter large quantities of Copper and Nickel out of water so it can be dumped into storm drains?  By easiest, I mean something that doesn't take up a ton of space and isn't overly complicated to run/operate, so more like a large filter system that can be changed after every x thousands of gallons.

Sorry if this doesn't make sense or is too vague, I'm not sure of the concentrations, but I know it's enough that it cannot be dumped.  Feel free to ask me any questions regarding what I said.

Thanks for you help!"

My role currently is to just enter receipts of clients' business expenses into Excel, to calculate the HST and also do bookkeeping in Sage 50.

Is this worth it if I'm not even being paid at all for it? I've used QuickBooks before but never Sage 50, so I do ask the guy questions whenever I come across a confusion situation. But still I'm taking part in doing billable work, so shouldn't I be paid?

**#1: The Intern**
I had just finished my second year of university, and it was now time to find a job for the summer. In this day and age, that was not easy. You had overqualified people working in minimum wage jobs, and underqualified people not working at all. So... where did a soon to be second year business major fit in that picture? Absolutely no where. I searched everywhere for a job, even going so far as to check Craigslist, which let me tell you, I will never do again. I basically did nothing for two months while I waited to hear back from several prospective employers, but I had heard nothing. 

The whole reason I was taking business was so that I could one day open up my own. I wasn't sure what it was going to be yet. A restaurant, a boutique, a salon. It could be any of those, but I still had at least three more years before I had to put my education to the test. The aspiration had come from my mother and father, who owned a restaurant together. It was a thriving Greek restaurant. My father was the brain, and my mother was the brawn... the brawn being the cook, in this case. They had taken some family recipes and built on it, and now they were preparing to open their second location. You'd think with success like that they'd be willing to give their own daughter a job, but no. They wanted me to earn things in life, not take hand outs. This was ironic, considering they were paying for my education and the fact that they spoiled me to death. But they still wouldn't give me a job. Did they think I was incompetent?

Anyways, me trying to earn a job didn't last very long. About a month into my summer vacation, my father introduced me to a friend of his who ran an accounting firm. He told me about a summer intern position that didn't pay very much. I wouldn't be doing real accounting work, either. More like just getting coffee, photocopying, and the likes. But my father preached about how it would be a great experience. Accounting and business were two different things, so this would exactly be a meaningful experience, but it would be better than sitting around all day. Plus, he told me that I would get my own cubicle, which meant that I had a place to go and hide and slack off.

So, I applied and I was basically given the job. So much for not taking hand outs. Twenty years old, now an intern at Zickler Chartered Accountants, a position that was handed to me. Despite the hand out, I was going to take the position seriously. I was going to kick ass at doing coffee runs and making copies. I was going to be the best damn intern that this accounting firm had ever seen. My mom even went out and bought me a bunch of outfits for me to look more professional... another handout. I didn't complain, though, I thought I looked cute in most of them. 

The whole 'taking the job seriously' phase lasted for about a week. I soon realized that I could literally sit in my cubicle all day and do absolutely nothing, and no one would care. This was going to be a long summer if I was just sitting around for hours on end. A lot of the guys here are nice, at least.
***
This was basically just a back story of how my character ends up working at the accounting firm you work at. You can pick who you are, however, there are a few attributes I would like your character to have.

* I do not want him to be my boss. I don't want a power exchange, unless you want me being slightly dominant. If not, I'm fine with that.
* I'd like your character to be 30 or older (my character will be 20).
* I'd like your character to have worked at the firm for some time now.

How I see this going is your character taking a particular liking to me, being flirty and what not. Depending on how old you choose to be, it may seem more and more unlikely that our characters will someone end up having sex. But eventually, they will, and you know you'll have to keep it quiet or you'll lose your job for having sex with the intern that is at least ten years younger than you, which is where I would have the upper hand (if you're into femdom).

**#2: The Office Affair**
Supreme Marketing Solutions was a small marketing firm, based out of two floors of a tall office building in the wonderful city that is New York. It was not exactly as diverse or dynamic as other marketing firms, but it was not the *worst* place in the world to work. Aside from the stuffy atmosphere with everyone crammed into cubicles, the people were nice, the bosses were relaxed, and the work was relatively easy. Best of all, it paid well, and living in New York didn't exactly come cheap. 

Most of the employees at Supreme Marketing Solutions were young, a majority being in their early to mid twenties. Besides Rhonda, the secretary who mostly kept to herself, the office population was mostly comprised of college graduates and young office executives. The younger crowd meant a more relaxed work day, but it also meant wild weeknights and weekends. The people that you spent your days with were usually the same ones you spent your nights with, and it was not uncommon for co-workers to end up going out and getting smashed together. It also wasn't uncommon for co-workers to end up sleeping together, which made for some awkward workdays. 

Despite many of the employees being young and reckless, some had married right out of college. That didn't stop them from getting drunk and enjoying life. It simple meant that they couldn't go around fucking their co-workers, no matter how young and attractive they were. No matter how tempting it could be sometimes, you had to remember that there was someone waiting for you at home.

I was one of those people. Here's a little bit of information about me, Kayla, a junior executive at Supreme Marketing Solutions. Life before my job at the marketing firm was great, not that I'm saying it isn't now. I went to a lower level college, as I wasn't very interested in school. I took economics and just barely got through my degree. I wasn't stupid, but I wasn't motivated. I spent most of my time partying. I was probably drunk more of the time than I was sober. If I wasn't out at a frat party with my girlfriends or out bar hopping, I was probably sleeping, waiting to do it all over again. One thing I haven't mentioned yet is that I was kind've a slut... I loved getting fucked, I couldn't help it. Being drunk most of the time didn't help with my decision making either. Boys just came naturally to me... and  on me... and in me. It's not like it was an every day thing. Maybe a few times a week? It was college, though, so I can use that as my excuse. In my fourth year, I was placed on academic probation. That was when I realized that I needed to get my shit together. I literally quit drinking, I started doing my work, and to my surprise, I scraped by and got my degree in business. But then, I had to find a job. Who the hell was going to hire me with my grades? I searched and searched, looking at job postings all across the country, hoping I could find something. Long story short, I somehow managed to land an internship at Supreme Marketing, and I worked my ass off. I spent my first few months doing everything I could to secure a permanent position. That was three years ago. Now I'm a junior executive, and I *still* work my ass off, but I've regressed to my old ways a bit. I do my work, but I still go get smashed a few times a week. I haven't regressed to my old sexual ways, though. It's hard to do that when I have my husband, Trevor, who's a police officer with the NYPD. Not that I want to do it, but I kind've miss be able to go out and get whoever's dick I wanted. Trevor works nights a lot, too, so I don't always get his dick. I'm still young, I still need dick! Who knows, maybe Trevor will start working days and we'll be able to spend more time together, or maybe something else will happen...

I am not the greatest writer, I'm aware of this, but this is the most effort I've ever put into a prompt in hopes that it'll attract some great writers and willing, detailed roleplayers. My plans for this roleplay are to have a lot of build up. You can choose who you want to be. A co-worker who I've known for a while, a new employee, the IT guy... I really don't care, you can pick. And if you haven't realized, I'm looking for an office affair that will eventually turn into more. Again, I want lots of build up. In the first few encounters, there will be no sex. There will be flirtation, sure, and perhaps a realized attraction, but no sex or anything sex related for a little while. Unless you think you can seduce me right away... but you'll have to do that in-character. Anyways, yeah, realistic tension build-up, leading to a steamy office affair."
4noktz,5,2016-06-11,My parents asked if I can go on a trip with them.,ElectroClan,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/4noktz/my_parents_asked_if_i_can_go_on_a_trip_with_them/,"Just today, my Edad and Nmom asked me if I wanted to go on a trip with them after my internship finishes in August. It would be a short one that would have me back at my new city just before the dorms at my university open. I've been living close to campus on an apartment for all summer, and I leave for an internship in another city nearby tomorrow. The last time I've seen my parents was Christmas, and I had intended to stay away from them for the next twelve months. 

However, my Nmom told me earlier today that my Edad had found a deal on Expedia for our whole family to go on a nice trip to a city we've never been to before. Tonight, my Edad called and explained the details of the trip and asked me if I could go or not. 

Quite honestly, I'm torn. I wish I wasn't, but I am. My Edad's favorite thing to do is plan out fun trips to great places, and I have so many wonderful memories of all the trips we've been on. 

For now, I've told them that I honestly don't know. I've told them that I'm going to have to have time to move my things from the apartment to the dorm, to rent textbooks, to buy supplies, etc. I told them that there would be too many things for me to do before school starts again. 

My Edad replied, ""But there's not that much you have to *do.* You just have to move your things and get textbooks. Moving and unpacking should only take one day, and textbooks don't take that long to ship. And you'll have plenty of time to get supplies.""

I could hear my Nmom in the background grumbling, ""She just doesn't want to be with us. She wants to be in her own world."" 

My Edad also said, ""Aw, c'mon, ElectroClan, why don't you want to go? Is it us? I mean, we shower often!"" (He gave a small laugh for this one. He's said this joke before.)

They did, however, give me a choice. They said that I could go or I couldn't. I told them that they could go ahead and buy their own and my brother's tickets while I thought about it, but my Edad said that ticket sales were final. So, I'm basically holding their deal hostage while I think about it. 

I don't know why I feel so torn about this. When my internship would finish in August, I was planning on just coming back to my university's city and taking it easy before school started. I didn't want to see their faces for a long time. 

But a part of me still misses those family trips. A part of me misses those long car trips where I just stared out the window at the world. Sure, my Nmom would act up (and I still didn't like it), but I never let her ruin a good trip. I could say ""no"" to this, but part of me doesn't want to. 

How can I stop feeling so torn? My initial thought was to refuse, but I feel like I'll regret it if I don't go. Does this mean I should consider going?  "

4nos2d,2,2016-06-12,Go Team Go!,TwilitKing,randomsuperpowers,https://www.reddit.com/r/randomsuperpowers/comments/4nos2d/go_team_go/,"*Marcus was standing at city hall with the rest of the interns and mercenaries that he had roped into being on a superhero team for Chicago. Rahm Emanuel was giving one of his boring, but impassioned speeches over how the heroes were going to help Chicago, when a numb panic began to fill Marcus' mind, 'Oh shit, we didn't make a name for this team. Shit, I better text Jericho and see if he's got any.. No wait I can't text at a public event. Fuck it, time to make it up on the fly.'*

*Behind and beside Marcus is the team themselves and dressed in their superhero outfits, some of which are probably feeling pretty hot since it is 95 degrees and pretty humid on top of that. Marcus eventually relented and let Chris on to the team, but made him sign off a double warrant over his exceptional fragility compared to the others. Thankfully their insurance was covered and they were getting paid pretty well, and would get to work hand in hand with the resources of Chicago PD, so the deal wasn't all that bad.*

*Eventually though, Marcus had to walk up to the mic and introduce the team and cut the ceremonial ribbon to symbolize... something. So the man put on one of his award winning smiles and spoke into the mic,* ""Hello citizens of Chicago, it's me again, Marcus, and my buddy here Rahm has already explained thoroughly that you all are going to have an official hero team to defend Chicago. Isn't that great? Now if only the weather had agreed with us and made today not such a scorcher. Since it is though, I will try and make this as short and sweet as possible for you all. We're going to be entering into a new era for Chicago, Smith Power, and hero teams in general because of our joint efforts to make the streets a safer place. So without further ado, I'd like you all to welcome The Lakeside Defenders as permanent parts of this great city!""

*Marcus cuts the ribbon, and the crowd gives out their applause and such. Is anyone going to talk with the new heroes or with Marcus? Or are people going to take this as a cue to get free food and mingle?*"
4noz00,3,2016-06-12,My Journey On NoFap,Pucho92,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/4noz00/my_journey_on_nofap/,"I've been doing NoFap on and off for a few years now, and it really has done wonders for me. 

The benefits that most people report of when they start doing this is more confidence, energy, and charisma. I've felt these benefits too, and they give me more than enough reason to continue doing this. 
For me though, one of the best benefits that it has and transformed my life over these years, was that **it gave me the drive I needed to go out and do things with my life.**

Before NoFap, I'd usually fap once or twice a day, because I thought it was healthy and that I would stress myself out if I didn't have a release. (In hindsight though, since I was releasing to myself I never really had much drive to go out there and meet girls to make anything happen anyways.) I'd go to my internship, go home and fap, then play video games. I didn't have many friends cause I didn't socialize much, but I was okay with that because at the end of the day I had my PMO, alcohol and video games. Then when I would socialize with people it'd feel forced, and that would stress me out more and lead me to want to depend more on these vices. My POV in life was to just do things that would give me instant gratification.

I don't remember how it was exactly that I found out about NoFap, but I thought it was interesting so I wanted to give it a shot. I do remember throughout my week, I'd start feeling higher highs, and lower lows. I'd have the biggest urge to flirt with girls around me, but then there are days where I would just wanna cry for no reason. I didn't feel so numb to life anymore, and it was scary.

Over time I had to look for other venues to get my dopamine. I would love the dopamine rush I'd get from exercise, so I started doing that more often when I was stressed. I focused more on good habits too, I started cooking more, and studying more. Because those things made me happy. 

Then at some point, **socializing with people didn't feel like work anymore.**

NoFap shifted my mindset from instant gratification, to depending on good habits in life to make myself feel good. Naturally I got away from drinking and video games throughout this process, I didn't feel a need for them anymore.

I love this movement and the community behind it. There are people out there that can really use something like this to get their life back on track, I'm just lucky I stumbled upon this by accident. Thank you for helping enhance my life, and helping me feel like I have a purpose again."

4np5wh,1,2016-06-12,"Me [20F] with my boyfriend [21M] want to see each other during the summer break. However because of my grandparents[late 70's], I am presented with impossible conditions which prevent me from seeing him.",iwantoutofhere4,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4np5wh/me_20f_with_my_boyfriend_21m_want_to_see_each/,"Me and my boyfriend have been dating for a little less than 18 months now. We met and go to college together, and we're extremely attached to each other. During school, we were together all of the time unless we had classes or work. 


However, whenever school ends, we have to go separate ways because our actual homes are about 400 miles away from each other. We skype everyday, but it's clear that it isn't enough. Although the answer is to clearly visit each other on a regular basis, because of my grandparents they have made this extremely difficult and impossible.


During the summer, i live with my grandparents because they happen to live in the state i'm attending school in. I come from a military background, and I've always had issues with my grandparents for numerous reasons. I was raised in an extremely sheltered environment, no sex talks (thank GOD i dated someone as amazing as my boyfriend instead of someone who would take advantage of this because i had NO idea what i was doing), could never go anywhere with friends, no sleepovers, no pets (outside of fish). But despite all of this, i always kind of hoped that they would have some leniency when as i started to transition to become an adult and started making my own decisions. Which obviously isn't the case.


 Their conditions were (or are) essentially that i could not go visit him at all, not even during the day, or in a separate hotel. He had to come visit me , and if he wanted to buy a hotel, i couldn't even stay with him, and i would have to come home a certain time. My grandfathers ignorant reasoning for this is that ""A man does the visiting. He needs to come to you."" This sounds extremely reasonable to traditionalists out there, except my boyfriend is a type 1 diabetic, so he really cant drop his stuff and come visit me on a whim and leaving his home for a couple days is not really safe for him. I told them this, and my grandpa spwed ""WELL I GOT A LOT OF DIABETICS IN THE FAMILY ITS NOT A BIG DEAL"". Like he understood fucking everything about a type 1 diabetic because of his fat ass middle aged cousins.


Last summer, i had A LOT of arguments with my grandparents. The first time my grandfather told me that ignorant shit, i shouted ""SO SHE NEVER VISITED YOU?"" and he said its his car and i don't care and i almost basically started packing until my sister talked me out of it. Last summer I had a job, and i couldn't really quit. I waited until they left for a couple weeks to sneak down and visit him a few times, but after that i had to wait weeks to see him again.


For my birthday, i gave in and asked my boyfriend to come up. This was when we found out about the part where i couldn't sleep at the hotel. His parents flipped out (his mother started crying apparently because she didn't want him alone) and his dad came with him. I told him i'd meet him at the hotel the next day, but my grandfather demanded that he'd meet him and took my keys away so i couldn't leave the day before. This would be fine, except that the hotel he planned on staying with with his father was about an hour or two away. I mean COMPLETELY on the other side of the city. I blew up, but they drove over here and my grandpa handed back my keys IN FRONT OF THEM with a smirk on his face. I did EXACTLY what they asked and it still wasn't fucking enough for them. I have so many bullshit stories go on about the horseshit about my grandparents but i realize this isn't raised by narcissists so i'm going to move on.


So we move on to a year later. We both have internships this year, but essentially we ended up in the exact same situation as last year. My boyfriend asked me not to fight with them, so i've been trying REALLY hard to keep my cool. I was hoping that we could last with just skype calls but I miss him so much. I don't hear any plans of my grandparents leaving for an extended amount of time so i might go a summer without seeing him at all.


It really hard. Everytime we disconnect from each other on skype it hurts. Everytime we say goodnight to each other it hurts. Everytime showgo fucks up it hurts. Its hard for us to play games together since my laptop is ass and its hard to find games that run for toasters. I was inspired to make this post because he bought me overwatch (I PLAN TO PAY HIM BACK) just so we could have stuff to do together. But it basically is lag city on my computer so we were crushed.


I don't know how to confront my grandparents again. I don't know if i really want to. But I cant live like this. Everything's going right in my life, I finally got an internship (which is HUGE for me), but I can't seem to look past the fact that I can't even use that money i earn to go out with my boyfriend. Or go on vacation together like all the couples i see on my snapchat story. It isn't fair. 


So me and my boyfriend are wondering how do we approach this? Is there a way i'm not thinking about out of this? Even if there isn't, i would also love to hear advice on to how to make this any easier.


Some answers to some questions you guys might ask, just because i didn't know where to fit them in my story.


**But what if your grandparents put these conditions down because they don't know this guy and need to know him first?**


This isn't the case at all. My grandfather told me this the day before my birthday but i knew it was horseshit. My sister has been dating her fiance for almost 5 years (the only reason they haven't married was because of school), they're under the same conditions. He came for Christmas this year, and at the dinner before our prayer, my grandpa said ""I'm glad to have the family here....and [sisters boyfriend]."" It was awkward and disgusting, because he's been at our Christmas for the past years with no problems at all.


My grandmother also came up to me and asked my about my boyfriend. She said his name wrong (not like pronouncing it wrong, like a completely different name that started with the same letter) and i tried to correct her meekly and then she told me she didn't care what is name was and what i was going to do if he got me pregnant and kept implying that he was going to leave me if i ever get pregnant. Me and my boyfriend had our discussions about sex. I'm on birth control, and we use condoms, and we're EXTREMELY careful and know the risks. She knows this, because i tell her this every time she asks. But she still says crazy shit like this, trying to convince me that having a boyfriend is the worst thing that's ever happened to me.

**What about your parents?**

My mom is not in my life. I lost contact with her a long time ago, but if it means anything, one of the main reasons my parents divorced because of my grandparents. Their last argument was my mother trying to fight to keep us here at home rather than take us to our grandparents. 

My sister was told a story from my grandparents (assuming after my birthday outburst) about my dad running away with a girl in college to California, but it didn't work out so he had to ask them to fly him back. I'm sure my dad will take side with my grandparents because he's convinced the same will happen to me. I wouldn't run off with anyone if i could just visit my boyfriend every few weekends. I'm pretty sure my grandparents asked her to tell me this to change my thinking but it made me even more justified with my decision to leave to be honest. 

**HURRRRR WHY DONT YOU JUST MOVE OUT HURRRR**

Last summer, After i told my boyfriend about what happened, He  almost immediately said to come live with him. He was looking up places for me to work that was close so i didn't worry about having a car( the car was owned by my grandfather. He said that he'd put the car in my name after i get A's and B's but it turns out that he only uses the car as leverage.) We even went as far as putting my name on his lease (he had an internship at the time so he had an 1b apartment). I would've gone, but eventually i realized that i had a job, and that if i left i'd be essentially cut off and couldn't go to school either (I'd pay out of state fees.) So it didn't work out.

This summer, i didn't think i was going to have an internship, so i had no money, no job, and i'm pretty sure my boyfriends parents didn't want me to live with my boyfriend so i didn't pry into the idea. I got an internship in the city close to home. So i decided to take that instead and hope for the best. It's not working as good as I thought. 

**We need more information about your grandparents**

I have a lot of demons that involve my grandparents. I sound like a typical spoiled teenager when i talk about them yes, but they have never been good people to me, my mother, my siblings, or many strangers, and that's all i'm able to share.

**tl;dr**: Me and my boyfriend can't see each other, because my grandparents put an impossible restriction on me. It's difficult to comply because my boyfriend traveling under these conditions is a risk and gets other people involved and i'd much rather visit him."
4np799,1,2016-06-12,I proved myself to my co-workers and it feels amazing.,throwaway582487,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/4np799/i_proved_myself_to_my_coworkers_and_it_feels/,"Throwaway, because I'd rather not have anyone from work accidentally find this!

I'm a journalism student who fucked up my first year of college. I wasn't ready, and my GPA was an astounding 1.9. It killed me to see how far I had fallen, since my high school GPA was 3.7. Because I don't come from a family made of money, I took time off college and focused on working on my career until I could finally pay for college. 

That was 2012. I moved states away in 2013 to reset my life and it's the best decision I've made. I had already had one news station job on my belt back home, but I actively did what I could do work in another newsroom. Obviously I had to find less-than-stellar jobs in the process, but last spring I landed my current job -- a killer entry-level job in a large news market. Not counting interns, I'm one of three people who was hired without a degree. It was a nice self-esteem booster and I'm still proud of that.

Last month, I pitched a story idea that I knew would be a hit on our website. It took a few weeks, but I got everything together and published the piece this past week. I knew the final product would be good, but not *this* good. Literally each day I've come in since publishing it, I've had multiple come up and tell me how great they thought it was, and how the people who run the website/social media are also amazed. I absolutely hate attention, but I have so much confidence in my writing that I figured I could spark a change in how people saw my talent.

For at least half a year or more, I've wanted to work in the digital department. I've been going on various shoots and covering different events locally all of this year to kinda show my interest, but I had never written anything for them yet. Again, the confidence I have in my writing sort of just propelled all of this.

The guy who runs the web emailed me and said he wants to talk to me when I'm in next. My direct-boss, who copy edited the piece, immediately told me I should apply for the web after finishing the edit. Various people *in* the web have also told me how great my piece is. I don't know what to do with people being this nice to me, but I also realize that if I ever wanted to get anywhere in this business, I have to not just put myself out there, I have to *throw* myself out there.

And I did just that. From what various co-workers have already told me, it sounds like I'm on the verge of getting promoted or being at least seriously considered for one. I start college in the fall for the first time since 2012, and I'm possibly going to be working a job typically only grads land. A lot of things in my life don't seem to go my way, but I can't lie and say this just feels so fucking good.

I'm sorry if I sound cocky or like a know-it-all. Believe me when I say I could not be the opposite. I'm just very, very proud of myself right now, especially when I look at how far I've come in such a short amount of time. 

Thanks for reading."
4npd1r,2,2016-06-12,very anxious over impending life decisions in college,Toriningen,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/4npd1r/very_anxious_over_impending_life_decisions_in/,"A lot of things are going on this summer. It's going to be a lot, so sorry.

I'm lost in life and don't know what to do. I'm panicking over choosing a path in life and what to do for my future and time in college (sophomore). I feel like I'm running out of time, especially with important decisions coming in a matter of days.

I'm undecided in major since I don't know what I want and don't trust myself to make a good decision. I don't know all of the possible experiences of careers enough, and no amount of ONET, googling, and asking people has helped me make a decision. I don't want to make a decision because I'll know I'll do it wrong. But I can't wait, or I'll lose my options.

For example, my university is extremely impacted. Fall registration is in two days, and the major I choose decides what classes and summer class I pick (or if I'll even go to school for summer/fall at my uni). Delaying a semester isn't a good option either as I still can't find my answers within that time.

I've thought about some careers and computer science is one option I'm attracted to (for the $$$) yet skeptical for many reasons. Because of impaction, it's incredibly difficult to get in. I'd be willing to put in the effort if I knew I wanted this, but I don't know. I have a bad feeling from prior experience that either I'll suck and can't get in, or I'd do ok but not like it anyways. 

If I want to go for CS, I need to decide within this week or give up. It's the last week to sign up for summer Calc II, which I'm hardly confident of getting a good grade at or even passing. In just a few days, I need to make decisions that could cut off paths in my life.

I've found I simply can't solve this with logic. But I don't trust myself to make a ""gut"" decision. What my professors suggest is to go after my interests and passion. What my friend says is to go after CS and get money so I can pursue what I want. There's other options like pharmacy, soil and plant scientist, engineer, finance, but they all seem either crappy for the time and costs, or something that might make me miserable. 

I might even be doing it wrong according to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/4lgoij/do_you_bitch_online_about_your_degree_being/). This post makes me uncomfortable, but I keep going back to it because it's true. I don't even know, there are too many ways to take my future, and it's coming too soon. 

People say I'm young at 18 and I got time to explore, but I call BS. Why does my years now not matter? I don't have time or the resources to explore. I'd need to be in the major to even get the right resources to learn more about what it's really like (say, internship). 

I don't enjoy my life and myself in my current state. It'd be nice if I could change for the better. Except I don't know how, what, and I'm resistant to change. 

Sorry if this is long and messy. Thank you for reading. "

He’s a total piece of shit, in and out of work. I mean, I’m not an intern anymore, and he still expects me to do all his errands for him! “Roberts, pick up my dry-cleaning!” “Roberts, come park my car for me!” “Roberts, the sun’s in my eyes, go up there and extinguish it for me!” Okay, I made the last one up but you get the point.  
  
Man, I’m telling you, if it wasn’t for the fact that this place pays better than any other job I could get, I would have quit long ago. Oh well, life could be worse. I do have a date planned tonight, and she seems like a lot of fun! Oh shit, my boss is calling me over. I reluctantly walk over to where he’s standing, and he looks a little frustrated. “Yes, Mr. Lewis?” I ask, knowing that’ll he’ll probably want me to do a favour for him.  
  
“Roberts, I need you to do something for me.” Called it. “It’s my wife and I’s anniversary, and she’s booked a hotel room for us. Unfortunately, I need to meet with a few clients, and it’s absolutely urgent. Now, I can’t take the time to call her, because I can’t waste that time. So you have to call her, understand? Let me give you her number.”  
  
I hold back the urge to grin, “Sorry sir, but my phone’s being repaired. Looks like you’ll have to ask someone else.” I try to walk away, but he grabs my shoulder. “Not so fast, son. If you can’t call her, then you’ll have to tell her in person.” He fumbles around in his pocket for a few seconds before pulling out a card. “Here’s the room key. She’s at the Blue Lion, Room 45, got it? Now hurry up and get going!”  
  
And just like that, he walks away, leaving me with the card in my hand. Sighing and mumbling, I walk out of the building and begin walking. Great, guess I have to pass on my date tonight. Did I already say fuck my boss? Because fuck my boss, fuck him to hell and back. The hotel must be about an hour away, and I may have taken my time, just to make sure his wife gives Mr. Lewis an extra large chewing out later. Eventually, I make it to the hotel’s front doors. I’ve got to admit, I feel slightly underdressed, compared to some of the people here.  
  
After I walk around some more, checking out some of the expensive looking architecture. Eventually, I decide I’ve had enough, and just want to get back home as soon as possible. I walk up the stairs and find the right floor. Checking the card, I look for the right number, and after a good few minutes walking, I find number 45. Sliding the card in the door I open it slowly.  
  
Damn, this is one lavish room! The drawn curtains are made of red velvet, and the carpets are obviously made of some other expensive material I’ve never heard of. I didn’t have time to notice the rest of the architecture, as one sight took my attention away from all the others. There, lying naked on the bed, was my boss's wife! And if that wasn’t enough to make me horny, she was wearing a blindfold, and had some handcuffs and rope on the nightstand next to her.  
  
Oh my god! I remember meeting her at one of the office parties, and thinking she was beautiful, but now? She was one of the most attractive women on the planet! What should I do? Should I tell her who I am? Or, should I pay Mr. Lewis back for his years of abuse, by doing the one thing that would hurt him most. Fucking his wife. My dick seems to already have convinced the rest of my body, as I begin to disrobe, and walk up to her alluring body.  
  
Once I’m naked, I stride over to her, and place my head between her thighs. Grabbing two gentle handfuls of her ass, I pull her pussy towards my face, and begin to plant soft kisses around the edge of it. The heat from her inner thighs radiates on my face as my lips brush against the outskirts of hers. Mmm, sorry Mr. Lewis, but somebody has to take care of your wife!

#Expect spoilers in this section if you have not watched the episode!

The [**Armed Detective Company**](http://bungostraydogs.wikia.com/wiki/Armed_Detective_Company) is a company that deals with crimes that may be too violent or too difficult for regular police. Most of the members have their own special power, which are just simply called 'Abilities.'

[Atsushi Nakajima](http://bungostraydogs.wikia.com/wiki/Atsushi_Nakajima) - Young man who has white hair, with a single strand going down the side of his face.

Initially he is not aware or in any sort of control of his ability. 

[Osamu Dazai](http://bungostraydogs.wikia.com/wiki/Osamu_Dazai) - Saved by Atsushi close to the beginning of episode 1. Suicidal, he was trying to drown himself. Very lighthearted/playful, despite his suicidal tendencies. Well dressed and has brown wavy hair.

I don't know what the hell I just watched, even after seeing it twice. Did they have an intern write Arya's arc for the past couple of episodes? 

A quick synopis of Arya's history with the Faceless Men, [including the TWoW chapter ""Mercy"".](http://web.archive.org/web/20150216163605/http://www.georgerrmartin.com/excerpt-from-the-winds-of-winter/)

**bookArya**: Her first FM target is a merchant/insurance agent. It is sanctioned by the FM. Her second kill is a Night's Watchman by the name of Dareon. This is not sanctioned. Her punishment is to drink a bitter concoction, every day, leaving her blind. She regains her sight after proving that she doesn't need her eyesight to defend herself. Specifically, the kindly old man sneaks up on her. Arya is able to see him by warging into a cat that's hiding in the rafters. She parries the kindly old man's blow, thus proving herself. (It seems that Arya isn't actually the skilled fighter that the kindly old man believes her to be.) 

But bookArya doesn't learn the intended lesson. She doesn't care about the agenda of the FM and she doesn't want to be restricted to sanctioned-only kills. In the ""Mercy"" chapter of TWoW, Arya spots Raff the Sweetling in a crowded theater. Raff is still on her list. Arya seduces him and kills him.

**showArya**: Her first FM target is a merchant/insurance agent. It is sanctioned by the FM. Her second kill is Ser Meryn Trant. This is not sanctioned. Her punishment is instant blindness. Her eyes are returned by drinking of the same poisoned water that's given to those seeking the ""gift"" of death. She is instructed to kill Lady Crane. She refuses her orders, publicly reveals the truth to Lady Crane and goes into hiding. Last week, we (ostensibly) saw the Waif attempt to kill Arya.

**(End synopsis)**

Clearly, these are many similarities between bookArya and showArya - but the differences provide a drastic change of tone in Arya's arc.

1. showArya has a tone of regret and redemption. She has realized that her hate consumed her, made her into something that she doesn't want to be. As much as Arya wanted to be a cold-blooded killer, she's not. She wants to fight evil and only evil. She refuses to kill Lady Crane. In /r/gameofthrones, many people are claiming that Arya passed a test. There's a bit of disagreement on the exact nature of this test. Some claim that Arya's test was the mercy/compassion that she showed to Lady Crane. Others claim that it was not Arya's test at all - JH knew that Arya would fail, but wanted to test the Waif. The Waif failed when she twisted the knife in Arya's gut. The Waif showed that she was incapable of following orders, that she preferred vengeance to justice, that she lets her anger get the better of her.

2. bookArya has a tone of vengeance. She was given a different sort of test. Her compassion isn't tested - it's her ability to follow orders that's tested. We see that Arya is still driven by vengeance, that she has little regard for the FM's rules or even her own life. She risks it all to kill Raff. Since we only have the single chapter, we can't assume that bookArya won't have a moment of regret/redemption - but things certainly don't seem to be headed in that direction.

Regardless of the reasons behind showArya's refusal to kill Lady Crane, the fact remains that bookArya's situation is entirely different. bookArya has continued to kill people on her list, even after being warned not to. But where does all this lead? How can these two divergent arcs be brought together again?

Now it's theory time, right? Here's where I whip out some elegant hypothesis which ties all of this together and predicts Arya's arc. Just one problem. I don't have one. And I haven't seen one. All I've got is an ugly thought or three:

a. I think the show made things a bit softer and more poetic for Arya. I think they want us to cheer for Arya, so they've turned her into a truly ""good"" person. bookArya is not portrayed as such - she is still focused on her list. 

b. I think bookWaif won't be so personally invested in Arya's downfall. The show turned showWaif into Arya's nemesis. bookWaif is much less violent, she seems passively hardhearted rather than passionately hateful. If there is a showdown with bookWaif, I don't think it will be as personal as it is in the show. There won't be a knife-twist in the belly or a chase through the city streets. Instead, bookWaif will track bookArya to a dark location, where bookArya will use the cat-in-the-rafter trick (possibly with a rat in the sewer?).


c. I think bookArya will end up in a similar position that showArya is in - being hunted by the FM. 

d. I think there's a good possibility that showArya will have the help of JH. I don't think bookArya will get any help. 

e. I think bookArya's murder of Raff will be a much bigger ""deal breaker"" than showArya's mercy to Lady Crane. Arya will be on her own, truly the lone wolf. 


**tl;dr:** bookArya has continued to perform unsanctioned kills, even after being punished. OP has provided a bunch of rambling thoughts and would like your input on bookArya's arc, how her story might resolve and why the show chose a different path for Arya.

I am constantly on the road traveling and meeting with clients and working with them on various engagements. This Co-Op will extend in to the upcoming school year, so I won't be attending classes this fall. Afterwards, I have an tax internship lined up with PWC, starting next January, during busy season. 

I just finished my 4th year out of the 5 year program. However, because of these internships, I will be graduating a year later than originally planned. So when I graduate, it will have taken me six years instead of 5, and I'll be close to 25.
As someone who is going for the CPA License, I am well aware that my state requires 2,000 hours of relevant experience. However, I was told that my internships and co-op will count towards meeting that requirement. By the end of my internship at PWC, I will have met that requirement as I will have over 3,000 hours of accounting experience after doing 3 internships. I heard stories of people who have passed the exams, but have had difficulty finding jobs due to lack of experience. Has anyone had any trouble meeting the work experience requirement? Did internships count towards that requirement?"
4nruvn,5,2016-06-12,An Important News Bulletin,Channel_20_News_Net,Askasurvivor,https://www.reddit.com/r/Askasurvivor/comments/4nruvn/an_important_news_bulletin/,"It's that time again redditors! Time to deliver another Channel 20 News bulletin. Channel 20, hard news from hard reporters on hard times delivered by one hard news anchor. I'm Buck Johnson, and this is the way the wasteland is.

Our top story tonight centers around the surprise war ignited between the Lunar Technocracy and the quadruple threat of the AMR, FCC, FR, and the barbarous city state of New Golgotha. The war first kicked off several days ago when the FCC assassinated one of the super-intelligent AI's known as the Borsons during his peaceful diplomatic mission to FCC Smith. In retaliation, the Lunar Technocracy has invented and distributed numerous kits that allow people to test for the Voice, a mysterious and quite possibly dangerous genetic defect that turns regular god-fearing wastelanders into psychopathic killing machines. Parents of suspected Voice possessing children are advised to remain calm and aim carefully in case the crazy mutant powers of their children allow them to manipulate your minds into unconsciously shooting normal desirable loved ones. The purge is on people. Stay safe out there. 

Following up on our top story, I'm also receiving reports from out west that the Borson War, as it's being called, has been received with ""pleasant surprise"" by Undertown's many black market arms dealers, and promises to last well into the Summer according to our market analysts. An upturn that will surly send company values in the area through the roof for this quarter.

Next up for tonight: Anable June's secret compound, that illusive wonderland of mad science and mad people. We've all heard the stories of night doctors being deployed to retrieve stolen augmentations and of gargantuan abominations prowling the coastal waters, but until now no one has ever been able to discern where these technological horrors come from. That's why Channel 20 is sitting down with an exclusive live interview of our esteemed guest, one Dr. Warnik Odinson, who reportedly knows the location of Anabel's secret compound. How are things on your end doctor?

""You know, if you people let me go now some of you might actually survive."" 

Dr. Odinson, I'll be frank, we want to know just where Anabel June's lab is. What insights can you provide us?

""Piss off- *sounds of electrical current running in the background* ""Aaaaaaaaiiiieeeee! *pant, pant* listen you idiots, *pant* even if I knew exactly where the compound was, I couldn't tell you. It's not even a matter of me not wanting to, I physically cannot tell you anything Ms. June doesn't want me to say, so-""

Can you at least give our viewers a hint as to where the compound is Dr. Odinson? 

""Stop calling me that! Warnik Odinson is dead, I'm his clone! I keep telling you people. I wouldn't know where the compound is on a map, I work in hydroponics for the gods's sake! And even if I did know where it was I couldn't tell you, I- wait, wait no, no not again!"" *Sounds of screaming and more electrical noise goes on for a while before deteriorating into static*

Looks like I'll have to check back with Dr. Odinson after we re-establish a solid connection. Moving on with our followup segment for tonight: Last issue we recorded a tape of AMR Co-President Bill ""quick and dirty"" Jameson performing several sexual acts with a young woman who we are now being told was serving as a warrant officer in the military detachment sent to guard him after the Philadelphia attacks. Although we threatened to release the tapes to the wider public, Mr. Jameson has refused to so much as provide us with an interview in exchange for all copies made. That's why I'm here live with our roving reporter, action man Jack Nellson and a squad of highly trained and highly underpaid Channel 20 interns. Jack you're on the air. 

Thanks Buck! The scene behind me is AMR rail line 243B, which our insider sources say will be the line on which Co-President Jameson's personal train car will be traveling down in a few short moments, and it's here that we hope to nab the Co-President and perhaps some of his senior staff for an exclusive interview with Channel 20 news. 

Fascinating stuff Jack, let's go to the live feed our interns have set up along the train tracks. 

*Image cuts to the grainy video feed of a rail line in the middle of a wooded area. Whistles can be heard in the distance and a steam engine rounds a bend into view. Then an explosion goes off several yards in front of the train, mangling the rails beyond recognition. The train continues at full speed, but lights go on on its undercarriage as what looks like a pair of emergency rails are fired out from underneath the engine. The rails land on the gap made by the explosion and clamp themselves into the ground automatically, allowing the train to pass over unharmed while noticeably picking up speed.*

Buck, I'm sorry to report that it looks like our surprise interview sessions will have to be postponed. The interns here will try to drive ahead of the train in a few hours to cut it off again, but now that AMR security has been alerted I think their success likelihood has been drastically diminished. Back to you Buck. 

Well that's just a crying shame then. Say Jack, I'm told you actually saw the tape before we distributed it. Is that correct Jack? 

Yes it certainly is Buck, and knowing that the average wastelander has no way to actually play the DVDs we released them on, let me just take a moment to paint you all a picture using my experience as an amateur pornography artist myself. *""Jack"" is shown getting into a jeep with several masked gunmen as he talks. The jeep is speeding off as the sound of AMR artillery fire is heard in the distance* Now in my opinion, Mr. Jameson put on a spectacular performance for those of you that do have a DVD player, even more impressive considering he didn't know he was being filmed at the time! Good tempo, respectable variety, strong finisher, Jameson truly is nothing if not a showman. May I please see my family now Buck?

Later, Jack, later. As a final rap up for tonights show, a local church received a visit from what the traveling pastor there is calling an act of angelic visitation. The angel was seen during a sunday morning mass last week, publicly stabbing a respected churchgoer. Earlier on, our team of highly trained and highly underpaid interns were tracking the angel and cornered her for an exclusive interview with Channel 20 News. After every possible avenue of escape had been exhausted, the Angel commented that she identified herself as one ""TsMK1"" and that she ""just wanted to be left alone"" and had ""no idea why anyone was following her. Please, I just want to be alone"". So behave yourselves kids. And maybe next Sunday an angel just might come and stab you in church. Truly magical.

That's all for tonight folks. I'm your news anchor Buck Johnson, and this has been Channel 20 Wasteland News. Hard facts driven from a hard life that's hardly worth the hard work it takes to live hardily in it anymore. Bye now!"
4ns43m,3,2016-06-12,Memoirs of a Computer Technician,ThePaperShredder2,paydaycirclejerk,https://www.reddit.com/r/paydaycirclejerk/comments/4ns43m/memoirs_of_a_computer_technician/,"The Memoirs of a Computer Technician
Jon sat there on his computer, wondering which questions he should put on his company survey. He decided that browsing 4chan would be a good idea, however his boss was an androgeneous pansexual demisexual trans-racial lizard zerf, so he was worried he might offend zerf. Jon needed to put a survey on socialjustice.gov and also praise their mistress and savior (as in wall street whore) Shilllary Killary Clitoris Clinton, and her husband and her husband's step-wife, Shill Clitoris Clinton and Lewinsky Clitoris Clinton. Jon straggled and knocked down his copy of ""Why Women are Scientifically stronger than men"" by Tina Fey and Anita Sarkeesian Fey who got married in a lesbian marriage because Obama Llama Adminstration. Jon then accidentally spilled some apple juice from his Manny Pardo sippy cup onto his keyboard. The computer warped and had a icon of a trash can called ""Your Waifu"" pop up. Jon was spooked, and clicked it slowly. Jon then founded all of Hillary Clinton's deleted emails. Jon then had a spasm and heard the voice of Donald Trump.

""Jon, we have to make America great again, go to the gas chambers, you will find a man who may help you""

Jon, using his 9 year knowledge of stealth from the Buddha Zen temple thanks to 9 years of staring at a wall training about something about suffering and divorcing from reality. He stealthed his way to the gas chambers to find Bernie Sanders strung from his entrails.

""Hillary, she lied....the trade treaties......they are taking away jobs....everyone is unemployed.....Israel owns everything with China.....Jon....take this key....""

Sanders then vomited a literal skeleton key, as in it was his own bone. Jon took the key and watched Sanders dying in the future he did not believe in. Jon then grabbed his Manny Pardo sippy cup, and knew what to do. He used the key on his sippy cup to unlock a secret compartment that had a VHS tape. How it fit into a sippy cup? None of our damn business. Jon then pushed the VHS into the last VHS player in existence because Disney destroyed the others for Blu-Gay Ray. Richard appeared and told instruction to summon Manny Pardo. You need five pounds of butter, a very thick tortilla, some tiger eyeballs, and pump action shotgun, preferably Mossberg, and a Colt Python. 

Jon then donned his Hoxton mask, because this entire time, he was the successor of Derek Ray, the voice actor and live action actor for Houston in the Payday™ universe. He called himself ""Texas"". 

Texas stealthed through Hillary's kebab party serving the finest chicken kebab. Jihadi Jon and Obama Bin Laden were busy screwing children, so Texas made his move and stole a Colt Python out of Obama's genitals. He then made his way to the buffet and found the world's biggest butter tortilla, very thick too. He used his silenced M9 and took out the milita surrounding it. He then put the entire damn thing into a body bag and stealthed his way out. He then stealthed into Mitt Romeny's Bengal Tiger zoo, with a memorial of Churchill for all the great things he has done, here are all of Churchill's contributions to society:

Dying

That is it.

He then used his dagger, forged from Almir's beard, and stabbed the Tiger in the heart. He then scooped out its eyeballs with a spoon. Using his Cleaner Aced skill from the pre-beta skill build, Texas didn't have to pay any cleaner costs.

Texas then stealthed his way to Shill Clitoris Clinton's intern concubine harem lounge to get the last Mossberg in existence. 

""HALT"" Shill Clinton, ""Lewinsky, babe, summon the Zodiac Killer to take care of Texas...or should I say, JON!""

COVER BLOWN

Things went loud, luckily he had his concealed carry minigun thanks to previous military service in the middle of Africa to gas some poor niggers who did nothing wrong and then steal all their gold.

But then, the Zodiac Killer, Ted Cruz, manifested. He was vicious, you could smell the raw flesh and maple syrup from him. He then summoned his Mountie minions.

Texas sprayed his minigun at them, however his minigun jammed, because his minigun relied on a thermal cooling system. 

""This broke dick piece of shit minigun""

Texas then was face to face with the Zodiac Killer. There was only one thing to do. He had to rush B.

Texas rushed B as fast as he possibly could with the Cherry 4 detonating chewing gum, now with extra boom in every bite! The Zodiac Killer gained on him, but Texas and Zodiac Killer agreed on one thing, fuck the gays. So the Zodiac Killer committed honorable suicide because Obama and B was nuked harder than Hiroshima. The shotgun was there, but Shill then summoned Elizabeth Warren with her clan of 'Native Americans', as in 1% blood because a settler raped one of them since no women. Her feminist babbling was too much.

Texas was downed! 

Texas needed help, so using his training he got in the middle of Africa, he used his ECM to play ""Loud Nigra"" on full volume.

The KKK heard the nigger call, and then came in, stabbing Elizabeth Warren with double edged spears. 

Texas stealthed out, and then turned on to channel 110, Foodies Channel, where ""Cooking Satantic Concotions with Richard"" was playing.

In reality, Richard wasn't really cooking, it was just for trademark and branding reasons. It was just a Japanese girl in an apron and Richard mask speaking Engrish teaching you how to summon Manny Pardo in this particular episode.

After enduring the mispronounciation of ""L"" as ""R"". Texas finished the concoction. He then added the final ingredient, bleach, and it just so happens he is a bleach dealer, so he has a ton to spare. 

And so Manny Pardo manifested in all his thick skinned glory.

""Texas, I was born with thick skin. Now we must stop Shillary.""

Together they fought through the hoardes of liberals and conservatives, every last one. Eventually they got to Shillary's door, where they had to fight the guards, DEBBY SCHULTZ AND GEORGE SOROS, CLINTON CRONIES!!! Along with an army of Israeli Jewish merchants with Uzi's and Usuries.

Texas tried 'loud Nigra', and the KKK attacked.

However the Israeli Jews bribed the KKK.

Texas shouted ""I thought Jesus was your god, not bloody money!""

The KKK didn't care, they never even followed their religion anyways.

Money was this world's only god now, and it was wrong, Pardo is and always should be. 

Pardo summoned the powers of the Ogrelord, Shrek, and Shrek violently threw the shekels away and shouted ""WHAT ARE YE DOING IN ME SWAMP, LADDIES!?!?"". Shrek then ate all the Jews and Klansmen alive. It was just Soros and Schultz.

Then, AN ARMY OF LAWYERS.

Dreamworks was sued by them and Shrek's IP was confiscated. Shrek was now a Clinton crony.

Pardo knew he had to do one thing, he must sacrifice himself again, for the greater good. He majestically dual wielded his Colt Python revolver and trunk shotgun and shouted ""LONG LIVE THICK SKIN"" and died in battle, taking out Soros and Schultz. Texas knelt near Pardo's corpse, as Pardo said as his last words:

""Sometimes, I hate these political jokes""

And his thick skin turned into a golden trunk shotgun, which Texas shall use to slay Hillary.

Texas walked in, and Hillary was sitting there with a smug face, with the semen of Wall Street donors all over her old overaged face, today was her 103rd birthday. 

""I've been expecting you"" she said after removing a money dildo from her festering decaying vagina, with spiders coming out may I add.

Texas grabbed his gun and tried to shoot at Clinton, but Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan meat shields absorbed all the blows. Texas decided he must fight fire with fire. Texas got a safe and drill, but it was no ordinary safe and drill. It was a limited edition Almir safe and drill. And he opened up a common Almir Listo! Almir's greed however seduced Clinton and they created spawnlings. The spawnlings were bastard midget versions of Bo Andersson, Ulf's greedy ass brother. They kept throwing flashbangs, yelling ""Your opinion, my choice"". Texas couldn't see anything.

""Give up"" said Shillary.

Texas then grabbed his ""Mom's Spaghetti"", and ate it. He felt the power of Mom's Spaghetti. Like how Eminem blew their own daughters.

Texas then went in one man army style with his trunk shotgun and terminated Paul Ryan and Mitt Romney. He then had his gun pointed at Shillary.

But Shillary, like the greedy whore she is, ate the golden shotgun, so she could sell the shit for later. She then said:

""I am not who you think I am, I am actually...""

AXEL STONE, THE MIAMI MUTILATOR

Texas was shocked, stunned, and stunned, shocked, but mostly confused.

""But...how did you create spawnlings and...."" Texas said

""I am gender fluid"" said Axel Stone

""That makes no sense in the foggiest manner you blithering idiot"" exclaimed Texas

""Mind your pronouns, shitlord"" said Axel Stone

Axel Stone used his mutilator round kick and drop kicked Texas to the ground with his cloaker army.

Texas was kill.

Axel Stone then said how this was a time for love and kindness, and where we must respect people of all their sick perversions and delusions of reality. He also said Undertale and FNAF were video games. He said it was a time for understanding, and it is a time for love and China having all the jobs. He said everyone's name was important and other SJW shit while shafting workerse.

A deadly man was manifested before him, it was none other than the grim killer himself. He then said to Axel Stone:

""My name...is not important"" said Not Important

Not Important and his army of bolsheviks attacked Axel Stone and his army of Freddy pillows. Not Important then grabbed Axel Stone by the neck and said 

""Undertale is not a game""

""NOOOOOOO"" shouted Axel Stone

""FNAF is not a game""

""NOOOOOOOOO"" shouted Axel Stone

Axel Stone then exploded into a bunch of pieces or something, who writes this again? Oh yeah, me.

From that day forward, the USSAR was formed, and Scott Cawthon, creator of FNAF, was lynched. 


But it was all a part of Bane's master plan, of crashing the Clinton campaign, WITH NO SURVIVORS!!!!

4ns4hd,3,2016-06-12,My partner doesn't want to leave the house except to go to work and to go to the liquor store... Advice on how to get her outside???,ToshLegend,BPDlovedones,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/4ns4hd/my_partner_doesnt_want_to_leave_the_house_except/,"Let me start by saying that I completely understand why she doesn't want to go out (she's tired from working and I know how that is. And I feel the same).

But I would still like to go out in general. How about going for a short drive? How about going to a movie?
Both sound tiring when u work, I completely understand!
Well then how about going to the park and laying around on our hammock?

How about bbq-ing in the park and being in our hammock?
How about going to a baseball game? (All things we can do sitting down) and all things she has said NO to.

So alright, I completely understand that she's tired. I am too.

So we can stay in and order some take out. Guess what? She doesn't want to! She wants me to cook and guess what too?
All we can watch is chick flicks that are on TV (so basically only movies SHE LIKES that are on TV right now).

So as you can imagine all we watch are movies about dancing or romantic comedies (ur ""step up"" and Tue sequels followed by all those cheese Katherine higel movies [is that even how her name is spelled!?]) But I am going insane with the constant staying in. She drinks everyday and of course won't let me open the curtains during the day so what is a weekend together like:

Its like this:
-we watch romantic comedy after romantic comedy, after romantic comedy. For 12 hours. In between she gets drunk and passes out. Then wakes up again and repeats. Sometimes the movie is played many times on a day and she will SIT AND WATCH THW SAME MOVIE TWICE IN THE SAME DAY. When I leave the room she asks why I left the room and why I'm not spending time with her. If I have to see ""*The intern*"" for a THIRD TIME TODAY, in the dark, I am going to loose all hope in humanity, haha (nervous laugh)

So whats the good part of all this?
Well, she has made GREAT PROGRESS AS OF LATE! And she NO LONGER HAS FITS Nor yells at me (she's on 200mg of Zoloft, the perfect dosage for her) and there's a peace here that we didn't have before (and I am GREATFUL for it! Believe me!!!) 

But... 
This whole *Let's shut the curtains while I sleep all day and  force u to watch ""13 going on 30"" over and over, I just ... Idk!
I love her so I am willing to put but with this until we are able to work out a compromise or maneuver this into the right direction.

So...?
Anyone else have a similar experience?
If u do/did what did u do?"
4ns96l,1,2016-06-12,I [22 M] and my girlfriend [21 F] just split up and I have no idea how to handle it,Throwaway22918,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4ns96l/i_22_m_and_my_girlfriend_21_f_just_split_up_and_i/,"We dated for 18 months. She is the most beautiful and thoughtful person I have ever met. When we both met, we were virgins and I was planning on saving myself for marriage. After  some time together, I decided to give myself to her completely. It was freeing; being myself and engaging in a love that I didn't expect to find until later in life. We understood each other and connected on a deep, emotional level. She made my college experience so amazing and I still wouldn't trade a moment with her for anything.

We split up last week because I graduated and am moving to a new city while she has another year of college ahead of her. In my heart I know it was the right thing to do because balancing a new career in a new city with a long distance girlfriend seemed daunting. I still believe this to be true even though I am now having second thoughts.

We have stayed in contact even FaceTiming a few days ago. I'm an emotional wreck and I can't stop thinking about her. She has started an internship in a new city and has been going out with her new coworkers and new friends. I can't stop picturing her with other guys and having fun while I'm alone with nothing. I have never been in love before and never been through a breakup. My parents are more religious than me and don't know that we ever had sex. I feel like I need to hide how distraught I am around them because they'll raise questions about how serious we actually were.

Maybe I'm just writing this because it's cathartic but I would also appreciate the advice from others who have been in a similar situation. How long will these feelings last? Should I continue to stay in contact with her? 

Thank you all in advance; I appreciate it more than you all know
   
**tl;dr**: My first love and I split up for circumstantial reasons. We both feel lost."
4nsfxc,732,2016-06-12,He wasn't the maintenance guy,leah012345,LetsNotMeet,https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/4nsfxc/he_wasnt_the_maintenance_guy/,"My friend frequents this thread and suggested I tell my creepy story here (23F currently, BTW), and this story happened last summer when I was still in college and living in an apartment. 

I had two other roommates who lived with me. My one roommate Ally was originally from a city about 45 minutes from our school, so she went home a lot on weekends. My other roommate, Kate, and I were both from out of state, so we never really went home. 

So summer rolls around, and Ally accepted an internship in her home-town and left for the summer. So it was just me and Kate. We both had internships in town and worked 40 hours a week, so we didn’t really see each other except on weekends.

My apartment complex was large, and had an open layout, so everyone’s front doors were accessible from outside, you didn’t have to be buzzed in or anything. We lived on the first floor. We also had a lot of friends who lived in our same complex, we would often leave our doors unlocked during the day when we were home incase anyone popped in to say hi. 

It was a Friday, which meant I didn’t have to go into work until noon. All the executives had meetings in the morning and since I was an intern, I wasn’t required to be there. Kate, however, still left at her usual time of 8:30, leaving the door unlocked, nothing uncommon about that. She knew I would be up soon, plus it was 8:30am, what could happen?

I was getting ready for work in my bathroom with the door closed around 10am when I heard our front door swing open. I figured it must have been one of my friends wanting to borrow something or Kate had left her lunch here. I waited a minute for my friend to yell my name or raid my fridge, but I didn’t hear anything. I suddenly got a very uneasy feeling. 

I stuck my head out and didn’t see anything initially. Then I stepped out and turned towards the kitchen. Standing in my kitchen was a middle-aged man with his back to me. “Excuse me can I help you?” I yelled. The man turned around, looking very surprised to see me. He was holding a grocery bag, with something in it, I couldn’t see what it was. He stared at me for about 5 seconds before telling me he was maintenance and we had called about an issue with our sink. 

I immediately felt like an idiot for being so rude, and thought Kate had put in a request and not told me (she had done this before). He then mumbled something along the lines of he “didn’t have the proper tools to fix the problem”, so he would “have to come back later”. He then breezed past me and went out the door. Weird. I immediately texted Kate and bitched at her for not telling me he was coming. She didn’t respond, so I continued getting ready for work and left.

Around 2pm, Kate called me on her break to explain she never put in a maintenance request. I immediately got a very nervous feeling. She told me to call our manager’s office and report it. 

I told my manager the story and he was not exactly very concerned and just blew me off. My apartment complex was pretty safe. The only time I ever saw a police car was to bust some idiots throwing beer bottles off their balcony. 

The rest of the day, I continued to rationalize to myself that the guy had been maintenance and he was just confused. By the weekend, I had basically forgotten about it. Kate left Friday night for the weekend, meaning I had the apartment to myself, which never happens, so I was pumped. This was around the time of the NBA playoffs, and our hometown team was playing Saturday night, so me and a few of my friends went to a bar to watch the game. We left around 8, and decided to call it a night around 2 am. My friends were taking an Uber, but were headed in a different direction than me. So I opted to walk. 

Taking the long way meant I was coming from the opposite direction of where I usually walked in from the parking lot. I could see my windows first, from the street, then have to walk around up a few steps to get to my front door. As I got closer to my apartment I could tell something was off with the windows. I could see Ally’s window was just barely cracked open. First of all, Ally has been gone since May AND it was the end of June. THEN as I got even closer, I saw the screen looked funny, it was sideways like it had been popped out and then been put back in upside down. 

Now listen, I’m not one to overreact, but I knew for a fact that window had been closed before I left for the bar. So I noped the fuck out of there and ran to my friends apartment on the third floor where I called the police. I went down when they got there and reiterated the situation to them. They told me to go back to my friends’ apartment and wait until they told me it was ok to come out.  

After about 2 minutes, the cops walk out with YOU GUESSED IT the fucking weirdo who was in my kitchen the day before. The cop was holding this big ass hunting knife in his hand. Nope Nope Nope. 

I really wish the police hadn’t told me what I’m about to write because it still haunts me. They found the creep hiding behind my couch in my living room, holding a hunting knife wrapped in a Kroger bag. EVEN CREEPIER, had I not walked home and noticed the messed up window, I would have just walked in the front door from the parking lot unknowingly. I had a lot to drink that night, and I had just planned on going right into my room and passing out. I would’ve fallen asleep with this guy still in my apartment. I know for a fact he wasn’t just planning on hanging out. So weirdo non-maintenance guy, let’s not meet. 

(I don’t want this to be super long, so if you have any questions I will try to answer them as best I can in the comments)

Has anyone had any success in saving the page and printing later? I've heard of Printing to PDF, but does it actually work in this instance? Ideally I'd like to take the course and test tonight and then get to training early to print on their computers, which is way more preferable to going there later and sitting down for an hour, taking the test, printing, and driving all the way back home just to sleep and go back in the morning."

It seems I either haven't taken enough advanced classes in accounting for them or they think I live too far.  I  live smack dab in the middle between the city (where I've applied for jobs) and my school.  The city is 45 minutes east from where I live and my school is 1hr west from where I live.  I commute to school.

Every time they bring up the fact I go to school far away and live quite a ways from the city, I get a disappointed reaction.  I tell them I've worked in the city before and commuting isn't a problem and during Fall semester I'm only in school two days a week.

The interview goes well until they bring up logistics and/or that I've only taken 3 accounting classes so far. I also ask good questions. When they say at the end, ""I've got so many other candidates to interview..."" I know I didn't pass to the next round.

I have another phone interview with another tech start up in the city for Accounting position this week so I'll see how it goes.

I'm starting to freak out if I don't snag an internship for this summer. I'm hoping to get an internship with the Big 4 or mid-tier by next summer as I am an entering junior year.  I'm trying to be competitive for this fall against my peers.  I don't have any accounting experience or leadership experience yet. At this point I'm applying to anything accounting related, I've cold emailed/called mom &amp; pop CPA firms (no bites) and I'm volunteering on the weekends at the SPCA and feeding the homeless.  

Am I getting myself into a panic for nothing?"

I rented a room in a house so I could go to my summer internship an hour away. In the two weeks I was here, I have ran into several problems with the landlord. 

Here is an account of what has happened from my perspective. I wrote this up over the 2 weeks, some of it was looking back and filling in some blanks.

I am a student trying to provide for myself, and these are my accounts of my time living with **LANDLORD**. I do not know how legal writing works or anything of the sort, but I assume it would be in my best interest to keep an account of what happened in my point of view.

May 29th

On arrival, I have moved my stuff in, and **LANDLORD** was trying to fix the bed. I had paid 25$ bonus to the rent with the understanding that the furniture would be ready for me on arrival. He had suggested I do not tuck the provided sheets because it would cause the bed to collapse. I later laid in this bed and it had collapsed, injuring my back. After trying to put it back together, I had learned that **LANDLORD** had not set up the bed and had only put the frame together (without supports) which is what caused the issue. I helped him set it up afterwards, despite my sore back. **LANDLORD** seemed careless and unapologetic.

Contract has listed furniture included for 25$. This included a table, chair, and bed. I had mentioned there is no light in the room, and that I would be fine without one, however they have provided a light.

June 1st 

**LANDLORD** has told me several times that I am so quiet that he was not sure I was in the house. I have brought accomodations so that I may be as quiet as possible (namely, a wireless headset for my electronics)

I have been here for 4 days and the room is infested with what looks like “Ilnacorella sulcata” (a common plant bug that lives on leaves, trees, ect.), gnats, and spiders. This only seems to be apparent when I have the window opened as **LANDLORD** suggested all tenants do to keep the house cool. This worries me because **LANDLORD** had mentioned there was a bug problem in the past in the upstairs rooms. Tonight they covered my bed and myself, and to alleviate the annoyance I closed the window and turned on the light provided. The light seemed to attract them and pulled them away from my side of the room. The window is closed and **LANDLORD** does not turn on AC at night, it is a very uncomfortable temperature in my room. 

June 3rd 

**LANDLORD** blames me for the infestation, claiming my 3 empty, closed, gatorade bottles and 8 empty, closed, water bottles, along with my 3 pairs of dirty clothes are responsible. I was told to clean out my room in spectacular fashion. **LANDLORD** made a vague threat, mentioning something would happen if I did not take my clothes to get them washed in Tracy by the end of the following day. The room has no stench. **LANDLORD** refuses to listen to any explanation as to why there may be bugs in the room and threatens to charge me with the fee for a exterminator, despite it possibly not being my fault.

June 4th

I have washed my clothes as demanded, and readied myself for the inspection he informed me of, however he never seemed to follow through. This seemed like a threat.
I have found many dead bugs inside the light provided- they could not escape to the outside after closing the window.  **LANDLORD** has told me I am not allowed to keep the light provided on during the night, so I cannot keep bugs out of my bed. I accepted this despite the discomfort caused.

I will keep the window closed from now on to prevent bug entry. This however will cause me to sweat during the night.

I feel very uneasy to leave my room, however I believe that it was discussed that I should be in my room most of the time anyway. It is very stressful to eat or drink in the kitchen so I have taken to eating and drinking in the Garage. I have been very careful to not spill or leave any crumbs.

June 11th

I have asked to do our weekly cleaning a day earlier because I may be unable to do it the following day. We clean the bathroom and vacuum my room, as he mentioned previously, however only some of the cleaning supplies were provided, when he had said “I provide you all the cleaning supplies you need”. I provided my own rag and paper towels. I assumed that he was just not prepared, especially since I had requested it a day early.

June 4h 

**LANDLORD** seems annoyed that I had come back sooner than expected, though I had not mentioned it was a guarantee that I would be gone for the full two days. I told him that I just wanted to be responsible by making sure I could do the cleaning at least by the scheduled day.

June 12th 

Today is the 2nd scheduled day of cleaning. I decided to bring up that despite cleaning supplies having been said to be provided, that he had not provided Paper Towels or Rags. He laughed patronizingly, and claimed that Paper towels and Rags are not cleaning supplies, as they are like toilet paper, something that I would use for myself. I told him that if I am using it to clean, it is a cleaning supply. He told me that if I wanted Paper Towels that it would cost an additional 5$ a month to provide them. I told him that I can pay for them myself and its not a big deal, but that he lied to me. I would have preferred he just told me what I needed to get beforehand. He immediately walked to his phone and stopped responding to me, and paced back and forth in front of my room seemingly very upset. I continued to mop the bathroom floor until he returned.

I have received an email saying that, despite everything that was said up to this point, 
“I would provide you the cleaning supply, which includes special Granite Cleaner and Polish, Floor Cleaner, other Cleaners and Sponges. You provide a Paper Towel and a Soft Rag or Towel for cleaning. I have also informed him that all tenants pay $5 monthly for cleaning supply which it does not include paper towel. He is currently not paying anything for the supply.“
Followed by a separate email mentioning the same issue:
“Note:
There is a $5 cleaning supply fee per month that all tenant(s) pay.
Currently we are waiving this fee for you as a courtesy.”

None of this was mentioned in either my rental agreement, rental agreement addendum, nor my payment receipt. He had only said “I provide you all the cleaning supplies you need”. I am unsure of the implications of the emails, and I will buy my own paper towels regardless. 


edit:

Here are some rules that I think seem outlandish:

1: I am provided two oven mitts that I must prepare food/drink/ect on, and can only eat at the dining table(no prepping or anything else at the table). I am only allowed to use the microwave. I will lose 100$ out of my deposit otherwise. The microwave portion was in the contract.

2: Shoes must be taken off inside an stored in the garage in a particular spot. I am unsure of the consequences. This is not in the contract.

3: I am not allowed to loiter outside of my room. This is not in the contract."

After the destruction of Lion's Arch, the Council decided to form a branch of the Lionguard that specializes in recon and information gathering in order to better prepare for future threats. The Lion's Arch Exploratory Brigade was formed. These are their reports.

------------

The Consortium
---

During our last report, /u/Professor_Retro had brought to our attention a conversation between two Consortium members in LA. [Specifically this conversation](http://i.imgur.com/ra82DGf.jpg). Intrigued by this we launched an investigation into the Consortium and looked to see if we could find anything new concerning their presence in LA. Here is what we found.

Expanding Conversation
---

When I was scouting these NPCs for their conversation, I spent a little over an hour standing next to them listening for this particular conservation to happen. The weird thing was that it never did. However, I still didn't want to give up. To see if this was a new conversation, I did some digging around. What was found was that this conversation was actually reported here on reddit [4 months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/44wqrn/some_random_happenings_ive_noticed_recently/). So we can probably disconnect it from recent events. However, it still raises the question. Is it removed or I was just very unlucky? Along with the question of where they want to expand.

Expansion Locations
---

Now when we looked at what possible locations could be the site of the expansion, we mainly look at a few things. First, distance. The Consortium is mainly based in LA and haven't really explored too much beyond that. Mainly the nearby lands. The second thing we looked at is possible profits.They wouldn't expand if it didn't profit them. Third, the lady from the conversation is going to the location to scout it out. So I doubt she is running through fire to get to the location. Fourth, they seem to imply that the location is currently occupied. Finally, if you look in the conversation one says ""we're barely staffed up here"". As if to imply it is to the south. 

So with those in mind, we found a few highly possible locations. The first, the fields of Farshore Ward in LA. These are primary farmer's fields that are are fully of just crops. There's a chance they're looking to buyout the fields. Second possible location, Dredgehat Island in in Bloodtide Coast. This is a mysterious island that is theorized to be the location of cut content. Right now it sports some golems and weird architecture that seems to be Asuran in nature. Third, the island south of Claw Island. Currently unused, it could become a location for Consortium operations in the area to help support the LA branch and Southsun Branch. Finally, the area west of LA. The locked out land to the west was already found in the game files before and I believe you can still see it in Tyria3D. There were 3 maps that were cut from the game if I remember. The area west of LA, the area north of DR, and then an Underworld looking map. These were cut from the release of the game, not recently. 

Now the final location I'd like to mention is that if we ignore the location aspects, Fort Vandal also has a chance of becoming a prime suspect for expansion. Not only is it an already fortified location, it is also within close range of dragon activity/energies along with the potential riches of the Maguuma Jungle. However, with the close proximity to danger it seems the least likely. 

The last thing I'd also like to note is the conversation in the same area talk about someone else hiring. They say ""You know who is hiring. I hear they're expanding"". Or it was something along those lines. There's only one other group that the statement could be aimed at, the BLTC. If this is true, both the Consortium and the BLTC are ""expanding"". Perfect grounds for new content. 

The Consortium Leader
---

Now during my [undercover operation at the Consortium HQ](http://i.imgur.com/YPossut.jpg), we came across an interesting conversation. It seemed to hint at the potential leadership and going ons within the Consortium upper management. [This is the conversation in quest](http://i.imgur.com/B97xlgU.jpg). From those same administrative assistants that talked about the expansion. Now our researched shows that on the wiki, this dialogue was added in August 2015. Now the wiki says that this is 3 different chairmans. Chairman Macro, Chairman Boll, and Chairman Overkill. However, it doesn't say exactly where it is getting this information from. Here is what we think based off of the conversation. First, Chairman Macro is a Charr. Second, Chairman Boll is actually the leader/founder of the group. Chairman Overkill is no chairman, but a sarcastic comment about Chairman Macros personality/attitude/behavior. Being a vicious Charr. Overkill (being Macro) is a charr. Hence the jokes about him eating someone. The interns inside also talk about how he held a door open for the chairman. One intern then makes a comment that he was lucky the chairman didn't take a bit out of him. The Subdirector is also a female, as evident by the conversation. However, I couldn't find any currently ingame female subdirectors, so there is a chance that she will be new. Finally, we think Boll is the founder because Macro promises that Boll is still calling the shots. That comment just seems out of place if Boll isn't presumed to be the founder. 

Tinfoil Hat Theory
---

So what we have is the potential that a Charr chairman of the Consortium is performing a hostile takeover of the company, from the inside. The story could easily evolve into Macro killing/kidnapping/locking away Boll, then telling the rest that his orders are from Boll directly (when they're not). It is also curious that he is a Charr, like Evon Gnashblade. If you remember about Evon, he killed his legionnaire Aria Gnashfang. It would be an interesting story is Macro is doing all of this with the consortium to eventually get revenge on Evon. Both companies have been constantly looking for ways to legally take the other company down. Now most of the evidence has been in the game for at least 5 months, so it is very plausable we wont see anything till the start of Season 3 of the Living World.

4ntiu6,0,2016-06-12,Looking for fastest sequence of steps to start driving as soon as possible in CA,neurominer,uberdrivers,https://www.reddit.com/r/uberdrivers/comments/4ntiu6/looking_for_fastest_sequence_of_steps_to_start/,"I moved to San Diego about 8 months ago, but have so far gotten by without a car. I just started a new summer internship that I am getting to via public transit right now, but really need  a car for in the long-run.

I'm looking to start driving for Uber on the weekends to help defray the new expenses of leasing a car.

I know that I need to:

1. Transfer my MD license to a CA one at the DMV
2. Get (lease) a car
3. Get CA plates
4. Get CA insurance
5. Sign up as a driver for Uber
6. Get a smog test done 
7. Start driving 

From what I've read so far, the most sensible sequence is to do these tasks in the order listed above. Do you all agree? About how long do you think I'm looking at here before I can start driving?

Any advice on how best to negotiate/which dealerships to try for low down payments (&lt;$1,000, preferably &lt;$500---my current income is quite low, but will raise significantly over the next few months, irrespective of what I make with Uber) would also appreciated.

Cheers!"

4nudo1,0,2016-06-13,[Everything] I still have my tin-foil hat on for Arya's storyline. I also might be in denial. Help.,ZeroTheCat,gameofthrones,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/4nudo1/everything_i_still_have_my_tinfoil_hat_on_for/,"I'm going to preface this by saying I might not be in the ""acceptance"" stage of grief here yet, but there is a part of me that legitimately believes theres still a reason everything has been so easy for Arya.

There are quite a few things that just stick out to me about this episode, and for them to finish her FM arc here, completely cold turkey, is egregiously bad. Which, barring some poor writing in the past, has never truly derailed a character arc as horrifically as they would have done to Arya. Until Episode 10, assuming its a Winterfell centric episode next week, I'm holding out that something else is happening here. 

So, a few things that stuck out to me as general loose ends, or weird set ups:

* **1.) Lady Crane:** Crane seems exceptionally stacked with everything Arya needs. Furthermore, why is she all of a sudden method acting Cersei and cutting up the actress who tried to kill her? What was that all about? It seemed super....evil. It almost read as if she was playing the Game of Faces with her. Yes, I realize she doesn't look like she's just gonna ""get up"" with how the Waif left her. It just bugs me. 

* **2.) Jaquen completely let her go:** He could have easily disarmed her, or at least fought her. Yes, a face had been added, but if that was the goal all along, why drag Arya all the way into this shit just for that? 

* **3.) Jaquen's Master Plan:** Jaquen continually asks Arya who she is throughout her training. She says no one, when she clearly is not. Why the sudden change? Why declare her ""no one""? Is it standard FM protocol to offer membership if you can avoid a shanking in the dark?  

Is it also standard hiring procedure to pit two FM ""interns"" against each other and take the face of the one that sucks at making coffee the most? 

* **4.) Liam Cunningham has said Arya's storyline this season is ""mental"":** How has any of this been ""mental""? With one episode left for Arya, I don't see how, barring some sort of gigantic reveal, she is going to be doing anything major. I swear to God if she shows up in Westeros...I won't buy that ""she-took-another-boat-and-followed behind"" speed boost explanation.

* **5.) Her sudden injury healing:** And I mean wayyyyy more sudden than a night of rest. Why is she suddenly ok when she is threatening Jaquen, after just seriously re-opening her wounds, and looking close to death (again) before she slices the candle? The show writers painfully made an excuse for the injury healing with Crane, but not for this? Did she drink the water that cured her blindness? If so, how the Hell did she know how to do this?   

There is far too much that has been unanswered with the HOBAW for them to just leave it like that. I'm honestly going to be shocked if this is the final time we see the FM or if Jaquen is seriously done with her. 

I keep thinking back to the mind fuck that occurred when Arya wore a face for the first time, and started shredding faces off of ""Jaquen."" It just seems like there is something else, something ""mental"" going on that can explain these leaps in logic. It's the only way.  

Add your tin-foil if I missed anything. Because I'm literally at a loss for words right now the more I think about how good this show usually is with its narrative logic. 

If this tin-foil doesn't come true in some form, they didn't just stab Arya in the gut and twist it. They stabbed me and twisted it like it was a game of fucking Bop It. "

He’s a total piece of shit, in and out of work. I mean, I’m not an intern anymore, and he still expects me to do all his errands for him! “Roberts, pick up my dry-cleaning!” “Roberts, come park my car for me!” “Roberts, the sun’s in my eyes, go up there and extinguish it for me!” Okay, I made the last one up but you get the point.  
  
Man, I’m telling you, if it wasn’t for the fact that this place pays better than any other job I could get, I would have quit long ago. Oh well, life could be worse. I do have a date planned tonight, and she seems like a lot of fun! Oh shit, my boss is calling me over. I reluctantly walk over to where he’s standing, and he looks a little frustrated. “Yes, Mr. Lewis?” I ask, knowing that’ll he’ll probably want me to do a favour for him.  
  
“Roberts, I need you to do something for me.” Called it. “It’s my wife and I’s anniversary, and she’s booked a hotel room for us. Unfortunately, I need to meet with a few clients, and it’s absolutely urgent. Now, I can’t take the time to call her, because I can’t waste that time. So you have to call her, understand? Let me give you her number.”  
  
I hold back the urge to grin, “Sorry sir, but my phone’s being repaired. Looks like you’ll have to ask someone else.” I try to walk away, but he grabs my shoulder. “Not so fast, son. If you can’t call her, then you’ll have to tell her in person.” He fumbles around in his pocket for a few seconds before pulling out a card. “Here’s the room key. She’s at the Blue Lion, Room 45, got it? Now hurry up and get going!”  
  
And just like that, he walks away, leaving me with the card in my hand. Sighing and mumbling, I walk out of the building and begin walking. Great, guess I have to pass on my date tonight. Did I already say fuck my boss? Because fuck my boss, fuck him to hell and back. The hotel must be about an hour away, and I may have taken my time, just to make sure his wife gives Mr. Lewis an extra large chewing out later. Eventually, I make it to the hotel’s front doors. I’ve got to admit, I feel slightly underdressed, compared to some of the people here.  
  
After I walk around some more, checking out some of the expensive looking architecture. Eventually, I decide I’ve had enough, and just want to get back home as soon as possible. I walk up the stairs and find the right floor. Checking the card, I look for the right number, and after a good few minutes walking, I find number 45. Sliding the card in the door I open it slowly.  
  
Damn, this is one lavish room! The drawn curtains are made of red velvet, and the carpets are obviously made of some other expensive material I’ve never heard of. I didn’t have time to notice the rest of the architecture, as one sight took my attention away from all the others. There, lying naked on the bed, was my boss's wife! And if that wasn’t enough to make me horny, she was wearing a blindfold, and had some handcuffs and rope on the nightstand next to her.  
  
Oh my god! I remember meeting her at one of the office parties, and thinking she was beautiful, but now? She was one of the most attractive women on the planet! What should I do? Should I tell her who I am? Or, should I pay Mr. Lewis back for his years of abuse, by doing the one thing that would hurt him most. Fucking his wife. My dick seems to already have convinced the rest of my body, as I begin to disrobe, and walk up to her alluring body.  
  
Once I’m naked, I stride over to her, and place my head between her thighs. Grabbing two gentle handfuls of her ass, I pull her pussy towards my face, and begin to plant soft kisses around the edge of it. The heat from her inner thighs radiates on my face as my lips brush against the outskirts of hers. Mmm, sorry Mr. Lewis, but somebody has to take care of your wife!  
~~~~~~~~  
Hey there Ladies of DPP! For this prompt, I'm looking for somebody to play the role of my boss's wife. This one is pretty simple, but for your first message, I'd really appreciate you sending me some of your kinks, just so I don't have to ask or guess later.

4nv55c,17,2016-06-13,"Guy who seemed to be really interested in me told me he didn’t want a relationship, but is still going out of his way to hang out with me almost every day. What is his logic? Should I stay around or go?",307148,askgaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/4nv55c/guy_who_seemed_to_be_really_interested_in_me_told/,"I feel like, at this point, I should know better than to ask for advice on this sub; however, It’s be nice to talk through my situation with some other people and see some different perspectives on this situation. I’m personally just confused about the situation. TL:DR below the following wall of text.

So about two weeks ago I moved to a new city. I’m living here for the summer for an internship, but I’m hoping to move here at the beginning of the year once I graduate from college in the Fall. Anyway, I started talking to this guy on Tinder. I remember on his profile he had said something about “looking for the Pam to my Jim” (reference to the couple on The Office [US] in case you didn’t know), and “Doesn’t anybody want something real and lasting anymore”, which would seem to me to imply a relationship, right? Well we got to talking and seemed to really hit it off. We seemed to have very similar personalities and interests, and ended up talking throughout the day every day for a good five days or so. Finally, we met up at a mall, and walked around and talked for a bit. We had a great time.

We then proceeded to hang out every day for the next three days – doing things like going out for dinner and dessert, him showing me his favorite park and us walking around it, him taking me to the downtown core of the city, and so on. On the third day of hanging out, we had sex together. We also communicated through text and snapchat throughout the week. Things seemed to be going really well between us. At one point he was texting me while at work and made a comment like “you’ve been on my mind a lot today, it’s hard for me to focus on my work”

The next day, I was going out of town to go to an event with some friends. I was originally going to leave the day after, and we were going to try to do something together the night before I left, but he had a family event he *forgot* he had to go to, so I left earlier. He actually called me when I got to my destination and just wanted to know how my trip was and to talk to me. I thought it was really sweet – and it really made me think he actually liked me, as I had been having doubts about it before then. Most people wouldn’t do that for just a friend they had just met a week or two prior.  Throughout the weekend we texted a lot, and all seemed to be well. He would send me things like “hope your day is going well and that you’re having fun with your friends!” Yet, I still wasn’t sure how he actually felt about me, even though his behavior seemed to imply that he liked me.

Yesterday I came home from my trip, and we had made plans to hang out that evening. I went to his house, and after he greeted me he said to me that before we leave he needed to talk to me about something. He had me sit down on the opposite side of the living room that he was sitting on – something I thought was weird – and said that it’s hard for him to say this, but he isn’t looking for a relationship right now and just wants to be friends. He said he didn’t want either of us to get our feelings hurt. Despite feeling crushed, I took it surprisingly well in the moment – I was happy that he was mature enough to be up-front about it, rather than ghosting me like guys have done in the past – and we ended up spending the next six hours out together, shopping, having dinner together, and things like that. That night he took me back to his house and showed me a lot of the things he’s collected that he had told me so much about during our times together. And throughout the evening he kept bringing up things that he wanted us to do together – building IKEA furniture he’s planning to buy together, going to his favorite thrift store together, having dinner together one night this week, going together see a new movie that’s coming out on Friday… Then, that night after I had left, he sent me a goodnight message and said that he would talk to me in the morning.

I guess I’m just really puzzled by his behavior. Because of past experiences, I try not to take things too fast and to get too emotionally wrapped up in a guy. But this guy seemed so into me. He would snapchat me “good morning” every morning and wish me sweet dreams at night. When I went out of town he called me just to see how I was doing. And we went on three dates in one week. And then after he tells me that he wasn’t looking for a relationship (which was the complete opposite of what his Tinder profile implied), he is still wanting to hang out with me and texts me when he wakes up and goes to sleep. His behavior, to me, seems outside the actions of a normal friend. I have great friends, but they’ve never acted as interested in me as this guy has.

Part of me can’t help but to wonder if I did something wrong at one point that demoted me from a potential boyfriend to “just friends”.  But I don’t know what I could have done wrong, unless he just didn’t like one of my viewpoints or something. Maybe he felt I was taking things too fast, and just wants to be friends for now and see how things progress before taking it to the next level? He also talked about his previous girlfriends at times, I suppose it’s possible that he is bi and only wants to be in relationships with women? He said that she cheated on him, maybe he’s afraid of getting hurt again? 

Furthermore, we are kind of at different places in our lives; I’m a summer intern about to knock out my last semester of college, and he has a career and owns a house and several cars and is generally settled-down already. Maybe he realizes that and doesn’t want to get too involved with me at this time until I’m at a more permanent place in my life, which I can totally understand. But then, why would he still make such an effort to try to get to know me?

And it’s also possible that he just wants a casual but meaningful relationship with someone without dealing with labels and feelings and all that jazz. Normally I would be okay with that from the get-go, had he not been acting like somebody who was interested in me on a deeper level. It’s also a possibility that I “read between the lines” a bit too much and saw things that weren’t actually there. Or maybe he wants me as his “back-up” guy to fall back on in case things don’t go well with a different guy. I really don’t know.

I’d really appreciate the input of others who have gone through a similar situation. Why would a guy be so interested in talking to and spending time with me if he didn’t want to date me? Is he just super lonely or something? Am I being played? Will I have to decide between either being his back-up guy just hoping for a chance to be with him when he finally comes around to it, or cutting ties with and leaving him entirely for someone who will give me what I want (a relationship), even though I would rather be in a relationship with him? Will I ever figure out the gay dating world?

*TL;DR: A guy who acted super into me, said he was looking for a relationship in his dating profile, and went out of his way to talk to and hang out with me, told me after almost two weeks of dates, phone calls and text messages that he just wanted to be friends. Not only that, but he is still texting me and making plans to hang out with me, just like he did before he told me that. I don’t know why he seems so invested in getting to know me and spending time with me if he isn’t interested in a relationship with me, and he is not acting in the way a normal guy friend would. I would like some perspective and advice on the situation so that I can understand and feel better about the situation.*"

Overwatch - Since there is still no ranking system until the end of June, there is no accurate measure of skill. I was playing briefly with an unsigned team until the start of this month, where I had to leave for vacation (I'm currently in Asia). Admittedly, the team chemistry was lacking and I was having conflicts with a few of my teammates. The team captain is willing to give a recommendation if required, and I have a good amount of logged scrim time. 

The heroes I currently main are **McCree, Pharah, Widowmaker, Zarya, Roadhog and Winston**, however I can also play every other viable hero at a consistent and high skill level, including supports. 

___________________________________________________

**Strengths**: Good accuracy, top level mechanics (though OW doesn't really require much), very flexible player, experience with strat-calling, top level game sense, comprehensive knowledge of established meta/strats, previous competitive experience and top notch teamwork

**Flaws**: Moderately inconsistent (when tilted), excessive communication in-game (noticed during Overwatch scrims), easily hyped, high expectations, inexperience with OW strat-calling, shitty computer

If I can find a team that can accommodates my weaknesses I can definitely be a strong addition to any team. They are definitely going to change at some point but those are current issues that may interfere with some things.

4nwe2g,1,2016-06-13,"My [24M] ex-girlfriend [21F] asked me out to dinner; it went well, but where do I go from here?",_DjangoFett_,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4nwe2g/my_24m_exgirlfriend_21f_asked_me_out_to_dinner_it/,"Bear with me on this one, it's gotten a little wordy. But I do really need advice here. 

So, I recently met up with my ex-girlfriend, we'll call her Stephanie. This was kind of a big deal to me, as I never fell out of love with her, and she is ""the one that got away"" for me. For a little backstory, I met her when I was in my senior year of college, and she was a freshman. I had never intended to date her, but we ended up falling in love with each other, and dated until about halfway through my final semester at school.

We broke up under the pretense that I was going to be moving on, and she was still going to be at school, and just basically that the timing wasn't right. She loved me just as much as I loved her, but my graduation and the prospect of doing it long distance while she still had so many years of school left was hanging over us like a storm cloud, and led to the eventual break up.

Now, I kept in touch with her over the last two years. Nothing creepy; I didn't try to ask her out on any dates or quasi-dates. She had told me that she wanted to remain friends, so I did my best to be friends with her. 

Fast forward to the present. She just got an internship in the city which I currently live, and she texted me to let me know that she got it, as I had told her to let me know if she did, and that she wanted to meet up with me for dinner. I took this as just a friendly ""let's meet up,"" kind of deal. But what really struck me was how adamant she was about out. No less then 3 times in the course of our conversation of the next few days did she tell me that ""we needed to meet up,"" and how ""excited she was"" to see me. 

I'll try to wrap it up here. Basically, we met up at a cool dinner spot my friend suggested to me. It went really well. For the whole 3 hours that we were there, we never stopped talking. It was extremely fun, and for me, unexpected. She asked me to walk her to the train station so she could get home after we finished, and once we got to the station, she turned around and kissed me. It wasn't just a friendly peck either; it felt passionate, like it was something she had been waiting to do. We said goodnight, and promised to meet up again soon.

Here is where things get weird. This took place about a week ago today. In the week since, we have only talked intermittently; I did not talk to her at all over the weekend, as she was at a friends house, and I tried to talk to her last night, but she was busy and promised to text me later, which did not happen. I realize that I may be expecting way too much of her at this point; I am not trying to talk to her every day, I am doing my best to give her her own space; she's in a new city and basically living her dream, and I am not trying to interject my own life and problems into her, seeing as we are not, in fact, dating.

My question(s) is this. Am I expecting too much of her? I know she is under no obligation, but she seemed to have a lot of fun and she claimed to want it to continue; however, based on her conversations with me since, it doesn't seem like she wants to talk to me at all. Is there something that I should try to say to her, or am I just being a crazy ex, and should I let the leaves fall where they may? Did I possibly read too much into our conversation from dinner, and the subsequent kiss goodbye?

As I said, I never fell out of love with her. I moved on, as everyone does, but I have still always loved her. She has similarly told me that she still loves me, but we've just not been in the same place at the same time. One thing she said to me at our dinner last week was that it was good that we were finally in the same place, as she's missed me.

So, yeah. Any help or advice, even if it's something that I might not like to hear, is appreciated.




   
**tl;dr**: Met up with ex, went well, but now I'm confused where to go from here."
4nweko,16,2016-06-13,I graduated from college. [Wall of Text],Disco_Bloodbath,stopdrinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/4nweko/i_graduated_from_college_wall_of_text/,"It took me ten years to get my undergraduate degree. I came to college with severe anorexia in 2006 and started studying apparel design, but was mainly studying how to exercise compulsively and eat as little as possible. It wasn't long until I was drinking like a freshman and then not long after that before I started doing a good amount of cocaine and experimenting with psychedelics. I was incredibly insecure and lacked any love for myself. My body was a sacrificial means to a good story and drinking/drugs were my feeble upper-middle class white girl attempt at being a tortured artist.

 I did have some good times of course. Made a lot of great friends in the dorms, travelled a fair bit, and got some decent work/school experiences under my belt. However, my head and heart were obviously not committed to the facade I was building. I didn't want to be in school, it was becoming increasingly obvious that I had an eating disorder, and once I started having sex it was clear that I wasn't going at it responsibly. As the years went on, I changed my major to Anthropology, then to European History. I took French, Italian, and Russian along with some art history and had some memorably incredible professors who, looking back, wanted to help me, but didn't quite know how to reach me. 

I was an ok student and got through more classes then I withdrew from, but I was still in a troubled place. I had resigned long ago that no one would ever want to date me and that I was too wild, too much of a handful, too intense for any normal person to want to tolerate more than 3 minutes with me. I drank to take away the responsibility of my actions. I started blacking out a lot and waking up with weird scars and bruises. Date rapes were common as were a few (thankfully curable) STDs. I had stopped doing cocaine the year I turned 21, but I still slipped up if I was drunk and it was around. I had quit cold turkey after months of selling clothes, books, anything I could get my hands on, but looking back I probably should have gotten some professional help because I very much replaced my coke habit with sex and drinking. I slept with over 60 people that year and woke up the next morning lucky to be alive on many more days than I realized. I only had one trip to the hospital with alcohol poisoning and laughed it off the next night. I know many of us have experiences like this that make us cringe, so you know what these memories mean to me now. They are shameful and painful beyond measure. 

After a few years of gradual re-stabilization, still smattered with too much booze several nights of the week, I decided to drop out of school and go to culinary school. I thought restaurants and bars would be a safe haven for a freak like me and I wanted to find a path where I could be unapologetically myself. I don't mean bitchy for no reason, I mean just exist without having to apologize constantly. I should preface that I was harassed beyond measure in middle and high school. I was always different and longed to be accepted or at least left alone. My group of friends were fortunately brilliant and lovely and creative. We merged together late in high school and I was definitely the most traditional one of the bunch. The gay kids, the students who would be in alternative high school if they weren't so damn smart, friends who were sometimes homeless, had absentee or drug addict parents. These were my people. They often laughed at me (nicely) because I was gorgeous, a straight A student, played 5 sports, and came from a traditional family. I don't know what I would have done without them. 

Ultimately I decided to not leave university for culinary school and ended up going from a misc. liberal arts major into the Food Science and Technology program. I'm not quite sure what I thought I was getting myself into, but I had never been much of a scientist and I guess must have felt confident that I would figure it out. By this point, I had bounced between a variety of living situations and was finally somewhere more stable. I was actually trying to take school somewhat seriously and my horrific party girl nights were starting to minimize somewhat. I still got drunk way too often, lost a few jobs because I was irresponsible (or drunk at work), but overall I was getting better slowly. Then I met my boyfriend. He was the president of the food science club and we bonded doing college bowl together. I went from having a few 2-3 month, semi-open relationships to basically living with this guy after a month. We clicked so fast and fell in love so quickly it still blows my mind. Its been 4 and half years now and we know we'll be getting married. He's been the best thing about my life these last few years and I haven't always been a perfect partner. 

A year after we'd been together I was starting to majorly kick ass. I was going to all my classes and the information was starting to sink in. Then one day during a kickboxing class, my heart felt heavy and tired. Kind of a cross between asthma and the day after you smoke too much pot. I left the class, politely told the front desk attendant I was feeling odd and a few minutes later the ambulance was there. My pulse was 280 bpm and was short and strange. Like a CD skipping. The EMTs could tell exactly what was happening, something called supra ventricular tachycardia, but I had never experienced it before and was terrified. Long story short, I went from being a kick-boxing, physics learning, saucy lady to someone who could no longer listen in class because I would sit in terror and just listen to my heart beat. This went on for 3 months. 

They said no alcohol, no cardio, and no caffeine until my scheduled surgery. I was too afraid to do cardio and the increased pulse from the caffeine made me very anxious. I did not stop drinking. It was the only way I could relax since my cardio had been taken away from me. The coronary ablation was painful and terrifying when it finally happened. 6 hours of surgery where you are not under anesthesia and are feeling your heart manually manipulated to all sorts of insane bpm (like 330!) as the doctors try to recreate the initial SVT so they can isolate the extra electrical pathway that I had apparently always had, but had never had problems with. This condition is called Wolf-Parkinson-White for anyone interested in learning more. 

After this very traumatic surgery, that was mostly a success. I developed panic disorder. A week after the surgery I had an acute traumatic dissociative response while driving where I don't remember anything for several hours. After that, I started taking benzos daily and could barely drive or sit through classes most days. I stayed in school because I was on health insurance through the university. I thought that pretending to be normal would have been good for me, but really I needed 6 months of sleeping in and yoga and not having any responsibility because while pushing to be normal, I ended up failing myself and everyone around me constantly. Obviously the inability to sit still and be quite in a dark room without succumbing to inexplicable, heart pounding terror was a bit of a hindrance. Especially for things like organic chemistry….you definitely need to attend those lectures. 

I failed class, after class, after class. I drank into oblivion at night, or in the morning. I cried and cried and ate too much pizza. I felt like I had faced my own death and had somehow not survived it. I waited every day to die. Waited and wondered when my heart would suddenly stop. Lived in fear of another dissociative experience where I wouldn't know where I was or what was happening to me. It was misery. I gained weight. I could barely make it to work. Every single day I failed. 

Somehow things started to get better slowly…the farther away from the surgery I got the more confident I became. I switched from ativan to clonapin and that gave me more stability. I still did absolute crap in a lot of my classes, but I sort of was heading in the right direction. This time last year, I did have to take an incomplete in a class that I was struggling with. It was heart breaking because I had thought I was going to graduate, but ended up being a blessing in disguise. Because I had a year to kill before I could retake the class, I worked a couple odd jobs and then got a harvest internship at a winery I've always loved. That winery brought me back to life. I was having trouble finding a doctor who would refill my existing clonapin prescription (you other benzo users know my pain) so I cut my dose in half and dove into my first harvest head first anyway. It went great. I lost a ton of weight. Had hardly any panic issues and definitely found my calling. 

When that internship ended, I knew what I wanted to do with my professional life. I added a few extra wine related courses and did well in them. I retook and passed the class that gave me so much trouble last year, all while cutting down to taking clonapin as needed. Now about 5 times a month. This time last year I was taking 1.5 pills a day. I am honestly more proud of how far I've come with my anxiety than I am about finally graduating. But I did graduate. Its still sinking in. I did have to request a reset for my badge because I drank friday, saturday and yesterday. I didn't drink like an ass, but I'm still not sure how I feel about it. Having some champagne made things feel celebratory and everyone agreed that I deserved to relax. I guess that's all fine. I am very excited to be back here today. There will very likely be some days in the future that I feel are worth celebrating, but I'm thinking I won't need a badge reset next time. I think this weekend I just wanted to let myself relax. To look back on the last decade and give it a toast. 

Today, I will not drink, and I'm hoping that this new person, this college graduate, will not be known as that crazy girl who parties too hard. I would much rather be that crazy girl who studied food science and takes dance breaks during night shift at harvest. Thank you for those of you who took the time to read this insanely long post. I haven't ever written any of this down and I needed to release it from my system. I feel like I owe you all an apology for drinking this weekend and I hope you can forgive me my weakness. I thought about this community all weekend and, although my drinking days were ok, I was more excited to come back here and start counting up my sober days again. Thank you. Thank you all so much.

4nwkvy,17,2016-06-13,I’m [23M] unsure if my girlfriend [22F] is not being honest with me or if I’m bring too insecure.,thr0waway48,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4nwkvy/im_23m_unsure_if_my_girlfriend_22f_is_not_being/,"I’ve been with my girlfriend for almost 2 years and lately I’ve been feeling like she’s been leaving me out of the loop, or hiding certain aspects of her life that shouldn’t be secretive in the first place. The first year of our relationship was great since we were both going to the same college and were able to see each other almost every day. However I graduated last May and she’s still in school until this upcoming December. She’s about a 40 minute drive from my parents’ house, but luckily my job is right in between where I’m living and where she’s living by college so even though I don’t see her every day, I can easily stay over her place about 3 days a week. Last summer all of her roommates would go home during the week and she didn’t have any other friends by her so it seemed like every other day she would ask for me to visit her especially since she didn’t want to be alone. However this year summer, her roommates are around more frequently and she has some newer friends that live by her that she can hangout with. 

So since she has more people around her I feel like she doesn’t typically ask me to visit like she used to, but I can kind of understand that since there’s times where, like me, she would want to hang out with just her friends. But on top of this, our relationship has seemed pretty off the last few months as her school year was coming to end. We stopped having sex and most of the times I’m with her I can expect to her to be staring at her phone 50% of the time instead of just talking to each other. I mentioned to her that this concerned me a little but she claims that she was just stressed, and possibly depressed, from all of her school work, working an internship and a part time job at the same time. Ever since she finished the school year she took on two part time jobs and still has to take a summer class so she has a lot to preoccupy herself. I was somewhat able to see where she was coming from since I was almost in the same mentality as her during my last semester at school. 
While this seemed like it was an issue that I could work through, I’ve also started to notice how she’s never introduced me to some of her newer friends and it’s gotten to the point where if she hangs out with them she won’t consider inviting me out at all. She has no problem with me knowing her roommates some of her workers that we’ve gone out with before, but there are still the friends that she hasn’t formally introduced to me. All of my friends on the other hand know her very well and I have no problem inviting her to come hang out with us at times. I have met one of the new friends when I was by myself and she immediately recognized who I was and acted really friendly so it’s not like her friends are oblivious to the fact that she has a boyfriend. So with all of this, I knew I had to have another talk with her.

When I brought up how it seems like she doesn’t want me knowing some of her friends she got really defensive and mentioned how I’m acting selfish. I just said that I’m asking her to invite me out sometime to get drinks or whatever so I’m more acquainted with them. She said it was something she has to work on, which doesn’t seem normal to me, but I figured that was fair enough. A couples of months after this conversation she still never introduced me to them which I got pretty annoyed with.  On top she recently got a text from some guy I’ve never met with at 1 in the morning. After asking her about him and flat out asking if she was cheating on me, considering the whole lack of sex and overall weird behavior, she swore that not of that was true and this guy was some guy she used to talk to years ago who was drunk texting her but she didn’t reply to him. 

So with all of this in mind, is it fair for me to still suspect that she could be cheating on me? On one hand her last relationship ended after her ex cheated on her so I feel like she should know how shitty it feels to be cheated on. But still, is that a reasonable train of thought? Like I mentioned before, I could totally see how she could be stressed from all her work and wanting some time with her friends but I also don’t think I’m asking for much by having her introduce me to her friends. I’m really confused as to what I should do or if I’m missing any obvious red flags. I genuinely love her but obviously I’m starting to have some trust issues with her and I’m not sure how much longer I can stay with her if this keeps up. 

Tl;dr: First year of relationship with girlfriend was great but started to notice how things haven’t been the same and she won’t introduce me to some of her friends. Called her out for possibly cheating after seeing some guy texted her late at night but she denies it and claims she’s overwhelmed from schoolwork and part time jobs.

4nwse1,32,2016-06-13,Daily practice with R?,the1whowalks,statistics,https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/4nwse1/daily_practice_with_r/,"Fellow statheads,

I will begin my MSc in the fall and have been out of the classroom for a little longer than I prefer. All of that is to say that I would like to get a jumpstart on what I feel like will be important skills in my program and beyond (headstart on internships and jobs post grad). 

With this in mind, does anyone have advice for a good way to practice a little bit of R every day? I don't have the wherewithal to really manipulate an open data set and do anything purposeful yet, but would like to be comfortable by August doing so. 

I used datacamp and am enrolled in two edX classes that center on R use, but once I finish them I will be out of prompt to get up and practice each day like I am. 

Let me know some ideas, 
Thanks!"
4nx42f,9,2016-06-13,"My girlfriend [20F] of almost two years abruptly ended things with me [21M], and I'm still desperately in love with her",J1mbuktu,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4nx42f/my_girlfriend_20f_of_almost_two_years_abruptly/,"I know posts like these may be a dime a dozen here, but I could really use some kind words and reassurance.

My girlfriend ended things with me two days ago, and it's been incredibly difficult for me. This was my first serious relationship and first devastating breakup. In my first year of university, I got to know a decent number of girls, but none of them really stood out to me. After meeting this girl though, I was stunned at how well we meshed; she was so accepting of my quirks and shortcomings, we enjoyed so many of the same things, and she was so caring, thoughtful, and truly intelligent that I fell in love quickly. 

Even though it was my first serious relationship, and even though I'm sure ""almost two years"" is chump change relationship time for many of you, I really felt that I genuinely knew her, and I know myself very well, and I was 100% certain that I wanted to and absolutely could spend my life with her. We talked about it frequently, and it really seemed like she was on board as well. She was my best friend and knew me better than anyone else ever had, and she told me the same. We had each other's backs, and I truly believed that I would always be there for her and she for me; I felt like she was a constant in my life that I could always turn to -- a permanent fixture. 

After a month of long distance at our internships, we had still been keeping in touch and, despite some smaller arguments, doing fairly well I thought, but one day something was clearly wrong. And that's when I felt my heart ripped out of my chest. Her reasoning was that after being apart for a while, she took a step back for a couple weeks and noticed ways in which we were bad for each other and differences in personality (primarily that I tend to be much more pessimistic than she does), and she felt that she romanticized the good parts of our relationship because we spent so much time together. She decided that these differences and issues were too much to ignore despite everything good about our relationship and felt that it would be best for us to separate.

My reaction for the first day was mostly bewilderment, anger, and pain. I couldn't (and still do not) understand how she just hid this monumental, terrible decision from me until that day and that after all the problems we had worked through in the past, she was unwilling to communicate her thoughts and give it a chance. Especially since she had always stressed how open she wanted us to be (and she always had been) about addressing any issues, I just couldn't understand this. 

She has had serious boyfriends that she loved in the past, but she told me some time ago that it was okay to have loved before, and it was a different love she had for me in the present that mattered. She said that she learned and grew from each relationship, and they helped her become who she is today. But now I feel like I was always just an experience to her, part of her becoming who she is, and even though she assures me that she meant everything she said when she said them, I just don't see how she could have sincerely said all those things about wanting to spend her life with me, etc. when she so abruptly ended things with me this way after being apart for only a month. 

In the past couple of days, I've had a chance to examine myself, and I noticed two significant faults that most likely contributed: 

* I grew complacent and took her for granted. I truly believed that she would always be with me, and I believed she would be the girl I married. As I tend to do with many of my relationships (i.e. with mom and dad), I didn't appreciate her as much as I should have. I didn't let her know often enough how I felt that she was the one for me and I never wanted to leave her
* I'm a huge worrier and tend to be pessimistic. She was the first person I had ever met who would put up with all my complaints and my almost constant worrying (she was a big worrier herself as well). I began relying on her too heavily, and even after she would reassure me, I would keep pressing, complaining, and worrying. For instance, we were both incredibly stressed about finding jobs together post graduation, and I only ever whined about how hard it would be, how hard we would have to work and try to stay together. I feel like an idiot, and I regret this immensely now; I know all my negativity must have taken a toll on her. 

Now I am sitting at work feeling guilty that I am wasting this time at my internship, but I absolutely cannot focus on anything. I just feel this dull emptiness, a deep ache, a tremendously crushing loneliness, and a total lack of motivation to keep going. I'm also fully aware that it may be the dopamine, oxytocin, and serotonin causing all the good times to overshadow the bad in my mind, I have read plenty of advice on r/breakup and breakup threads here, and I know the theory of how to handle a breakup and that it takes time, but right now I don't see how I could ever move on. I may be idealizing our relationship now, but I do remember that, even though I had weighed the good and bad and had considered ending our relationship before in the early stages, for the past several months, I was all in and never considered leaving her. I know I need to give up the ghost rather than clinging to hope, but I just can't believe that she no longer wants to be part of my life. Honestly, I wrote this post partly in the hopes that she would read it, as I know she browses this subreddit. 

This is the most painful event I've had to endure, and it's even harder knowing that we have another year of school left, especially since we are both mechanical engineering students in a relatively small private school and are taking the same classes and share many of the same friends. I never told her, but I always felt that she was way above me -- my God she is beautiful -- and what I deserved. Prior to finding her, I had several failed attempts at relationships (all with girls I know I could not have had such a connection with), and I thought it was an absolute miracle that I just happened to fumble my way into such a fulfilling relationship with such a gorgeous, caring girl so similar to me. Girls have told me before that they are surprised to find that I'm not really a ladies' man (very fit, in a fraternity, etc.), but I've never really been good with girls. I've never had a ""one night stand,"" and I don't at all enjoy the conventional way of meeting women in bars, parties, etc. I'm terrified that I just lost my chance at spending my life with the only girl I could imagine doing so with and that I'll never feel about another girl the way I felt about her. 

If you've gotten this far, I want to thank you for taking the time to listen to me pour my heart out. Please comment on my naivety, give me advice, be honest with me. 

**TL;DR: The girl I thought I would marry left me, and I'm a naive child who is totally hopeless, empty, immensely lonely, and scared with no idea how to move on.**"
4nx59o,4,2016-06-13,Should I (23M) propose to my girlfriend (24F) of almost 5 years after breaking up?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4nx59o/should_i_23m_propose_to_my_girlfriend_24f_of/,"This story starts about a month and a half ago when I was at a poker party with some friends. Afterwards they all left to go party downtime and pick up some girls. I would never even consider cheating on my GF so I decided to head on home (And got hit by a car as I crossed the street). Anyway the fact that other people were partying and having random sexual encounters with other women kind of ate at me, but it wasn't a big deal.

Fast forward to a month ago, when I graduated college. My GF was so supportive and that day was easily the best day of my life. Then real life followed. I had no money to even apply for Grad School (I've since applied) and I was still waiting on word about a job at the local police station. We had no way of paying the rent for the month (had to take out a title loan) and we were talking about moving into a real house with a yard for the dog, none of which I could afford to do. Thus, I felt extremely shitty about myself and felt like a disappointment to my GF, who I had planned on proposing to after I got word on either the job or grad school (which should have been this past weekend, both were delayed). So I brought this up to here and told her that I wanted to be free of responsibilities and travel (had no means to travel). In reality I was scared shitless about the prospect of not being able to take care of this women that I loved, and felt that I should struggle by myself.

We talked about this and thought it best to take a break. Keep in mind, I didn't mention the proposal, house, job, grad school etc. I did mention that I wanted to be free. We agreed that we could talk to other people in the intern, and would continue living together and even searching for a large home together. I'm still unsure how or why we came to that agreement but we did. 

Fast forward another week and we had one of the best weeks of our relationship. We were in contact contact with one another. We kissed, hugged and loved on each other all throughout each day. I really can't explain this or why it happened. Anyway while this was going on I was talking to a few girls on Tinder. It really wasn't my intention to sleep with any of them, but it was fun talking. My girlfriend, whom I assumed was curious wanting to see the messages. We had a laugh and she even suggest what to say next to the girls I was talking to. Later on she tells me that reading the messages really hurt her, but she put on a brave face. I seriously had no idea and had I known I would have stopped. Then the shoe dropped.

Prior to all of this I had bought a box of condoms and put them in my glove compartment. Like I said, I wasn't trying to have sex with anybody, but in the event that I did I wanted to be safe. My GF found these and flipped the fuck out, and I understand why. She views it as me actively trying to fuck other girls, which wasn't the case. I know this because I was asked to meet up with one of the girls from Tinder for sex. While in the mists of having the condom conversation my GF said that she didn't know if she could take my back if I had sex with somebody else. So I declined Tinder girls offer. Thats when I realized that 15 minutes of fun isn't worth losing this amazing women to. Then came last Friday.

The straw that broke the camels back. I went out with some friends and meet up with this girl that I used to work with (campus job) Shes cool and we went out and hung out until 2 in the morning. I know this cools horrible, but seriously we talked about aliens and shoes the entire time. Nothing even close to romantic, and me and my GF were still on our ""break"". The entire night was complete happenstance. Upon returning home I intended on making all of this right with my GF, and proposing later on. When I told her the story about this girl she again flipped out, and said she needed time, space, and didn't know what she wanted.

For about 4 days I was positive she was going to break it off for good. I didn't eat, sleep or drink the entire time. I cried at the drop out that hat and even called the suicide hotline because that was a real possibility. I had finally had enough and packed everything into my car, ready to make the long drive cross country back home. In doing so, she stopped me and asked to talk. The only reason I stayed is because we had a meeting with our counselor, and had already paid for. We talked for a few hours, until she asked me to lay down and listen to music. Odd request, but sure. A fucking breakup song comes on. I looked at her, she looks at me, and we both start fucking BAWLING our eyes out. I grabbed her hand and held her and apologized for causing all of this. I didn't know I had that much water in my body considering I hadn't had any fluids in 4 days. Afterwards we agreed to work it out, but she still needed space and time. During this time she said she needed to initiate all physical contact because her 'wall' was up, and she was afraid of being hurt again.

This Saturday she was going to go out with a friend but her friend canceled. Me being the only other person she really knows agreed to go out with her. This had disaster written all over it. Instead we danced, I held her, kissed on her etc etc. It was like we were the only two people in the club.  We were both a bit tipsy, when in the car we talked and she said she wants to get back together but is scared. She said she wants to marry me, get a house etc but doesn't know if she can trust that I won't hurt her again. She also thinks a break from all of this would be a good idea. We do see each other everyday since we live together, so I tend to agree, but on the premise that we don't see other people. 

However, today I should hear back from the job, and I'm 90% sure I've gotten into the Grad Program, so why should I wait to propose? Why not put everything out on the table and do it now? I know this is the woman I want to marry, and I know she feels the same way. She is hurt and I'm a fucking idiot, but we can rectify this. Should I?




   
**tl;dr**: Broke up with GF a few days before proposal, talked to other girls, realized that was stupid, GF hurting, want to propose."

4nyayp,1,2016-06-13,"Counter offer situation, advice?",Vampir1c,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4nyayp/counter_offer_situation_advice/,"Hey all, so recently I've been dealing with a personal situation. While I had planned to move by the end of the year, the news of my parents moving has kind of put me in a spot where I would feel it's better for everyone if I moved before they did (so they wouldn't have to worry about me and such).

 My dilemma is that I've been at a company officially as a paid intern for the past 3 years, but was promised a FT job when I finished school. I finished the past Dec, and spoke to my boss in April about starting, and said he'll get back to me with something in a few weeks. End of May I still haven't heard anything, and when I explained the parents moving situation, he said that because they recently merged with another company who will be handling their finances, there's a temporary freeze on big spending until the new company can organize everything but he'll try to accelerate the process due to my situation. I was okay with being patient with this, but I've recently felt under valued when another intern (different position) came back from a month after graduation and started his full time contract last week. 

I had an interview today that went really well and basically unofficially confirmed that I'll be receiving an offer in a few days. Now I'm sure when I bring this up/hand in my notice, my current employer will counter (I'm their only IT specialist), and I'm not sure what to do. Everyone including my boss at my current job is awesome, and I'm extremely happy at the place and would love to stay there, but I'm still feeling a bit hurt over the delay for a FT contract. 

Should I just discuss this with him and bring up the current status of the contract again? Do I mention ""oh I saw X employee start, and wondering if everything has been cleared financially now?"" I don't want to just give my notice and leave as I really am happy at my current employer.

Thanks in advance guys.

EDIT: I should clear up the 3 years intern thing, it wasn't them who kept me as an intern. I wasn't ready at the time, however, have been told mid last year that once I finish school, they'll offer me a FT position. Now that I've finished school, I'm facing this dilemma."

Looking for some advice, particularly from those of you that are RPDs, work with residents, have done a residency, etc.

I am now a P2 and genuinely interested in pursuing both a PGY1 and PGY2, and I would like some feedback if I am on the right track for getting accepted into a program.

Currently:
I am an intern at Wags (been a tech for 3 years, now bumped up)
Tech at a local hospital
Few leadership positions(APhA chair, admissions committee, leading a summer camp for high school students, ASHP committee chair) Nothing too fancy
Starting a 2 year research project with a well-known faculty member in critical care/cardio
Do some various community service stuff (help at homeless clinics, health fairs, etc.)
Decent grades (like 3.85 ish)

I have been going to networking events, trying to talk to pharmacists, especially clinical specialists and such but they don't offer too much advice to those of us so early. I have attended some state/national meetings and will continue to do so. I am also working on a small project to be presented at a state meeting in poster form. 


Anything else I could/should be doing if I want to go down the residency path? Any tips? I don't want to be one of those people who waits until last minute to realize that I didn't do anything valuable to help get me in. I am going to also try to talk to some at my hospital job and see if they will let me come shadow one day to get a feel for what they do everyday, etc.

Of all the ways people met their neckbeard nemesises though, mine is unique.  I lived in his closet for a year.

I was in grad school online while working a high profile but unpaid internship.  Money was coming in through a data transcribing job I took on a work from home basis.  Housing therefore needed to be beyond cheap, and I was thrilled to find a listing for a small bedroom in a shared apartment listed for less than the cost of a cheap hotel room, paid weekly.  My landlord was a large, terrifying Russian man who stressed that he was very picky about his tenants.  But he was pleased with me being a student and having references, so I was good to go.

The apartment was, frankly, probably not legal.  It was the third story.  The ground floor was a small cafe owned by the Russian landlord.  Second story was a full apartment occupied by his daughter, her kids and whoever she was dating at the moment.  

The apartment was accessed by a staircase that opened into the restaurant.  So, if the restaurant was closed, you couldn't get upstairs.  The wooden floorboards had gaps where you could see into the apartment below.  There wasn't a kitchen so much as a small mini fridge, a camp stove, and a microwave stuck in the small communal area. The back half of the building was ""storage"" which we didn't have access to. But I wasn't planning on spending much time there so it was perfect.

I had four roomates.  Two were a young married couple who occupied one bedroom.  Another bedroom was taken up by a young woman who was usually at her boyfriends.  The back bedroom was the largest, and lived in by Turnip.  To access my ""bedroom"", you had to walk through Turnip's room.  It was small, just big enough for a twin sized bed and had no windows.  It was obvious this was meant to be a large walk in closet.

I took it.

Turnip wasn't there when I toured the apartment.  I would later find this was an anomoly as Turnip was ALWAYS in his room.  Still, I was pleased that his room was clean, spartan even.  A twin sized bed, a small plastic drawer unit, and a desk with a computer set up with a two monitor system occupied most of the room but there was no clutter.  The only weird thing at first glance was that beside the desk was a huge trashcan, the size of a normal outdoor household can

I met the man himself while moving my stuff up the narrow stairs the next day.  A few steps from the top, I came in contact with a rather rotund man heading down.  He had a ruddy, flushed face, wore basketball shorts and a tshirt.  His hair was pulled into a ponytail, not a low one, but on top of his head.  Combined with his rather fine thinning hair it poked out in a frizzy bloom.  He had kept walking until we collided, then he stood there staring at me.

""Oh, hi, you must be Turnip.  I'm Raptor, your new roomate.""

""I'm going to the 711""

""Ok, well... Let me sneak by you here...""

""I need to go downstairs to go to the 711.  You're in my way.""  He sounded insulted by my presence here.  We were mere steps from the top, there was no way we could fit side by even empty handed.  At the moment, I had a big backpack and a duffel in my arms with an air mattress and bedding.  So we just sort of stayed there, breathing at each other for a while.  Finally, in the name of being a good roomate, I turned and walked down the two flights of stairs to the restaurant, Turnip following.  Then I headed back up the two flights, puzzled by my new roomate.

Twenty minutes later, Turnip came in and yelled out ""what's that cord!"".  Because I was in a closet, there wasn't a light socket in my bedroom.  So, my landlord had run an extension cord from a light socket in his room under the door into my room.  I said it was my electric.

""No, that's my electricity.  Your electricity is in there.""

At this point, I figure the guy is fucking with me so I chuckled.  He wasn't, and went on to explain that we had to use electricity in our own rooms so that the power company ""knew who used it"".  But utilities were included in our rent and not metered.  I was baffled.  Tunrip stared at me like I was stupid.  He would have to share his electricity WITH me, which wasn't fair.  I needed to get my own, or I would use his up. Then he recommended that maybe I didn't need to waste that much power and should go electricity free.  I set my foot down and said that I paid for part of the electric, I was going to use it.

The only thing I can figure at this point is that the guy was pissed at having someone live in his closet, so he was giving me a run around, and the issue was dropped.

The third night, I plugged my phone and laptop in to charge overnight like normal.  Halfway through the night, I wake up to a flashing light on my laptop, signalling low battery.  I follow the cord out and find my extension has been unplugged.  I plug it back in, Turnip none the wiser as he was asleep.

This passive aggressive standoff continued for a few days.  The extension cord was unplugged while I was at work.  The extension cord was missing entirely once.  Finally one of the other roomates told me if I had any issues with Turnip that I should take it up with the landlord.

I texted him that afternoon when I got back and found the cord unplugged.  Within five minutes, there was the sound of footsteps pounding up the stairs.  I heard Turnip's door slam open and in a thick accent the landlord told him that if he touched his stuff again, he would evict Turnip and throw his PC out the goddamn window.

Turnip never touched the cord again (although we continued to have issues with Turnip's understanding of electricity)."

Overwatch - Since there is still no ranking system until the end of June, there is no accurate measure of skill. I was playing briefly with an unsigned team until the start of this month, where I had to leave for vacation (I'm currently in Asia). Admittedly, the team chemistry was lacking and I was having conflicts with a few of my teammates. The team captain is willing to give a recommendation if required, and I have a good amount of logged scrim time. 

The heroes I currently main are **McCree, Pharah, Widowmaker, Zarya, Roadhog and Winston**, however I can also play every other viable hero at a consistent and high skill level, including supports. 

___________________________________________________

**Strengths**: Good accuracy, top level mechanics (though OW doesn't really require much), very flexible player, experience with strat-calling, top level game sense, comprehensive knowledge of established meta/strats, previous competitive experience and top notch teamwork

**Flaws**: Moderately inconsistent (when tilted), excessive communication in-game (noticed during Overwatch scrims), easily hyped, high expectations, inexperience with OW strat-calling, shitty computer

If I can find a team that can accommodates my weaknesses I can definitely be a strong addition to any team. They are definitely going to change at some point but those are current issues that may interfere with some things.

I've been looking into Certificates of Completion through local community colleges and online courses and I've noticed there are multiple courses that have similar names and similar focuses, but I would like to figure out which one would be best to start with. 


   I'm looking into applying for an internship (ideally entry level job) for graphic design and don't have much funding for the more expensive degrees, hence the certificate route. I have a good background in lightroom, illustrator, and photoshop where I have created logos, stickers, and event posters for local bands and coffee shops. 


   I've been looking at http://trydesignlab.com/ since it is fairly inexpensive, http://springboard.com since I've heard good reviews about this resource, and http://codecademy.com because it is free. 

  
 I've also found four programs at the local colleges where they seem pretty similar with slight differences in course names:

* **Computer Graphic Design**
   https://aztransmac2.asu.edu/cgi-bin/WebObjects/acres.woa/wa/freeForm?id=45956

* **Digital Arts: Graphic Design**
   https://aztransmac2.asu.edu/cgi-bin/WebObjects/acres.woa/wa/freeForm?id=90352

* **Graphic Design: Visual Communication**

* **Information Technology: Web and Graphic Design**
   https://aztransmac2.asu.edu/cgi-bin/WebObjects/acres.woa/wa/freeForm?id=90340

This is a pretty long post, but I do appreciate any advice or guidance. Thank you in advance."

#This series is available legally on [Crunchyroll](http://www.crunchyroll.com/bungo-stray-dogs).

&gt;For weeks, Atsushi Nakajima's orphanage has been plagued by a mystical tiger that only he seems to be aware of. Suspected to be behind the strange incidents, the 18-year-old is abruptly kicked out of the orphanage and left hungry, homeless, and wandering through the city.

&gt;While starving on a riverbank, Atsushi saves a rather eccentric man named Osamu Dazai from drowning. Whimsical suicide enthusiast and supernatural detective, Dazai has been investigating the same tiger that has been terrorizing the boy. Together with Dazai's partner Doppo Kunikida, they solve the mystery, but its resolution leaves Atsushi in a tight spot. As various odd events take place, Atsushi is coerced into joining their firm of supernatural investigators, taking on unusual cases the police cannot handle, alongside his numerous enigmatic co-workers.

[Ranpo Edogawa](http://bungostraydogs.wikia.com/wiki/Ranpo_Edogawa) - Wears a sterotypical detective get-up (Sherlock Holmes-esque). He has short black hair.

**[Tachiwara Michizou](http://bungostraydogs.wikia.com/wiki/Tachihara_Michizou)** - Short, wavy Orange hair with a bandage on his nose.

*Special case - Higuchi has never been confirmed or denied to have an Ability (even in the manga, according to the wiki page), so no one really knows if she has one or not.

I have another job but it's basically a type of internship for a few days a month.

He waited until after I got the position before trying to initiate a relationship, I think it was important for him not to give the impression he wanted anything in return.

I liked him, was attracted to him in a way, and the sex was really good. I did say that I wasn't interested in a  serious relationship as I had my own social life, in my home town for the rest of the month.

So he suggested that I stay with him for the few nights every month, and we got into a routine. I think one of the problems was that he's struggling to find other relationships, so he's perhaps over reliant on me.

We did have quite a good time together, but because of work commitments it was primarily confined to his home and really just based around sex.

I'm fairly broad minded sexually, after a while he started to ask for various things, like anal sex or some elements of BDSM. 

I actually think there was a kind of marked change, when he wanted to ejaculate on my face, which I let him do. I think there was an element of anger involved in him doing it. He was frustrated that I wasn't spending more time with him (he'd even offered to travel up to see me).

Last time I was with him, I refused to have penetrative sex with him for the 3 days, though I did agree to oral. Partly because my period was finishing and partly because I just wanted a break.

He didn't really take it well, though he backed down when it looked like I was considering ending the relationship.

I think that the change happened when I agreed to do certain of those sexual requests. That he lost respect for me and is now frustrated that I just won't drop my knickers and bend over whenever he wants?

Is that possibly the case?

We got to know each other at a bar just about after my first relationship of 2 years ended. In the beginning, things were kept simple and we only saw each other onces every few weeks. I wasn't ready for another relationship so we just met for some casual sex with we kept it really low key with a both having  good understanding of the situation. However as time passed we started sharing more and more on these casual nights and eventually started both to develop feelings for each other. We got together and everything went perfect from there on. The honeymoon phase ensued and things couldn't have been better for both of us. We are both students and we decided it would be a good idea to take a one year lease on an appartment which would significantly reduce both our living costs due to the expense rent of student flats. This lease was signed in July and runs from september till september. 

This introduction is important to know because some of the issues that I'm currently experiencing were already hidden in this timeframe. We met during his first year of University and starting dating in his second year of University. Since it was really low key, we didn't really talked about his work ethic for school. He has been struggling ever since he started university since he doesn't like what he is studying. I assumed it was just a phase since I also had to retake a year of University. I've been really supportive over the past 2 years since we have gotten really close and trying to listen to every problem he has with it and I tried to give advice where I can. But here lies the problem, he is seriously regretting his decision of his field of study and his failing grades have seriously dented his self-esteem. For the past 2 years I've had to listen to the details of his field of study which doesn't interest me in the least bit. We've had a lot of discussions about how school isn't everything and I want to talk about other stuff too but in practice this isn't possible since his relation with his parents is going to shit because of it as well and he barely sees any of his friends (maybe once a month). 

I'm really tired of the fact that we are having discussions all the time because his life is going to shit, gets frustrated and works it out on me. The worst part is I'm trying to be as understanding as I can be but sometimes he is putting to much stress on me with his problems. We didn't have a fun moment in months and his problems are affecting my mood negatively every day and I'm sick of it. I've been crying a lot because it's not working out since he doesn't have any discipline and doesn't do anything about it while I'm working my ass of at my internship during the day and writing my thesis in the evening during the week. 

However, deep down he is really a kind and genuine person and I wish nothing but the best for him. Since he doesn't have a large pool of friends and doesn't have a good relationship with his parents I'm the person who goes to discuss his problem and is around for 90% of the time. This isn't the person I want to spend the rest of my life with and will be able to achieve my personal goals. Breaking up would mean shattering the bit of self-esteem that is left (he says no one wants to be around and other similar things). I'm crying as I write this since I only want the best for both of us, but it's not working out. 

We've talked about this issue numerous amount of times but things arn't getting better and the romantic feelings are mostly gone because of this. I'm afraid to break up because I'm the only with whom he has shared all his problems and the trust building took a long while for this. I know if we should break up that he will need support or things will end badly for him which I do not want to happen. I really need some advice or shared experiences!


**tl;dr**: Romantic feelings are going because his school/ family problems keep dominating the relationship but I still care about him and do not want him to get hurt. I want to break up with him but don't know how and I'm afraid of the negative consequences for him even though the current relationship is breaking me mentally. "
4o1hqy,0,2016-06-14,How can Origen reach worlds?,thelightcoach,leagueoflegends,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/4o1hqy/how_can_origen_reach_worlds/,"This is just a post for worrying fans , analysts and ""experts"" who want to offer valid suggestions of how Origen can save their year and reach worlds.

Lets start then..

1) Find a new adc and have xpeke changing with POE at mid

First of all lets examine the case abit better . Lets assume they find a good adc that is a worthy replacement. Can they still be a top team to go to worlds? In my opinion no. The problem is that when xpeke is with the team he offers a ""calm"" factor and  some of the players e.g.amazing are playing around him more (focus in helping him). 

Some people call it the Hai effect but it is simply a player that people feel comfortable around him. He is a world champion who was playing the game since s1 while on the other hand POE is/was a new talent who his best achievement was 2nd place in a new rookie lcs team. Even that achievement is no longer something huge since g2 got first place.

How to solve that , simply make him play champs that can carry or he likes to play (even if they are off-meta)... remember jensen in his first split? This does't mean OG will become top team but you will get another threat in game and another target for picks/bans. This is important because teams will now start focusing top to tilt soaz and not allow him to carry .

Who can be the adc for OG? Creaton,hans sama (next year),tabz,Yuuki,Holyphoenix,p1noy,nien

Personally i will go for Creaton due to his lcs experience and the fact he never seemed to have caused problems.
Then bring hans sama . The only issue is that in tha past sometimes while always had good kda etc he did't seem to make an impact in games.

2) Organisational structure.

Personally i believe that for this year alone they should focus on xpeke playing and have a manager running the team. While adding part time analysts (even non paid) that want to act as interns. If players have staff working with them and not exactly coaching them could be a good alternative. 
They need to be ""knowledge ready"" before games.

I would personally add a business,life-coach for 1 month working with the team (whole organisation) 

3) Planning for the future

I believe unless they manage to make POE an integral part of the team they should make a change after worlds (or before if they dont make it). I also believe they need to find a replacement for amazing . I dont believe he has anything else to offer to the team.

Not sure if they can afford him but i would try to get rush or go for djoko,hans sama since they both have played together and fill in 2 roles (plus they speak french meaning soaz can communicate better).

Soaz

Djoko

Xpeke,xpepi?

Hans

Hybrid


Number 3 is more about the future and not how to reach worlds but i believe they need to make some moves right now.

Finally i believe this week could be the most important . If they manage to go 2-0 in boths games then they are back to the playoff's race."

Recently, I have had some incidents with co-workers that are leaving me feeling pretty drained. One co-worker of mine was assigning me clients without going through my supervisor. When I started to bring the clients up with to discuss in my supervision, it came to light that this coworker, we'll call her Sue, was not allowed to be assigning me cases. One of the cases Sue assigned me was a suicidal client who had not been seen in over a month before I started sessions with her. Sue had scheduled appointments with her, but had cancelled them all. I don't know if Sue ever got talked to about that incident, but my supervisor informed that what she had done was not in any way okay. Since then, Sue has been pretty passive-aggressive towards me. I hear her saying rude things to other co-workers regarding me, and we have since had several passive-aggressive encounters. About a month ago, Sue mentioned that there was a family that she might need some help with, and I told her that I could if she would let me know what I needed to do. After that, my caseload filled up, and my supervisor capped me and said if I really wanted to, I could take more clients, but advised me that I should not take any more clients. Yesterday, Sue asked me about working with the family. I apologized to her, and told her that my supervisor had declared my caseload full. Sue became pretty passive-aggressive, and I could sense that she was not happy. I directly told her that I felt like there was some discourse between us, and told her that if she could not find anyone to help her with the family, I would. Sue responded, ""No, no. I'll work it out myself"".

I'd like to talk to Sue to work out our issues directly, but I am unsure if this is the best course of action. I have spoken to my supervisor a couple of times about Sue and another, older, male clinician who was being pseudo-inappropriate to me (rubbing my shoulder when he would talk to me, grabbing my shoulders from behind and yelling in my ear to scare me for ""fun"", etc.), but have asked him to not do anything quite yet. I also had what seems to be a minor incident with the department supervisor. Once I transitioned from intern to employee, I was supposed to receive an office. My department supervisor kept telling me one thing and then changing her mind, and bottom line, I'm still in the intern space. This isn't overly bothersome, I like being able to talk to the other interns, however there has been another new hire (also an intern from the same company) who has already received an office. This part isn't too big of a deal, and I only add it because I am worried I am starting to take on a victim mentality, and need some perspective. 

I moved to my current city, in the Pacific Northwest, from a city in the Southeast about two years ago. I am adjusting fairly well to the cultural shift. When I moved here, I took a bachelor's level job at an inpatient psychiatric hospital. The environment there was fairly toxic, a lot of the staff were stressed and burnt out and angry. That, combined with a long commute led me to quit that job and work at a homeless shelter while I finished my school. The shelter was a great place to work, but I had a hard time connecting with my co-workers there. As an intern (at my current place of employment), I was pretty quiet. I tried to keep my head down for the most part and do my job. I did not go out of my way to make friends with my co-workers. At this point, I feel like the only person I have a solid relationship with at my job is my supervisor, who is leaving the company after 20 years of service due to ""a better opportunity, and some serious concerns about the company"". 

I guess I just need some help trying to untangle all of this mess. I'm wondering how much of my current situation is due to my own history of not connecting well with co-workers since moving to the PNW. I am trying to view things objectively, and figure out if I have adopted a victim mentality, if I am being scape-goated at my job, some combination of both, or something else entirely. 

I feel really passionately about serving in community-based mental health, and even turned down a private-practice position to start employment at my internship site. Now I'm wondering if I belong in community-based mental health. I want to be a part of my team, but also find it damn near impossible to form even base-line connections with people who I feel aren't respecting me. Can anyone please help me discern all of this? "
4o1thd,0,2016-06-14,Going to Sweden for a couple of months,[deleted],sweden,https://www.reddit.com/r/sweden/comments/4o1thd/going_to_sweden_for_a_couple_of_months/,"Hi /r/Sweden,

Currently, I'm working on my master degree in applied physics, and as a part of the program I am required to follow an internship somewhere. I quickly to do this abroad, and have chosen Sweden as my country of destination. (I'm from the Netherlands myself)

From the end of august until mid-December, I'll be in Linköping for my internship program at Linköping University. I did have a few questions about the country I would like to ask to you. The first ones that come to mind are:

- Is the country bicycle friendly? As I am Dutch, I am very used to get everywhere using my bicycle. It's my main mode of transportation, and I was wondering whether I should get a bicycle during my stay.
- And if not, how is the public transport in the country? And is it affordable? I probably won't be payed a lot, and I have looked around at the costs of renting a car during my stay. This is easily over 3000 euros (28k Swedish Crowns) at my age, which I definitely cannot afford.  

So basically I was wondering what's the best way to get around through the city and the country itself. Usually I take the bicycle in my country, unless I need to go further than 20km. Then it's usually public transport or the car. I do have a driving license, but getting a car during the entirety of my stay is probably too expensive for me.

- Are the major things I have to see or visit during my stay? I'll be 'working' full time, but I do also have some time off. 
- Also, I need a place to stay during my visit. Could anyone point me to a place to look for a room, for international students visiting for only a few months?
- Finally, I am working a bit on my Swedish on Duolingo. Does anyone know a place where I can find some easy reading in Swedish? Full literature is too hard for me at this point, but it always helps for me to read a bit more than just the single lines in DuoLingo.

I understand if this is not the best place to ask these questions here, but I could give it a try
Thank you for taking the time to read this.

4o1w00,80,2016-06-14,[Update] My [21F] live-in boyfriend [23M] and I just broke up last night after 2.5 happy years. Heartbroken and I need help.,thwawyf,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4o1w00/update_my_21f_livein_boyfriend_23m_and_i_just/,"OP: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4kze0z/my_21f_livein_boyfriend_23m_and_i_just_broke_up/

I'm mostly making this post because I'm so grateful for the dozens of supportive comments and PMs I got from people. Y'all are seriously beautiful and you helped me so much.

I ended up having to move back home, temporarily. I truly appreciated all of the advice about trying to make it in the city, and I was hellbent on making that work. Then the friend I was staying with didn't exactly work out (that's a longggg other story), and I was staying alone in my ex's apartment, with his stuff and only his stuff, while looking for another apartment. It was my personal hell, and every night I sobbed until I could finally pass out at 8. I was all set to stay and was looking at several apartments but it's surprisingly hard to find an apartment within about two days.

A very strange and kind hippie woman from one of the apartments I was looking at was rather concerned about me after I told her why I was looking for a room. She took me to dinner and listened to me talk for about three hours and offered some really insightful advice, the most important being to go where the love is. I was fragile, homeless, and had no one who loved me in the city, and being so fragile I wasn't in a position to even try to make new friends. She said if I had any *one* good thing in the city--a boyfriend, some good friends, a place to live, or a job I really loved--then I should definitely stay, but I didn't even have one of those. I was really proud of myself for trying, and for going to dinner with a strange lady--one of the things my ex was great at and I was not is being open to experiences and new people, and it's one of the things that broke us up. I *want* to be the kind of person that is open to anything, and I'm on my way to becoming that.

The ex and I had a long talk yesterday. He was mean and then not. He truly just wants to be alone right now. He wants us both to grow, and he wants to pursue his hobbies professionally, and I can admit that I wasn't mature enough to let him do that. I'm really childish in that I'm super into dudes who are super into their passions, but once we date I kind of expect that their only passion will be me. I'm suffocating. I definitely need to grow up and be happy with myself and my own hobbies and interests before I try to merge with another person again. I think this split is honestly the right thing for me too, and being alone for a while will be great for me. I just wish it hadn't tanked my entire life, but I've never been a girl with a backup plan. I also wish that he would admit that he's banking on us being together again in the future. I think he is, but he won't say it, because he's trying to like White Fang me or something. I won't wait around for that, though.

He's doing wrong here too, but he thinks it's the best thing for both of us. I do have a *lot* of growing up to do. He admitted that we would be a great couple after we've both take some time to work on ourselves, but we need to be completely apart from each other and grow, and then ""see what happens"". I know he's not bullshitting me, too. He's had photos posted on Facebook in the last few days and he looks absolutely miserable. I know what his happy smile looks like, and those pictures ain't it, so. I'd kill him if this whole thing was so he could see other people, but I really believe that it isn't. It's hard for both of us. We agreed last night to just be nice to each other, but that I won't contact him anymore. I'm sure we'll be friends when I move back to the city, and we can take it from there.

I'm playing piano again, I'm painting again, I'm hanging out with my friends and I was recently offered a 6-week internship teaching archery at a summer camp, which would be the perfect temporary gig while I'm here, and will help me toward my goal of working at a private high school when I move back to the city. So now I have to learn archery, which sounds pretty cool. This is also something I never would have been open to before, but now I'm just seeing where life takes me. Trying to be as outgoing and as kind as I can. My friends have been amazing, my parents have been great. I'm very very sad but I think things will be okay. Thanks to everyone who read all of this. It got rather long, but writing it out has been very helpful for me.

**tl;dr** Had to move home, quite sad, but things will be okay."

I'm an INTJ and one of my good buddies is an INFP.  He was job hunting and has a degree related to my industry, so I got him a paid internship here and have been training him on how to query databases.

He's done a good job of learning the concepts, but I'm very concerned about his ability to *apply* them.  He's a very smart/passionate dude, but when I ask him how he'd approach a technical problem, he sits there silently churning away, sometimes for a few minutes, only to come up with nothing, or come up with an idea that just doesn't make any logical sense if you think about it for a moment (it feels like he's ""reaching"" emotionally/intuitively, throwing out random ideas, without being grounded in any objective rationality).

I'm concerned, because I want the best for him, and I'd love to see him succeed here, but his inferior Te function is VERY apparent here; he is just not demonstrating the ability to organize ideas and systematically approach technical problems.  I don't expect him to know all that I know after doing this for years, but just to make educated guesses and come up with rough strategies...

I'm not seeing it.  Would highly value your thoughts.  I love the idea of him being on my team, but more and more I'm thinking he just doesn't have it in him."

(Btw, sorry for the extremely long post).

**Background:** I’ve been working on this script for roughly half a year now, since the Paris attacks happened. It really came out of this very dark place for me. I was thinking about themes like vengeance, and it got me thinking, what if someone went out there and terrorized ISIS back? So that’s kind of where the concept for this movie originated, since it’s about a rogue agent who basically humiliates ISIS in the best way possible, and becomes their worst nightmare.

The story grew from there and it became about a lot of different things, including radical Islam. I personally feel that radical Islam and its undeniable links to terrorism and the oppression of women and homosexuals are subjects that not a lot of movies these days even want to touch, even though that radical culture poses such a massive threat to our way of life both nationally and globally. And it's obviously because of the whole modern PC movement that we can’t even have a frank discussion about the problems. So hopefully, if nothing else, this script can serve as just one more talking point in our collective human quest for truth.

This screenplay has been kind of sitting on my hard drive for a few months now, but in light of the recent, incredibly tragic events this past weekend, I decided to finally add the finishing touches, and share it with the world. Any feedback, pointers, criticism, or assistance is welcome! Here is a link to the full screenplay (which is 133 pages long): http://docdro.id/CZoGyUi.

And for those of you TLDR folks, I have some nice condensed versions of the story below as well, in case you just want to get the gist of it. If you guys know any producers, directors, actors, etc. who might be interested in making this into a film, by all means send it to them. Thanks!

**TLDR:** Wrote this screenplay out of anger/anguish following the Paris attacks, and more recently the Orlando attack. Full screenplay link above, shorter summaries below.

**Logline:** The film is about a lesbian CIA agent, whose wife has been captured by the Islamic State, so she goes on a rampage—targets and brutally kills many top IS officials—and then posts it all on YouTube.

**Short Synopsis:** The film is about a former CIA agent named Silvia Church who is called back into duty when the CIA wants to organize a meet-up with a potential ISIS defector, Bakar al-Moradi. Silvia is the perfect woman for the job because she is simultaneously an outstanding agent, and ironically completely expendable because of her past with the CIA. Secretly, Silvia has a personal vendetta against the Islamic State—and radical Muslims in general—because in September of 2014, they abducted her wife, Azhara, who was a member of the Peace Corps in Syria. Since then, Silvia has vowed to do everything in her power to put a dent in ISIS, and maybe even get her wife back. When she gets inside the Islamic State, she meets with Bakar al-Moradi, and forces him to do her bidding as she targets and kills 10 top IS officials, and wreaks havoc on the men who took her wife away from her. She has al-Moradi videotape her killing spree. She then proceeds to post all of the videos to YouTube, becoming an overnight viral sensation, much to ISIS’s and the CIA’s chagrin.

**Full Synopsis:** *(SPOILER ALERT: This contains the full ending of the film. If you don’t wish to know the ending, or you want to read the script first, don’t read this.)* We open with two women at a swanky restaurant. One of them is Silvia Church, a masculine woman who obviously doesn’t wear make-up, and a more feminine woman named Azhara Sebastien. They are lovers, and they seem very happy. That is until Azhara suddenly and inexplicably has an AK-47 pointed at her head. Silvia wakes up, panting. It was a dream. But the reality is that Azhara is no longer with her. We discover more later on.

Flying in a helicopter, high over Washington, DC, a CIA official named Joseph Vitter meets with one of his agents, Max Villanova. Vitter discusses the situation in Syria, and we learn that an ISIS official named Bakar al-Moradi wants to defect to the United States. Both Vitter and Max are pretty skeptical about the likelihood that this isn’t a trap. Nonetheless, Vitter decides to proceed with a mission to meet and negotiate with al-Moradi by bringing back one of his old agents, Silvia Church.

Silvia arrives at the CIA headquarters and immediately starts wreaking havoc with everyone she meets—at one moment intimidating an intern, and the next, pointing a gun at another low-level CIA employee. We get the sense that she isn’t entirely stable. After accepting the mission and being debriefed on the airplane to Turkey, Silvia goes off about the religion of Islam, and in particular, its treatment of homosexuals. For her, the religion is the problem.

In a backroom on the plane, Vitter talks with one of his CIA peers, Jess Spier, and reveals that Silvia’s wife had been abducted by ISIS in 2014, and that this is the cause for her anger and desire for revenge. Jess expresses doubts that Silvia will be able to complete the mission, nevertheless she does not try to pull the plug.

Arriving at a U.S. base in Turkey, Silvia stocks up on weapons and ammunition, and starts her journey across the desert into Syria. Once across the border, she meets Mohammad, a CIA operative who will help her get into ISIS. At first, she seems to dislike and disparage him because of his background, but over the course of the film, she grows to like and respect him.

They get past the Islamic State border unscathed, despite raising some mild suspicions with the border guards. That night, Silvia sets out to meet al-Moradi. She meets him on a bridge in Raqqa that goes over the Euphrates River. She is shocked when she sees him for the first time, because he is a white man with blue eyes. Prior to his life in the Islamic State, al-Moradi had been a guy named Joe from the United States. It isn’t explicitly explained in the story, but it can be inferred that he became indoctrinated with the radical Islamic beliefs purported by the Islamic State, and decided to move there. He has since regretted his decision and now seeks political asylum within the U.S. After learning this, Silvia essentially refuses to negotiate with him and instead forces him to bow to her and call her his “Goddess”.  He obeys under the threat of being killed, and then names ten ISIS officials that become the targets of her killing spree that same night.

She gives al-Moradi a camcorder and has him film her executing terrorists in the middle of the night, most of them unwittingly sleeping in their beds with their wives when she kills them. She then posts it all to YouTube. When Vitter gets wind of her killing spree the next day, he immediately starts doing damage control. He talks with Max and they decide that the best course of action is assassination.

That morning, Silvia enters the apartment where she and Mohammad had been staying. Mohammad has a gun pointed at her, and they talk for a few moments. Mohammad reveals that he doesn’t intend to shoot her, even though he has been ordered by the CIA to do so. He then proceeds to tell her that he knows the man who took her wife. He is telling her this because his own wife was kidnapped and killed by the Islamic State, and therefore he empathizes with her revenge-quest. He tells her that the man who took her wife was named Husaam Baari Halim.

She goes with Al-Moradi to Halim’s house, wearing a full burka. They get to Halim’s house, which is gated, and Silvia forces Al-Moradi to use the call button and pretend that she is his wife. However, Al-Moradi, having had enough of Silvia’s shenanigans, instead tells Halim in Arabic that he is being held hostage and that when Halim opens the door he should immediately shoot Silvia. Silvia is unable to understand Arabic, but she nonetheless senses something is wrong when they get to the door, and it doesn’t open for awhile. She puts her ear to the door, and hears Halim loading a rifle on the other side. She immediately scales the wall of the house, and perches on top of the doorframe. Just when Halim walks out, she jumps on top of him, and tackles him to the ground. She then shoots Al-Moradi in the shoulder in order to incapacitate him. Then she leads Halim back inside the house so she can sweep for anyone else who might try to attack her.

At one moment, while they are in the kitchen, she sees Halim’s wife, holding a knife. She doesn’t see them, however, and Silvia quickly shoots and kills her. That’s when Silvia threatens to kill anyone else in the house and Halim starts talking. Ultimately she holds Halim’s two sons and second wife hostage as he reveals to her that Azhara is still alive, and was ultimately wedded to a man named Dayaan Soltani. After interrogating him, she kills him, grabs Al-Moradi and drives the car back to Mohammad’s apartment.

When she gets to the apartment, she looks for Mohammad, but he doesn’t seem to be there. Just then, she is ambushed by two CIA assassins, Ryan and Peter. She and Al-Moradi get taken to a warehouse where she is to be killed. However, just when Ryan is about to shoot her, Mohammad appears and grabs him by the neck, putting a gun to his head. Mohammad forces Ryan to toss his gun to Silvia, and Silvia in turn aims her gun at Peter. The situation becomes a standoff, with no one willing to budge. Finally, Peter takes his eyes away from Silvia for a brief moment, and Silvia, being the excellent shot she is, uses the opportunity to shoot Peter’s gun right out of his hand. She kills Peter and Ryan and decides to leave al-Moradi behind at the warehouse for the CIA to pick him up. Back at the CIA, Vitter destroys all materials relating to Silvia, while the CIA chief makes a speech, completely denying any ties the CIA may have had with her.

At Dayaan’s apartment, Dayaan, his men, and the Syrian police prepare to secure the entire area in preparation for Silvia’s attack. That night, she arrives by the roof, making her way down through the building as she searches for Dayaan’s apartment. She kills dozens of IS troops along the way, and is badly wounded a couple of times herself, though she has a bullet-proof vest that saves her from what could’ve been multiple lethal hits.

Finally, she gets to Dayaan’s apartment, kills his henchmen, but when finally facing Dayaan, she is bested, partially because she is already badly wounded. He shoots her several times in the chest, winding her, before he realizes that she is wearing a bullet-proof vest. He then takes off her vest, prepares to shoot her in the chest for real, but at that moment, she lets a grenade roll out of her hand, and before Dayaan has time to react, it explodes and he dies. She loses her arm in the explosion as she is flung across the room.

Nonetheless she somehow gets back on her feet, laughing and spitting on Dayaan’s remains. She has been victorious. However at that moment, from the other side of the room, a woman in a full burka appears carrying a rifle. Silvia swivels around and they both shoot each other simultaneously.

Silvia, no longer wearing the vest, now has a fatal shot to the chest. She nevertheless manages to crawl up to the woman, now lying dead on the other side of the room, and remove her hedjob, only to realize—it is Azhara. Azhara had become so brainwashed by the Islamic State, that she’d shot her own wife. And Silvia, not knowing it had been Azhara underneath the burka, had shot her back. In a moment of pure anguish, Silvia cries over Azhara’s dead body. Then puts her arm over her shoulder and tells her “we’ll go together.” The film ends with the IS backup troops storming the room, only to find the two women lying together, dead.

I was not sure if I should post here or r/askwomen, but I would like some help.

Backstory:

I am currently continuing my internship that I started before I graduated from high school. I am leaving in August since I will be moving out of state to begin my college career. I really like my internship and it is in the field which I would like to pursue. 

My issue is that there is this older man that works in my office that is not only distracting me from my work, but also outside the office as well. Lets call him Steve. Steve is very attractive and has the most amazing voice I have ever heard. I have only spoken to him a few times in passing. 

For the past couple months I have found Steve incredibly attractive. It is the first time I have ever been this attracted to a guy. I have had crushes of course but this is something different. I find myself constantly day dreaming and fantasizing about him. Like any young female, I masterbate and he constantly jumps to my thoughts. I know he is taken and he has not flirted with me at all, and that is why I am so concerned.

Again, I have never felt this way about someone and I am not going to act on these thoughts. I feel so guilty for having them. If I was in his girlfriends shoes and knew another girl was thinking about my boyfriend like this I would be pissed!

My question is, how do I get rid of these thoughts. I went on a date last weekend but the guy was not anything I would be interested in pursuing. I leave for college in less than two months, I assume these thoughts will fade but this being the first time this has happened to me, I am not sure. Anyone else been through this?

tl;dr; Lusting after fellow coworker who is taken, I want these thoughts to go away.

She has al-Moradi videotape her killing spree. She then proceeds to post all of the videos to YouTube, becoming an overnight viral sensation, much to ISIS’s and the CIA’s chagrin.

**Full Synopsis:** *(SPOILER ALERT: This contains the full ending of the film. If you don’t wish to know the ending, or you want to read the script first, don’t read this.)* We open with two women at a swanky restaurant. One of them is Silvia Church, a masculine woman who obviously doesn’t wear make-up, and a more feminine woman named Azhara Sebastien. They are lovers, and they seem very happy. That is until Azhara suddenly and inexplicably has an AK-47 pointed at her head. Silvia wakes up, panting. It was a dream. But the reality is that Azhara is no longer with her. We discover more later on.

Flying in a helicopter, high over Washington, DC, a CIA official named Joseph Vitter meets with one of his agents, Max Villanova. Vitter discusses the situation in Syria, and we learn that an ISIS official named Bakar al-Moradi wants to defect to the United States. Both Vitter and Max are pretty skeptical about the likelihood that this isn’t a trap. Nonetheless, Vitter decides to proceed with a mission to meet and negotiate with al-Moradi by bringing back one of his old agents, Silvia Church.

Silvia arrives at the CIA headquarters and immediately starts wreaking havoc with everyone she meets—at one moment intimidating an intern, and the next, pointing a gun at another low-level CIA employee. We get the sense that she isn’t entirely stable. After accepting the mission and being debriefed on the airplane to Turkey, Silvia goes off about the religion of Islam, and in particular, its treatment of homosexuals. For her, the religion is the problem.

In a backroom on the plane, Vitter talks with one of his CIA peers, Jess Spier, and reveals that Silvia’s wife had been abducted by ISIS in 2014, and that this is the cause for her anger and desire for revenge. Jess expresses doubts that Silvia will be able to complete the mission, nevertheless she does not try to pull the plug.

Arriving at a U.S. base in Turkey, Silvia stocks up on weapons and ammunition, and starts her journey across the desert into Syria. Once across the border, she meets Mohammad, a CIA operative who will help her get into ISIS. At first, she seems to dislike and disparage him because of his background, but over the course of the film, she grows to like and respect him.

They get past the Islamic State border unscathed, despite raising some mild suspicions with the border guards. That night, Silvia sets out to meet al-Moradi. She meets him on a bridge in Raqqa that goes over the Euphrates River. She is shocked when she sees him for the first time, because he is a white man with blue eyes. Prior to his life in the Islamic State, al-Moradi had been a guy named Joe from the United States. It isn’t explicitly explained in the story, but it can be inferred that he became indoctrinated with the radical Islamic beliefs purported by the Islamic State, and decided to move there. He has since regretted his decision and now seeks political asylum within the U.S. After learning this, Silvia essentially refuses to negotiate with him and instead forces him to bow to her and call her his “Goddess”.  He obeys under the threat of being killed, and then names ten ISIS officials that become the targets of her killing spree that same night.

She gives al-Moradi a camcorder and has him film her executing terrorists in the middle of the night, most of them unwittingly sleeping in their beds with their wives when she kills them. She then posts it all to YouTube. When Vitter gets wind of her killing spree the next day, he immediately starts doing damage control. He talks with Max and they decide that the best course of action is assassination.

That morning, Silvia enters the apartment where she and Mohammad had been staying. Mohammad has a gun pointed at her, and they talk for a few moments. Mohammad reveals that he doesn’t intend to shoot her, even though he has been ordered by the CIA to do so. He then proceeds to tell her that he knows the man who took her wife. He is telling her this because his own wife was kidnapped and killed by the Islamic State, and therefore he empathizes with her revenge-quest. He tells her that the man who took her wife was named Husaam Baari Halim.

She goes with Al-Moradi to Halim’s house, wearing a full burka. They get to Halim’s house, which is gated, and Silvia forces Al-Moradi to use the call button and pretend that she is his wife. However, Al-Moradi, having had enough of Silvia’s shenanigans, instead tells Halim in Arabic that he is being held hostage and that when Halim opens the door he should immediately shoot Silvia. Silvia is unable to understand Arabic, but she nonetheless senses something is wrong when they get to the door, and it doesn’t open for awhile. She puts her ear to the door, and hears Halim loading a rifle on the other side. She immediately scales the wall of the house, and perches on top of the doorframe. Just when Halim walks out, she jumps on top of him, and tackles him to the ground. She then shoots Al-Moradi in the shoulder in order to incapacitate him. Then she leads Halim back inside the house so she can sweep for anyone else who might try to attack her.

At one moment, while they are in the kitchen, she sees Halim’s wife, holding a knife. She doesn’t see them, however, and Silvia quickly shoots and kills her. That’s when Silvia threatens to kill anyone else in the house and Halim starts talking. Ultimately she holds Halim’s two sons and second wife hostage as he reveals to her that Azhara is still alive, and was ultimately wedded to a man named Dayaan Soltani. After interrogating him, she kills him, grabs Al-Moradi and drives the car back to Mohammad’s apartment.

When she gets to the apartment, she looks for Mohammad, but he doesn’t seem to be there. Just then, she is ambushed by two CIA assassins, Ryan and Peter. She and Al-Moradi get taken to a warehouse where she is to be killed. However, just when Ryan is about to shoot her, Mohammad appears and grabs him by the neck, putting a gun to his head. Mohammad forces Ryan to toss his gun to Silvia, and Silvia in turn aims her gun at Peter. The situation becomes a standoff, with no one willing to budge. Finally, Peter takes his eyes away from Silvia for a brief moment, and Silvia, being the excellent shot she is, uses the opportunity to shoot Peter’s gun right out of his hand. She kills Peter and Ryan and decides to leave al-Moradi behind at the warehouse for the CIA to pick him up. Back at the CIA, Vitter destroys all materials relating to Silvia, while the CIA chief makes a speech, completely denying any ties the CIA may have had with her.

At Dayaan’s apartment, Dayaan, his men, and the Syrian police prepare to secure the entire area in preparation for Silvia’s attack. That night, she arrives by the roof, making her way down through the building as she searches for Dayaan’s apartment. She kills dozens of IS troops along the way, and is badly wounded a couple of times herself, though she has a bullet-proof vest that saves her from what could’ve been multiple lethal hits.

Finally, she gets to Dayaan’s apartment, kills his henchmen, but when finally facing Dayaan, she is bested, partially because she is already badly wounded. He shoots her several times in the chest, winding her, before he realizes that she is wearing a bullet-proof vest. He then takes off her vest, prepares to shoot her in the chest for real, but at that moment, she lets a grenade roll out of her hand, and before Dayaan has time to react, it explodes and he dies. She loses her arm in the explosion as she is flung across the room.

Nonetheless she somehow gets back on her feet, laughing and spitting on Dayaan’s remains. She has been victorious. However at that moment, from the other side of the room, a woman in a full burka appears carrying a rifle. Silvia swivels around and they both shoot each other simultaneously.

Silvia, no longer wearing the vest, now has a fatal shot to the chest. She nevertheless manages to crawl up to the woman, now lying dead on the other side of the room, and remove her hedjob, only to realize—it is Azhara. Azhara had become so brainwashed by the Islamic State, that she’d shot her own wife. And Silvia, not knowing it had been Azhara underneath the burka, had shot her back. In a moment of pure anguish, Silvia cries over Azhara’s dead body. Then puts her arm over her shoulder and tells her “we’ll go together.” The film ends with the IS backup troops storming the room, only to find the two women lying together, dead."

(Btw, sorry for the extremely long post).

**Background:** I’ve been working on this script for roughly half a year now, since the Paris attacks happened. It really came out of this very dark place for me. I was thinking about themes like vengeance, and it got me thinking, what if someone went out there and terrorized ISIS back? So that’s kind of where the concept for this movie originated, since it’s about a rogue agent who basically humiliates ISIS in the best way possible, and becomes their worst nightmare.

The story grew from there and it became about a lot of different things, including radical Islam. I personally feel that radical Islam and its undeniable links to terrorism and the oppression of women and homosexuals are subjects that not a lot of movies these days even want to touch, even though that radical culture poses such a massive threat to our way of life both nationally and globally. And it's obviously because of the whole modern PC movement that we can’t even have a frank discussion about the problems. So hopefully, if nothing else, this script can serve as just one more talking point in our collective human quest for truth.

This screenplay has been kind of sitting on my hard drive for a few months now, but in light of the recent, incredibly tragic events this past weekend, I decided to finally add the finishing touches, and share it with the world. Any feedback, pointers, criticism, or assistance is welcome! Here is a link to the full screenplay (which is 133 pages long): http://docdro.id/CZoGyUi.

And for those of you TLDR folks, I have some nice condensed versions of the story below as well, in case you just want to get the gist of it. If you guys know any producers, directors, actors, etc. who might be interested in making this into a film, by all means send it to them. Thanks!

**TLDR:** Wrote this screenplay out of anger/anguish following the Paris attacks, and more recently the Orlando attack. Full screenplay link above, shorter summaries below.

**Logline:** The film is about a lesbian CIA agent, whose wife has been captured by the Islamic State, so she goes on a rampage—targets and brutally kills many top IS officials—and then posts it all on YouTube.

**Short Synopsis:** The film is about a former CIA agent named Silvia Church who is called back into duty when the CIA wants to organize a meet-up with a potential ISIS defector, Bakar al-Moradi. Silvia is the perfect woman for the job because she is simultaneously an outstanding agent, and ironically completely expendable because of her past with the CIA. Secretly, Silvia has a personal vendetta against the Islamic State—and radical Muslims in general—because in September of 2014, they abducted her wife, Azhara, who was a member of the Peace Corps in Syria. Since then, Silvia has vowed to do everything in her power to put a dent in ISIS, and maybe even get her wife back. When she gets inside the Islamic State, she meets with Bakar al-Moradi, and forces him to do her bidding as she targets and kills 10 top IS officials, and wreaks havoc on the men who took her wife away from her.

4o3ags,2,2016-06-14,I'm fucked up and criticism would be constructive.,ZingLinger,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/4o3ags/im_fucked_up_and_criticism_would_be_constructive/,"I met this girl working in the same restaurant as me. Slowly but surely I flirted with her and we eventually started going out. I heard a rumor she slept around a lot. Well, this was encouraging to be honest. We go out once and have a good time, very shyly kissing me. This turned out to be a game, something she refused to tell me about afterwards. Next time we saw each other we went all the way. The first date and third date involved her talking about ex boyfriends about ~2/3rds the time.

The second date she whined about her roommate. 4th date when I wanted to talk a bit before sex it was like pulling an arm and a leg. Now that I think about it, she never offered much to me as a person. The next couple dates were mostly sex, although at times she wanted to hang out and go to restaurants. Last date she shit tested me saying ""you only like me for my tits"" but I told her otherwise. At that point she leaves for an internship in Kansas, going for two months. She said she ll be gone for 2 months. We hug and say a quick goodbye and I ask her to keep in touch. She says ""she ll try her best"" with a smile.

Looking back, I always to do a lot of chasing. She was always playing hard to get (except in bed, she was easy.) I would try to be light and open with a joke and she would give me distant, cold attitudes. It wasn't fun and by the end of it, it was difficult for me to get horny for her. I didn't like her attitude. She was so self centered and egotistical. She was shy, true, but it seemed like she was generally pretentious. Not because she gave the cold shoulder and I acknowledge that I'm not the coolest, funniest or most interesting guy in the world, but because everything always had to be about her. She barely listened or let me speak on the first date, checking her phone multiple times when is spoke at one point, just to make it look like she was checking something. It seemed spiteful. She was great in bed, but had a pretentious, stuck up and entitled attitude. I showed her vulnerability, I tried to be open and light. I showed her weakness at time. One day we were showering together and I was at the edge, where I didn't feel like trying to be cool or confident anymore. I never showered with a girl before so I just thought ""let's let her take the wheel"" on this one. After some initial cold and awkward moments, I guess she got the point. It was ok from there. Throughout the friends with benefits relationship, there were moments where she was vulnerable, showed kindness or was sweet. Barely, but few.

I texted her yesterday, about a month since we last spoke. Her responses were cold, one worded or matter of fact. She had completely decided to ignore me and give me the cold shoulder. After an ""indeed."" response I asked her ""penny for your thoughts? "" but she never responded. I feel mad that I'm ignored. It's totally fair that she doesn't want to talk to me, though that still felt rude. I was hesitant to make contact with her because I knew I would get Ice Queen in return. Because me trying to be nice to her would just feed into her ego. She probably got off to to the fact that she could ignore someone. Ok, I'm kidding, but as fair as it is, I am upset about this. I did some serious growing up throughout the 2 months together. I started off needy, not knowing what to say to a girl and today I'm more relaxed, confident and less preoccupied with my emotions. I admit that trying to talk to her yesterday was part of me trying out the ""new me"" with a ""fuck it, it probably won't work but let's see"" attitude.

I met a girl at a party that I want to go out with, I was kind of waiting for a back up since I pretty much knew this girl was going to give me attitude. It was a defense mechanism, it seemed like a suicide mission. I have something to fall back on now. I put in a lot of work and emotional overthinking into this first girl and looking back, she definitely isn't worth it. This second girl I met was open, conversed and seemed nice. I immediately had a much better vibe and thought she was cool.

Maybe I'm the egotistical one, I recognize the first girl's pretentiousness because I used to be shy and had arrogance covering up my weaknesses. I saw my old self in her. But maybe I'm just whining because I didn't get a response I wanted. I'll admit I was mostly testing the waters, but I wanted friendship with her. Though I would not have minded having sex with her when she came back. My mind unconsciously focuses a lot on her and spends a lot of energy thinking about her. I found myself thinking of her as my girlfriend many times. I'm attached to her. But it's wrong. I want to give this new girl a clean slate."
4o3ena,4,2016-06-14,Is there any way to have a SQL live connection dashboard viewing solution without shelling out the $10k for Tableau Server?,adhi-,tableau,https://www.reddit.com/r/tableau/comments/4o3ena/is_there_any_way_to_have_a_sql_live_connection/,"Thing is, I'm the lone BI intern at a startup. I don't have any BI colleagues so I'm the only one doing BI reporting and data analysis and etc. for the org. On top of this, my audience is only 2-3 people. I'm using Tableau Desktop for Students and have created a SQL db for the org and connecting tableau for that, but if I want to share the dashboard with my leadership, I can only give them a packaged workbook with the data extracted. I would like for them to be able to open the dashboard and refresh the datasource as often as they would like. 

Because of the size/stage of the org and the amount of usage (only one creator and less than 5 viewers), Tableau Server is too much to pay for. Any ideas for a workaround? Are there other plans for pricing besides the $10k for 10 creators? If there was a $1k for one user for one year, we may consider it, and its even more likely if it's less than that!"
4o3q75,4,2016-06-14,My opinion on what happened to the HL franchise and why.,cmtrapp02,HalfLife,https://www.reddit.com/r/HalfLife/comments/4o3q75/my_opinion_on_what_happened_to_the_hl_franchise/,"I know stuff similar has been posted here before, but this is my first time posting so I thought I mine as well go in depth on what I personally think happened to the HL franchise. It's rant time so get ready. I need to get this off my chest, I'd appreciate if you guys would respond with your opinions or at least read this.
 Sigh... We, more than ever, feel the pain of Half-Life especially right now. With e3 done and gone, it's just salt on the wound. And that wound is Valve's silence. 10 years, 10 friggen years since the last Half-Life game. Back then we were promised a 3rd installment that would reveal what happens after that horribly timed cliff hanger. but years have passed and nothing has happened. Valve is silent, they refuse to speak on the matter. It really makes you wonder if they even care about their first franchise that got them where they are. Well Today, I'm going to attempt to put out my thoughts on what I think happened, and why.

 Half-Life 3 was promised back in 2007-2008ish. At the time it was going to be an episode, the last in the trilogy. But it eventually got cancelled. My opinion is that they realized the episodic content just isn't that innovative. Sure they get stuff out fast, but HL was nolonger being the pioneer of the industry that it was renowned to be. So, they scrapped it, decided to go for a full game that would wrap up the series and innovate in some way.

 At this time, they were realizing the new trend throughout the industry. Games were changing from a platform, to a service. Online gaming was getting bigger and more profitable. And single player games just didn't bring in enough revenue. They realized this with TF2. After the TF2 orange box release, it changed drastically through free updates and well done micro transactions. Mostly through in-game hats. These free updates kept the community coming back, and the micros transactions kept the money flowing.

 So, Valve obviously couldn't just make another Half-Life game with a retro single player style. So they tested it with Portal 2. Portal 2 was amazingly well done both in story and gameplay. The puzzles and witty dialogue was unparralled by any other game. And that was great, except, the co-op element didn't do so well. Sure people played and enjoyed co-op, but it didn't keep people coming back. And certainly didn't sell hats. Shortly after this, CS:GO and Dota 2 where released, further proving the model that online play just sells well. And also behind the scenes, was VR. A new technology that Valve was, and certainly has been pioneering.

 VR was big focus of many employees and a tough challenge at that. So Valve had, and still has many projects going on. They constantly maintain their current multiplayer games, maintain steam, and work more on VR. So even if they wanted to, HL3 couldn't be made because they are too busy. Now, with VR out the door, and the games being not that hard to maintain, You'd think they have time. And you'd probably be right. But let's be honest, if HL3 where to be announced today, it would probably make record breaking sales on pre-orders alone, but still wouldn't amount to the insane monies they get from Dota 2, CS:GO and TF2.

 A new HL3 would take manpower, good innovative ideas, and money. Now, Valve has all of those. But is it really worth all that if in the end, it's a single player game that will die sooner than any other multiplayer games? I'd imagine as an employee that has to think about the way they do things more than the average game dev does, it doesn't really sound like a good idea. ""B-But, what about the community? Half Life fans deserve a new game for all their patience!"" Yes, I agree. But once again, as a Valve employee, who are you going to listen to? The couple thousand dying HL fans? or hundreds of thousands if not millions of Dota 2 fans? Sure, you feel bad about the community you've left to die, but that community isn't the money maker, and isn't as innovative. Because the unfortunate fact is, there is a lot more to innovate in multiplayer than there is single player.

 Okay, so let's say this is all true, then why is Valve silent? why don't they just tell us that there isn't going to be another HL game anytime soon? In my opinion, they could silent for several possible reasons. Reason 1, they aren't done with HL. There will be a HL again someday, but probably not soon. For this reason, they aren't going to say no, but at the same time, they don't want to say yes. If they say it's not happening, then they lie. If they say it is, then they hype us up for something that is far into the future.
 
Reason 2. They could be working on it, and it is happening sooner than we believe. If they are working towards HL3 being the next game, they don’t want anyone hyped until they know that it is ready. I personally find this to be unlikely, but it is still a possibility.

Reason 3. They aren’t working on it at all, but the little hype there still is keeps giving them attention, which intern gives them money. If they said no, they’d risk not being the same awesome Valve they used to be by not giving us what we want at all. I find this to be the least likely possibility, as I do think Hl3 will happen.

Reason 4. They don’t know what to do with it. Valve might actually be stuck between a rock and a hard place with this game. They need to innovate with HL just like it always has. And in order to do that they can’t make another retro styled game. But, from what they have learned with portal 2, monetizing single player just doesn’t work the same as multiplayer. They also have a rabid fan base that they do care about, but can’t fully please without innovation. So, they stay silent, rather than talk about something they are unsure of.

Now on Valves silence. Now I do think that some of these options would justify their silence more than others. However, I don’t think any of them justify it completely. Valve, in my opinion, is hurting their fan base more with their silence then they would be saying something. Now by something I don’t mean a release date, and I don’t mean a yes answer either. If Valve would at least acknowledge their community, give it some attention, it would be all for the better. Give us a, yes we are working on it, or no we aren’t. Or don’t even. Pay some respect to you franchise on anniversaries. Give us something. Your community is dying Valve, and from what you claim you don’t like that. The more you ignore us, the more we ignore you.

So, this is painful, it’s honestly unhealthy how much I obsess over Valve and their ips. Enough is enough. I’m going into hibernation. And by that I mean I’m done constantly checking up on Valve, and Half-life. I don’t want to look at the HL subreddit until I’ve heard official news from Valve. I can’t keep obsessing over a company that is different from what I want, and a game that will not come out anytime soon. I will of course continue to play Valves mulitplayer games. But I’ve played HL2 too many times, obsessed over its beauty and masterful environment for too long. HL2 and its episodes continue to be my favorite games of all time to date, but I must bury it deep for now. This sounds rather dramatic I know, but I just feel it’s be better if I cut off ties from HL until there is once again a real reason to care. And as for Valve, well they are still my favorite gaming company, but I’m going to check up on them a lot less, and try to be patient, and enjoy the other thousands of awesome games out there that deserve the attention just as much. 

Welp, that was my rant, sorry it was so long, but I needed to get it off my chest. Thanks for reading, and please give me your opinions on what you think.

4o3zwj,163,2016-06-14,Tomorrow is a big day for my Surface 3 and me!,[deleted],Surface,https://www.reddit.com/r/Surface/comments/4o3zwj/tomorrow_is_a_big_day_for_my_surface_3_and_me/,"I bought my Surface 3 in September because I wanted a light extension of my MacBook Pro so that I didn't had to carry around so much weight while working on my Master's dissertation.

The little thing, because it was always with me, became a central piece for my work and by December it was my main computer. It was my companion to the libraries, to a internship and to many meetings with my professors. It changed the way I like to work with a computer, made me go paper less, saved me some money when I started to use Drawboard to read my papers instead of printing them...

My hobbies also changed a bit, I had bough a Wacom Bamboo to drawn the previous week and returned it, it made no sense to own it with the Surface. I bought a microSD to my camera so that I could see my photos on the go with no cables... things like that.

Then I moved to a new country, still waiting for my dissertation to be approved, waiting for the sign to fill the papers and print the beast.

Most of the forms had to be filled by hand, I had no idea where the nearest library was to print them... it was not important, my Surface allowed me to write directly on the files. Save. Send. Done.

All from the comfort of my bed.

Tomorrow I will face the judge and defend my hard work. I built my presentation in a second screen plugged to the Surface, worked on it in the airplane home and tomorrow I will plug it to the projector and... well that's it.

It's silly to give such importance to a computer, but I was (am) kind of burned out from the emotional stress created during the degree and this computer really eased my life... using Apple's slogan: It just worked.

I know it was not the same for most of you guys, I followed your struggles with the SP4 and SB, but I had no major problems with my Surface 3, Windows 10 is awesome (it came with 8), it has been working as well as my MacBooks ever worked.

I own the 4GB model and it fits my needs perfectly.

I really wanted to share this because I am feeling nervous about tomorrow and kind of scared and needed a distraction...

Wish me luck and thanks for reading!!!

Edit: I did not die yesterday, I did my presentation within the time I was given, I answered all the questions and I passed! Now I have a Master degree and I am done with school for the next 50 years or so... My plans for the future consist in enjoying this thing called ""free time"", I never experienced it to its fullness. It's true that I work, but I barely remember no having to do school work, so... it's special now.

Regarding the Surface 3, I am now curious to see what uses I will give it (besides watching netflix), I bought it for school work and now I closed that chapter of my life... I don't want it to stay on my desk how it's happening until now.

Thank you very much for all your support! :D"
4o4iam,23,2016-06-14,Anyone producing / writing / arranging / engineering / playing on a lot of pop tracks?,Red_PillCosby,audioengineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/audioengineering/comments/4o4iam/anyone_producing_writing_arranging_engineering/,"I'm just about to finish my music production degree in the fall, and I've landed an internship at a mastering house in a location that isn't hot, but has a lot great talent (players, not band-wise). I think it might be a good place to use my free time gathering players, writing tunes, arranging for em, producing some tracks, etc. And I really hope to work my way up to producer somewhere... I used to be a die hard alt kid, it was all I listened to... But there seems to have been some blurred lines (ha ha ha) between alternative and pop right now in how well their major acts are received, number of fans, some arrangement things (alt tunes I hear on the radio have some clearly manipulated elements to help them blend with the playlist) and I generally don't like where it's going on the charts lately.  So I'm kind of dabbling around in both genres, though I love any jazz, classical, and traditional genres. 

Anyways, a lot of the discussions in the pop realm I've had with successful engineers revolve around the old phrase ""how do you make a small fortune in the music industry? Start with a large fortune!"" and lead to us discussing how homogenous the charts really are lately. Looking at tunes like Sugar by Maroon 5 versus Birthday by Katy Perry, California Girls by Katy Perry versus Tik Tok by Ke$ha (Dr. Luke, really). Of course with producers and tunesmiths like Dr. Luke cranking singles out for the majors, it seems that choosing from their roster of artists is sort of akin to buying a generic store brand of paper towels from grocery store A or grocery store B. They're shipped out from the same place, but they've got a slightly different label. I don't look at a set of pop tunes in a year as having a formula as much as a recipe (808s, four on the floor throughout or at the chorus, vocal harmonies or doubles panned out and subtle in the mix to aid the lead vocal, stingray bass sounds are in, synth strings, strummy rhythmic strat playing, etc).

But how do you guys deal with this when you're working on a track that has to compete? I don't think authenticity would even be a question when writing pop, seeing all these law suits with today's big artists and yesterday's old artists, and hearing that lyricists in pop often recycle words from hits that year for new tunes. And I - V - vi - IV. It seems like a constant rehashing of 70's and 80's (Gwen Stefani's new single has sort of a disco/housy vibe). In a songwriting lecture I watched from Ralph Murphy, he said 70% of music was sold to women and your song has to compete with women driving to work at 8 am. ""All they want to hear is local weather, local traffic, local news, and they put that poor little song in their slot"". How can you be confident trying to make a competing pop track with a bunch of established players in the industry with a boat load of money who either outsourced production / writing to Sweden (Max Martin, Cheiron Studios -- their big thing is a hook every 7 seconds) or have 40-50 personnel on an album and 6 writers for each track, that many say aren't even good and are only hits because listeners hear them over and over again on Clear Channel's 5 song playlists and grow to like them? (Carly Rae Jepson's  last album had a huge personnel list and was tracked in a lot of studios). 

Everyone I know says it doesn't matter anyways cause Payola still exists in more discreet ways... Ask anyone in EDM how to get on the Beatport 100 charts. 

I don't have any hopes of making a success in pop, but I wanna be well rounded in producing for today's genres, especially in the case I get a pop singer wanna-be diva. What do you guys think? Where do you see the future of pop? Will we be lifting our soundscapes from Nsync and Backstreet Boys? And the Biebz? What do you consider when you work on a pop track?"
4o4jzo,9,2016-06-14,"Where's the quietest place in the US you've found that isn't painfully remote? (Also, my story if you're interested, lots of triggers but feel free to skip it and just answer the question)",Whatelsewhat,misophonia,https://www.reddit.com/r/misophonia/comments/4o4jzo/wheres_the_quietest_place_in_the_us_youve_found/,"So, if you don't want to expose yourself to my many triggers, feel free to just skip to the bottom here and post an answer to my question - which would be helpful. If anyone has the time / patience to read my long story and offer any help or insight it would also be much appreciated.



I have rich parents. I grew up in a quiet house. Quiet houses really, one in the summer, one in the winter - and later on a third one. They were all huge, and I always had my own quiet space. I knew I had misophonia since I was a child and I couldn't sit at my family dinner table without breaking down and crying because my mother's lip smacking and food talking bothered me so much. She took it as me making fun of her and it damaged our relationship. We stopped having family dinners and I later learned this was because of me, and my mother blamed me for the family's lack of closeness as a result of this.

At college I had a difficult time. I did not work well with roommates and snoring, loud TV watching etc. so after freshman year my parents helped me get an apartment. I was handling noises well enough at this point, getting good grades and working at impressive internships. My misophonia was a joke among my friends since I had to make them all eat with their mouths closed, but beyond that I was a functioning person. I didn't really like school and didn't like what I was studying so I started smoking a lot of pot. I told my parents I wanted to take a semester off and figure my life out, but my mother said that she didn't want to support someone doing nothing and said she wouldn't help me financially if I did that, so I felt stuck.

Around that time a neighbor yelled at me for slamming my door as I was emptying the trash. I hadn't even realized I was slamming it. This poor guy was disheveled in his bath robe, so pissed at me and I felt terrible. From then on I was very careful about slamming doors and started to notice and get angry at other neighbors slamming doors. It was then that I remembered my brother had mentioned to me that my mom's loud eating bothered him as a kid, and it was from that moment that it bothered me. I realized I pick up other people's triggers very easily and that freaked me out. That's the main reason I'm never on this subreddit. (PLEASE DON'T MENTION NEW TRIGGERS TO ME IN THE COMMENTS)

Soon after that a woman below me starts pounding on my floor every time the guy next to slams the door. She thinks it's me, and this really wasn't helpful. I start to have problems with that apartment and move to another one, which turns out to be above a bar that plays the same music every day. Soon I can't handle the music and I'm noticing neighbors slamming and stomping and I'm smoking a ton of pot. Most of the time it feels like being high makes the constant noise around me easier to tolerate, but sometimes it seems to make it worse.

I use earplugs and white noise machines to sleep and barely make it to graduation and am looking forward to spending a few months in my family's quiet homes. I knew I was smoking too much pot at this point and planned to quit after a few months of decompressing from the hell that college had been for me. Throughout college I'd smoked pot in the basement of my parents' house during vacations as a compromise, since they didn't want it in the house and we live in a cold climate. They seemed fine with this arrangement. 

However, the day after graduation my parents informed me I'd no longer be allowed to smoke in the house. This sounds pretty stupid now but at the time it was really important to me and I'd been looking forward to that time of freedom smoking and living in a quiet place for a long time. It was freezing outside and they were basically forcing me to quit. I got really angry and said some nasty stuff, they said nasty stuff and it escalated to me getting kicked out of all my houses.

Because my parents are super rich they were generous enough to pay for me to get an apartment. For most people that would be the end of the story, but for me that's where it starts to get bad. The apartment was really noisy. People stomping, slamming doors, watching loud TV. I really couldn't take it. I couldn't sleep and could barely function, let alone go out and find a job and start my life.

I begged my parents to help me move and break the lease and they relented. I also begged them to let me come home for a while to quit pot in a quiet place and figure out my next move - but they always refused to let me come home, or to even let me use one of their empty homes while they weren't using it. They said it was time for me to be my own man, and thought that therapy and drugs could fix my misophonia. They didn't. I searched and searched for the quietest seeming apartment, and did my best but got another one with people stomping overhead, a baby screaming, doors slamming and I hated it immediately. All day I'd smoke pot and wish I was back in my quiet family homes. A year passed like this and my parents said they're going to cut me off. I lived in my car and pretty much threatened to kill myself and they gave in and help me move again. 

I searched the country for a quiet place and end up on an island near Seattle, which turns out to be right next to a naval air base with growler jets doing touch and go landings overhead all day and night. I also developed a permanent eye dryness issue which means I can't drive more than 30 minutes straight without severe discomfort. So I begged to move again and after a long battle my parents finally gave in and the next place was on a pretty small street in Seattle. 

However after I moved in, I realized it's on a hill and every car had to slam on the gas and vroom their engine really loudly right outside my window. On top of this the apartment flooded every time it rains. I begged my parents to move yet again and at this point they've had it. They demand I go to some place for troubled young adults. They're sure I'm crazy and need to be in one of these places. 

It's the most depressing place I've ever seen, with people that've tried to kill themselves, people that won't eat, etc. - no internet, no phone. I'm isolated from my friends and miserable there but eventually I managed to get out. It was not helpful as nobody had ever heard of or seen anything like the sound sensitivity I was dealing with, and I didn't have anything in common with anybody there.

Now I'm almost 30 and my parents got distracted by getting divorced (which my mom blames me for, maybe correctly) and have thrown up their arms in defeat, basically. They activated my trust fund which means I get a few grand every month and can ask the trust lawyers for more money for reasonable things. It's split between me and my brother, so I can't go overboard and be moving every few weeks or living in a penthouse hotel room or something. I have to ask the lawyers for extra funds and show receipts, etc. 

I'm glad to not have to work but I'm definitely depressed about the fact that I've basically missed out on life now because of this series of events combined with my misophonia. I do try to stay hopeful. Every time I move I hope for the best, but then it turns out there's an industrial park nearby I hadn't noticed in my search, or as with my current house flight paths change. 

I'm currently in Portland, OR, near the edge of the city. I thought I had found a quiet place, and it was mostly quiet all winter long. Things got better and I started taking classes and met a girl. However in the past month air traffic overhead has more than quadrupled. There are planes 24/7 now with small planes flying low and waking me up through earplugs and over the sound of fans, and large jets booming over and circling sometimes. 

I called the FAA and airport and apparently they change the direction of take offs and landings in the warmer months, and there's nothing to do about it. I have tinnitus in my right ear from playing white noise machines too loud in one of my previous places, when I ended up above a brake shop - so I can't blast white noise anymore - now I have to wear foam earplugs at night and musicians earplugs all day due to the planes. It's not how I want to live, and the planes often fly low enough to bother me through the plugs. A month ago I was happy and relaxed all day, so thankful to have finally found a quiet place. I was planning on quitting pot, getting a dog and volunteering. Now that the planes have become so low and frequent I have to completely change my plans and start looking for a new place to live once again. 

Every time I look for a new place to live I get so overwhelmed trying to think of every possible source of loud noises that I always overlook at least one. I know it would be simple enough to move far away into the country, but with my eye problems I can't do that until self-driving cars are invented. I need to be able to get to a grocery store and a pharmacy within 30 minute drives - but other than that I am willing to move literally anywhere in the United States to find a quiet place to live. When I'm outside of my house these noises don't bother me, but when I'm in my home trying to relax and some loud noise comes in that I can't escape, loud enough to wake me up or be heard through earplugs - I get so, so angry at the source and so anxious about all the work I'll need to do now to change my life around and get away from it. 

I also start to think of my parents choices and my mistakes and how I ended up trapped in one place with loud noises when I could've always had access to all those quiet homes. I get angry at them for doing this to me, I get angry at myself for not playing nice and just giving them what they want. I get angry at everyone who watched on the sidelines as my life crumbled and didn't intervene and just tell my parents to let me come home for a year after college. Everyone was on their side. When I tell the story, most people think they were right to kick me out and not let me come back. But I needed that time at home in a place I knew was quiet. Instead I'm always searching.

Right now I'm considering looking on the outskirts of cities in Idaho, Montana and Alaska - but I am really feeling overwhelmed at the idea of starting a new search and I'd appreciate some input if you have any - so that's why I posted the original question. I like states with liberal politics but at this point that's secondary. 

I have gone to so many therapists and tried so many different things. I am currently seeing a CBT therapist and he basically said at our last session there was nothing CBT could do to get the noises to be background noises for me like they seem to be for everybody else, and he seemed to be at a loss as to how to help me. I still smoke pot pretty heavily and I'd like to stop, but every time I try my triggers get way worse and I start to basically wish I were dead every time a plane passes, truck rumbles by, person stomps overhead, slams a door, etc. I know I should have quit this winter but I was just so happy to have a few months of silence after all these years and didn't think it would end so abruptly.

Anyway, have any of you found, visited or heard of a place somewhere in the US, within 30 minutes of a grocery and pharmacy, with no low air traffic overhead year-round, no train tracks or industrial park right nearby, no busy highways too close where real estate doesn't cost millions of dollars to buy and tens of thousands to rent? I have enough in my trust to rent almost anywhere up to 3k a month and to buy / build a house up to 400-500k, but I can't ever afford to get back into the super rich, super quiet areas I grew up in. I still hold out hope that somewhere there's a place where I can live and not be miserable. I plan to spend the next year traveling around and trying to find that place, so any advice will be most helpful.

EDIT: I wanted to add that from 26-27 I quit pot completely for one year while I was on klonipin to sleep and prozac for depression. This was in the place above the brake shop. My parents wouldn't let me break the lease so I stayed there the full year. I ended up drinking a lot and gaining 60 pounds. I didn't see much of a reduction in triggers. After a year I started smoking pot again, stopped staking klonipin and prozac, lost the 60 pounds and the trust was unfrozen, then I found what I thought was a quiet place for about six months - then the planes started flying right over me 50-100 times a day and here we are. I do think I could quit for good if I were in a quiet, trigger-light environment for 6 months to a year, but otherwise I don't know if it's possible. It's the only real break I get from feeling trapped by loud inescapable noises.



TL;DR: Where in the US would you move if you had lots of money and lots of triggers but couldn't do super long drives?"

Basically, I want to approach this summer by learning how to use CAD software or learning a programming language. I'd like it to be relevant to the bioengineering field so I wanted to know which would be more useful as a BioE student focused on a tissue engineering track?

I have in the past just dabbled here and there with trying to learn HTML and JAVA but nothing really in-depth or anything. I have access to the Lynda.com online library from college and can use many of the different options there to gain a certification. 

Also, as a hobby and side job I dabble in photography so I can always take a course for that too. Although it will be less relevant maybe having something different on my resume would be good?

Those are just some thoughts. Suggestions/advice is very much appreciated! Thank you!"

From what I understand is that for most firms you get about 50-70 hrs a week during the internship and would have to take a semester off from school. But in my situation, I would only have 2 classes left and they are offered at night once a week in the spring (7-10pm). I guess my question is would firms allow me to do the internship and take two night classes a week? Or do they typically require a full open schedule due to it being busy season? I could always take those classes in the summer but if it was possible to do both during spring I would definitely consider it.

I've tried researching this but could not find much. Any info would help me. Thanks!"

On Monday I got an e-mail reply asking for an online Hangouts interview for a position as a virtual data entry position that worked at home. I looked at the e-mail I noticed some spelling errors this got me suspicious. But didn't think it was a big deal. I went through with the interview making sure I didn't give out any crucial information such as SSN. The interview was done through messages on Hangouts. I only gave the recruiting officer my name and address but that was already on my resume. I answered a couple of questions. And the officer said I was hired and paid $35.00 an hour. This got me so suspicious $35.00 an hour that's crazy for an beginning internship. Then he sent a list of programs that I needed to purchase but he will send me a check via mail so I can purchase the products. He said to purchase it after I get the check. He also asked what bank provider I have. I replied to him ""Chase"" I didn't give him my bank number or anything. And he that training and orientation started tomorrow, not in-person interview or anything.


Then later today I got another e-mail for another online internship. It was the same e-mail I got before but with a different company name and a different recruitment officer. The same typos even occurred. This further confirms that these internships are fake. I am not sure what to do now. They have some of my personal information such as name, phone and address. What should I do? I was supposed to report online tomorrow morning. Should I just ignore and block him? Thanks for everyone that replies.

But that wasn't my experience. I feel like my whole pregnancy people only told me horror stories. It's like they were trying to scare me for whatever reason. But I LOVED my labor. I love thinking about it. And I absolutely love my daughter. Oh, and this is going to be long. 

Okay. So I am 2 months pp (8 weeks 6 days to be exact). I want to share my positive birth story, my (mostly) positive postpartum recovery story, and my so far amazing experience with a newborn. 

 I did not enjoy pregnancy like I always imagined I would. I couldn't breathe for the last 20 weeks. I had the worst acid reflux I have ever had to the point where I would wake up projectile vomiting stomach bile and couldn't sleep lying down. Heck, I couldn't sleep period. I gained 50 lbs and was swollen everywhere all of the time. At the end I couldn't even get out of the car by myself. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely loved feeling those big kicks and jabs and wiggles and knowing there was life inside of me. But that was about the only part I liked (and how people jumped to the occasion to do simple tasks for me because that goes away as soon as that baby comes out). 

My due date was 4/13/16 and I was scheduled to be induced on the 15th. On the 11th I had a membrane sweep and that was absolute hell. I was 3cm dilated and 75% effaced after it. I don't think I will be getting one of those again in the future. But my due date rolls around and I was having very inconsistent, non painful contractions. They happened mostly at night. My boyfriend and his mom and my mom went to the local hiking trail/park and decided to do a whole bunch of walking to get this baby out. I think we ended up walking 3 miles total. We got home and still nothing. I went to bed that night like normal. At about 6 am I woke up and had to pee. While I was peeing I had a really bad contraction. It freaked me out but I layed back down and tried to go back to sleep. But they kept coming. They were bad enough that I had to stop what I was doing and bend over and focus on breathing. I couldn't chat through them. They came out of nowhere!  I called the on call doctor at the hospital at around 6:30 when my contractions were lasting 45secs and coming every 5 minutes. She told me to go on in and get checked! We got to the hospital at 7:30 am on the 14th and checked in. Once I got changed and hooked up to the machines and IVs and whatnot the nurse checked me and I was 4cm dilated and 100% effaced. We had an intern shadowing our nurse and Doctor which I thought was awesome. Being a FTM I didn't know what to except and neither did she so we kind of had a special bond and I felt really comfortable with her. At 9:30 the dr came in and broke my water! I didn't think things would happen so fast! Man that was a very weird feeling. They stick this 2ft crochet needle up there and boom. The flood gates open. And the liquid is so warm and you can't control it from coming out even though you feel like you are peeing and should stop it lol. As soon as she broke my water my contractions doubled pain wise and were about 2 mins apart. The nurse asked me if I wanted an epidural to which I replied YES PLEASE. they were having a really slow day so the guy came really fast with the epidural. I think I ordered it at 10:45 and he was there at 11:30. Those 45 minutes were the worst part of my whole experience. I only had maybe 6 bad contractions that I couldn't even think through. And yes those are horrible. They make you shake and want to puke and you don't know what to do to make it better. Mine were coming two at a time too. But as soon as that epidural kicked in I was good to go. It was perfect. I couldn't feel pain but I could still move my legs with some help from my arms. I wasn't too numb (which is a thing). At 1:00 I told the nurse that it felt like ""worms were crawling out of my butt"". I didn't know how else to describe the sensation I was feeling. Turns out that's what It feels like when a baby head is trying to come out of your cooch and is pressing on your butt. She checked me again and I saw her mouth the word ""ten"" and I just laid there with my mouth open staring at her while she shushed me so that the intern could check me. She asked the intern what she thought I was and she was like ""I think a 10 but I don't think it's been long enough?"" That's right ladies. A FTM at 10 cm in 6 hours of labor with no pitocin or anything. The nurse ran and grabbed the doctor and got me all ready to start pushing. My mom frantically started calling family because we were sure we were going to be there all day we hadn't even called anyone yet! I started pushing at 1:15pm and my daughter was born at 2:08 pm. Pushing was hard. But not painful. Imagine holding your breath in 10 second increments for an hour while running as fast as you can. I had to wear an oxygen mask to help me catch my breath. Inbetween pushes me and the dr were taking about house hunters that was on the tv in the background and she kept telling me how beautiful my daughters hair was. She had hair omg. She got a little stuck and her heart rate was dipping to ~60bpm every other push and talk started about vacuum or c section. But then she came out on her own and had the cord wrapped around her neck 2 times, which is why she wasn't progressing and why her heart rate was dipping. The strangest part for me was when her head came out. They have you stop and take a rest once the head is out before the body comes out and you feel like there is something just hanging out of you and it is so awkward. But she started crying with just her head sticking out of my cooch while her body was still in. I was laughing and crying and it was so funny and weird at the same time. As soon as she was all of the way out the plopped her on my chest and she started rooting right away. She was latched onto my boob within 10 minutes of being born. It was amazing. I loved my birth experience and love sharing it with others. I had a second degree tear that required 6 stitches. I tore horizontally instead of vertically. The dr said it looked like a smiley face. Oh joy. She was born at 2:08 pm weighing 7lb 4oz and was 22"" long. 

I bleed until 3 weeks pp. My stitches fully dissolved at 6 weeks. My recovery wasn't terrible at all. After birth you feel like you got hit by a Mac truck. My arms and legs and back were so sore I couldn't lift my baby out of her bassinet for the first two nights. TAKE THE PAIN PILLS THEY WILL SAVE YOUR LIFE. ALSO THE STOOL SOFTENER. Do it. I didn't poop until 5 days pp and it was not nearly as scary as I had made myself think it was. Stool softeners are your best friend for the first month pp. The worst parts of my recovery for me were being able to feel my stitches when I sat because of their placement and how unprepared I was for what my pp body would look like. I cried everyday for the first two weeks because my body was so hard for me to look at. I am not one of those women that proudly wear my stretch marks and 30 extra pounds of baby weight because of the baby it gave me. Yes I am proud of my body for what it did. Yes I love my daughter. But I am allowed to miss my old body and work as hard as I can to get it back. I lost 24lb in the first 3 weeks. I am now almost 9 weeks out and still have yet to loose the last 20. But other than that my recovery was fine and non traumatic at all. 

Life with a newborn is amazing. You are so tired and in love and nothing else matters. For the first week at home I literally laid in bed with my baby attached to my boob and just stared at her and her beauty. She slept like a beast and still does. At 6 weeks we developed a predictable nighttime routine. Bath at 8. Book at 8:45. Boob at 9:15. Lay down in pack n play still awake at 9:45. Asleep by 10. Now at almost 9 weeks she sleeps 10pm-5:30am and then wakes up to eat and snuggle and smile for a little then back to sleep from 6:30-9. Before that she would also wake up at midnight and 3 am. I sleep better now than when I was pregnant! She had a terrible horrible rash for the first 4 weeks that everyone told me was baby acne. It turned out to be a bad dairy intolerance. Now that I have cut dairy out of my diet for 5 weeks she is the happiest, healthiest baby I've ever met. We are EBF and have had no problems besides her having to learn to deal with my over active letdown and a slight lip tie that is being evaluated next month. All you hear about it how hard breastfeeding is but I haven't found it to be hard in the least. I love it. It was the best decision I have ever made. My favorite time of the day is whenever she is nursing. It's pure joy for me. 

Yes, babies are frustrating and tiring and unknown. But as soon as that little face throws you a smile every bad thought (and you will have some terrible thoughts) goes out the window and you are overcome with pure love and joy and confusion on how you could love something so much. 

Wow. Thank you for listening and good luck with your labors and babies. I'm a FTM and had a 7 hour labor start to finish. Anything is possible. Get ready for the journey of your life. There is nothing like it.

A friend of mine who doesn't speak them was offered a job, but he had 5 years experience.

But what about a beginner with just an internship and a couple of projects behind him? Or someone with 1 year of experience? 

Or is the language problem only outweighed for employers once you get to mid or senior level?

Do you know any people who have done this?

( I have an EU passport.)

EDIT: I feel that I need to elaborate, since the post is getting downvoted. The reasons why I want to go to Barcelona are because it fits my criteria, not because I idealize the city. I realize that the city has it's problems and that I would earn less than in Northern Europe.

* It has a good startup scene and the IT industry in general seems to be developed.

* It's a big city, but dense and compact in size, making it cheap and fast to get around in. 

* I look Mediterranean, so it would be easier to fit in looks wise. People wouldn't be able to tell I am a foreigner just by looking at me as they can in more Northern countries.

* It has a cheap daily flight to my home country (I've seen the price drop to 20 euros return on one occasion).

* The weather is really important to me. I've lived in Scotland, and the weather (lack of sun) made me miserable. The extra money I would earn there don't mean much if I'm depressed. I come from a sunny climate, and would like to stay in one.

* Related - beaches and mountains close by.

* While the rents and properties are not cheap, they are not too bad compared to places like the UK.


I know that I could earn more in Northern Europe, but money isn't everything. "

I am having a very difficult time dealing with the ""Silent treatment"" my boyfriend is giving me the last 4 1/2 days.

Lets start from the beginning : I am currently doing an internship abroad for a range of a couple few months. Unfortunately, my work placement is situated in the middle of nowhere and I am living at a place in a very small town close by. It is very hard to meet people around my age in this town, and my co-workers are 45+. So I spend my freetime alone, in a different country, away from home, missing my boyfriend and family. I do not like my work at all, and I am looking forward for my internship to end.

Before I lived in the place where I am living now, I stayed at another house, where another housemate[25] lived as well. We exchanged numbers as we both moved out. Just recently, the housemate, who is a guy, suggested we could met up, watching one of the EURO16 football game in a pub. I told my boyfriend, and he said it was fine meeting him regarding the circumstances. Then, a few days later he changed his mind, telling me the thought alone meeting the other guy hurts him. I was tired being alone all the time, so I met met former housemate regardless. It was 2 hours. Just watching the game, having a coke, nothing more. Just socializing. That was the last time my boyfriend messaged me - two days before the met up. I texted him, telling about my day, that nothing happened, that we met up for 2 hours, nothing else . Over the past few days my text got fewer and fewer, since he is not responding - neither to my texts nor to my calls. I know that he sees them, but he is just ignoring me. It hurts so much. 

I asked my boyfriend a couple of times if he is coming over to visit me since before the trip he told be he will come over a couple of times to see me. But he is not coming over, which also did hurt me a lot, and it honestly still does....

Maybe I should add that I met a guy[21] without telling my boyfriend back home. I just told him that I met him as my boyfriend rang me asking what I was doing when I was with the other guy. So I told him. We went inline skating, then. He was really hurt then, I did not trusted me anymore. (No romance was going on with the other guy, or anything. Just again a normal meeting fro me, but not in the view of my bf.)

I do not really know what to do and how to deal with it. Not hearing from him drives me nuts. I love him and I dont want to loose him.

Is he breaking up now? Should I give him more space? Tell him how childish he is for shutting me out and not talking about it? Should I apologize for meeting up?Advice is desperately needed, please.

EDIT: I did tell my housemate that I have a boyfriend. I also did tell my boyfriend about the meeting with my former housemate beforehand.


TL;DR: Met another guy, even though my boyfriend did not like it. Now he is giving me the ""Silent Treatment"" for the past 5 days."
4o6fw1,42,2016-06-15,Confession.,J2488,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/4o6fw1/confession/,"Long time lurker. First time poster. 
I just joined 'officially' NoFap. its taken a long time to get to this point. Heres my story. Im hoping there are other who have the same/similar history and are going through/have gone through the same thing. 
I've been fapping since I was 12 or 13. I cant remember the first time. I came from a family that did not speak about sex. Never even a hint. If we were watching a love scene in a movie, it was promptly forwarded, it was that bad. Consequently I think I grew up without really understanding sex/relationships/fapping etc. 
I was fapping quite regularly, never having a break of anything more than a few days, and never on purpose. i'd challenge myself to fap as much as I could in a short space of time, using more and more controversial porn to do so. This continued basically non stop until recently. I met a wonderful woman 3 years ago and we started seeing each other, and even then it didn't sate my appetite. I was still looking for every opportunity, never knowing the toxic affect it would have. 
I was still fapping on a daily basis, but hiding it from all. Looking back now, I was a sick man. I fapped everywhere, at work, at home, in the laundry room when I went down to get laundry, on the balcony while having a cigarette, at my desk at work when I was alone for a few minutes, in the car while driving. I fapped over any female that I met, even going so far as to look for porn tailored to whichever colleague/random woman I was trying to emulate, in turn reducing the real woman to nothing more than a sexual object to be used as I saw fit. I reduced every single woman I ever met to her naked self, and ignored everything else about them. Even the interns at work, who are barely 17 or 18, were victims of this. I thought this was normal. I even fapped in bed, next to my sleeping girlfriend, when she was asleep. Every single woman was reduced to being no more than an object in my sick mind, to be used for my own gratifcation in ever more taboo and controversial ways, and damn the consequences. Im too ashamed to admit the worst, but suffice to say that more than once, I disgusted myself, which led to an ever deeper cycle of fap-regret-depressed-fap. 

About 18 months ago, I asked my girlfriend to marry me. She said yes. All was still seemingly good at the time. Our sex life was good too, never having any problems. she had no idea about my addiction, and I just supposed I would eventually 'grow out' of it, even though I was in my late 20s. 

About a year ago, the problems began. We usually never went more than 3-4 days at most without sex. Then, suddenly, it just stopped. The problem was me - 'it' just stopped working. No matter how hard I tried, I could not get aroused by my girlfriend. I just didn't see her as a person I could have sex with anymore. She was my wife, not a sexual partner. The only way I could get aroused would by driving myself into a frenzy earlier on in the day by bingeing on porn and then thinking about one of her friends or a colleague while in bed. It was shameful, and every time it felt like I was betraying her. I would think of her friends and doing shameful things to them while having sex with her. I went to see a doctor, preferring to perhaps blame it on depression or low testosterone, but tests came back normal. I searched desperately for an excuse, but was running out. This, led to an even deeper depression, with even more ED problems. This has continued for a whole year. Finding excuses not to have sex...is there anything more embarrassing? My ED has lasted for the better part of a year. no guy in his 20s should be having these problems. 

I was introduced to PIED when browsing online trying to figure out what the f*** was going on with my penis, about 2 months ago. It seemed to make sense. The symptoms fit, and there were stories of guys coming back from the edge. Maybe that would help me? I was still in denial, not realising just how deep my addiction went. I only realised when I tried to go PM-free.

My god, its difficult. The longest I've managed so far, in my entire life, is 7 days. 7 piddly days. 7 days out of a minimum of 90 I've set myself. This addiction, that I never truly appreciated the depth of, has taken over my life, and only now have I realised just how deep it has spread its tentacles. How was I in denial for so long? How the hell did it get so deep without me realising? for 15 goddamned years. How did I fall asleep at the wheel for so long...how do I come back from this?
 
Last night was tough...I couldn't sleep. I literally lay awake all night, unable to stop thinking of sex. sex with every single woman in my life. Sex with all of my friends, all of my acquaintances, with every fibre of my body urging me to just grab hold and start going to town on myself, if for no other reason than just to get some sleep. It would just take a few minutes, and then I could sleep...God knows how I resisted...I could not, for one second stop thinking about sex. Thinking up ever more devious scenarios in my head. Feeling ashamed that I was thinking that, then thinking up an even more devious scenario with another woman in my life. I couldnt sleep one minute. I thought of doing horrible things to all my best female friends, and to women I barely knew. All the while, my penis twitching and my hands twitching and my mind constantly telling me to get a grip and deal with it. I've never had a night so tough, and I used to be in the army. I need help. 

I want to save my marriage, because if I don't get this godforsaken habit under control, my marriage will disintegrate in front of me. I want to be normal, and think of women normally again (I'm not even sure I know what that is). I want to stop being a slave to this habit. I want control. I want my damn penis to work again properly. 
But...its been 7 days, and im not sure I can do it. Its so difficult. My brain is twisting every single waking moment of my life into a reason to fap. Every woman I see, before I even register who it is, ive already ripped her clothes off like an animal and started f*****g her in my mind. How the hell am I going to last another 83 days of this? I'm standing on the precipice of a huge cliff, and coming to the realisation that I may not be able to step back. 

Help.

4o6g6q,1,2016-06-15,Pygame window opens then closes immediately,Snoodbird,pygame,https://www.reddit.com/r/pygame/comments/4o6g6q/pygame_window_opens_then_closes_immediately/,"As part of my internship this summer I have to use a python/pygame script written by the previous intern. After much trouble, I have finally gotten pygame installed and ""working"" (i.e. it at least imports without error) and figured out how to run the script from Terminal, using the correct command line arguments, and so on.

But when I run the script, the pygame window opens for a split-second before crashing.

If it matters I'm using OS X, Python 2.7.11 32bit, and the corresponding version of pygame.

I doubt this is a problem with the code because I know the previous intern has run it successfully in the past, and I didn't change it at all, and the game is very basic so I highly doubt it's crashing because my system can't handle it.

I know I have the correct version of pygame installed, and I just did the basic install of the download from pygame.org so I don't see how I could have fucked that up, but who knows. Originally, I had 64bit Python 2 installed so I tried using Python3 and installing pygame using homebrew and a bunch of other command line nonsense I barely understood so that I wouldn't have to uninstall 64bit Python 2, but that ended up not working so I settled on replacing 64bit Python 2 with the 32bit version and then installing the corresponding version of pygame. I tried uninstalling the other stuff after, but I honestly don't even know how to fully uninstall ""normal"" programs on OS X (why the hell is there not just an ""Uninstall Application"" tool like there is on Windows?) nevermind shit installed through command line that is almost impossible to even find on my machine, so there could be something still there that's fucking pygame up.

I also get two warnings in Terminal when I run the script about how I'm using the ""deprecated Carbon Component Manager for hosting Audio Units"" and ""NSQuickDrawView, which has been deprecated"" and saying I should instead use the ""API's in AudioComponent.h"" and ""Quartz"", respectively. I have no idea what any of those things are, but they could easily be the problem as well.

Edit: Installed Ubuntu on a virtual machine and was able to get this all up and running in ~1 minute. I'm sure if I really wanted to I could get it working on OS X, but I've been wanting to dual boot anyways so I'm just going to do my PyGame stuff on Linux for now.

I was born with a disfigured face, it's very asymmetric and only one ear and one eye work.
My childhood was good, I played video games with my cousins very often. Even though other children at school were sometimes cruel and I was almost always alone, it didn't matter to me because I had my cousins to play at my grandmother's house and I was a good student anyway.
I ended up liking physics and math. So I went to the university to study engineering. There I made a very good friend and we got really close, he introduced me to his group and helped me to socialize (I'm shy). I had a good time with this group.
One of my classmates was suffering from depression and I couldn't stand not doing anything to help( I thought she would kill herself), because I knew what was like to be sad.
I started talking with her, but I didn't know how to help so I talked mainly some random things and said that she could vent if she wanted. We became close and I started having feelings for her. She noted and would no longer talk to me.
After some months we started talking again, I assured her that I was just her friend (only way she would accept my help). We became close again and I noted she had lost all her friends, but I assured her that I was there and she would not be alone. But she liked my other close friend and he didn't like her. I was in the middle of many arguments and I argued with him many times. It got to a point where I thought I would lose his friendship so I made (maybe the worst) decision. I told her that I couldn't go any longer and wanted distance. She accepted without arguments, saying she understood my situation.
I immediately regretted that, cause I liked her very much. But there was no going back.
Fast forward some time and I am at the final year of the university where it's obligatory to do an internship to finish the course. I was failing to get one and she started sending me opportunities to help me, and talk about random things. I asked her why was she helping me after what I did to her. She said she will always be my friend and help me with my problems. She said she was better and was dating a guy. I felt really relieved that my decision didn't fuck up her life.
Now, some months later, I still couldn't get an internship and I'm feeling generally bad about my life. My close friend  will move to another state after graduating and the other guys of the group are not really my friends. Not that I don't like them, but they are very distant, more like acquaintances. I don't talk with most of my cousins anymore, except one, but it's only small talk (they got girlfriends/boyfriends) and I'm not close with my parents.
I don't have a girlfriend, I think it's because of my face. I have a bad vision with the only eye that work, so people think I'm being rude but I simply don't recognize them sometimes. My bad hearing don't let me do well in public places where there's a loud background noise and that's exactly the kind of place that people like to socialize. If I'm with another person, strangers address this other person instead of me thinking I have mental problems.
This was always part of my life. But it never bothered me because I still could do what was necessary, like studying and passing exams. But now that I arrived at the ""real world"" where talking to people is important I'm failing big time.
I didn't want to open up to anyone because I knew what happens:friends stop talking with you. But I convinced myself to open up to my formerly depressed friend, I thought she had the biggest probability of understanding me.
I opened up to her and she said she would help me and that I wasn't alone. We talked a lot and she was very kind and gave me advices. But suddenly she became cold. When I asked what was happening she said I was not following her advices so she didn't know how to help and that I should ask for help elsewhere. I thanked her and said that I was sorry to put her in such a difficult situation.
Now I don't want to open up to my close friend, afraid of losing him. I feel abandoned. I don't know what to do. It's hard to sleep at night. I think I'm not fit for this world. Some time in the future I'll do some surgeries to correct my face a little, but that won't help my vision/hearing. And I may be too broke after 24 years living like an outcast."

You can skip the first two paragraphs. Furthermore, sorry this is copied and pasted from my /r/cscareerquestions post so it may sound oddly phrased.

I started this year on a maths and computer science course, finished my first year. I **love** physics. It's my heart. However, I also really enjoy programming and more than that; real physicists work in R&amp;D or academia and academia is torture for the soul.

Because of my love for Physics there are certain maths courses I need to take to self teach particle and quantum theory that a joint CS course wouldn't allow me to do. So I'm going to do a straight maths degree with the explicit intent of working in Software development. I need holes poked in my plan.

This summer I am reading Linear algebra and Real analysis books as prep for next year. However, I am also working through a book on Data Structures and Algorithmic Analysis (by Jul 20 happy birthday to me :/ ), a book on UML (general) and then the UML for Java book (by august 20). Then I'm reading a book on Game dev and software while finishing the Java language book I didn't get a chance to finish last Summer. 

Because of my prereading for maths, the first month of Algebra and Real analysis will be a breeze allowing me to focus on building a Java game (something dumb and easy but broadcasting knowledge). The rest of my second year CS study will be spent increasing my Java knowledge before my Second Year summer internship.

In second year summer I plan to Learn DBMA and SQL, while transitioning from Java to C++ (**I need to know if this is smart, worth it, and what industries prefer either OOP lang**) while bumming some sweet, sweet Classical Mechanics. 

Third year: Unkown; I don't know what do learn during third year. If I start learning C++, that would be good to keep going but if not, what other stuff should I learn? By this point I'll be proficient with Algorithms, UML and general good SD practice, and Java. What other Huge areas of CS should I learn about **to be competitive with CS grads for a run of the mill dev job**?

Thank you if you read and have a nice day."

This is my first post and the first time I am telling my story.
I am 19 and I am depressed. What led me to write this is last weekend I broke down completely. I was talking to a friend I made online. We were pretty tight. After knowing her for a while she told me she was depressed. At the moment I didnt know I was aswell. And she ignored me for about a week. She came back and we played games every night and had a lot of fun. About 3 months ago she was talking less and less. She started to ignore me. And it felt bad and I felt worthless, unappreciated and hated. My birthday was coming up and I asked her if she would be online she said yes. I was excited cuzz I hadnt heard her voice in weeks. I invited friends for the actual party a week after my actual birthday they all blew me off. The 4 friends I thought I had disappeared. The day of my birthday it got late but I gave her time because she was american I was dutch. It was after midnight and decided to text her. She said no. She said she forgot and never came. Even though in the morning I asked her what day it was and she said it was my birthday. The night went by slowly me being emotional paranoid about losing her and  I decided to text her again. I was mad and I didn't think with my head. It was stupid. She ignored me for a whole week. I kept messaging her daily. The day before the party she blocked me I was gone me was gone. Party went by and I finally got to bed feeling like crap. The day after I heard my internship got canceled due the company quitting. I needed it to graduate for college. Everything was falling apart and 2 month past and last weekend I got to talk to her again we had fun but it didnt last long. We talked and I completely broke down. I was crying for the first time in years. She comforted me to some extent. The next days went by with her partially ignoring me. Until we had a pretty fun discussion and arguing about it. She suddenly got mad and blamed me and how I was to blame for everything that happened between us. The months before were like hell for me. The one person I could talk to and the person I somewhat loved was gone. Only for her to come back and blame me. For everything.

This was the period I found out I was depressed. Although I thank her for making me realize I am depressed. I am pissed that she blames everyone but herself. It isnt suprising I was depressed and had no friends. I was bullied all through out high school and I had no one outside high school to hang out with. So I had no one. I always played games on my pc but I played them more and more untill the point where my pc mattered more than anything. Ibpassed high school. Got in college. I only have a few more months to go.

Gaming was my exhaust system. I loved it until 2 years ago and started to enjoy it less and less. Gaming didnt distract me anymore. The addiction was gone. The only reason I still play is I have nothing else to do. I dont want to go outside and meet people cause they are going to leave me again. Im just done with this shit. I love her for what she made me feel. I want to feel that again the happiness she gave me for a while. So ive been trying to puck myself up. Its not working. At all.... I go to sleep at 7 in the morning and wake up at 5. doesnt matter  what time I go I cant get up. At all. It feels like i am paralyzed.

I want a social life again im not sure how to go about it. I need friends, I want friends, I want a girlfriend. And I want to be loved. I dont want this anymore. Idk where to start. I cant just go into a cafe and talk to people right. Cuzz its weird. I cant just ask out the cashier at my supermarket to go out with me. Btw she is super cute cx. I wont stop trying she'll be mad if she heard that I tried to kill myself. She might be the reason I am still alive.

If anyone wants to chat pm me cuzz the internet is the only place rn where I feel comfortable."

I'm currently trying to make a model viewer to view some scanned .obj files in virtual reality. I have pretty good experience with Python but not C#, and I'm pretty new to Unity. However, I want to create a viewer that can handle both computer input as well as support VR, and from what I've looked at, Unity is a good way of doing that. I have used JanusVR, but I think I would like to make an application myself in Unity since I, a VR Lab intern at my school, have been approached to make it so that people in the Biology and Anthropology department at my school may also use it. 

What knowledge of Unity would I need to get started on this? Any relevant tutorials or videos I can watch? I've watched a few video tutorials on making scene selectors, which have helped a little bit, but I'm not exactly sure how to make it support VR. I also have access to Lynda so I can use some of the videos there as well. 

Thanks all!"
4o7lz6,1,2016-06-15,Question on Modbus TCP architecture on the Arduino and if there exist any well documented libraries for the Arduino to act as master?,nthompso13,arduino,https://www.reddit.com/r/arduino/comments/4o7lz6/question_on_modbus_tcp_architecture_on_the/,"Hi everyone,

For my summer internship, part of my project has been to create a unique identification system for stage equipment. Essentially, we would like a device that can sit on an invention (e.g. lifts, catapults, conveyor belts), and indicate to the drive powering the motors (where this device is located) what invention it is plugged in to. So on plug and power up of the invention we would like this drive to go ""Hey, I am connected to Bob, let me load up his parameters from a database so I don't kill anyone"". This idiot proofs the initial set up, as well as helps to guarantee the wrong type of drive is not connected to the wrong motor. The most important constraint is that these drives can be up to 300ft (~100m) away. 


After much research, I thought a nice solution would be to use an Arduino powered and networked through power-over-ethernet (PoE). This allows us to have just one cord, as well as meets the distance constraint. In order to communicate with the drive, the protocol required is Modbus, and since it is over ethernet Modbus TCP fits well. Additionally, the Arduino will need to be the master in this master/slave configuration. 


The only library I have come across is [this one](http://www.myarduinoprojects.com/modbus.html), but it is not well documented. I understand what the script is doing, but I am having difficulty getting it to connect and send data to [this dummy program](http://www.modbustools.com/modbus_slave.html). I am trained as a mechanical engineer (I am eventually designing and manufacturing the drive rack), but have been tasked with figuring out a plug protocol and identification system as well. As such, I am no expert in the network architecture, so any help would be immensely appreciated. Here are my questions:


1. Is there a more robust and documented library out there for  Modbus TCP architecture on the Arduino? [This one](http://www.myarduinoprojects.com/modbus.html) has not been updated in over a year. 

2. Does there exist a better solution to this design prompt?

3. Has anyone ever worked with a similar architecture and be willing to hold my hand through a basic walkthrough or even just offer some advice?


Again, any help would be greatly appreciated!

---

Maria causally laid her elbows on the table, looking deeply into her date's dark brown eyes. ""So..."" she said, ""What do you do for a living?""


James remained unresponsive, frantically tapping away at something on his phone. Maria rolled her eyes, giving the man a stare the entire restaurant could feel. After a good five seconds of palpable annoyance perforating the air, James was aware that something was amiss with his blind date.


""Er, did you say something?""


""Yes. What do you do for a living.""


""Oh!"" James was using all five fingers on his phone now, refusing to look away, even for a second. Was he playing a game? The thought of just walking out briefly crossed Maria's mind. ""Well I used to be a lab chemist,"" he murmured, ""but a couple months ago I started taking art commissions and working from home.""


Maria took a sip of water. ""Oh, really? So you just up and quit your chemistry job? Why?""


James slipped his phone into his coat pocket, glancing out of the enormous modern window for a barely noticeable second. ""Oh, you know...art. I just wasn't satisfied with the job I suppose.""


""You suppose?""


James anxiously picked at his collar. He was sweating bullets! Maria wondered if she was being too intimidating. Maybe she should try to lighten up the conversation.


""When I was a kid I always wanted to work with animals and stuff. You know, like a zookeeper? It wasn't until I took an internship at the local zoo that I realized I hated all the chores that went along with the job. Now I can't look at a gorilla without wanting to puke."" Maria smiled at her date, who to her frustration was furtively sneaking a peek at his phone again.


""Hey, Maria."" James stowed away his phone again and took his date by the hand. ""Maybe we should continue this date somewhere else. I mean, El Cantante? This place isn't that great, right?""


Was he joking? ""We haven't even gotten our appetizers!""


James looked at his wristwatch. ""I just think it would be a good idea to get moving. Like in the next two minutes and twenty-three seconds.""


Maria recoiled into her chair. ""You set a bomb, didn't you?!""


James sheepishly chuckled as every head in the room turned toward the couple. ""No, I didn't set a bomb. No bombs here!""


Maria wasn't entirely convinced. There was something wrong with this guy, that's for sure. ""Then tell me. What's going on?""


James massaged the bridge of his nose. ""I knew going out with you was a bad idea..."" he muttered under his breath. ""Okay, I'm going to be honest with you here. I'm being hunted.""


""*Hunted?* What are you talking about?""


James leaned in closer. ""Keep your voice down! I uncovered some old bones in an unlikely place last summer and took them into the lab for analysis. Next thing I know, some ancient Peruvian curse has got me running for my life 24/7. Now I'm telling you, we have to get out of here before *it* finds me.""


Well that's it. The guy was a whack job all right. This was the last time Maria would let her roommate set her up with someone again. ""Yeah, sure. We'll leave right after our food gets here. We can get it to go, right?""


""No. We need to go *right now.*""


""Look, do you have medication you should be on or something? You seem really...twitchy.""


James got to his feet and started tugging on Maria's sleeve. ""We can pin down my level of sanity while we're driving to a safe distance. The people around us are in danger as long as I'm here.""


""But the breadsticks will be out any minute!""


James began gesturing wildly with his hands. ""I'm not kidding! We have to go!"" 


After realizing he was getting nothing out of his date, James took a moment to regain his composure. ""Maybe this will convince you. Take a look."" He unlocked his phone and handed it to Maria. ""I got the monster to swallow a tracker a couple weeks ago. It hasn't got the drop on me since.""


Maria squinted at the screen skeptically. ""What is this, Google Maps?"" The brightly colored grid displayed a bird's eye view of El Cantante and the surrounding restaurants. ""Okay, so that's us,"" said Maria, pointing at a small red dot on the center of the screen. ""I don't see any monster.""


""What? Let me see."" James scowled and leaned in over Maria's shoulder. ""That doesn't make any sense. It was running this way just a minutes ago. Give me that."" James snatched the phone away from Maria. ""Wait a second. I set the monster's locator as a red dot. We're blue.""


Maria leaned her chin on one arm. ""So wouldn't that mean the monster is right here with---""


*CRRREOOOOOMPH*


Maria's thought was interrupted by a loud crumbling of plaster and crashing of a chandelier. The table across from James and Maria was splintered into pieces as a colossal bear tumbled down from the ceiling. Patrons screamed and ran for the exits as the beast turned to James, letting loose a bloodcurdling roar. It was significantly larger than any bear Maria had ever seen, but perhaps that was due to the fact she hadn't seen many bears. In any case, this bear had unsettlingly large, glossy, sky blue eyes, which Maria knew wasn't normal for North American Grizzlies.


As his date dove for cover into a nearby booth, James reached into his coat pocket, swiftly brandishing a small handgun. ""How many times does a thing have to die before it's dead?"" he cried, shooting a few rounds into the bear's pelt, to no effect. ""This is getting ridiculous. A bear?""


""Is it not normally a bear?"" Maria shrieked hysterically.


James turned around and met Maria's gaze for a moment. ""It's come back as something different every time I've killed it. I don't--AGH!"" The bear swung a frenzied claw at James, tearing a gash down his suit coat. Gripping his chest with his left hand, James let loose a couple more shots into the bear's exposed belly, but the beast hardly seemed to notice. James started to back away towards the entrance. Apparently deciding El Cantante wasn't a great place to attempt to kill an unholy supernatural bear monster, James pushed his way out the door and into the night. Seeing its prey attempting to flee, the monstrous animal hurdled through the window, spraying broken glass across the broadway street and disappearing into the darkness after James.


Maria stared blankly out the shattered window for a few seconds, taking in what had just happened. The rational part of her brain told her she should probably just go home and pretend the whole date never happened. She would probably see this on the news tomorrow, anyway. James could handle himself against this thing, right?


Maria rolled onto her back. A gaping hole led up into the second floor of the building. How had that thing gotten up there? Surely someone would have noticed if that thousand-pound monstrosity had taken the fire escape. Turning her head toward the kitchen, it seemed like the staff had fled through the kitchen exit at the first sight of the bear. She couldn't blame them.


Gunshots rang out in the darkness. Maria came to her senses, scrambling to her feet and jumping outside through the bear-sized hole in the window. Shots continued to echo loudly through the streets, making it easy for Maria to guess the general direction James had ran. It wasn't long before Maria noticed a splotchy trail of scarlet blood illuminated in the beam of one of the streetlights. It led down the sidewalk for about forty yards before turning the corner into a wide alleyway.


A glint of moonlight on the ground made Maria pause. James' handgun, handle stained with blood looked like it had been dropped when needed most. Maria gripped the weapon tightly in her right hand and dashed into the alley. She could barely make out the silhouette of the hulking Grizzly, lashing out and reeling back from the figure Maria knew was James. He was fighting back!


""Yaaah! Take that!"" James was driving off the beast with what looked like an improvised scourge. Sharp metal had been taped to a bullwhip, which still seemed be just enough to make the beast keep its distance. He had that thing in his bag on their date? James swung the whip around his head, tearing into the bear with every chance he got. He continued to back up down the alley, but Maria could see the graffiti-covered brick wall wasn't far off. Cocking the gun, she ran up to about ten feet from the bear.


""Hey!"" Maria screamed. ""Behind you, fuzzball!""


Turning a murky blue eye to Maria, the bear twisted around to face its new threat. *GRAAAAAAAAWWWW.* It roared like a jet engine, revealing three rows of unnaturally jagged teeth. Maria took aim and in the blink of an eye, sent a bullet through the roof of the monster's mouth.


The bear's roar was cut short as it slowly blinked its insect-like eyes. The monster shuddered and growled weakly before toppling onto its side with a sense of finality. Maria looked down at her hands in disbelief. Had she actually just done that? Dropping her gun in shock, Maria sat down in stunned silence.


""Thanks."" James staggered over to his dinner date, pressing his chest wound tightly to keep from losing any more blood. ""Hate to ask for another favor, but could you drive me to the hospital? I'd like to get cleaned up before that thing comes back.""

I'm a longtime reader of PF and read a lot of good advice here. I never thought that I would have to be that guy and ask for your input.

I live in central Europe, I am 30 years old and I studied an IT related subject until now. I changed university for my girlfriend and had to write some test exams that had to be passed until the 3rd semester. That one subject is where I failed and was consequently kicked out.

I began my study in my mid twenties and was never the most motivated student, hence long time for my study. But my grades were okay and I progressed steadily with my exams. For a year I studied a completely different subject before and spent a year abroad. Although I worked part time jobs, they were related to my field and I didn't do any internship.

So that's all in my CV now.

Here is where I hope I can get your experience and opinion:

I could finish the bachelor study at a local school, which isn't a university and, contrary to university, would require attendance in all classes. That would mean that finding time to earn my living would be more difficult.

I could also do my bachelor in a dual study program, where you work in a company half of the year and study for the rest of the year and get paid a liveable income.

But to be honest, I don't know if it makes sense to study again! Isn't it better to start working now and try to make my way anyway? What would you do?

Sorry for the long wall of text and thanks for your input. I appreciate it a lot!

Tl;dr: am 30, was kicked out of university, CV looks *gnaw and I don't know if I should just work now and make my way."

#This series is available legally on [Crunchyroll](http://www.crunchyroll.com/bungo-stray-dogs).

&gt;For weeks, Atsushi Nakajima's orphanage has been plagued by a mystical tiger that only he seems to be aware of. Suspected to be behind the strange incidents, the 18-year-old is abruptly kicked out of the orphanage and left hungry, homeless, and wandering through the city.

&gt;While starving on a riverbank, Atsushi saves a rather eccentric man named Osamu Dazai from drowning. Whimsical suicide enthusiast and supernatural detective, Dazai has been investigating the same tiger that has been terrorizing the boy. Together with Dazai's partner Doppo Kunikida, they solve the mystery, but its resolution leaves Atsushi in a tight spot. As various odd events take place, Atsushi is coerced into joining their firm of supernatural investigators, taking on unusual cases the police cannot handle, alongside his numerous enigmatic co-workers.

4o9640,2,2016-06-15,[F4A] Basic Protocol - New World Order,CrowmeatDPP,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/4o9640/f4a_basic_protocol_new_world_order/,"""War"" may be a bit of an exaggeration, but anyone who claims that Western society is living in racial harmony has their head buried in the sand. Just turn on the news, the US, Europe, it's the same story everywhere. It's not anyone's fault, really- we're genetically designed to associate with those like us. But we're also designed to compete and conquer...

Let's introduce the Black Broadcast Capitalist Enterprises. International underground firm that is part of almost every market imaginable. News broadcasting, commercials, auctioning, farming, construction, law, politics, the film industry, sports... Everything. Though they always have cover-ups, ghost companies used to hide them from true sight. Most of the world has slowly been taken over by BBCE, and now they control enough to start moving.

Nearly every employee for the BBCE and their underling companies is of African descent, and the ones that aren't are very attractive white girls. Well, they weren't very attractive white girls at the start, but the BBCE works in the research industry and the cosmetic industry, and also the plastic surgery industry. They are very attractive now. Though they don't date, they deny any man that talks to them. Apart from a black man. And then if a girl talks to them, well, they'll introduce them to that high-paying secretary job at BBCE, and the cycle continues...

Now, however, they can start their original goal. To make the Black Race supreme. They've always been working towards this goal. Money is funneled into interracial porn productions, sent as child support payments to Black men and the women they breed, used to fund tuition for Black students to attend historically white colleges and universities and support the propaganda spewing Tumblr blogs they write filled with smut. In fact, BC Enterprises is the largest source of funding for the advancement of the Black race the world has ever seen- and it's working. Only, they are ready to launch a new initiative.

the Basic Protocol. Designed to target basic white girls, ones that are cute and the ones that are stunningly hot, the goal is that by the end of the year, nearly every white girl will dream of BBC stretching them out and being filled with the superior sperm. Of course, that takes time... And testing. If people suddenly get suspicious of the copious amounts of interracial porn that they can watch, targeted towards them in particular... No, the BBCE got to where they are now by patience and waiting. They were slaves by these stupid white men, now they'll enslave them. Only, they won't realize they are being enslaved until all their women are breeding black children and every job is taken by the superior black race.

The BBCE control everything, as mentioned above. And when I say everything... I truly mean everything! Every market, every business, everything is managed and monitored. If the BBCE want a famous celebrity to go black, for example Kim Kardashian... They start to influence her. Replace her friends' thoughts and let her friends convert her. Whisper in her ear. And then they put down their hand-made celebrity Kanye West to sweep in and finish the job. Now, millions of teens on instagram look up to Kim, and her sexy black husband...

This is only an example. The first step to the project is to pick a fresh target. I am sure that you boys can find a nice picture of a pretty girl who is ready to be tested and moulded into her ideal image! Then, the influence begins. Start replacing boys in her school with black ones, have her watch her crush get beaten up by a gang of muscular black guys. Surround her with pretty black men and... Her friends. Her friends will be converted in advance, on a more... Enhanced version of the protocol. Sped up. Her friends already love black cock and eagerly work for BBCE. They giggle and point out things like how much bigger and more dominant black men are...

And then they steer it towards sexual conversation. Is it true that black men are bigger? Is it true that once you go black, you can't go back? Stuff like this. Questions that keep our target up at night, pondering about them... At this point, we'll begin to convert her family. Take the men of the house out, her brothers and father, replace them with a new black step-father. This is a long process, but the black agent who will play as the step-father will begin to play subliminal messaging and hypnotic videos that are disguised as films. Ones that get her horny as the sex scenes get steamier, the ones that make her close her eyes at night, but not for sleeping.

Then we amp it up after a few weeks of this. After this amount of time, she's into black guys. But still into whites... And that can't do. We'll make her give a BJ or have sex with a white guy and his tiny penis, and then afterwards, a few days later, have her accidently walk into her step-father, or maybe find a beefed out black guy in the gym showers... Maybe asked on a date from the basketball player in school. And they'll get it on, slowly but surely.

She should have her first black cock within two weeks of amping it up. Then, we give her more black cock, and tiny white cock as well. From there, she'll make her choice. We'll get her addicted to the stunning pleasure of BBC, and then the BBCE will give her an internship at one of their prestigious offices, far away from her family. There, they'll pump her up into an airheaded bimbo secretary and... Rinse and repeat. Until they get the formula for the Basic Protocol down.

Then... They can release it upon the world.

---

The best message to me would be starting off the roleplay by writing about one of the girls. You'll play any man that comes up, and the world and how it reacts to the Basic Protocol, but also about the brainwashing and the effects it has on the four girls! So mentioning how they find themselves thinking about black men... Stuff like that. I'm more likely to ignore you if you don't write a response to the roleplay and get stuck in straight away, just because I can see your writing talent and whether we'll be a good match! "

I recently started an IT internship at a corporate branch office, and a few of the Sr. Engineers here want me to learn PowerShell for some scripts they want me to understand and run. Though, I tried looking around and can't seem to find any guides or sites that strictly start off teaching PowerShell from a base level. 


I have some experience with Python from a college class, though I did not do well at all, and I don't understand or know anything about PowerShell either. Is someone able to point me in the right direction to start grasping the fundamentals and basics of PowerShell?

Thank you :)

4o9pmc,34,2016-06-15,Back on the wagon after falling off... hard. Reverse progress pics included,McTitts,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/4o9pmc/back_on_the_wagon_after_falling_off_hard_reverse/,"STATS: F | 23 years old | 5' 6""

2013-2014: Went from 191lbs to 130lbs 

2015: Went from 130lbs to 206lbs

2016, current: Went from 206lbs to 165lbs

I debated for a long time whether I wanted to post this on here or not.

A year and a half ago I worked my ass off to get down to my goal weight (~130lbs). Once I thought I had lost enough, I didn't really know how to properly transition into maintenance, so I just kind of... stopped. I stopped going to the gym, I stopped counting calories, I stopped prepping my meals at home, and I stopped my weekly weigh-ins. It was my senior year of college, I was working 2 jobs and a great internship so it was easy to tell myself I didn't have the time for all that extra work. I told myself I would be *fine*. I told myself ""I'm skinny now! I lost 60lbs! *I'm not going to gain it all back overnight!*""

Well, I didn't gain it back overnight. But I did gain it all back, and then some, in the span of the next 12 months. I don't know how I let it get that bad you guys. I don't and have never had a bad relationship with food, I don't binge until my stomach is about to rip open, I just made a long series of bad choices with no good choices in between. I lost complete motivation to keep taking care of my body. I'm disgusted by the amount of excuses I made to keep eating like shit. 

Anyways, in January of this year something in me snapped. The 'what are you doing with your life' kind of snap that can only come from looking at a picture of yourself with all of your healthy friends and realizing that you look 10 years older than your peers and completely deplete of energy or happiness. A little depressing, I know, but that's how it hit me.

So, I loaded the My Fitness Pal app for the first time in 14 months and took the first and hardest steps for me: weighing myself to assess the damage and changing the current weight on my profile from a previous 130lbs to 206lbs. 

Since then, I've lost 40lbs and have another ~40lbs more to go. I plan to make it stick this time when I reach my goal weight, and with the help of so many of you on here I think I know how I will safely transition into maintenance (essentially do the opposite of what I did before).

I'm posting this because I suspect there are a lot of lurkers in this community like myself who come on here and are especially, even if momentarily, inspired by the fact that falling off the wagon isn't the end-all be-all and that people CAN come back from failing. I hope this will motivate some of you who have fallen off to get back on, and I hope this will resonate with those transitioning into maintenance. 

For those wondering how I've lost the 40lbs so far, it's been through CICO with an emphasis on vegetables and seafood (I'm pescetarian), lots of water, and doing 1 hour on the elliptical (usually low impact) a few times a week.

Thanks for listening, [here's what you came for](http://imgur.com/a/bUtvh). "
4o9ygu,3,2016-06-15,"Orgasming is my drug, and I can't find the right time to stop",ineedmydrug,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/4o9ygu/orgasming_is_my_drug_and_i_cant_find_the_right/,"The last time I tried was over a year ago, and I reached over 40 days, hard mode.

However, that period also amplified all my problems. It's an addiction, and I had a brutal withdrawal period. That withdrawal period made my grades go down because I couldn't concentrate anymore with that feeling.

It's like coffee to some people, if I don't do it from time to time, I start experiencing withdrawal, and that puts me out of commission for at least a month, or even longer. With school and internships, there's never a right time to stop, unless I want to be experiencing withdrawal for over 2 months, and either fuck up my grades or my job prospects.

When I fap, I feel calm, relaxed, confident, and can concentrate for long periods of time, and I need this drug to keep functioning properly."

Not sure what to do.",ZodiacSpeller,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4oa27g/brother_resentful_that_i_have_it_easy_while_he/,"I have lived with my Mom [45F] and StepDad Todd [49M] for 13 years. I moved in at six and moved out at nineteen. I am [21F] and the only girl in the sibling group. I have two stepbrothers Mike [23M] and Tim [21M]. 

I have a Dad I love very much. He is [50M] and pretty well off. He travels, so I have always lived with my Mom since the divorce [14 years ago.] However, ever summer I would go see my Dad and StepMom Lori [39F]. Lori liked to take me on trips with her and I have been to most of the major countries: Japan, China, India, most of the United States, Canada, England, Wales, Irelands, to name a few. 

My child support also went into a bank account for me. To say I am doing pretty well for my age is not really a joke.   

Tim and I were pretty close up until about two years ago. My Dad has paid for my apartment and schooling, so I have no debt. I have also saved my money pretty wisely and can pay off my own bills while I am waiting for my internships to finish. 

Tim, on the other hand, is still living with our parents and paying his way through school. Mike moved out a long time ago and is engaged. Tim feels he is the only one not doing anything with his life, despite working hard and having good grades. He is still about two years from graduating and will leave with about $30,000 in debt. 

The moment I moved out, Tim withdrew from me. He stopped wanting to do stuff, refused to meet up to hang out. He saw my apartment twice before he told me he didn't want to come over anymore. 

My Mom has said there is some resentment between Tim and I. Tim worked harder in school, though we were both getting very close grades. I got a 3.1 GPA and he was a 3.4 GPA. He was always the smart kid and it never mattered because my Mom was very careful to make sure we all had similar stuff. I don't think Tim realized that I had money saved for me by my dad. 

I had nice clothes, but Tim had musical instruments and a lot of sports, so it evened out. We had the same lifestyle for a long time.

I had talked to Mike about it and he said that it was hard to see me get it so easy when I graduated. But he didn't hold it against me. He pointed out ways I unintentionally might have shown off wealth [paying for tickets to see Mike and Tim, paying for them to go to concerts with me, talking about trips I took.] 

I worked to make sure my behavior wasn't offensive and I am very thankful for my luck. I have helped Mike and Tim pay off bills. I have tried to talk to Tim about what is happening, but he is still resentful. 

I thought we were working towards getting better, but recently Tim has told me that he hates the person I have become. This was over his dog. When we were 14, our parents bought us both dogs. Same breed, same age. My dog Lucia is still alive, Tim's died. 

Tim has asked if he could adopt Lucia but I told him no. I have since gotten another dog and offered to buy Tim one. Our parents said no, they did not want more pets. 

I am not sure where to go with this. I feel like nothing I do makes Tim happy and wonder what I can do to make life better? 

**TL;DR** Brother resentful that I have it easy, while he has it hard. Not sure what to do.

 Anyway, I met this cute Chinese chick  at the interviews for an internship position we both applied for (there were others too). After our interviews, I asked her if she wants to hang out in the evening, she said yes.  One thing to consider is that she had to leave for another country the next day where she is living(We both are living in Europe). We both met, she seemed excited from text exchange before we met. We went to a bar cum buffet, she didn' take any drink. After that I proposed her ice cream, she said yes but that she will have to leave early. We ate ice cream, continued walking to some distance. I tried flirting and a bit of touching, she didn't give any good response.There was a concert, we stayed there for half an hour more, I tried putting my hand around her while dancing, she didn't follow. After the concert, I asked her if we could go sit near a monument. She agreed although before she was saying that she had to go early. We sat there talking and she says again that she has to go. I went down that monument and give her my hands so she can kind of jump on me. She doesn't and jumps herself. After that, I said ok let's walk and then I will show you your stop. I wanted to take her away to a less crowded street and kiss her. I was so confused about her reactions(saying that she will have to leave soon and then refusing to take my support while jumping). Anyway, I couldn't muster up the courage to kiss her and at the end. While we were nearing the stop she innocuously brings her BF in the convo and then says he is very tall. I said her goodbye.

Now, this was my first experience to ask someone out to hang out with me(I told you I have a God like sex life). Although I have cold approached 4-5 girls before, rejected by all.
Now all I want to ask is what do you guys think, should I have kissed her? Although in the end she told that she has a BF but that was just at the end. I regret not kissing her before that but I don't understand the situation at all. I am really inexperienced with girls, so have no clue about this situation.

My strategy so far is to get a tech job, say as a programmer or sysadmin, first so I can get a decent paycheck, and second so I can leverage the tech experience to get my ""in"" with government work, because governments don't hire many public policy analysts straight out of grad school.

The competition has been damned fierce. I am having very little luck. The only job on USAJobs that's given so much as a phone screen interview was a GIS analyst position... in Alaska. Maybe that would be a worthwhile adventure, but the jobs close to home (Denver, CO) are incredibly hard to get. Competition's fierce, and if you aren't a veteran, and one applicant is, you're automatically rejected.

I could just use some general advice in booting my career.

The goal is to list things such as ""take a picture in front of a mural / painted building"" (Ex: Chicken alley? etc.)- 10 points, ""take a picture in front of a statue"" (Ex: The big iron, the pigs near the square, etc."" - 5 points. and more! We will split into groups and then proceed to discover and share!

I was wondering if the community had any input as to some good ideas in order to help not only our interns, but myself, explore Asheville! (We were trying to keep everybody mainly downtown!)

4odyht,3,2016-06-16,Finances with NDad - How to stop NDad from encroaching into my personal income and finances,Semper-Aethereum,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/4odyht/finances_with_ndad_how_to_stop_ndad_from/,"Hey reddit. This is gonna be a long story so buckle up. So currently I am a college student studying econ and finance and this summer i landed a finance internship at a large company. 
 - Internship pays $25/hour and came with a $5000 stipend. 
 - My parents and I all agreed that i would stay at home,save as much money as I can, and commute via train. 
 - I told my parents that I wanted to spend $2000 on a custom pc and on MANDATORY company outings.    

So 2 weeks into the internship, the $5000 plus my first paycheck arrived in the mail. When I got home, **I find that both checks had already been deposited by my narc dad into a savings account THAT I CANT WITHDRAWN FROM WITHOUT A 25% WITHDRAWAL FEE.**     

I asked him why he deposited both checks, he said ""he makes the decisions around money"" and that i should be happy that ""I didnt need to walk to the bank"" to deposit the check. When I told him I needed the money for company lunches and for the computer, he said that the computer and lunches are ""impulse buys"" and that ""he knows whats best for me and is protecting me from my impulsive self.""     

I told him **I already pledged 90% OF MY FUTURE INCOME INTO A SAVINGS CONTRACT THAT I CANT BACK OUT OF.** The savings will be directly deposited into the same savings account my dad put the checks into. When I told him this, he said I need to save more, even though the savings account matures 2 weeks after my internship ends, so I wont get a dime in interest for anything I deposit this summer. The worse part is that all future income earned that isnt pledged to savings will come by mail at 11am, so I cant stop him from continuing to put all my money into an untouchable black hole savings account.    

My dad has always been a narc in this regard. He thinks his judgements are above faults and errors and because of this ego he feels like he needs to be involved in everything. I listened to him while in highschool because i understood he had a better plan that I to get me into a great college, which made his ego grow. I like listened to his advice about college because i know that he went through college and has great advice, which made his ego grow. I listened to him when he said quit your 16-year commitment to Taekwondo because I knew that if I kept competing in national tournaments I would get hurt eventually.    

And now im 21 with a job that I got all on my own, with 90% of my income already pledged to savings, with mandatory company outings I NEED to pay for - and yet my narc dad INSISTS that I save more. How the fuck does he get to decide what happens to MY money? He makes decisions on topics that he has no right making decisions on. Yet his ego just allows him to be infinitely nosy. He says he wants to ""teach me to save money,"" yet I'm not even allowed to see the checks. So I work and don't even get to see any money; how is that testing my ""impulse"" to spend and teaching me to save? How is never being tempted teaching me to resist that urge?     

Reddit how do I stop him from depositing the checks and convince him that the MANDATORY company outings and computer arent ""impulse buys""? How do I convince him that 90% savings is enough?    

**TL;DR HOW DO I GET THE MONEY FROM MY DAD AND STOP HIM FROM DEPOSITING THEM INTO A BLACK HOLE.**
**TL;DR HOW DO I GET MY DAD TO REALIZE THAT IT IS MY MONEY AND HE SHOULDN'T TOUCH IT IF HE WANTS ME TO ""LEARN HOW TO SAVE""**    
*Edit:* Ah shit, sorry guys I'm at my cube and I haven't had coffee yet. Some people pointed out that the account isn't a savings account as I said it had a maturity date. My bad; they're right. I meant to say short-term CD. It does have a higher interest rate but eh period was 1 year and it opened last year around August. Sorry, my bad.

I'm from Spain but I feel like London is the only place in Europe where I might get a chance. 

I have walked into so many studios here in London, and I have phoned many others. And still nothing. A few 'maybes', a shitload of 'noes'. 

I know that it's a difficult industry, I know that there are a lot of young guys like me trying to get work in recording studios. But now I am starting to wonder if it's just impossible, rather than just very difficult. 
I try and set myself aside from the others, by going to the studios, showing my face and trying to give a really good impression, but nothing ever follows through. 

So now I think that I should try a new approach, and I would like to hear some input from you guys. Maybe trying in a different city, or approaching the job search in a completely different way...or maybe even just quitting while I am still young (22 years old) and do something else with my life. I have also considered pulling of a bank heist and starting a studio with that money.

Any thought on this would be greatly appreciated. I want your brutally honest opinions guys, go for it!"

Hyde here. Guess what I have for ya’ll? A two-for one beetus special! That’s right – not only do I have a short Salad Dressing Ham story, I ran in to SDH’s coworker again. Tuck in your folds, you big, beautiful people, you. It’s going to be a jiggly ride.

My office building is a high rise in a complex of high rises with a triangle-ish courtyard in the center. We have one FedEx drop off/pickup point in every building, and the delivery man generally makes his rounds for pickup at the same time every day. 

Everyone has learned the building order for pickup, so if I have something that needs to be sent out, but my building’s pickup time has passed, I can usually hustle over to another building and drop my parcels off there. 

I nearly missed Tito, our delivery man, at the last pickup point today. Fortunately for me, he was delayed by none other than Salad Dressing Ham. 

When I stepped into the hallway, Tito was backed up against his trolley, looking like he was weighing the option of being eaten by a small elephant or suffering the humiliation of screaming like a little girl. Salad Dressing Ham was leaning in and running other hand down Tito’s arm, gurgling seductively. I stopped in my tracks awkwardly.

&gt;Your tattoos are *so* sexy. 

&gt;I need to leave, I’ve got a timetable.

&gt;Oh, I totally understand. Bosses, deadlines. Don’t you ever make time for what’s *important*? Time for … loooove?

&gt;Ma’am, this is … super uncomfortable.

I decided to be heroic. Or obnoxious. You decide. 

&gt;HIEEEEEEEE TITO! OH MY GOD I am SO glad I caught you, my boss would have KILLLLLLED ME if I hadn’t gotten this out today.

Tito looked at me like he’d just seen an angelic being. Salad Dressing Ham looked at me like I was a salad, without Ranch. I babbled on, pushing ‘obliviously’ past Salad Dressing Ham and moving as though I intended to walk with him towards the exit. The door to the outside world glowed like a portal as we got closer.

&gt;You would NOT BELIEVE how busy it’s been, I’ve probably been the bulk of all the heavy packages you’ve been picking up, SO MANY CARBON COPIES, it’s just ridiculous. I have no idea why we don’t just do EVERYTHING electronically – 

&gt;UHM, EXCUSE ME, WE WERE TALKING.

*Damn.*

Tito snatched my package from my hands and rushed the door.

&gt;SorryonadeadlinethanksHydeI’llgetthisdeliveredasapseeyoulater.

The door burst open with a brilliant burst of sunlight, and Tito escaped. Salad Dressing Ham huffed angrily.

&gt;It’s really rude to interrupt people’s conversations. JUST so you know.

I smiled cheerfully at her. 

&gt;It’s also really rude to scavenge other people’s lunches, or assault them when they decline to give you doughnuts. 

Salad Dressing Ham’s piggy little eyes grew wide, and she turned very red before turning and waddle-stomping away, muttering about discrimination.

I feel an inordinate amount of pride for my response, I won’t lie – normally I just walk away or get too flustered to compose a proper response.

Now, for the second morsel of beetusy goodness – my chat with Salad Dressing Ham’s coworker, Jim.

Jim remembered our short conversation about SDH, and chuckled a little when I asked him if he would mind telling me more. I was honest and told him I’d been chronicling SDH’s antics on Reddit, which cracked him up, so … if you’re reading this, Hi Jim! 

These are the things Jim told me about working with SDH.

1.	SDH has, on multiple occasions, raided the catered lunches for executive meetings. The first time she managed to make off with an entire platter of sandwiches and an entire platter of cookies, which were nearly all consumed by the time the platters were discovered at her desk. She was reprimanded, but she started screaming about conditions and discrimination and HR backed off. During the next catered lunch, she was caught wrapping sandwiches in napkins and packing them into her purse. From that point on, the lunches were kept under lock and key in a manager’s office until it was time to eat, and even then sometimes things were found to be 'mysteriously' missing. Most incredibly, these lunches were for meetings that SDH was not in any way a part of. 

2.	I got a few PMs asking about the filing cabinet that got ruined, so I asked Jim to elaborate. Apparently, SDH’s office crush – a 19 year old intern – had a metal two-drawer filing cabinet next to his desk that SDH liked to perch herself seductively on top of to ~~flirt with~~ harass the poor kid. One day the kid came in to work and noticed that the file cabinet was not warped, not bent, but *crumpled* from her sitting on it – to the point that the drawers would not open. Jim described it looking the way a partially crushed soda can looks after being put in one of those can crushers. The intern alerted his superiors, who removed the filing cabinet. SDH was instructed to only interact with the intern for business purposes. The kids’ internship ended shortly after that, probably to his great relief. 

3.	There used to be birthday celebrations in the office, with cake and balloons, until the remains of people’s birthday cakes – to be taken home that night by the birthday boy/girl – started going missing. Jim said that there has not been an in-office birthday celebration for over a year now.

4.	SDH’s coworkers are forced to sneak around when planning out of office events, even if they are personal in nature (birthday parties, get togethers, barbecues, etc) because if SDH finds out, she will either show up uninvited, or she will throw a huge tantrum and claim A. bullying by exclusion, B. fat shaming and discrimination, C. a hostile work environment. (Jim says HR usually ignores these tantrums because the events are not business events, but everyone has to deal with SDH being a colossal bitch at work, so it’s easier to keep gatherings on the DL). 

5.	The handful of times SDH has showed up uninvited to events (she even crashed a party at someone’s *house*), she ate tons of food, drank to a dangerous excess, and twice had to be restrained from attacking the “skinny office sluts”. She also nearly sexually assaulted one of the male staff while he was thoroughly intoxicated, and was pulled away by other coworkers after having removed his belt and unbuttoning his pants. She then screamed about how beautiful she was and how he was leading her on before being kicked out of the bar. Her victim had no idea what was going on and was horrified when he sobered up enough to figure it out. 

6.	SDH’s bullying and bad behavior has caused three successive receptionists, and one sales agent, to quit. All were female. 

7.	SDH gets away with her terrible behavior because she is the head honcho’s sister-in-law. He is rarely in the office, and Jim is unsure if he is at all aware of SDH’s behavior because the office manager is spineless and probably would not bring it to his attention for fear of repercussions. 

8.	SDH has recently demanded her own office (much to the relief of her long-suffering cube mate, who has put up with more than just noxious flatulence). She whined and demanded until she had displaced the highest up person she could screw with without getting in trouble, and taken their office. Jim said that almost overnight there were heaping piles of fast-food and snack detritus in the trash, on the desk, and on the floor, and that the smell when passing by is growing ranker by the day.


I thank all available deities that I do not work with this woman. Jim, FPS thanks you for enabling their beetus. We salute you.

**tl;dr:** Hyde saves the FedEx man from an untimely ingestion. Plus, I was super brave and killed a cockroach in my apartment this morning. That wasn’t in the story, but I felt the need to share it. Fuck cockroaches.

But, this is my parents culture, and not mine. I was raised to be as independent as possible and have the ability to live without my parents help. However, I feel like they do not understand that. I have talked with my mom about moving out, and she said that if I were to do that, I would receive nothing from them, I would be cut off from being on their insurance policy (would have to pay 1.5k/6 months for insurance, where now I pay 400$), all contact would be lost, and I am on my own, for good (my moms words, not mine). If I run into trouble, I can not come home for help, that kind of thing. While I love my parents and all, I feel like I'm at that age where I really want to do my own thing, but my mom holds this stuff over my head so I CAN NOT move out. She has even gone as far to say that if I move out, I essentially do not love her anymore. 

They want to go back to their home country one of these summers, and I told them to just go without me, since my summers are busy with college research and internships, and I honestly do not have any connection to anything or anyone where my parents are from. Everyone is much older than I am (I am 20) and I don't have memories of ever meeting anyone there. But, my mom says that she won't go unless I go, and it honestly kills me since I know she and my dad want to visit their brothers and sisters, but they won't go since I can't/won't. I would have to put a lot of my life on hold to go on a trip that I would benefit less from than doing an internship with a Fortune 500 company, where an amazing future job may be included. 

When talking about my future career with my mom, she hinted at selling the house and moving to the city that I was going to work in, to retire there. But I want both of my parents to retire and go back to their home country, not because I don't love them or anything, but because there they will be able to live their life without me constantly being the middle man to help with the language barrier, since my parents speak very little English and they can be with their family. I feel like it's my job to take care of them and cater to their needs, as they have done for me for the past ~20 years, but there is no way I am going to be able to live my life, work a great job, and have a family while trying to cater to theirs. I would have to give up a piece of my life to help them with theirs, and while I would love to help them in anyway I can, I barely have the time to see them now, let alone in the future. 

If anyone else was in a similar situation, how did you finally manage to separate from your parents, without them feeling like you abandoned them? "

I am about to head off to an 8 week-long internship, and while I'm there, I'll have more time and fewer distractions to work on my fitness goals. One of these is to be able to squat 150x5  by the end of the 8 weeks (August 14th). I plan to work on legs 3x/week. 

My question is about scaling. In April, when I had been lifting more consistently, I calculated my 1RM squat at 105 lb. I basically haven't been to the gym since early May (school craziness+vacation), so I'm not sure how much strength I've lost since then. I plan to figure out my 1 and 5RM again when I start next week so I have a more accurate reference. Regardless what the actual numbers are, what should my strategy be for scaling? I.e., would it be better to do higher reps and add like 5 lb at a time, or do fewer reps adding 5+ lb at a time, or something else? I'm used to doing 20 rep sets at a bit less than my 20RM, so I'm not sure how to scale for doing a 5RM. For reference, I'm 20F, 5'6"", 146lb

Hopefully this is the right place for this kind of question. If it matters, I am INFJ. I've been living with my boyfriend for 2 months, together for 2 years. Using a throwaway because BF knows my reddit account (also just noticed I put enfj in my throwaway name, just a mistype).

I'm having a problem where he *never* picks up after himself without being asked. Even when asked it usually takes a couple times. He is very forgetful, so if I ask him to do something, he will either do it within 30 minutes or he will forget about it and have to be asked again. To his credit, asking him to do stuff does not seem to bother him at all, but it bothers me to have to constantly ask.

I work a lot. I co-founded the company I work for so I am very invested in it. I work 60 - 80 hours a week, mostly at the office but sometimes I work at home at night. I enjoy my work and I like to stay busy. My boyfriend is a college student, currently he is taking summer classes part time and doing a part time internship. During the school year he does not work and goes to school full time. I would put the time that he is ""busy"" between work and class and homework to be about 40 hours a week currently, and when school is in session more like 20 - 30 hours. I think this is totally fine, I don't expect or want him to work as much as I do, but I do wish he would do at least equal work in the house as me given that I have so much less free time.

I have to constantly ask him to throw away his trash, throw away empty food containers, put dishes in sink, pick up his dirty and clean clothes off the floor, wash dishes that he has used, to take out the trash when it is full instead of piling on more trash. To me these are things that don't need to be told. If the trash is full, you take it out. Clothes don't belong on the floor. If you use a dish you wash it. If you have trash you throw it away. Like I said, when I ask him to do these things he will eventually do it, although it can take anywhere from 30 minutes to 3-4 days, and he is very relaxed about being asked to do things (which I admire because I am the opposite, I have a hard time dealing with being told to do things).

But the thing is, I already have a job. Telling him what to do is not my job, and I don't want it to be my job. We've only been living together a short time, so far half the time I will repeatedly ask him to do something if it's something I don't want to do myself (like putting his clothes away, I don't know where they go), or I will just do it myself so I don't have to bother asking (like throwing away the trash he leaves laying around). But I don't want to do this! I don't want to pick up after him and I don't want to tell him to pick up after himself. I want him to *want* to pick up after himself. I'm just not sure how to do this. Should I just have a sit down talk with him? 

Also, every Saturday I do some deep cleaning, cleaning the bathroom, sweeping floors, wiping down kitchen, etc. Sometimes he pouts that I am cleaning because he wants to spend time with me on Saturday. Which I get, but if he would just help me it would only take half the time and then we could spend time together. But I don't want to force him to so I just do it myself, if he offers to help I will tell him what needs done but he rarely offers. So eventually it would be nice if he would help with this kind of stuff but for now I would be happy if he just did the bare minimum of picking up after himself. I also take care of the pets, I feed the cat, dog and guinea pigs, I walk the dog, I clean the guinea pig cage (totally fair because they are my guinea pigs, he has no interest in them, but it's just another thing that takes a lot of my time). I only ask that he cleans the cat's litter box because the litter makes me sneeze. But again he never does this unasked even though we have an understanding that it is ""his"" chore.

So far have not had any arguments about this, I have just been alternating between nagging him and picking up the slack myself but I am getting very salty about it. He honestly probably has no idea that I am annoyed about this, since I've mostly kept my annoyance to myself. I want to go about this right instead of just blowing up about it.

**TL;DR - I [INFJ] am trying to get my ENFP boyfriend to do basic household chores without being asked. Not sure the best way to get through to him.**"

We've only been living together a short time, so far half the time I will repeatedly ask him to do something if it's something I don't want to do myself (like putting his clothes away, I don't know where they go), or I will just do it myself so I don't have to bother asking (like throwing away the trash he leaves laying around). But I don't want to do this! I don't want to pick up after him and I don't want to tell him to pick up after himself. I want him to *want* to pick up after himself. I'm just not sure how to do this. Should I just have a sit down talk with him? 

Also, every Saturday I do some deep cleaning, cleaning the bathroom, sweeping floors, wiping down kitchen, etc. Sometimes he pouts that I am cleaning because he wants to spend time with me on Saturday. Which I get, but if he would just help me it would only take half the time and then we could spend time together. But I don't want to force him to so I just do it myself, if he offers to help I will tell him what needs done but he rarely offers. So eventually it would be nice if he would help with this kind of stuff but for now I would be happy if he just did the bare minimum of picking up after himself. I also take care of the pets, I feed the cat, dog and guinea pigs, I walk the dog, I clean the guinea pig cage (totally fair because they are my guinea pigs, he has no interest in them, but it's just another thing that takes a lot of my time). I only ask that he cleans the cat's litter box because the litter makes me sneeze. But again he never does this unasked even though we have an understanding that it is ""his"" chore.

So far have not had any arguments about this, I have just been alternating between nagging him and picking up the slack myself but I am getting very salty about it. He honestly probably has no idea that I am annoyed about this, since I've mostly kept my annoyance to myself. I want to go about this right instead of just blowing up about it.

Preferably someone from the UK. If so, are there many differences in the work culture between them that I should be aware of, such as typical norms and etiquette? 

Or for anyone who hasn't but has worked in the USA/New York (I imagine pretty much all of you!) is there any part of your working life that you find is typically American? For example, over here in the UK people tend to be quite reserved and won't often tell you you're not doing a good job, whereas in America I've heard people will be much more direct and to the point. 

The reason I ask is because I should be doing an internship in NYC for 12 months within the financial services - I would like to be as prepared and professional as possible. 

Thank you."

I don't know what to do now,ilfuoconellevene,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/4og750/boyfriend_broke_up_with_me_because_hes_depressed/,"Hi r/depression. I just got broken up with my boyfriend a couple hours ago because he said he is depressed and can't be in a relationship.

Backstory: We met in January on Tinder. From the get go he was polite and actually took time to talk to me for several days before asking to meet up for coffee. He is 21 and I am 22, and we both go to the same mid-sized university. During winter quarter we didn't see each other too often because we have demanding majors and I was also working some. I also lost my virginity to him. During spring break, I decided to quit my retail job so I could see him more, plus I wanted to focus on academics and finding a good post grad job. Spring quarter was honestly amazing. I hadn't been nearly as stressed by classes as the previous quarter and I had met his group of friends and I got along with them pretty quickly. They even told me how much he liked me, that he would show me off on FB, etc. I did learn that he had issues in the past with abusive ex-girlfriends. His female friend told me I seemed like the only sane girl he had dated. 

This friend also mentioned that he was a bit ""skittish"" in the past regarding relationships. Like he wouldn't refer to girls as his girlfriend. So I finally talked to him and he said he did consider me his girlfriend, and that he hadn't been seeing anyone else. I just wanted to be the best girlfriend I could be. We had a by the books perfect relationship. Not one real fight or argument. I never turned him down for sex. He loved my cooking. We had a lot of similar interests and enjoyed going to improv shows, getting drinks with his friends and playing games. We lived within walking distance from each other. We're both introverted people so it wasn't like one of us was ever smothering the other. I never nagged or showed jealousy if he had already committed to plans with his friend or was going to be up late doing schoolwork. The whole time I basically thought the worst thing about him was that he was allergic to cats!

So last Saturday I graduated with my BA. He is supposed to get his in December. Right after the ceremony we went to lunch with my parents, which was their first time meeting. They got along and liked each other. During the quarter he had been stressed out because he thought he wasn't going to get a summer internship, but then at the last minute one came through for him, and its in the same city as his parents and where I plan to start my career. This morning was the day he was supposed to go back to his parents for his internship. I'm moving out Monday into my parents which won't be too far from him, and once I get a real job I'll live in the same city as him. I was really excited to start this new chapter in our lives together. Three days ago we saw each other and I noticed he seemed sort of depressed and didn't say much. I asked if he was okay and he said he was just tired. He does have some issues sleeping so I shrugged it off. Went back to his place, watched HBO, had sex and spent the night. I left the next morning and when I was messaging him and asked if he was okay because he seemed a bit sad and he just wrote ""I'm sorry, I don't want to talk about it."" I said nothing. This wasn't actually the first time it had happened. A few weeks ago after the weekend he wrote me to say he was sorry we didn't talk much because he hadn't been in a good mood. When I asked why he said ""Sorry I don't like to talk about my problems"" but I chalked it up to a well guys don't like to talk about feelings thing. 

So this morning around 10 am I get a message asking if I'm home and he asks if he can stop by for a bit. My heart sank into my stomach. He had never suddenly asked to come by, and it was such a strange time and I knew he was leaving that day. So he comes by and tells me I had been right about suspecting that he had been down because he has been depressed and then was saying he doesn't really feel things so he can't be in a relationship. He wouldn't even look at me. I kept assuring him that its okay and I want him to get help and talk to someone, and that pushing me away won't help. He said it isn't severe and he isn't suicidal or anything. He just kept saying he needs to be alone to figure out what he is doing with his life. I didn't get angry or upset with him for the record. I just tried to tell him that I didn't want to be out of his life because of this and I wanted to support him however I could. He said he still did like me. I said so now what? And he mumbled we could still be friends. He just said ""I'm sorry ilfuoconellevene"" and eventually got up and left. I sent a message reiterating my feelings again, that I'm always here to talk to him but I respect his decision. I said I cared about him a lot and he means so much to me, and it breaks my heart to see him in pain. That was all I wrote though. He's seen it and no response but it has only been a few hours. 

Has anyone ever been in this situation (whether it is from my perspective or his)? I just hope he realizes he is making a mistake. Should I just lay low but leave the door open for communication (I don't intend to block his number or delete him from Facebook or Snapchat or anything) and then in a month when it is his birthday maybe shoot him a message and ask how he is doing and sort of test the waters? This is such a shitty feeling. Any advice would be appreciated

Tl;dr: Boyfriend and I met in January, are college seniors, have a relationship pretty much free of any issues and then he breaks up with me because he feels depressed and said he shouldn't be in a relationship"
4ogb9y,2,2016-06-16,GMAT Question IRL,Whatchaknowgood,GMAT,https://www.reddit.com/r/GMAT/comments/4ogb9y/gmat_question_irl/,"Hey so I am in business school and at my internship and I've been presented with this task that is essentially a GMAT combinations problem. x/post from r/excel

So at work I've been assigned this task. There are 21 people in the department, and the goal is for each month there to be 7 groups of 3 people that get together and do an activity. Next month there will be 7 different groups of 3 people and this exercise will repeat every month for a year. The goal is to minimize being in the same group as someone you've already been with before...So for example, in January I'm in a group with Bill and Ted, the goal would be for me to not be in a group with Bill or Ted anytime again soon.
I believe the max number of unique combinations is something regarding combinations / permutations. It's been a while since I took the GMAT, but if my memory serves me right it's something like 7!/3! or maybe 7!/4!*3!
However, where I'm struggling is how to build the model that minimizes having the same person in your group of 3 multiple times throughout the 12 months.
Anyone have any insight on how to do this in excel?
Cheers, and thanks for your help.

Also, I took the GMAT 3x and went 660, 680, 760 so...AMA if you want."

What should my next steps be to give myself the best shot at dating her?",faqesel,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4oggj9/i_21_m_might_have_something_great_going_with_a/,"I know this will be a lot of information, but I need to get it all out of my head at the very least, as my mind has been moving at lightspeed thinking about it all lately. Just some background info before I get started: I haven't been in a committed relationship before, so I realize I may be overthinking/overanalyzing everything I am about to say to a ridiculous extent. I've managed to have my fair share of hookups, one night stands, and brief stints at being friends with benefits, but the closest thing I've had to a real girlfriend was four years ago during my senior year of high school, and it was pretty far from a healthy relationship (nothing bad, just lots of immaturity on both ends).


---


Now, the girl in question (let's call her Grace) just graduated from the college at which I'm entering my senior year, and she has a job close by. She dated a guy for the first 2.5 years of college and hasn't had anything serious since then (to my knowledge). Before two weeks ago, Grace and I had seen each other at various parties/bars/etc and were friendly but still did not know each other very well, despite having many mutual friends. Somehow, we still managed to drunkenly make out with each other one time at a bar back in March, but that didn't lead to anything...



...Until maybe now. Two Fridays ago, I get to talking with Grace at a tailgate for the baseball game that night (big southeastern universities FTW), and I learn that we live only a few houses down from each other in the same apartment complex. The next day (Saturday), after hanging out together with some friends at our complex's pool, we end up as drinking game partners for that night's baseball tailgate. As we get perpetually drunker, she starts making little affectionate gestures like briefly resting her head on my shoulder or leaning on me periodically. Things continue like this as the game ends and we go downtown, and at the end of the night she ends up sleeping over with me, but she is pretty drunk and so we only make out for a minute going to bed.



Then comes Sunday, complete with two more baseball games and another full day of tailgating, so being the degenerates we are, both of us wake up and continue to drink together. The day proceeds similar to Saturday afternoon/evening, with everyone having a good time and Grace continuing to make it seem like she's quite interested in me. We get back to my apartment around 7pm, order a pizza, watch game of thrones, and promptly pass out together, which turns into a quality cuddle sesh.



Monday night ends up being the first time we get to spend together while sober, and it went great. We watched a movie, talked for another hour or two, and I got to second base with her later when we went upstairs. She explains that she likes to take things slow, and so I back off from any other advances, and have not made any since then.



Between that day (6/6) and today, we have watched a few movies together, gotten dinner once, and gotten lunch once as well. Each of the times that we've been together at night (~5 times), she's slept over in my bed, but we haven't done anything more than make out for a bit before going to sleep.



Unfortunately for us, I'm leaving tomorrow for a 7-week long internship that is 5 hours away from my school. I plan to make a trip or two back here at some point, and she has expressed interest in visiting me while I am at the internship to take a tour of the facility (which you can only do if you know someone who works there. Think spaceships). From what I can tell, she likes me, and I definitely like her. I'm a bit thrown off from her reluctancy to go any further in bed, but I'm not too worried about it.



I would assume that being a bit less than 2 weeks into things, it's probably too soon to ""define the relationship"". However, I'm wondering if I should at least express to her how I feel, since I won't see her again for at least two weeks . I *REALLY* don't want to screw up what we have right now, but I'm at a loss as to how to handle this situation going forward. All I know is I want some sort of relationship with this girl.



As I post this, it's ~7pm my time, and both Grace and I will be seeing each other downtown tonight as she doesn't have work tomorrow and I want to let loose one more time before making the drive to my new apartment. Assuming my drunk self doesn't do anything drastic tonight, what should be my next steps before I say goodbye to her for now? Keep in mind that whatever I do will probably have to be done over the next week or so via text or phone call, since I don't think sitting her down to talk about ""us"" while hungover tomorrow morning before I leave would be a great idea (or is it?).



**TL;DR**
Hit it off 2 weeks ago with girl who I'd previously known but only talked to briefly on occasion. We've hung out ~8 times since then and things are going well, but I'll be 5 hours away from her for 7 weeks starting tomorrow and might see her 2-3 times at most during this time. Nonetheless, I really like her and want to start something with her, so I'm now wondering:

* Should I tell her how I feel now, even though it's only been 2 weeks?

* If not, how else do I preserve what we've started and give myself the best possible chance at having a relationship with her down the line?

Any advice is sincerely appreciated!

4ogko4,451,2016-06-16,How should I deal with my [29F] friend [30F] who made a large charge on my credit card without asking me for her wedding (now I dont even want to go)?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4ogko4/how_should_i_deal_with_my_29f_friend_30f_who_made/,"My friend Tammy from high school lives in a different city from me and is getting married this September.  She made plans for her wedding over last summer, when I was living in the same city with her for a summer internship, and I was there for some of the dress shopping etc.  I was, and still am, really happy for her and her marriage.  However, something weird happened with my credit card a few months ago and apparently kind of escalated while I was busy with school, and now I'm feeling weird about attending her marriage at all. 

*Some important background*
Tammy is overall a pretty good friend, though she can also be really, really selfish.  When were in high school, this manifested as her doing some pretty means stuff to me.  Most of this mean stuff involved telling other people my secrets, and telling other people any time I accidentally let slip something about them.  I know it was high school and people are immature, but this behavior of hers eventually completely came in between me and my other really close female friend, lets call her Sarah.  I was closer with Sarah than Tammy was.  Sarah was a really sweet person and I still mourn the loss of her friendship.  Tammy knows I am still hurt by what she did to come between me and Sarah -- I even told her it made me not want to attend our reunion a while back (though I did eventually decide to just buck up and go, Sarah wasn't there at all so it wasn't too awkward).  

In recent years, Tammy has become a bit of a better /more trustworthy friend.  Though, to be honest I do not consider her a very close one.  Can be very picky about only hanging out on her terms only and she does not keep in touch much or call/text on birthdays.  To her credit, she is good at acknowledging her own flaws in this department.  However, sometimes if I really need her help she will help me.  For example, last summer she let me crash at her place for five days while I was figuring out whether I wanted to dump my then live-in boyfriend.

*Current Issue*
Anyway, I bought my hotel room for her upcoming September wedding ASAP last fall, as soon as the hotel made those dates reservable.  The full story behind this is too complicated, but I was able to get a two-night stay at the hotel she reserved for around $500.  This was a big expense for me, as I was in a doctoral program this past year until I graduated last month, and I have been quite poor/ struggling on student loans to cover my term bill.  Tammy, on the other hand, has been out of college (paid for by someone else) and working/amassing savings for 7 years now, so I know that she has a hard time seeing things from my perspective.

This past January, so halfway through my final year in my program, I finally broke up with said live-in boyfriend.  I did the dumping so I moved out of our shared apartment.  This was a costly decision but it was among the best I've ever made for myself.  I called Tammy and let her know, mostly because of her involvement over the past summer.  She was supportive on the call but never checked up on me or anything after that.  I explained to her on the call how costly this was for me, etc., my worries about finding a new place and all.  But I don't think she remembers any of this.  

A few months later this March or April, Tammy got in touch to ask if I wouldn't mind splitting my hotel room for her wedding with another friend who wanted to come.  Tammy said if I authorized it, she would go ahead and make all the changes/take care of any formalities regarding the change to make it easier on me.  I said ok, fully trusting that this meant I would end up having spent LESS, not MORE, on the hotel room and that nothing odd would happen.

A few weeks later, my school got in touch with me to say I had not been able to meet my term bill for the past period, and notify me that this put me at risk of not graduating if I didn't get the problem fixed by graduation.  I was wondering how that could be, as I had planned my finances carefully -- I went over them a bunch of times especially because of my breakup and moving out and knowing I would be under a tighter budget for this last semester.

After doing some digging, I realized there was an extra ~$1000 spent from my account (in addition to the $500, which had not been returned), on Tammy's wedding hotel.  I immediately called Tammy and asked her to talk about it.  Turns out that, without asking me at all, she had increased the stay to 3 nights, including this other girl, so that not only a) would I be paying a lot more in total for the room despite sharing it, but b) Tammy thought it was cool to front the entire amount of this additional charge onto my card without asking me.  And wait multiple days without saying anything about it.

Tammy played it off like it was no big deal, that I could just email her friend and ask her to pay me back.  I thought it was weird -- though characteristically selfish -- of Tammy not to think to put her friend in touch with me without my asking, or even just earlier.  I reminded Tammy that my finances were really tight due to my breakup, that I was worried about not covering my term bill for graduation, and that I was disturbed she would do all this and just let it hang on my card without even a) asking OR updating me about the increase in number of days / cost OR b) making sure I even knew the name of her friend, who now owed me $750. 

When Tammy didn't seem responsive to my concerns, I asked her to just give me her friend's phone number so I could get in touch with her ASAP.  I called her friend and left a very firm voicemail.  I really didn't think it was too over the top, but I remember being really stressed out about my term bill and Tammy's seeming indifference.   Since I wasn't getting through to Tammy, and apparently this other chick didn't even think for herself to pay me back $750 for over a week, my goal was to stick up for myself and be as firm as possible.

When I didn't hear back from her friend for another day or two, I called Tammy and told her that I wanted her to Venmo me back immediately, and that she could then collect from her own friend herself.  As it was my last semester in my grad program, I didn't have any more energy to devote to this, and I thought I would be done with it.  Tammy Venmo'd me the money, but she never apologized for the way it went down and ALSO never thanked me for essentially bearing another $250 charge just so that this other chick could also attend the wedding.

About a month ago, while I was in the midst of final exams, I got a few calls from Tammy.  I tried returning them, but we did not find a time to connect.  She also left me some voicemails that were vague ""hoping we can find a time to talk,"" and so i did not think it was anything urgent.  I never got in touch with her and just let it drop; she only ever reaches out to me when she wants something so I figured if she got urgent she could call again. 

Earlier today, I got another text from her asking hey did I see her emails and what did I think about another room change?  I did not remember seeing any emails from her, so I went back into my email and did a search.  My email is set up so that it filters only messages from frequent contacts; usually Tammy uses her old college address but I hadn't seen this because it came from Tammy's gmail.  

Basically, in her email she said that her other friend was ""really disturbed"" by my ""mean"" voicemail and the fact that I never responded to her apology email (which I also hadnt seen, due to filters) and no longer wanted to share the room with me.  It included a bunch of paragraphs pseudo-apologizing for the charges and money, not acknowledging how it made me feel scared about my term bill, and also kind of just attacking me for ""how rudely"" I handled the whole thing, and that she ""didn't want drama around her wedding.""  I honestly have just been chilling and focusing on graduating since then and just didn't see the emails.  I thought what they did was a dick move but hadn't been giving it more thought and thought I should just forgive Tammy because it was her wedding.

At the end of the email was a request that I change rooms yet again now, again at my own expense, because this other chick is not comfortable.  Honestly, if I think about it, I am not comfortable with any of this any more myself.  I don't want to be an asshole or ""ruin"" Tammy's wedding -- but really at this point I do not even want to go at all.  It does not seem like it will be fun for me.  What should I do?


   
**tl;dr**: Long-time friend put me in a difficult situation financially during a rough time in my life by charging a lot of money to my credit card for her wedding.  I got over it but apparently she and her other friend have been stewing about it.  Don't want to be rude but now do not even want to attend her wedding. "

This started around half a month ago, and has not stopped no matter how much exercise I did. It's not that I'm sad or unmotivated; in fact I'm a soon-to-be senior with many ambitions and plans for internships next year. But when I do things that used to make me feel happy and by all means should make me feel happy, I get...nothing. Not parties, programming, music, etc...I suspect this is because of a couple reasons, including:

1. Feeling burnt out after working my butt off to gain an IB diploma...though many of my friends worked as hard as I did and don't have the same issue.

2. A messed-up diet - I was fasting and then feasting unhealthily for the entire winter and most of spring.

3. Disillusionment with failures associated with activities I liked to do and tried to do.

4. Chemical imbalance in the brain (serotonin or whatever) from a broken reward system based on the aforementioned factors and more.

Any advice on how to deal with this? At times I can feel brief momentary pangs of happiness; however, they go quickly as they come. At this stage I have sufficient energy and motivation to try almost anything, provided it has a fair chance of working. But I also would prefer not to see a therapist or take medication, because my parents disapprove. I don't want to be not able to feel forever. Please help?"

The vet I was referred to at the time had the procedure done by an intern so I got an incredible discount which helped because me and my boyfriend were (and still are) students. Her left eye was removed in December of 2014 but before her surgery she developed one on her right eye. Since then, we've just been administering ofloxacin (antibiotic) drops to her remaining right eye to prevent rupture and infection. She's been excellent with this routine the last year and a half.

Yesterday however, her eye seemed to be discharging a lot of clear liquid so my boyfriend and I took her to our local vet center with an ophthalmologist on call. They gave us some medicine to give her for the night and told us to bring her in early the next morning to actually be seen by the specialist. The options would be a graft or full removal leaving her totally blind. Both operations are expensive but removal is cheaper.

Ever since we had her first eye removed I thought that euthanization would probably be the best option because I imagine it'd be hard for her to live out the rest of her days as a suddenly blind senior indoor cat and the operation to remove would still be too expensive. I'm not sure what the specialist will say tomorrow but my boyfriend and I have thought that we'd be okay with her being fully blind. Since we took her home though, she hasn't been able to see well and seems to be miserable. 

Could it just be because of the pain? Is full blindness worth it? How do older cats adjust to sudden blindness?

Update: We elected for the surgery to remove her eye due to the whole situation kind of being an emergency anyway but this was over a week ago and so far she's doing pretty well. The vet said that it's possible she was using her peripherals when she did have her eye because even though the sequestrum covered her pupil, she seemed to have excellent vision. I didn't realize how much she was compensating. When we took her in the night I first wrote this post, they administered some kind of medication that made her eye totally bleed when we took her home that evening. 

I mean, I'm not sure if it was the medication itself or if that was supposed to happen, or if that would have happened anyway. Her vision that night was terrible so the next morning she had the removal surgery. It was really, really difficult to see her in that state which is why I thought about euthanization for a while. But whenever I mentioned it to vets, they always changed the subject or steered me away from viewing it as a viable option, even though my cat is a senior. 

It was hard because I felt like I was made to force her to keep living a miserable life and screwed out of $1,500 at the same time for it; my boyfriend and I are both students. When my cat got sick once as a side effect of being given cheaper cat food when my relatives were watching her, they almost had her put down without telling me because they thought the vets I saw were just taking advantage (tangential story, but with this new emergency payment it will be hard to bring it up with them). My boyfriend reassured me by saying that, animals will typically give you a ""sign"" that their time is up and hers wasn't. 

Obviously I'm happy to get to have more time with her and I'm very happy that's she's healing really fast. She is getting used to blindness and can even climb on and off the sofa and bed. She has no issue finding her food or litterbox too. She's just stuck with the e-cone for now, but she'll get her stitches out in about a week. I'm saving up to pay for the surgery and my boyfriend is helping out too, its just harder this time because when she had surgery for her left eye a few years ago, it was done by an intern at the vet clinic so we were able to get a generous discount. So that's pretty much been the only worry lately. Otherwise things are good. 

I guess as a sidenote, this whole ordeal has kind of made me wonder if vets are supposed to steer people away from euthanization when it's brought up? Like I understand there's a code of ethics to be followed, because when my relatives almost had my cat put down they said the vet they called was willing, but when I saw my vet that same day he said it would be totally unethical to put down a healthy animal. Well, my cat has been relatively healthy since then besides her deteriorating vision and the toll its taken on us emotionally and financially, so shouldn't it still have been a possibility this time?

4ohxix,4,2016-06-17,Will my senior cat really be better off blind?,c4273073,AskVet,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/4ohxix/will_my_senior_cat_really_be_better_off_blind/,"Species: long-hair tortoiseshell

Age: 14

Sex/Neuter status: F/spayed

My cat is about 14 years old and for last few years has had issues with her eyes due to possibly being part Persian. Her left eye developed a sequestrum that ruptured then got infected, so it was removed. The vet I was referred to at the time had the procedure done by an intern so I got an incredible discount which helped because me and my boyfriend were (and still are) students. Her left eye was removed in December of 2014 but before her surgery she developed one on her right eye. Since then, we've just been administering ofloxacin (antibiotic) drops to her remaining right eye to prevent rupture and infection. She's been excellent with this routine the last year and a half.
Yesterday however, her eye seemed to be discharging a lot of clear liquid so my boyfriend and I took her to our local vet center with an ophthalmologist on call. They gave us some medicine to give her for the night and told us to bring her in early the next morning to actually be seen by the specialist. The options would be a graft or full removal leaving her totally blind. Both operations are expensive but removal is cheaper.
Ever since we had her first eye removed I thought that euthanization would probably be the best option because I imagine it'd be hard for her to live out the rest of her days as a suddenly blind senior indoor cat and the operation to remove would still be too expensive. I'm not sure what the specialist will say tomorrow but my boyfriend and I have thought that we'd be okay with her being fully blind. Since we took her home though, she hasn't been able to see well and seems to be miserable.
Could it just be because of the pain? Is full blindness worth it? How do older cats adjust to sudden blindness?

I'm a near grad at CWU from Pierce County, Tacoma area. Out of curiosity, how is the job market in Seattle for most of you? Especially in CS!

I've had a hard time finding anything job wise in this area. My first job when I was 16 was 1 out of 2 places that called me back after floating around 50+ applications and following up a week after applying. Since then, I hadn't even been able to find another retail job while I've been studying.

Nowadays I've been trying to find a job or internship in my field, computer science, but I've only been offered to get a call once I graduate. I'm trying to work, even in IT, while I take 1 class at a time before I'm finished early next year, but it seems like I've hit a wall."

&gt;For weeks, Atsushi Nakajima's orphanage has been plagued by a mystical tiger that only he seems to be aware of. Suspected to be behind the strange incidents, the 18-year-old is abruptly kicked out of the orphanage and left hungry, homeless, and wandering through the city.

&gt;While starving on a riverbank, Atsushi saves a rather eccentric man named Osamu Dazai from drowning. Whimsical suicide enthusiast and supernatural detective, Dazai has been investigating the same tiger that has been terrorizing the boy. Together with Dazai's partner Doppo Kunikida, they solve the mystery, but its resolution leaves Atsushi in a tight spot. As various odd events take place, Atsushi is coerced into joining their firm of supernatural investigators, taking on unusual cases the police cannot handle, alongside his numerous enigmatic co-workers.

Quite frankly I really, really want to intern for Conan. I've been a massive fan of the show ever since it got started, and it would an amazing stepping stone for my career. I live in Seattle (I would be willing to relocate for a semester), but I'm feeling pretty isolated up here and have a few questions I could use some help working through. If anyone's interned or even just applied, I'd really love to hear from you:

1. How much television experience should I have built up to even be considered? I've only had one solid television intern experience, but it was a rather large production and I learned a ton about the business and made some great contacts. Is this enough, in addition to having a related major plus some smaller jobs? Or should I keep building my resume before applying?

2. Is the application itself still done as a resume submitted to the intern email listed on Conan's website? How did you find out about the internship, and how did you apply? I was wondering if there's any other way I should go about getting my name in there without becoming a hassle to the hiring coordinator.

3. Letters of recommendation, yay or nay? Is it better just to have a solid list of references/contacts?

4. How long did it take you to hear back for a phone interview?

Any advice or information at all in addition to this would be hugely helpful. Thank you!

*****
&gt; LONDON - The intern credited with saving the life of U.S. Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords has spoken out about the murder of British MP Jo Cox, drawing on the risks politicians face while in office.

&gt; In a blog post for The Hill, Daniel Hernandez, Jr. wrote about the questions people running for office must answer.

&gt; &amp;quot;From &amp;#039;Am I qualified?&amp;#039; and &amp;#039;How will this impact my family?&amp;#039; to &amp;#039;Will I make the right choices?&amp;#039; But there&amp;#039;s another question that is rarely asked out loud. That question is &amp;#039;Will my family and I be safe?&amp;#039;&amp;quot; wrote Hernandez.

&gt; &amp;quot;It is that very accessibility that means at times we have people who protest us, shout at us, even threaten us. It is not unusual for public servants to receive death threats. We do what we can to cut down on the risks but at the end of the day they are a reality of modern political life,&amp;quot; Hernandez continued.

&gt; &amp;quot;Today, we hear of the death of Member of the British Parliament, Jo Cox, assassinated by a person who disagreed with her. It has become an all too normal occurrence that we give into hate. Fiery rhetoric from politicians is nothing new but what is new is the acceptance of demagoguery as political speech. Our continued acceptance that hate speech is&amp;quot;politics as usual&amp;quot; will divide us at a time when we need to come together.

&gt; Hernandez called on those in public service to remember Cox&amp;#039;s words spoke in the House of Commons.

Now, we have a new intern at work who's working on a project that has a C++ backend and he wants to be able to store the data on our Mongod instance. I pointed him in the direction of the C++ driver, but I was wondering if the same automatic serialisation was available in this version like there is in the C# version. I can't seem to find anything about it (searches just keep showing results about the C# version), and the quick start documentation only deals with Bson document objects just like the C# documentation does. Would anyone here know if this functionality is available?"

The thing is I have dreams and I like to think they are realistic but not if I live in this state. I would LOVE to be able to rent or even buy a small house with a garage in my 20s, but that's almost unheard of out here. A lot of my friends rent apartments in the city with roommates and still pay $1000+ a month, that's insane. 

Housing stays expensive even far outside the city. I live in a kind of bad small town and we still have to rent because it's too expensive to buy anything. 

Would I have to move out of this state to be able to buy or rent a house like that? Would that also mean I'm going to live in the sticks somewhere because the closer to the main cities = more $$$?

4ojg6a,1,2016-06-17,Urgent Help With Car Situation [Auto],pirsen,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4ojg6a/urgent_help_with_car_situation_auto/,"**TLDR:** I commute about an hour every day to my summer internship. The car I drive is experiencing both engine and transmission problems (I believe). I have $3,500 in my bank account and $30,000 in student loans. I don't know what to do.

**Background**

I'm a 22 year-old college student. I have two semesters remaining, so I will be graduating in May 2017. This summer I landed an internship with a DoD contractor. The commute is roughly 50 minutes, but I've been carpooling with my friend, so I'm only making the drive two or three days a week. However, after my first week I'm having major car trouble. I have an appointment to get it looked at tomorrow at noon (that's the soonest I could get in), so I'll know definitively whether or not it's even worth getting work done on it. It seems like it could be engine and/or transmission problems, both things that aren't cheap to my knowledge. 

It's a 2000 Chevy Metro that I got a few years ago for roughly $4000, so if the estimate is +$1500, it probably won't be worth fixing in my eyes. It had 66,000 miles on it when I bought it, and now it's sitting around 88,000. A lot of that is  from commuting to-and-from home when I was visiting an ex on weekends for a while who lived about 140 miles away.

I knew I was going to be driving a lot this summer for the internship, and my car had already been experiencing this problem with the engine thumping every once in a while when it slowed down. I took it to Firestone to get it looked at last week, and they even had it for two days, but they couldn't get it to act up in the way I had described. Thinking that my car would fine for the commute this summer, I paid ~$100 to get the AC recharged, so I wouldn't be dying of heat exhaustion five days of the week on the long summer drives home. A few weeks ago I also dropped about $300 to get things done in order to pass inspection.

So now to my financial situation. From student loans and such, I'm in debt around $30,000. I've exhausted my federal aid since I've been in school a little longer. However, my father got a job at a university that I've since transferred to, and that allows me to have my tuition waived. I usually end up paying only a few hundred dollars in fees and books each semester. I have about $3,500 in my bank account. 

My parents are not very good at managing their finances, and they're pushing me towards making payments on a new or new-ish car. To quote my mom: ""Everyone is in debt for the rest of their lives anyway, that's just how the world works."" No, that's not how the world works. I don't want to be in debt for the rest of my life. I don't want to follow in their footsteps. I know people get out of bad situations; I've seen in first-hand on this subreddit. I want to graduate college and pay off my student loans, so that I can be debt-free.


Depending on how this summer goes, I may be able to work more during the upcoming semesters. I have enough credits to graduate at this point, it's just two or three required classes holding me back (I can't finish in one semester because of how the classes are offered). I could potentially go part-time as a student, and work 2-3 days a week at the place I'm doing my internship. I took an 8-month leave from school two years ago because I couldn't afford it anymore, so I used up a good amount of my grace period. Luckily my dad got a job at a university which I was able to transfer to. That being said, if I were to go part-time I'm fairly certain I would have to start paying back student loans almost immediately due to my grace period being used up. I don't know what my payments will look like, but I'm planning on calling today since I have the day off.


**Options**

The way I see it, my options are:

1. Pay to have current car fixed.


2. Ask friend to drive every day in exchange for compensation.


3. Buy another used car outright.


4. Make payments on a newer car. 


Option #1:
I won't know how much this will cost until tomorrow. There is an amount of uncertainty associated with this option, since there's not saying that something else won't go wrong the next day, but I'll have a better idea of where I stand which this option after tomorrow.

Option #2:
I'm not sure if he would mind, but his car is a lot more reliable than mine. In addition to that car, he has another car that his parents bought him that they only let him drive once in a while because it's so new. So the wear and tear on his ""beater"" car doesn't matter too much to him. Of course he has no obligation to help me out and the decision would be completely up to him. The downside with this option is that it doesn't address the issue with my car. I could keep it and use it for personal use until it dies, or I could try to sell it to get some cash and save up for a better car in the future. During the semester I could get a ride with my dad to and from school, but if I work during the semester I would have no safe way of getting to and from work. Essentially this option buys me a little time.

Option #3:
In my price range, I won't be able to get a car in much better shape than the one I'm currently driving. Everything in my price range is early 2000's with +100,000 miles. So I run the risk of finding myself in a similar situation after a while. It's a gamble buying used, which makes think this option is about equivalent to option #1, but will cost a little more.

Option #4:
This is probably the safest option in terms of having a reliable way to get to and from work. However, it's also the biggest financial commitment. I'm already $30,000 in debt, and locking myself into a car payment will end up adding roughly $10,000-$15,000 if I want to get a decent, reliable car from what I'm seeing. If I choose to go part-time as student in the upcoming fall and spring semester and work more, it makes me nervous to think about having both a car payment as well as a student loan payment every month. Plus I'll have to pay for insurance, books, and fees for school. The upside is that I won't have to worry about getting to and from work and school and other obligations. I'm on my own and parents can't help me out financially in any way.


I need to have a plan by Monday, so I'm grateful for any help/guidance that anyone has to offer!

I am a D3 runner at a small liberal arts college, and this summer I am doing an internship with ShoeKicker, a new startup founded by former collegiate runners. I'm helping them collect data to build a tool that will help runners find their best possible running shoe. 

I know this is a big favor, but could you please take a few minutes and complete this very short survey http://bit.ly/1WQmTWb ? It would be so helpful with building this recommendation service, plus one survey respondent will win free shoes for a year! 

Thank you for all your help, and I hope summer training is going well!

Parents, man",Yonerest,teenagers,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/4ojlqr/rantjust_parents_man/,"OK, this is gonna be a really shitty rant and IDK if I'm really justified in ranting against my parents bc sometimes they're awesome but I gotta get this off my chest.


They're just like, REALLY annoying now that summer has started. Before, when I had school, I got to see a lot of my friends every day and chill with them at lunch and in classes and stuff and I loved it, it was fucking awesome. Honestly, this was probably the best school year of my life because of how many new friends I made this year. I was like, super antisocial(barely any friends at all) in the past few years. I'd love to make plans with these people, but every time I try to hang out with them it's always a huge argument with them about hanging out with human beings and how that's important for me. Last year, I was content with playing video games throughout my entire day and they bring that up from time to time and they just don't understand how I've matured a little bit and want to go do some stuff now. I'm also taking some summer classes and have a job that, both of which, they need to drive me to, and they start getting angrier and angrier that they need to drive me around. Added onto that, they're fasting for Ramadan and they're always really cranky whenever I talk to them, and they just don't like putting in any effort into anything when they're fasting. The worst part about it is that my dad won't let me take drivers ed until next summer when I'd have been 16 for half a year already. I also go to a magnet high school in a large city so my friends live pretty far away from me. Just, WTF mom and dad, either let me drive or take me places so I can get back to having a social life. They force along to visit their friends all the time but still refuse to take me around?


They've also been PILING stress onto me about this summer precalc course because they've put in a ""large amount"" of work driving me there every morning(my school IS across the city, but it's on the route to my mom's office so she drives by there anyways) and they feel that I'm not studying enough even though I'm at school for 4 hours a day plus I do homework when I get home. You add me working onto that(and it's an internship, so I'm not even making money) and I barely even get time to play video games on the weekdays.


They're also just plain weird and annoying sometimes. Both of my parents are incredibly irrational and tend to lie to me to make me do stuff. They never praise my good work yet always tend to criticize me for whatever I do wrong. They often say really horrible or incredibly racist things and I honestly cannot tell if they're joking or not. They're hardcore Islamic parents and expect me to be a pretty good Muslim but I really don't care for religion in the slightest, but I can't really break that information to them otherwise they'd probably disown me.


At least I have snapchat and video games, but god damn, I really don't want to deal with these people for another 3 years.


TL;DR: Parents won't let me drive which pisses me off because they also won't drive me around everywhere."

My eventual goal is to either get a Masters/PhD, research at a major tech company like Microsoft or Google, or possibly even run my own [startup](http://www.techrepublic.com/article/5-ai-startups-to-watch-in-2015) in the field of AI and Machine Learning.

At the same time, I am heavily interested in Linguistics, especially the potential connections it has with AI (i.e Computational Linguistics). I'm wondering how useful for my future job/education outlook would it be to do a Linguistics major/minor, or if it would be better to focus my time in other ways (research, internships, other majors?).

4okkyx,5,2016-06-17,cage for coming home on weekends?,joseybear,RATS,https://www.reddit.com/r/RATS/comments/4okkyx/cage_for_coming_home_on_weekends/,"Hello!

I will be doing an internship this summer (for three months) that will require me to move away from home. Luckily for me, the location isn't too far that I can't come home on weekends to see friends and family (I usually come home every or every other weekend). 

I have never had my ratties (I have two precious girls!) while I have moved away, so adding them into the situation is new for me. 

Originally, I had bought a travel cage that I planned to take them in and keep them in for the weekend. However, I just put them in it with their food bowl, litter box, and a few toys and it seems so crammed ): 

Now I am second guessing this plan and turning to you all for advice. 

For my permanent home, I have a single critter nation, but it is way too big to try and squeeze into my tiny two-door Chevy cobalt to take home every weekend. I also have the tiny travel cage and a large aquarium as options (although using the aquarium would make me nervous of hurting their respirator systems). Another important fact is that one of my rats has anxiety issues and hates moving cages for any reason or length of time (she has really bad diarrhea every time I move her Into something new), so would leaving them for the weekend be an option? 

My basic week would be as follows:
•Monday - Thursday: At intern-home, ratties in critter nation 
•Friday: I work until around three and leave to go home-home around 4-4:30 pm
•Saturday: stay at home-home 
•Sunday: around 2:00 in the afternoon i head back to intern-home 

So I guess my options are:
-leave ratties at intern-home (with fresh cage and plenty of food and water, of course)
-take ratties with me and keep them in a tiny travel cage from Friday evening to Sunday afternoon
-take ratties with me and keep them in a large aquarium from Friday evening to Sunday afternoon 
-any other option that you guys can think of?

I don't have a ton of money, as I am a typical broke college student, so buying another critter nation or expensive cage is unfortunately just not an option. I looked online in hopes that I would find one or a large bird cage for cheap in my area but had no luck ):

I just want what is best for my girls. I live to make them happy, so this choice is very important to me. 

Thank you in advance!!"

I wont have to pay my loans until december since i get a 6 month grace period but how bad is my situation compared to others?

Will this greatly affect me in the future? Or how will this affect my life moving forward? 

Assuming I make 50-60k a year, is is manageable debt?

I would love to hear what you all think."

4olnhv,2,2016-06-17,I'm in a hard place and the stress is taking a toll on me.,wfarighi,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/4olnhv/im_in_a_hard_place_and_the_stress_is_taking_a/,"Hi all and thank you in advance for reading. 

A little background on me:

* I'm an undergraduate student at a major state university in the US. I'm studying cyber security and risk analysis and I love my major and am passionate about the field. I do well in school. I have one semester left in my career ( I jumped ahead one semester ). 




So... What's the problem? 

As part of my undergraduate degree, I have a requirement to work as an intern in a relevant position with any company that hires me IN ORDER TO GRADUATE. At first I didn't think of this as a big deal, I love the path that I'm on and am looking forward to working for someone within Information Security. The catch is that I need to find a position fast because I'm on track to graduate December of this year. I can intern during the fall semester and graduate in the spring and still be considered to graduate ON TIME. 

ISSUE: I've been trying for months to land an internship. I keep making it to the final rounds of interviews and get cut at the last second. I've gone to my career counselors for help with my resume and interview tips. I've received the same help from my eldest brother who is doing great at his job. So I've revised my resume countless times in an effort to have more opportunities. My interviews haven't gone wrong (however that's from my perspective and the perspective of those I've talked to)... and I hate to sound upset or whiny, but no one will hire me! What kills me is that I'm doing everything I can to get an internship! 

Now because I'm still trying to land an internship I'm experiencing other issues. I have a job on campus as a supervisor and personal trainer. My permanent address is a 3 hour drive from the university and so I have an apartment I'm paying for. My internship hunt has no geographical limit so I've had interviews near the university and close to my permanent address. I thought about where I'd be the most productive and so I decided to stay at my apartment at school and work for the summer while hunting for internships. 

But I don't know where the best place to be is. The money I make on campus doesn't cover all expenses (i.e. rent and bills, they're paid for via loan). My family would prefer me to come home and I feel pressure from them to do so. But I also wouldn't work at home because by the time it would take to find a job, the summer is almost over. 
Since I don't know where to be and I can't land an internship... I'm just really stressed out. I don't know who to vent to because I'm not known for being the one who gets stressed out. 

It's washing over towards my close relationships... My mom and I argue because she wants me to come home and explains that if I'm stressed about money then I shouldn't be spending it away from home. Basically, it'd be more financially sound to come home. 
But what about me not working? I feel like I'd go insane if I didn't have a job... I also feel like a disappointment if I go home because it's like I lost the battle and am returning a loser. I know that may sound ridiculous but I have to be honest with how I'm feeling. At the same time I feel like I'm disappointing my family by not being with them. 
Consciously, I'm aware I'm a mature adult who is confident and should not be a disappointment... But, again, if I'm being honest... I just feel so shitty and stressed because I can't manage to ""succeed."" 
All in all, I'm really tired and exhausted. I'm playing a waiting game to see if other people ""like"" me or not (I know hiring is more complicated than that but that's how I feel). 

**tl;dr -** I'm stressing over not landing an internship and I need one to graduate. I'm actively doing everything I can to get one. Stress is clouding my judgement and I'm finding myself more and more upset. 

EDIT: I'd be happy to answer any clarifying questions. I know I just thought-vomited everywhere so it may be confusing. "
4olvl8,38,2016-06-17,How I got out of a toxic relationship and into a perfect one (m/f),SexyScienceThrowaway,gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/4olvl8/how_i_got_out_of_a_toxic_relationship_and_into_a/,"Time for some backstory. This all happened last week Monday so it's still super fresh in my mind. I had been with this girl, let's call her Natasha, for 4 years. She isn't the prettiest girl, and is a bit overweight, and I'm not really attracted to that, but we got along so well. Now, tasha and I had been in love, and I felt like she was perfect for me. Problem was, she suffered from a deep depression and had been on the verge of suicide a few times while we had been going out. I tried to stay positive. I knew it wasn't my fault, and I tried everything I could to help her with it, but I knew she needed professional help. For the last year or so, I have been going through an internal struggle. Should I leave her? When she's healthy, it seems like I'm the only thing keeping her sane, but when she's not, I feel like there's nothing I can do to make it better. In addition to all of this, I started feeling like we had less and less in common every month. I felt like I was growing and changing and she couldn't keep up because of how emotionally unstable she is. Anyway, I'm a scientist, just starting out my career as an intern, getting a bit of pay, enough to cover tuition for my PhD. Natasha is in business, and lately it has been much harder for us to talk about anything interesting, and her depression is getting worse. 

Introducing ""Carmen"". Now, I recently met Carmen at the start of this year. She had transferred from one department to another one in the same building as mine, and she worked in a similar field. We met through a mutual friend and are part of the same group that has lunch every day. Now, at the same time as I was struggling with my issues with tasha, Carmen was going through some issues with her boyfriend. I had no idea of this until later. I was immediately crushing on her as soon as I met her. She has a strong personality. Really tough and no bullshit kind of person. She likes to wear baggy pants and hoodies, which I find extremely attractive. And her body is just my type. Carmen is short and small, but with at least a handful of chest on her, a skinny wasteline, and big hips. The kind that sway from side to side naturally. And her smile. God, I can't describe it. And this is all without even starting on how smart she is. I don't mean to brag, but I'm a very quick thinker. I'm logical about everything and solve problems quickly. Carmen is one of the first people I've met that is sharper than I am. This really gets me going. Just in comparison, I'm a chubby guy, not particularly tall, I wouldn't say obese, I've just got a bit of belly. I do think I've got a good looking face though, and I'm quick with a joke and a very friendly person. I tend to get along with everyone, but women have never given me much attention unless I really put effort into a relationship. 

Now, Carmen seemed to like me from the second we met. She always paid more attention to me than I was used to, and would always be upset when I couldn't make it to our lunch group. I didn't quite understand this, because we both knew about our current relationships. Anyway, she started coming up to my office on a regular basis for one on one conversations. At first, we would talk about our work. She is really great at solving problems and getting around issues in the lab. Soon we started getting more personal. We started talking about the problems we were having in our relationships. At this point, I was a little disappointed, but had come to terms with the fact that this would probably just be a really close friendship, and nothing more.

A few weeks later, Carmen didn't show up for work from Wednesday to Friday, but I didn't really notice because I was so consumed in another of Natasha's episodes. I was at my emotional breaking point. I sat her down and told her I couldn't take it anymore. I'm a cheerful guy, but depression can be so contagious. I ended it with tasha on the Thursday. I felt like a complete piece of Shit, but also, that I had done the right thing. Tasha needed someone who could always be there for her, and who could give her the help she needed. On Saturday, I got completely wasted. Sunday, I had no regrets. I felt like I was free of a burden I had been carrying for years. That might sound incredibly selfish, and maybe it is. I don't know. All I know is that I felt like I could breath again. I had been struggling with this for so long, in my mind, I had broken up with her weeks ago. So I called up some friends, including Carmen, and organised a hang out at a bar we often go to. 

The others all bail last minute, so there I am at a bar alone at 3 PM on a Sunday. Enter: Carmen. She comes in and sits right next to me at the table already holding a drink. She immediately asks if I'm ok. Clearly I looked a bit upset that no one had showed. Also, she probably could tell how upset I would be from how I reacted on the whatsapp group. At this point I'm super nervous. Pretty much the girl of my dreams is sitting right next to me, caring about my feelings. I told her about the breakup, and we talked for a few hours over a couple of drinks. We both got really emotional after a while, and she started complaining about how her boyfriend was so emotionally distant. I mean, I like the guy, he's a good guy, but he clearly wasn't right for her. I started getting that firey feeling inside. I don't know if it's just me, but it happens when I know I need to make a move. I started getting closer to her, but I felt her pulling away, so I backed out. I thought I'd had a few drinks and misread the situation. Soon after, she said she had to go, so we went our separate ways. Fast forward to the next day, and Carmen is waiting for me at my parking spot as I come in to work. She looks upset.

So we talk as we walk to the building. Carmen says a few words that I don't think I'll forget for a long time. ""I broke up with him last night"". I felt my heart beating faster. Was it because of me? Should I feel guilty about this? I don't know if you can tell by now, but I pretty much over think everything. Anyway, I tell her I think she did the right thing, because at this stage, I'm over excited. I also say if she needs to talk, she knows where my office is. 

I hardly got any work done. Couldn't keep my mind where it needed to be. I couldn't stop thinking about the situation. Was it all my fault? Did I ruin a perfectly good relationship? Or did this have nothing to do with me? Am I overestimating my role in this? Should I feel guilty for already wanting this so soon after I abandoned my own girlfriend? Lunch time rolls along, and I head down to the usual table at the usual restaurant on the campus. The regular crowd shuffles in, and the mood seems really happy. The girls (pro tip, cellular science is mostly women) seem to be laughing and joking about something, Carmen included. Throughout lunch, Carmen is giving me looks. I couldn't help but feel confused. She is smiling at me and giving me apprehensive looks in the same sentences. For someone I thought I had a close bond with, I really didn't understand her at that point. When we had finished our lunch, we all got in the elevator. I work on the top floor, so I'm always the last to get out. Carmen didn't get out at her floor, and grabbed my hand as we got to my floor. She took me by my hand and led me to my office. Once we were inside, she locked the door. Now I knew what was going on. I. Couldn't quite believe all the pieces had fallen into place so perfectly. I kissed her deeply. Thank fuck I had read that situation right, because she kissed me right back. 

We got really into it, and our bodies were rubbing against each other. I could hear my supervisor coming back from lunch outside, but I really didn't care. Carmen whispered in my ear, and I'll never forget this, ""please don't judge me for this"". She pulled away from me and quickly took off the Jersey she was wearing. Underneath she wasn't wearing anything. I definitely wasn't judging her. Her breasts are perfect. Just the way I like them. Big and round, just touching each other in the middle a little, and holding themselves up enough so she doesn't have to wear a bar under the hoodies she normally wears. I start unbuttoning my shirt, and start feeling a little self-conscious about the aforementioned belly. She seemed to be into it though. I've got nice arms, so it's not all flabby. She gets close to me and presses her beautiful chest up against my midsection, looking up at my with her big brown eyes as I leaned down to kiss her. We kissed passionately and I gently squeezed her boobs. I could tell she was getting worked up. She started opening her mouth more, getting her tongue more involved and using one of her hands to try to get my belt off. 

Eventually I helped her with my belt, pulling away from the kiss to slip her pants off at the same time. She was wearing those cute little girl boxer brief things. I'm not sure what they're called, but they barely covered her ass. She has a ridiculously firm ass for it's size. Her big hips means it's wide, but it bulges out too. I could tell she was a bit embarrassed about having a big ass, and in my experience, most white girls are. I pulled her close to me and dug my fingers into the lower part of her ass, spreading her cheeks as I kissed her again. My pants were around my ankles at this stage, but my underwear were already off. Legitimately bothered me that she took mine off but kept hers on. I like things to happen evenly. 
Anyway, my dick was obviously very hard at this stage. It's quite wide, and around 7 inches long. Quite big if you ask me, but I'm no pornstar. She grabbed it and started rubbing it up and down. She had stopped kissing me and was breathing heavily in my ear as she did this. I could tell she really enjoyed either holding my Cock or me squeezing and massaging her ass. 

I lifted her onto my desk and pulled down her panties. She takes good care of her hair, and there is only a small tuft of brown hair above her clearly wet pussy. I started to move my fingers up and down her moist slit, ready to finger her. She gasped and bit me on my shoulder and squeezed my Cock hard as I reached her cute little clit. Carmen had other plans, and pulled me close forcefully. She is much stronger than I thought, and she nimbly guided my Cock right to her slippery pussy, pushing my head in before letting out a little squeal. She wrapped her legs around my waist and pulled me deeper inside her, sinking her teeth into my earlobe. This really gets me going, and I started to thrust into her at a medium pace, but hitting quite hard. She felt great. I could feel her walls resist me as I got deeper every time, and she inhaled sharply every time I got all the way in. I still couldn't quite believe this was happening, and I started getting faster. She was so wet, and so into it, we were making a mess on the desk, and the rocking knocked a few pens and papers off the other side. I was squeezing her ass and spreading her cheeks as she dug her nails into my back, and rested her head on my chest, biting her lower lip, feeling my rock hard cock slamming into her again and again. I could feel her thighs tense up around my legs and she started to quiver. I could feel her orgasm rolling through her, and I started to thrust slower, but much harder, slamming forcefully into her and feeling her quake with every thrust. I started getting close, and she could definitely tell. She pushed me away from her and dropped off the desk onto her knees, taking the head of my cock into her mouth and stroking the shaft quickly. She looked so fucking eager for me to cum I couldn't hold back. I started cumming into her mouth and she just swallowed all of it, then licked her lips. I was in shock. No one had ever swallowed my load before. We made out a lot after that, which was also new for me, because I had never tasted my own cum before. A bit salty, but I couldn't give less fucks at that stage. We cleaned up and started talking about what had just happened. She told me she was going to fuck me anyway, but she didn't want to cheat on her boyfriend. She was also very hands on while we were talking. She caressed my belly a lot, because I know now that she loves it. Makes her feel safe, which is all good for me. We have hooked up plenty since then, but mostly in my apartment, not in my office. No need to get fired when I live a block away from the university. I really think this girl is special, and I still can't quite believe this has happened to me. 

My first story on here. The only experience I have that is really worth sharing. Sorry the intro bit was so long, but I felt it needed explaining. Sorry about spelling and random capitalisation. I'm on my phone. Last thing I'm sorry about, sorry I chose the name Carmen. It just doesn't quite fit her and it felt wrong calling her that the whole story. Anyway, let me know what you think!

Edit. Spelling."

Or they should be.,dantepicante,HillaryForPrison,https://www.reddit.com/r/HillaryForPrison/comments/4olxo8/the_fbi_is_putting_together_a_rico_case_against/,"EDIT: Found the ""Friends of The Clinton Centre"" address and added it

EDIT 2: Added more info about The Clinton Centre I found in the wikipedia edit history.

I'm not sure where to post this so I figure it'll be welcome here at least. I sorta tumbled down a rabbit hole earlier today when researching the Huma Abedin FOIA-released emails. I only started compiling stuff today, and I haven't spent TOO much time on it, so let me know if I'm wrong about anything.

Grab a snack, this is a long one:

The Clintons are heavily involved with:

* **Teneo Holdings**, a consulting firm whose website says is focused on working exclusively with the CEOS and leaders of the world's largest and most complex companies and organizations

* **Doug Band**, one co-founder of Teneo (and also president thereof,)

* **Declan Kelly**, Irish business man and former Irish Ambassador to a number of countries and also a co-founder of Teneo, and

* **Huma Abedin**, who worked as a paid consultant for Teneo in the latter half of 2012.

Let's begin.

&amp;nbsp;

**Doug Band:**

Doug Band was a longtime counselor to Clinton, and more. From his [Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Band):
&gt; Douglas J. Band previously served as counselor to President Bill Clinton. He began working in the White House in 1995 working with Cheryl Mills as an unpaid intern in the White House Counsel's Office. Band served in the White House Counsel's office for four years, becoming a special assistant to the President before he was made one of the youngest deputy assistants ever to serve a President.[7] Band concluded his final year in the White House in the Oval Office as the President's Aide.[7] ""

&gt;"" Band served as counselor and chief advisor to President Clinton until 2013, and has been described as ""the key architect of Clinton's post-presidency.""[7] Although he was not the CEO, he oversaw the 1,200 employees of both the William J. Clinton Foundation and the President's personal office.[7] In his previous role, Band traveled to nearly 100 countries, over 2,000 cities, and helped and advised several heads of state transition out of public office into private life.[5] He assisted in creating and building the Clinton Global Initiative that has raised, according to figures released by the Clinton Foundation, $69 billion for 2,100 philanthropic projects around the world.[10] Clinton has credited Band with being the originator of CGI and has noted that ""Doug had the idea to do this.""[11] Band resigned from the Clinton Foundation in April 2015.[12]

&gt; Band was responsible for negotiating with the Obama Administration for then-Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton to become Secretary of State.[13] He also accompanied former President Clinton during negotiations leading to the release of American journalists Laura Ling and Euna Lee on August 4, 2009.[14]  

&amp;nbsp;

And, from [this article from newrepublic.com](https://newrepublic.com/article/114790/how-doug-band-drove-wedge-through-clinton-dynasty):

&gt;Twelve years earlier, at the age of 27, Band had entered Clinton’s orbit as that lowliest of Washington archetypes: the body man. He was the all-purpose aide who carried the bags, provided the pen, watched the clock, kept the cigars close, and ensured the Diet Cokes were always chilled. And after the inglorious end of Clinton’s presidency, Band had stayed on. It was he who had engineered Clinton’s transformation into a philanthropist-king, and over the years, the pair had formed a bond that was more like father and son than boss and factotum. “The most important thing about Doug is that he sort of took control of President Clinton’s career at a moment when he was dropping from about sixty percent [favorability] to thirty-nine percent,” says Paul Begala, the former Clinton adviser. “You look up today and Bill is in a league inhabited only by himself and Nelson Mandela and the Pope. He’s one of the most beloved people on the planet and an American political colossus as well. That’s just astonishing—and Doug’s been central to that.”

(The whole article is worth a read, really. Also I have a side-theory that Doug and Bill tag-teamed Monica Lewinski, but that one might be reaching.)

&amp;nbsp;

~~**Declan Kelly:**~~

~~First and foremost, it's pretty darn odd that [Declan Kelly's wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declan_Kelly) is only seven sentences long. Here it is, in its entirety:~~

~~&gt; Declan Kelly was the Irish Ambassador to Malaysia and Thailand from 2010 to 2015.[1][2] Prior to that appointment he was the Irish Ambassador to Canada, succeeding Martin Burke.[3]~~

~~&gt; He was schooled at St. Vincent's C.B.S., Glasnevin, and is married to Anne Bernadette Kelly. He gave the 2007 convocation address at St. Thomas University in New Brunswick[4]~~

~~&gt; Prior to his placement as ambassador at the Irish embassy in Ottawa, Kelly was the ambassador to Australia, New Zealand and Fiji.[1][5] Earlier, Kelly had been posted to Ottawa from 1985 to 1990 as the First Secretary and Charge d’Affairs at the Irish Embassy.[3]~~

~~&gt; Kelly was Republic of Ireland Consul General in San Francisco from 1992 to 1998.[1] ""~~


**EDIT:** Apparently this is a different Declan Kelly
&amp;nbsp;

It's especially weird because there's no mention of anything to do with info from [this article from politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/04/teneo-final-221807) (the whole article is worth a read if you have a sec):

&gt; The fact that Kelly and Band were laying the groundwork for their enterprise while Kelly was working for the State Department, reported here for the first time, represents a fresh illustration of the blurring of the lines between Hillary Clinton’s political network and her State Department that critics have long noted. And it shows how one enterprising fundraiser was able to insinuate himself into Clinton's inner circle and then built a 500-person, multinational consulting firm whose value, at least at first, was greatly enhanced by its founders’ closeness to the Clintons.

&amp;nbsp;

**Huma Abedin:**

If you've been following the election you'll have heard Huma's name once or twice. The short version from [her Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huma_Abedin):

&gt; Huma Mahmood Abedin (Urdu: هما محمود عابدین‎; born July 28, 1976)[1] is an American political staffer. She has been a long-time aide to Hillary Clinton, and was U.S. Secretary of State Clinton's Deputy Chief of Staff at the State Department. Prior to that she was traveling chief of staff and served as assistant for Clinton during Clinton's campaign for the Democratic nomination in the 2008 presidential election.[2][3][4] She is married to Anthony Weiner, a former U.S. Representative from New York. Abedin serves as vice chairwoman of Clinton's 2016 campaign for President.[5]

&amp;nbsp;

Emails released via FOIA request show that Abedin worked at both the state department under Hillary Clinton and Teneo. From [this Politico article:](http://www.politico.com/story/2015/09/huma-abedin-teneo-clinton-foundation-email-213965)

&gt; The messages illustrate the relationship between Clinton’s most trusted confidante and the private consulting company that asked for the favor, Teneo — a global firm that later hired Abedin. Abedin signed on with the company while she still held a State Department position, a dual employment that is now being examined by congressional investigators. ""

&amp;nbsp;

And from [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-huma-abedin-operated-at-the-center-of-the-clinton-universe/2015/08/27/cd099eee-4b32-11e5-902f-39e9219e574b_story.html) regarding one of the emails from September 2012:

&gt; “Stella O’Leary called to say she saw HRC this week and that HRC ‘firmly instructed’ her to urgently form a 501c3 called Friends of the Clinton Centre,” Desai wrote. Referring to both Clintons by their initials, Desai continued: “I also asked if the new org could be flexible so that any funding raised could be used in whatever manner WJC and HRC wish in Ireland and Northern Ireland and not restricted to support only the current iteration of the Clinton Centre in Enniskillen.”

&amp;nbsp;

[A 501-3C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/501\(c\)_organization) is a form for creating a tax-exempt nonprofit organization. I did some research and found that ""Friends of The Clinton Centre"" is a indeed a nonprofit company that I can't find a lick of information about. The only thing I know is that it's mail is delivered delivered C/O an Irish lawyer's office in lower Manhattan ~~(I found it on google maps earlier while at work and now that I'm home I can't for the life of me find it again).~~ I called the number listed and the lawyer's firm answered and confirmed their address for me. The address it is [listed under](http://www.companiesny.com/n/business/friends-of-the-clinton-centre-inc/4387481) is: C/O [O'Dwyer &amp; Bernstein, Llp, 52 Duane St., 5Th Fl., New York, New York, 10007](https://www.google.com/maps/place/O'Dwyer+%26+Bernstien,+LLP/@40.7144645,-74.0041815,18.25z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c25a219b7ed10b:0x5ab234396a404b18!8m2!3d40.714354!4d-74.003959). This is a very important area for international and domestic business; within a two-block radius of the place you'll find: 

* NY City Hall

* The United States Court of International Trade

* The IRS

* US Citizenship and Immigration Office

* The Supreme Court

* US District Court

* The NYPD

And it's relatively close to Wall Street and the Federal Reserve Bank as well.

&amp;nbsp;

So when I couldn't find any information on Friends of The Clinton Centre I just investigated ""The Clinton Centre"" instead. I found was [this crappy site about it](http://www.communityni.org/organisation/clinton-centre#.V2Ri7PkrJGN) which reads:

&gt; The Clinton Centre was officially opened in 2002 by President Clinton who gave his name to the facility in dedication to peace and prosperity in Ireland and around the world.

&gt; Situated centrally in the island town of Enniskillen, in the heart of the Fermanagh Lakelands, The Clinton Centre is an ideal Business Centre for your conference or meeting.

&gt; Firmly established as one of the region’s most promising conference and meeting centres, our unique multi-purpose design is suitable for a variety of business, conference and arts events.

&amp;nbsp;

I found a few articles about the Centre, both from irishtimes.com. [The first one](http://www.irishtimes.com/news/clinton-visits-enniskillen-to-open-peace-centre-1.425569), from Wed, Jun 5, 2002, is about its inception. I suggest reading the whole thing, but here's the end of it:

&gt; Mr Clinton last visited Enniskillen in May last year, when he met families bereaved in the bombing and unveiled an inscription on a memorial window of the Peace Centre, which is dedicated to the victims of the blast.

&gt; As Mr Clinton arrived at the building, police forcibly removed one of those injured in the bombing from the entrance to the centre and frogmarched him across the road.

&gt; Mr Jim Dixon was protesting that victims of the bombing had no role in the establishment of the centre.

&gt; ""Victims have had no input, but they are using the victims to get money for it,"" he claimed.
After leaving Enniskillen, Mr Clinton will travel to Dublin for discussions with business leaders about the financing of the Clinton Library in Arkansas.

&gt; He will then play a round of golf with senior business executives before receiving an international achievement award for his role in the peace process.

&gt; He will leave the following morning after a meeting with the Taoiseach, Mr Ahern.

&amp;nbsp;

It seems to me like the author was trying to help people connect the dots without outright saying anything, but that's just speculation.

&amp;nbsp;

[The other article](http://www.irishnews.com/news/2015/08/31/news/clinton-centre-peace-centre-fundraising-claims-245856/), from August 1, 2015,  regards the aforementioned Citizens United FIOA case looking into Clinton corruption where the Abedin emails came from:

&gt; Citizens United claim that in 2012, Amitabh Desai, foreign policy adviser for Clinton family charity The Clinton Foundation, consulted Mrs Clinton's chief of staff and other Clinton aides about establishing a not-for-profit organisation called Friends of The Clinton Centre to fund the Enniskillen-based William J Clinton International Peace Centre, opened by Bill Clinton in 2002

&gt; Citizens United's suggestion that this was an Irish 'slush fund' for the Clintons was flatly denied by Mrs O'Leary, who told The Irish Times it was ""the funniest thing I have ever heard.""

&gt; ""I don't think the Clintons need a slush fund in Enniskillen,"" she said.

&gt; The group are also critical of long-serving Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin, highlighting Ms Abedin's role in organising a Dublin dinner for Irish supporters of Mrs Clinton in 2012 while working for her at the State Department, a matter also documented on email.

&amp;nbsp;

**Teneo Holdings**

Alright so, Teneo Holdings scares me. It was founded by the two guys I mentioned, Doug Band and Declan Kelly, and Irish businessman Paul Keary. Keary doesn't appear to have a wikipedia entry and in fact there seems to be very little information about him at all except for [his bio on the Teneo Holdings website](http://www.teneoholdings.com/bios/paul-keary/). Odd.

&amp;nbsp;

Here's an excerpt from [Teneo's website about ""The Teneo Way""](http://www.teneoholdings.com/the-teneo-way/)

&gt; Teneo believes that three core disruptors are changing the lives of CEOs:

&gt; * Technology and social media

&gt; * Financial market volatility

&gt; * Geopolitical uncertainty

&gt; With these disruptors as a backdrop, Teneo embodies an entirely new approach to CEO advisory services, an approach that stems from a worldview we call the Teneo Way. The Teneo Way is based on the insight that, while the fundamental roles and responsibilities of modern leaders have not changed, the environment in which they develop and execute strategy has been radically transformed. These environmental changes make it harder than ever for a CEO to maintain the integrity of his or her strategy, and they demand a new mode of strategic counsel that:

&gt; * Looks at the world through the CEO’s eyes

&gt; * Is always senior-led and highly specialized

&gt; * Ignores traditional silos

&gt; * Gives chief executives the ability to see around corners and lead their organizations deftly

&gt; * This is the vision behind Teneo and the Teneo Way.

&gt; Teneo uses 12 operating divisions – to guide the leaders of corporations, governments and not-for-profit institutions through this uncertainty. Our experts work together to diagnose problems, devise and execute treatments and monitor results, all from the CEO’s perspective. Success requires an approach that integrates innovation, communications and execution across the client’s entire organization. Seamless, efficient and confidential – that is what distinguishes the methodology embodied in the Teneo Way.

(Note: I didn't format that incorrectly, they have ""this is the vision behind..."" with it's own bullet point. Sloppy work, Teneo)

&amp;nbsp;

Further on they talk about social media:

&gt;Misinformation reposted across social media undermines traditional reputational control – for instance, the recent havoc in the wake of fraudulent tweets that caused market movements representing billions of dollars. On the upside, studies indicate that the trust in and public perception of a CEO improve when he or she is active on social media. Facebook has surpassed 1 billion active users, more than 500 million are active on Twitter, and China’s leading microblogging site, Weibo, has more than 500 million accounts.

&gt; The explosion of social media and the ubiquity of other digital communications channels mean that CEOs must embrace “big data” as a paradigm to increase productivity and efficiency. Exponentially expanding sets of both structured and unstructured data can now be correlated across multiple silos. These innovations have enabled profitable new business solutions in every industry, and leaders are combining human ingenuity with data-driven insights to chart a new future. Simply put, big data is increasingly vital to maintaining a leadership position – and ignoring it raises the risk of falling behind the competition.

&gt; Teneo guides our clients through these technological shifts, providing counsel to monitor and protect their reputations from potential threats and helping them take advantage of the opportunities presented by radical technical innovation.

&amp;nbsp;

It sounds to me like they Correct the Record a lot.

&amp;nbsp;

**ANYWAY**

If I were to speculate on this, my guess would be that the FBI is investigating Teneo, the Clintons, and all the other major players. I would guess that Teneo's clients, some of the most powerful and influential people/companies/governments in the world, are very interested in passing the TPP. I would guess that they would use every favor they could to ensure the next POTUS is someone they trust will return the favor and pass the TPP. "

Ive been keto'ing my ass off and making lots of headway(at least I think so). I broke under 170 so Im out of that 172ish purgatory. Consistent morning weigh ins are 169.5 and under, IM MOVIN FAM.

My internship has made dieteing easy as fuck. I gotta wake up at 5ish to do my cardio(1 hour 3.2mph 5% incline). Ill get home, make 1c egg whites with peppers onions and turkey bacon and get my ass to work. By 5pm im home and Ill usually take the dog out and do some chores until 8 where I make a big ass meal consisting of either beef\tuna. My favorite lately has been an 8oz stuffed naked burger. Ill mix some finely diced green peppers, onions, and some cheddar cheese inside of it and serve it over a bed of romaine. For toppings Ill do sour cream guac and some seasonings. 

Im getting to the point now where starving is kinda normal. Im sweating my ass off 24\7 so I think I got the meat sweats. 


What do you guys think conditioning wise? My core has started to come in but Im still seeing lower back fat. Hamstrings are pretty torn, delts and all of that have always been there but Im seeing more chest definiton as of late.

4ommh0,2,2016-06-17,I feel like I have to pick my boyfriend (22M) or my mother (50F),Wateringthejellyfsh,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4ommh0/i_feel_like_i_have_to_pick_my_boyfriend_22m_or_my/,"I apologize for the long rambling post or any spelling/format mistakes. I'm on mobile.


So I've been dating Andrew for two and a half years now. We about to move in together after my internship. At the moment he lives in 'B' town and I'm in 'D' city 3 hrs away doing my internship. We get along well and I love him. Andrew and my mother don't like each other. I feel like Im gonna have to pick a side soon. 


Now Andrew tried to like my mother. However it's hard to like someone who hates you for no reason. She nice to his face and polite but has tried to break us up/tried to talk me into dating other people with out telling him. I'm not too sure why my mother doesn't like him. I don't know if she's being protective or thinks he immature (he is a bit). 


Now last week it came to a head. Last week was my graduation from college. My mom was suppose to come down and I was to go back with her. She lives 4 hours away from this city. Now my mom has a bad habit being flaky. Also my mom hasn't ever been to one of my graduations before. 


Anywho, 1 hour before grad, I texted her Andrews phone number since I had to do gown fitting, etc. She texts me shes stuck in traffic and won't make it but I'll see her after. 4 hours later after my graduation I text her to see what's up. No word. So I figure she flaked and went out to dinner with Andrew to celebrate. 


4 hours later (8 hours since she texted me about traffic) she calls me. Now she called me from a payphone and said she was in traffic in 8 hours(which I don't believe) and her phone is dead. I miss 3 calls from her within a timespan of 7 minutes. I missed them because the restaurant was really loud. She leaves me a really upset voicemail saying 'dont bother, she's going home.' She's pissed at me. 


Andrew listen to the voicemail as I was having a panic attack. I started having really bad anxiety and the rest of the weekend was horrible. Andrew and me got into some fights. He says I was on edge alot. Basically feeling guilty for not answering the phone. My mom has cut off contact before for me not answering the phone beforehand. She has also refused to talk to me since. 


Here's the thing. She is watching my cat for me as I do my internship. I know, bad move on me. I know it's irresponsible for me to dump my cat on other people but the place I'm staying at refused to accept pets last second. My mom has always treated her animals better than her children so I figured my cat would be safe.


Me and Andrew are going up tomorrow to get my cat. He's gonna be staying with Andrew after. I want to be pleasant as possible but Andrew wants me to be ready to get angry/comfort her. I'm worried they're going to fight. Honestly I'm freaking scared. I don't want to hurt her. I dont want her to threaten sucide. My brother doesn't talk to her and I don't want her to be sad over none of her children talking to her.


Andrew thinks shes a bad influence on me. He doesn't like the fact that my father    pays for her rent/bills while she lives with her boyfriend. Or the fact that my mom uses me as a weapon against my father. (Another reason I want my cat, I'm not allowed to talk to my dad. Which I do anyway but since she has the cat I can't really argue with her.) That and she gives me anxiety attacks. 


I just think of my mom as someone with mental illness and she can't control it. Andrew doesn't understand when I say it's hard to cut off your family but I do need her to start respect boundaries. I mean I love her, shes my mom. If I don't cut her off Andrew will be upset. I have cut off contact before. I was 16 and had a restraining order against her after her physically abusing me for a year.  (Which is why she couldn't got to any of my other grads) However she was more aggressive back then and isn't like that now. Plus it is kinda my fault her phone is broken, the cat knocked it down and it smashing the screen. The phone was a 900$ iPhone and I can't afford to replace it. My mom pretty broke right now and did spend her last bit of money on gas trying to come down to my graduation.


Tldr: I rambled alot. Basically bf thinks mother is a bad influence on me and wants me to cut off contact. Mom thinks bf is a bad influence. I just want my cat and everyone happy."

4on9da,2,2016-06-18,Title,Bradend45,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/4on9da/title/,"Hi all honestly I just needed a soundboard and I felt like this was the best place. For a little over a year I feel like my life's been in shambles I've been consistently searching for jobs and unable to find them forcing me to live with my parents for an extra few months between school. During this time I was forced back into my negative terrible other job as well as the crippling loneliness that comes with living between states. When I moved back for school I thought things would change but instead they just got different. My best friend used to be incredibly close and I started to get feelings for her. The two of us had a kind of pseudorelationship going and I really thought it would work out. It didn't and I've still felt the same way for her for a few months now even though I can't get her to acknowledge me anymore. All this time I struggled in classes and had to continue my job search this time with even more fervor. If I don't get an internship this summer I won't be able to graduate college and starting this January I starting very seriously applying for internships and jobs in the area trying to find anything. Not only are positions few in any related field but they are extremely highly competitive. I've applied for 30 positions in the last few months and have been turned down at every single turn. I'm consistently told that I don't have the right experience for them and it's really wearing me down. 

Honestly I just need something literally anything in my life to go positively right now and I can't find anything at all."
4ondzp,31,2016-06-18,Is my parents' treatment of their beagle abusive? Should I do something?,Shamus_Aran,Pets,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pets/comments/4ondzp/is_my_parents_treatment_of_their_beagle_abusive/,"I'm a college student, 22, home for the summer before starting an internship in the fall. My parents are in their early 50's. I don't keep any pets, but the plight of our family's beagle has finally brought me here to ask.

90% of the time the dog is tied up in the garage. He doesn't have a lot of space, and the leash is nowhere near long enough to let him wander around -- 2 to 2.5 feet. The space he can reach is his blanket, his water dish, and his food bowl, and that's it. He has no toys. We have no other pets in or around the house besides the chickens my father keeps in the backyard, which do their own thing most of the time.

The only time the dog is allowed off the leash is when someone is watching him, for fear of him running out into the road and getting hit. We don't have fencing anywhere on the property (an acre or so ranch bordering a highway) so it's a valid fear. What's more, nobody wants to stand out in the Central Florida heat, where it's always the dog days  of summer and fifteen minutes of sitting outside will get you drenched in sweat and half-dead from heatstroke.

So no one wants to go outside and watch him, but in the meantime he's confined to maybe 4 square feet of blanket and concrete with nothing to do. That can't be healthy. Whenever someone comes into the garage to get something, he'll start whining, and when they leave without letting him off his leash (or let him off his leash, get hot, then put him back on and go inside) he starts crying, then howling, which is really annoying my mother as the master bedroom shares a wall with the garage. He'll howl for about five or ten minutes before he quiets down.

The garage has no ventilation other than the breeze (which, being in central Florida, is rare) and mosquitoes are plentiful. Whenever the dog is let off his leash, the first place he goes is to the door to ask to be let in the house -- even before going to pee or rolling to scratch his back in the grass, which he also loves. My mother is adamant that the dog not be let in, because he ""stinks"" and has fleas. My father is saving money for a flea pill to give him, at which point we'll give him a bath and hopefully be able to keep him in the air conditioning.

So, what should I do? Should I wait for my dad to buy the flea pill? Should I call someone about the dog's situation? Should I do *anything?*"

I have about £2k - £2.5k to spend on a new setup (apple juice killed my current laptop). I am a uni student but have a programming internship over the summer (starting soon). This internship will require parallels to run an IDE in a windows environment. 

My options are:

The new Macbook Pro 15inch is supposably coming out in September. I could drop 2.5k on a huge 15inch Macbook Pro, however this would mean I borrow a laptop (definitely doable, but not ideal by any stretch) until it comes out.

I could buy a top spec Macbook 12inch and later buy a low-mid spec iMac (got a decent external monitor as well). Not sure if the 12inch will be powerful enough, but the portability would be insane. 

Any programmers out there who could weigh in on the 12inch suitability (it is a gorgeous machine). I do web dev through parallels on my internship and java through an IDE at uni.

Thanks in advance.

So we are in a secluded and small mountainous town and the only people we know are from the country club, and a majority of the Americans aren't originally from this area. For those of us that smoke ganja, it can be a daunting task to find any at times. 

We have gotten to the point where he has smoked a lot of weed with me from the ounce I bought, and he has given me $10 at my request once and then insisted I front him last night. He had just gotten home and was demanding that I smoke him up. Also a couple hours after that, he came in my room again trying to demand some weed but this time I sent him off since I did not want to smoke anymore and I was sleeping.

Today I came into work and he was blaming me for some stupid shit. He said that it was my fault that we couldn't eat omelettes anymore, while he was eating an omelette (WTF). This guy is a lot bigger than I am and I would rather not force an altercation. If he doesnt buy some from me after I reup or contribute at all, I'm probably gonna not fuck with him any longer.

Und genau das wissen sie, weshalb sie in Diskussionen nicht mehr auf Sinnhaftigkeit der Argumente gucken sondern auf Verteidigung der eigenen Unzulänglichkeiten. 
Wenn jemand sagt er habe nichts zu verbergen habe ich immer direkt zwei Gegenfragen: Vor wem hast du nichts zu verbergen? Und gib mir mal dein E-Mail-Passwort, ich meine das haben die ja sowieso schon. Die Antworten die auf diese zwei Fragen folgen zeigen den Willen zur Verteidigung  der eigenen Unzulänglichkeiten im vollen Ausmaß und spätestens ab diesem Zeitpunkt ist von einer qualitativen Diskussion leider nicht mehr auszugehen. „Vor wem? Ja halt vor der Polizei z.B. oder vor Google, da die meine Daten ja sowieso haben“. 

Ah ja, du hast also nichts vor der Polizei zu verbergen. Du bleibst also stehen wenn die Ampel rot ist und kein Auto weit und breit zu sichten ist? Du hast also noch nie eine MP3 gedownloadet ohne sie zu bezahlen? Und wie sieht es denn eigentlich mit Streams aus? Schon mal ‚ne Serie im Internet geguckt ohne zu bezahlen? Und was würdest du eigentlich davon halten wenn ich den Postboten vor deinem Haus abfange, deine Post lese, wieder zu klebe und sie dir dann in deinen Briefkasten lege? Interessiert dich bestimmt auch nicht, du kriegst es ja nicht mit.

Aber OK, du bist ein braver Bürger und wer dir etwas persönlich schreibt kann es auch gleich als Tafel auf dem Marktplatz platzieren, wenn das deine Meinung ist, Ok. Aber was ist denn jetzt, gibst du mir dein E-Mail-Passwort? Nein?! Wieso nicht? Haben doch sowieso schon alle? Und du hast ja nichts zu verberge. Die Post zu öffnen ist Ok für dich aber dein E-Mail-Postfach ist dir heilig? Tja, Pech gehabt. Denn niemand liest deine Post – dein E-Mail-Postfach wird aber ständig mit gelesen.  
Ah, jetzt verstehe ich, ist dir also egal. Weil nur die dein Postfach lesen, die sowieso deine Daten haben? Und was hälst du davon wenn „Die“, die deine Daten sowieso schon haben, diese zusammentragen mit anderen Informationen von Drittanbietern kombinieren und so ein psychologisches Profil von dir anlegen? – Du hast ja recht war ‚ne dumme Fragen – haben die ja sowieso schon!

Google würde jetzt sagen: Herr Nicht-Anonymus hat einen Steam Account, hier ist er täglich bis zu 4 Std. online. Die GPS-Koordinaten seines Smartphones bewegen sich pro Tag bis zu 8 Std. nicht – Deine Seite auf die du täglich gehst ist PornHub. Das sind drei Informationen, über die Zahl „Drei“ würde Google laut lachen. Was kann ich daraus schon über dich wissen? Du hast keine Freundin! Sitzt den ganzen Tag und durch die Bestellliste von Pizza.de wissen wir das du wahrscheinlich übergewichtig bist – du bist also ein männlicher Zocker mit Titten (Entschuldigung für diese Formulierung). 
Am nächsten Tag erreicht dich ein Brief „Sehr geehrter Herr Nicht-Anonymus, wir müssen leider ihren Krankenkassenbeitrag erhöhen“.

Noch am gleichen Tag denkst du dir, ein neuer Bildschirm wäre mal ganz nett am besten mit 144Hz damit ich noch besser werde in meinen Spielen. Dann gehe ich doch mal auf Amazon. Amazon sagt sich, geil! Da ist ein Typ ohne Freundin der viel zockt und den ganzen Tag sitzt. Der ist bereit mehr auszugeben als ein anderer. Lassen wir doch mal die „nach-preis-sortieren-funktion“ ausblenden und die billigen Bildschirme in der Liste nicht mehr auftauchen. Ach weißt du was… wir machen die Bildschirme bei dir einfach teurer. 

Dann kommt dir oft entgegen: „Aberglaube! Niemals! So machen die das nicht!“…. Und jetzt wird’s interessant. Du traust der Menschheit also nicht zu alles in perfektionierter Effektivität zu Geld zu machen? Du vertraust den Menschen dass die das alles schon gut machen werden und nur das Beste für dich wollen? – Stichwort Abschaffung der Demokratie in Polen? Ah ok, du vertraust denen also tatsächlich. Dann nochmal die Frage – Warum gibst du mir nicht dein E-Mail-Passwort? Jetzt wirst du aggressiv, dass brauchst du gar nicht – die haben deine Daten doch sowieso schon ;). 

Dann bleibt mir nichts anderes mehr übrig als meinen Kopf zu senken über die Menschen zu weinen die so blind vertrauen und einfach selber deine Datensatz für 0,05 Cent zu kaufen und dir beim nächsten mal einfach meinen Bildschirm überteuert anzubieten, oder was du dann auch immer willst, ich weiß es dann ja. 

P.S.: Google und Co. Werden intern folgendes sagen:

Right now she has a 10"" 800mhz 2GB netbook that can't play YouTube videos at 360p without being choppy... It was enough when she just needed something on the very rare occasion she couldn't use the desktop at home, but since she has to write reports for her internship and take summer classes as well, I'd love to get her something a bit better.

I'd like to spend &lt;$200. I might budge a little bit on that for something really good but I also wouldn't mind spending $150...

Optimally, I'd like to get her a 13"" or 14"" with a screen resolution of 1600x900 (or 1920x1080).  
Weight no more than 5lbs; 3-4lbs would be great.  
4GB RAM minimum (6-8GB preferred)  I don't mind if it has low (or no) RAM as long as it is upgrade-able.  
Intel Core i CPU: a new(ish) generation i3/i5 (dual core is fine).   
Integrated graphics is fine, preferred even, but a newer generation such as HD4000 or above would be best.  
I don't care about HDD as I'll be putting in my own SSD.  
Don't care about cd/dvd-rw. As long as it has 2x USB2 ports thats good enough.    
*Must* have stable integrated wifi. Doesn't have to be fast, even the most basic 802.11n speed is fine, but it has to just work.  
*Strongly prefer* a model with backlit keyboard and a semi-decent touchpad.  
I don't care about scuffs or scratches or other cosmetic issues, but it must function properly. I don't mind buying an aftermarket eBay battery.  


Like I said, my budget is &lt;$200 so of course I'm fine with getting something that isn't the latest and greatest. I also have a Haswell system I could trade (probably laptop+cash), plus of course the like new, but ultra low spec, 10"" Win10 netbook ;)

As the title says, I am looking for an internship during this summer in Darmstadt or in the area. I have sent many many CVs and many emails but none of the answers have been positive so far.
About me, im a french student currently doing a full semester in Hochschule Darmstadt and for my school i need to do a 8 weeks internship. Working and learning is of course not a problem for me as i always love to learn new stuff.

I am looking in the field of IT (informatik), i don't mind if it is programming, networking or just administrating. The best for me would be to find something in IT security, but anything else will do. About the dates, i should start around 11th or 18th of July and finish two months later (17th september). Remuneration is optional at this point, i need to find something.

I already have a living place here in Darmstadt and i also have my car so i can move easily around.

If anyone of you know something or someone that could be looking for an intern, just let me know on reddit. 

Let's hope we can make it, in the meanwhile i am still looking on my own of course.

Thanks."

&gt;For weeks, Atsushi Nakajima's orphanage has been plagued by a mystical tiger that only he seems to be aware of. Suspected to be behind the strange incidents, the 18-year-old is abruptly kicked out of the orphanage and left hungry, homeless, and wandering through the city.

&gt;While starving on a riverbank, Atsushi saves a rather eccentric man named Osamu Dazai from drowning. Whimsical suicide enthusiast and supernatural detective, Dazai has been investigating the same tiger that has been terrorizing the boy. Together with Dazai's partner Doppo Kunikida, they solve the mystery, but its resolution leaves Atsushi in a tight spot. As various odd events take place, Atsushi is coerced into joining their firm of supernatural investigators, taking on unusual cases the police cannot handle, alongside his numerous enigmatic co-workers.

4opqhe,1,2016-06-18,Recent graduate in need of advice on next steps,cck_291,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/4opqhe/recent_graduate_in_need_of_advice_on_next_steps/,"Hi there - recent grad here looking for some advice. I apologize in advance if this turns out to be a bit lengthy. Bear with me, I'll try to articulate my situation as best I can. 

So, I just finished college a little over a month ago and I'm at a crossroads in terms of what I should do next. I spent almost the entirety of my senior year freaking out about getting a job and having plans for post-grad; as my friends and peers secured jobs in New York, Chicago, San Fran, etc. I felt an immense amount of pressure to do the same (although in retrospect, I'm not sure why - perhaps just to have something to tell people? I don't know...)

The truth is, I had - and still have - almost no idea what I want to do. But of course that didn't stop me from applying to somewhat random jobs. Fast forward to one month before graduation, I am making headway on the job front; I landed some interviews and was feeling pretty confident, but I quickly realized that some of these jobs were NOT for me (example: business development associate at a software company, which I now know is a fancy term for sales - yuck. I didn't even go through with the second round of interviews) 

I was thinking, why would I, an international studies/anthropology major, enjoy selling software? Even if it meant being around other recent grads and moving to a cool city, I don't think I'd have a very good time. 

So I graduated without a job. It was exactly how I thought it would turn out even before starting college. I'm not naive - I have a liberal arts degree with very little professional experience, no doubt I'm not gonna land my dream job straight out of college. And I don't even know what my dream job is. 

But inevitably I was still freaking out, and I just wanted *something*. However, I wanted that something to be in DC. After having an internship there last summer, I am certain it is the only place I want to live - at least for the first couple years after graduation. I'm really not a fan of NY/Chicago/LA, all of which I have visited multiple times. DC is just the right size, plus I already know people there. 

Anyway, about a week after graduation I was contacted by a company with whom I'd applied for position about a month prior. Their headquarters are in DC, so I was pretty excited. The interviews went well and they offered me the job, so I took it. (note: this was the first and only job offer I'd received) 

And now, I was pretty happy. I thought, ""hey, I guess everything worked out; got a job just a week after graduating and now I can spend the next two months enjoying summer, living carefree, before starting work.""

So that's just what I have been doing, and it's been awesome. A little background on my current situation: I'm still living in my college town (which is amazing, probably one of the best college towns in the country - tons to do) because my mom actually moved here during my junior year. 

I thought all of my friends would be gone after graduation and it would be the loneliest place ever and I'd be dying to leave and start my new life, but it's been exactly the opposite. I still have a handful of friends here, one of which I met during my senior year and we've since become super close. We hang out almost every day, but she's leaving for med school around the same time I'd be leaving for DC. 

I also met this guy at a party a couple days after graduation, and we've been hanging out and I've started to really like him. He's leaving next week to study abroad for a month, though. Then he's coming back here. If I go to DC I'm not sure if we will stay in touch, which I am feeling depressed about. 

It has also been nice living at home, but still being in my college town. One of my brothers is still in school, so he is here. Another one of my brothers is also at home right now. We're quite close, and it saddens me to think about leaving, unsure of when my next opportunity to come home will be. 

That leads me to today. As you may have gathered, I am having conflicting thoughts about leaving. I am wishing that I had taken more time to consider different options and apply for jobs that would perhaps be a better fit for me, rather than just picking a city to move to and taking a random job. Granted, this job I've taken is with a solid company with a fairly good reputation, so it would likely look pretty good on my resume. But if you told freshman me that this is the job I would have upon graduation, I'd be very confused. 

My internship last summer was with a nonprofit, and I loved it. I could see the impact I was making. This job I've taken is in the corporate sector. Not sure how I feel about it. 

Part of me is saying that I should just go. I do frequently have these kinds of feelings before doing anything major (e.g. study abroad, moving to a new city for an internship) but the thing is, those were all temporary. I knew I was coming back after it. Now, it's permanent. I'm just leaving. I don't know if I'm ready for that. 

But at the same time, my future in DC looks pretty good, despite the fact that I don't know if I will like my job. I managed to find an apartment *within walking distance of my job*, a roommate who is also a recent grad that seems incredibly sweet, and I already know people in the city. 

If I give this up now, I don't know if I'll find myself in such an ideal situation. But the other part of me really wants to stay where I am, perhaps find a job working in development for the university (my internship last summer was in fundraising) and stay for another year or two. Then I'm fairly certain I'll be ready to leave. I'm just thinking, I'm only 22, I don't want to start the rest of my life in a new city just yet... I still have time...

Should I just go and see how I like it? My mom told me not to view it as something permanent. I suppose I could move there - I don't see it as being a huge hassle, considering the place I'm moving into is fully furnished so essentially all I'm bringing is clothes - and then move back if I find a job here that I think I'd like better. 

I just don't know anymore. I think I've included all of the relevant details, but I would appreciate any advice! Thanks in advance - especially for taking the time to read all of this.

I live in Poland, I study IT and probably will get a job in game development after I move to bigger city ( I had my internship there). I like to read books(Stephen King, Agatha Christie, crime, horror, fantasy too), play games(obviously), and meetings with my friends (which is harder after everyone moved out to different cities, thats why i want to talk with someone too). I also like movies,  and programming (i guess that's why i went to It studies). I recently started to do some jogging cause my physical condition went bad after i quit my job.

I would be happy to talk with girls mostly but if you're a guy and want to talk about anything, feel free to pm me :) I have a lot of free time now( I have my exams now, but there's always a time to talk with someone). If you think we can talk about something, pm me :)

4oqsys,10,2016-06-18,[NSFW][Intern!Reader x Suzy] Sexy Skinner Boxes,suzythirstfollower,PolyGrumps,https://www.reddit.com/r/PolyGrumps/comments/4oqsys/nsfwinternreader_x_suzy_sexy_skinner_boxes/,"[First time writing, whoops!]

Today was your third day of interning at KKG - and that means it was time for you to help record an episode. 

Your job was to watch facecam footage and make sure everything went smoothly for whatever editor was on board this week to compile it into an episode.

And as you walked into your job, as silently as you always do, but today was different - there on the couch was Suzy, as normal, but instead of sitting forward on the couch, as normal, she was laying across it, one leg on the couch, one on the floor. You looked in closely again, and you could barely see her shorts, around the foot on the floor.

You quickly got out your phone, typing out a flurry of commands, using your immaculate knowledge of SSH to get into your computer to check your video stream, and after each tense moment of loading passed, across your phone screen was Suzy.

You had caught her with her hand in her panties - uncharacteristically pink, with yellow accents, instead of the lace black you had imagined once and *never imagined again*... and then imagined again. Several times. You quickly shut down your phone, and slowly crept into the watch room, hiding beneath the wall between rooms until she finished.

As you crept in, you pulled a cord, pulling the mouse off of the computer desk, and it caught her attention. 

Her hand still in her panties, she gave you a heavy, loaded wink before restoring her shorts, and pulling out the hardware for today’s recording session.

The Steam Train PC was loaded with games you didn’t care for, and games she didn’t care for, and games neither of you cared for but a large mass of people cared for enough to make you try to care for. But today, you noticed something new. 

HuniePop Studio had a new game out. 

They had always mixed sex appeal with Skinner box techniques, and you figured to yourself, this was what she was all flustered about. It wasn't much, but she signaled you to start recording, and you hit the ""Start Recording"" button on OBS, and flipped the ""On Air"" switch that put the green light on the sign.

“Hello, everyone, it’s Mortemer and today I’m gonna be playing HuniePop Studio’s new game, with the help of my intern here!” 

She signaled to you from the couch, with the same loaded wink she gave you not more than 10 minutes ago.

And you blushed - she smirked - you blushed harder. 

She repeated herself  - “with the help of my intern here!” - in a way that smacked the meaning of her words into you. You had almost no choice - you had to get out on camera, or you would be fired.

You trudged out there, and sat on the couch, awkwardly close to the person you had just seen whacking it moments ago. 

“Since HuniePop has... worn out its welcome on this channel, we’re going to try something new, as inspired by my friend Vernon’s channel.”

She stood up - you’re certain her head was out of the frame - and in seconds, the shorts she just put back on were off. Her panties were still as yellow and pink as they were when you saw them from the distance, but now, up close, you could see more details. 

Right where her hips became thighs, right where there should be fabric, keeping this recording safe for YouTube, there was a shape cut out, the shape of a cat.

And you stared at her pussy, the tiniest bit of hair sticking out from underneath the fabric. She sat on the couch, splayed as she was before, and now, you too were here. She pulled her pussy’s lips apart with her fingers, and beckoned you closer with the same heavy wink. 

You were uncertain - she noticed. 

She tried to make things more comfortable, taking her shirt off as well, revealing perky, but not small boobs that were perfect for grabbing. 

But you doubt she’d let you.

You leaned in - she was calling for you. 

You had your face mere inches from her thighs, and she smiled, with the same heavy wink you’re sick of being called back to all the time.

You first took a detour. 

You placed soft kisses along the inside of her thighs, and she grabbed your hair, bringing your face to her clit, almost forcibly, but definitely, *definitely* consensually.

You brushed your tongue along every fold of her pussy, and she moaned. At first, her moans were small - almost inaudible. But you placed your lips to her clit again, and the moans began to rise.

Each moan that came out of her was perfectly in tempo with the brush of your tongue, and when you found you could no longer make them larger, you reached up your hands, pulling aside the kitty cut undies, and sliding one- two- three fingers inside of her, and the moans grew sharper. They were no longer the mewlings of trying something new. They had become the moans of someone who was clearly enjoying herself far more than your job description allowed for.

In a way, you could tell she was satisfied, and this, in return, satisfied you. 

Each pump, wiggle, and thrust of your fingers brought her pleasure, and it was pleasure that kept her moaning, it was pleasure that kept her knees shaking, and it was pleasure that kept her so wet.

And you traced figure eights into her with your tongue. You ran your fingers through her insides, and she climaxed the hardest right at the 10 minute mark - how convenient. She arched her back, and her moans grew so loud that normalizing audio is the last thing you want to do for this episode. 

You sat there, continuing to enjoy having your face where it was, kissing her pussy and the inside of her thighs until eventually, she let her fingers out of your hair, and pulled you up into a kiss, your lips still wet.

And as you kissed her, she slid up, and returned her shorts to a work safe position - though, with much difficulty as she was still shaky from a strong climax. 

“Thanks for watching KKG - tomorrow, we get the toys out!”"
4oqznf,0,2016-06-18,How I went from a slacker to succeeding as a pre-med student during my freshman year,jarrhead20,premed,https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/4oqznf/how_i_went_from_a_slacker_to_succeeding_as_a/,"I was a slacker. The kind that was good enough to do well in school without much studying. Not the crazy genius types that still was praised by teachers – I was just above average with minimal work. And I knew it. The pinnacle of my senioritis was when I didn’t carry around a backpack at all during the last 6 months. This attitude almost cost me – I was too lazy to respond to a scholarship initiation and I almost lost the opportunity to interview. My parents yelled and screamed – not angry, but so incredibly disappointed that they were speechless. It was the wakeup call I needed. 

After finding out I didn’t get the scholarship (although I was angry, looking back it wasn’t a huge surprise given my lack of preparation), I knew I wanted to make a change. It was time to rise up to the challenge and not just do the bare minimum. I wanted, no, I needed to prove to myself that I could reach the goals that I set out. 

I wanted to figure out to succeed in college, but first I needed to figure out what I wanted to do. Slackers don’t really have cogent long term plans when applying to college. I knew I was interested in both business and medicine, so I started to explore. During the summer, I shadowed a hospitalist, and even though he and his partners were incredibly cynical, I was just curious to find out if treating and healing patients connected with me. After 2 months, I definitely though it was cool and all with interesting terminology and complex decision making, but it wasn’t until I met a patient on one of my last few days that I could get a real sense of purpose in medicine that I could connect with. 

Still, I didn’t want to knock off business without exploring it. I decided to major in finance and loved the introductory business courses – especially the ability to immediately apply my knowledge. Something that I feel is not emphasized enough in science courses. 

Apparently my decisions paid of, within 2 years, I was selected into a combined BS/MD program and was guaranteed a spot in medical school – I’ll be starting in August. 

How I set myself up for success my freshman year 
-	First, I reached out to my sister who was a pre-med senior for advice. Together we created a tentative plan for the next 4 years – allocating time for summer opportunities and the MCAT and making sure I could explore both medicine and business. 
-	Second, I acknowledged that college classes were a new challenge- I didn’t want to be too cocky and shoot myself in the foot during my first semester. So I went to every single class( once I got the hang of college courses, later on I stopped going when I thought it wasn’t necessary). Doing so in my toughest course, chem 1, which I had no prior exposure to, I focused on solving test questions and ended up getting an A+ in the course and becoming a workshop leader the following semester. 
-	Third, I joined a bunch of clubs I was interested in, but avoided joining any group that was a huge time commitment because I didn’t want to overtax myself. In one of my clubs, I was selected as an alternate in a regional competition. Although I didn’t compete, I got to learn a lot and travel with the team. By second semester, I was part of the competitive team and eventually I became the team captain and president of the organization. 
-	Fourth, I worked out ate well and focused on getting a good amount of sleep ( I know myself and I get really cranky when I don’t sleep) 
-	Fifth, I had a blast with my freshman buddies – staying up playing madden, watching football, and just dicking around. I’m still friends with them after 4 years. 
-	Sixth, I actively looked for an opportunity that combined medicine and business so that I could explore both. I had recognized a guy at the gym who worked for the university’s health care system. With nothing to lose, I introduced myself while he was stretching and asked if I could get in touch with him about an internship. Eventually, I set up a healthcare internship where I got to work on the strategy side, learning more about business, healthcare, and medicine in general. 

By the end of the year, I had a 3.8 GPA, an internship where I could continue to explore the career paths I was interested in, and became the second-in-command in the organization. Although I had different challenges during my sophomore year, my experiences freshman year set me up for success. 

Now as I start medical school, I’m looking to start a pre-med coaching program where I help students succeed during their first year. Right now I’m just trying to understand what are the biggest challenges pre-med freshman face so that I can potentially find ways to solve them – allowing you to succeed while avoiding the mistakes I made. 

If you are an incoming pre-med freshman student, leave a comment saying that you are interested, and I’ll PM you so that we can discuss your needs. Hopefully, my experience can help you out.

I'm going to be a senior at the University of Washington and this summer, on top of my internship, I want to do quantitative finance projects and create a blog with the goal of becoming fully qualified to apply for quantitative finance positions for next summer. I am majoring in Industrial and Systems Engineering and minoring in Applied Math. I have advanced knowledge of R (a large portion of my major's coursework is probability/statistics), MATLAB, and Java. I have taken multiple computer science courses and will be taking more this next year. I have some ideas on what I want to do but it would be nice to be able to chat with someone that has some experience so I can ensure I am going in the right direction.

4osoea,66,2016-06-19,My [25F] dad [55M] just found out that I've been dating his ex-colleague [45M]. I don't know what to do.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4osoea/my_25f_dad_55m_just_found_out_that_ive_been/,"Okay so prepare yourself, cause this is gonna sound like some bad brazilian telenovela. Throwaway account, cause I haven't told all my friends yet and they're all redditors.

Here we go:

I've always been extremely close with my dad. I love and respect him and we've always been honest with each other, while at the same time being respectful of our boundaries. A perfect child-parent relationship, really.

When my father was in his thirties, he started a business with his best friend. They employed a lot of people and at first it worked ok. One of the workers was this guy, let's call him Jim, a younger guy with good ideas, but having completely different views than my dad.

Long story short, the company split due to differences between my dad and his best friend and Jim took my dad's friend's side, leaving them forever bitter over each other's careers.

A year ago I graduated from Uni, and searching for a job I stumbled upon Jim's company. I was unaware of who he was and I applied for an internship there.

Turns out Jim immediately knew who I was (I was already about five years old when my dad tried to get into business), but he accepted anyways, because I seemed capable.

I used to always get along better with older people and somehow I quickly befriended Jim. He was a really cool guy. Single, smart, gentle, in a great shape. A bit serious at first, but actually very funny when you get to know him. I quickly developped a crush on him and he seemed to like me too. We would eat lunch together almost every day and he'd take me out to run errands as his assistant. My 3-month-long internship got increased to 6 months and I started getting paid and we've been spending a lot of time together.

*Note that during this time, my father is aware of where I work and often asks about how I've been doing. He's quite surprised that Jim is a good boss, but happy that I'm succesful.*

Back to Jim, six months after I start internship, he makes a move and I'm more than glad to return it. At first I'm concerned that it's a one time thing, but he gets more and more boyfriend-like when we're alone so it seems like I'm not just your regular intern-to-shag.

We agree that it's better for us not to remain working at the same place, since I shouldn't be seen as someone's lover at the beginning of my career. He gives me a very good (well deserved I guess, cause I've been working my ass off in more ways than one) reccomendation and I'm starting to look for a job somewhere else, while spending more and more time at his place. At this point our relationship is still a secret to most.

6 months later (about now), Jim wants to take me on holidays for 2 weeks. It's more serious and official than anything we've done so far, so I'm seriously worried about how to tell anyone that I'm leaving. I don't want to lie, but I'm not ready to tell my parents that I'm dating a guy twice my age that is also my dad's old rival.

**As a result** I'm not saying anything (I know I'm an idiot :( ), until my dad visits me in my flat and sees plane tickets with Jim's name next to mine. To make it worse, when Jim was booking the plane, it automatically set me as his wife, so there's ""Mr Jim XYZ"" and ""Mrs wasadeaf XYZ"". 


**EDIT: Since many people are asking about the ticket thingy - it's not the boarding pass that has my name wrong, but the reservation document from the travelling agency, that has info about both the plane and the hotel we booked. I'm not a native english speaker so I don't know how to call this and I figured that it's not very important to the story. It's like a little leaflet-book thingy, but it's not binding in any way and does not need to match my ID. It's a common mistake/simplification when you're booking something via travelling agency.**

My father is so shocked he basically storms out of the flat without saying/asking anything. I try to stop him, but he won't stay. He doesn't seem mad, just completely dumbstruck.

Me and Jim are leaving in two weeks. The revelation happened yesterday and I haven't contacted my dad since. Jim is being extremely supportive and even suggested calling/meeting my dad himself, but I'm not sure if this is a good idea.

What should I do? For the first time in my life I don't know how to talk to my father. Also breaking up with Jim is not an option because I really care about him.

**tl;dr while pursuing a career in the same field as my father, I found myself in a happy relationship with his old rival. We've kept it a secret to my parents for far too long and now my father accidentally found out. I don't know what to do and how to talk to him about it.**


**Okay I'm sick of trying to get this updated with no result. Updating here.**


I went to my dad's place after dinner, hoping that he'll be there. He was home and he seemed uneasy when I entered the house, but when he heard that I want to talk he agreed and invited me to his office.


I sat on the couch while he was sitting behind the desk and I told him everything. The whole story. How we became more and more friendly with Jim and how I started to care about him, how I felt scared to tell dad because of Jim's age and also their past, how we're still spending a lot of time together but this planned trip was the first thing we'd do ""out in the open"".


Then I apologized for not telling him, I said that I understand that he might be very much against it all, but that I am extremely happy with Jim and I never meant to hurt anyone. By the end of this speech (that my dad did not interrupt once) I remembered the surname thing and ensured him that we did not get married.


My dad was silent for a while but he didn't seem too angry. Then he told me that it's not like he expects me to share my private life with him if it makes me uneasy, but in this particular situation he feels like he should intervene. He started to list all the issues he has with this situation, but at the same time he underlined that yes, he may be prejudiced and that he doesn't really know Jim as a person. He said he doesn't feel betrayed because he knows that it doesn't have anything to do with him. Basically we talked through all the scenarios focusing on me and possible results. First, the scenario in which I'm being used as a naive intern (not as means to revenge, just used by an older man). Then we talked through the scenario in which I'm being cared about, but he's still so much older and that's still an issue.


In the end, dad admitted that after thinking it through for those few hours, he's actually concerned that Jim is so much older and that I'm starting my first job-ish-thingy by jumping into a supervisor's bed which is immature and could be potentially damaging. This I agreed on and ensured him that I took precautions and that my current job should not be affected. So in the end it seems that their past is not such a big deal compared to the more down-to-earth problems like career and building a family.


He also said something that surprised me, which is that if I decide to pursue Jim further, I need to be mature, stand my ground and be prepared that it's not going to be easy. That this would mean I am an adult and I act like an adult in a relationship and take responsibility for my actions. So in a way he said ""go on if you feel like you should, only own up to it whatever happens""?


He said that he doesn't like this altogether, but I am obviously entitled to do whatever I please and he can't forbid me anything. I asked if he would be willing to see Jim, but he said ""not yet, maybe some day"".


So basically he was trying to stay collected while obviously distressed, made sure I am aware of all the possible negative consequences and allowed me to do my thing, since I'm an adult. He always does that. It's a guilt-tripping technique to teach me something. ""You don't have to get good grades, we love you anyway"" - the best way to make me feel pressured about getting best grades.



Then he told me to tell my mother. idk, it all kinda seemed as if he was trying to teach me a lesson about keeping stuff from them both. I went immediately and told my mom in the most simple ""I've been dating the XYZ guy for a few months"" way. She didn't seem to care. She basically said ""whatever you think is good for you"" and changed the subject.


I came home to Jim, we ate supper and talked about it for about an hour. Jim was actually very understanding of my dad, agreeing with his points and sometimes even adding more. Then he asked what do I think about my dad's points and only then I realized that he's expecting me to dump him.


He asked if I'd like a break to figure stuff out. He seemed quite down and I didn't know what to say to him after such question. I said that I honestly didn't consider it. He said that this is the way I can figure out if I want to bother with all this. Idk, I felt like he was really trying to be reasonable. He started to talk about his ex and about how they broke up after ten years because they just went so distant and could never decide to break it and stayed together for far too long because they got used to each other. I think this is the first time he talked this much about her (that's only like a sample of what he said, but I'm not going to describe everything).


So basically what he said was that better to figure out if we want to break it now before it's too late. He said that he doesn't want to break up, but I should be the one to decide here, cause he had put me in a pretty shitty situation with dad and he should have known better and he feels guilty and wants to give me space. Basically he admitted to what many of you have been saying - that he acted immature giving in to this. And he apologized for not intervening.


We've agreed to take a week long break, after which I'm supposed to call and let him know about my decision. In the meantime I should focus on my thing and try to figure it out. We also decided not to take the trip even if I decide we should stay together, since it brings horrible memories now. We lost about 10% of the costs, but we'll get the rest of the money back.


Also, in the morning I noticed that Jim wrote me a text yesterday, saying that he hopes everything's going to be alright and wishing me good night. I guess the break starts from today then.


I don't know what I'm going to do. I guess I'll really take a week to gain some distance and think about it. I care for him, but I think I should sleep on it before I make any final decisions. I can see that father is trying to teach me a lesson. He disapproves, but he recognizes that I'm an adult and also despite being against it all he realizes that there is a small chance that Jim is actually honest. We'll see.
Right now I am kinda miserable, but since I slept on it, I'm a bit better than yesterday.
tl;dr Dad says he disapproves more of me fucking my boss and getting involved with someone twice my age than of me fucking a guy that wronged him once. We went through the possible scenarios (1. Jim uses me 2. Jim loves me but the age gap is still a big deal) and I was left to make a decision on my own. I also told my mom and she was not affected at all. When I came back to Jim, he seemed distressed and after talking for a while he suggested that we go on a break and I should contact him in a week to give him update, but it should be entirely my decision. We're also definately not taking this fucking trip that outed us


Also, my ex keeps calling me. He probably heard from mutual friends since some of them are already updated. Not picking it up though."

Although I think this is a good ending for the second season i would personally like another eding. If there were 30 episodes at that rate the second season would end at chapter 131, The first Azami Nakamura appearence. I would like this ending better for 3 reasons.

1- The conflict between Soma and Kuga would be resolved in the last episode, thus showing that Soma can clash against the Elite Ten Concil and making spectator eager to know more about the other seats.

2- The Azami Cliffhanger is awesome, it alone would be a reason for a third season to happened.

3- As the first season was the introduction to the characters, the second season would be the development of them. With the Moon Festival serving as the plot device to show how much Soma has grown over the internship. "
4otjz5,1,2016-06-19,Help me on my luxury problem (question for you experienced guys),SupremeCreamExtreme,sounddesign,https://www.reddit.com/r/sounddesign/comments/4otjz5/help_me_on_my_luxury_problem_question_for_you/,"Hello. I having a hard time with a decision and would really appreciate a pointer or two for you more experienced guys who are actually in jobs :)

I'm finding myself in the fortunate positions of having been accepted to two schools both related to audio design. They are both university master programs, but have different foucus points in relation to audio. I have a bachelor degree in ""media technology"", which is basically design and programming of various media solutions, and encompasses everything from image processing, interaction design, sound &amp; music computing (yay), animation &amp; graphics, physical sensor &amp; stuff and so on. My main focus during the bachelor has been computer games and I fell in love with the sound design aspect somewhere i the middle of the program. I want to work with designing and implementing sound in games, and it's important that I can get to actually create and work with the sound and not just be implementing it. I want to sit there and work with the voice actors, discuss with the art director, create creature sounds, and work with sounds that are adaptive and can be interactively manipulated by the environment and so on. You get the gist. I'm not fully sure if this position exists, but I'm pretty sure I wanna do something similar to what [this guy](https://www.careersinmusic.com/sound-designer/) is doing (pretty sure it's not Raison Varner on the picture!! haha). I don't mind if my work will be technical oriented as I'm already pretty into programming and stuff for games. But I would really want to keep my fingers in the creative part of actually creating the sounds in my future work.

My question revolves about how I make the best choice keeping this future in mind. The first school, lets say school A, has a much greater focus on math and programming behind sound, new technology and innovative solutions related to sound. An example of an outcome form school A would be like creating the software for audio manipulation instead of using existing one. School A is pretty new and no one has actually finished the graduate program yet so potential job possibilities are hard to relate to former students from school A.

School B has a greater focus on aesthetics and artistic expression of sound. Interactive sound is in focus and especially computer games are a focus point. Their will even be possibility for an internship as the position of a sound designer for games. School B is still technical, however less than school A. I will of course learn about DSP and so on, but their is an emphasis on the aesthetics which their isn't in school A. School B is older than school A, and I know for a fact that people from B is working as sound designers for games.

This might seem like a no-brainer, but I'm not in the industry so I don't know what would be most sought after in a sound designer for games. I know I will be more technical and maybe less able in artistic expression when graduating school A. I know that at school B I will be credited for artistic expression which will not be as much a focus in A. School A will improve will my programming and math which might make me more attractive on the job market in general.

So in end my question is about where I should put my focus to actually get in to the game industry as sound designer in the end. Of course portfolio and realized projects are most important when trying to land a job in this industry, but having a solid education in audio shows that you know what you are doing (I guess!). I in quite a pickle over this, so I would really appreciate if you could give me some ideas for making up my mind. Sorry for the ramble, heres the TL;DR. 

TL;DR: Want to do sound design for games. Have to pick between 2 schools, A and B. A is more mathematically and technical than B. B is more aesthetically oriented and less technical. Both are applicable for game audio design. My head is spinning over the decision."

In truth, I should have reset it last August when I started graduate school. I started drinking again due to the stress, the unfamiliarity of it all, having to get used to new people (I'm socially awkward so I don't do this well), etc. But most importantly, because I had stopped using the support of a recovery community. I had been going to SMART meetings in Baltimore, but when I moved for school to a relatively small town, the nearest SMART meeting was an hour away, and I soon got out of the habit of attending meetings. I lurk on this subreddit regularly, but I haven't been an active participant for quite some time.

This drinking period wasn't as bad as the previous go-round that landed me in detox and cost me my health, lost me a job, and had me moving in with my parents for two years to start over. I'm doing ok today, got through the first year of school, and I'm working at an internship this summer. That said, I dodged a lot of bullets that could have been rock-bottoms (drunk driving but wasn't caught, for example). My thinking isn't as clear as it could be. I'm spending money stupidly on booze that I don't need to spend. Anxiety that had left me during my two years of actual sobriety has come creeping back. If I keep drinking, eventually something bad will happen.

So today I went to an AA meeting, and got some phone numbers and a Big Book. I didn't drink yesterday. I'm not going to drink today. Let's do this (again).

And thanks for being there."

4ouk2i,5,2016-06-19,Need ideas for lessening dependency on BM,Chees_a_saurus,stepparents,https://www.reddit.com/r/stepparents/comments/4ouk2i/need_ideas_for_lessening_dependency_on_bm/,"Hi guys.  Hagatha strikes again.

Background: Clingy overstepping BM that turns bitter and vengeful upon experiencing boundaries.  She mad.  Skids are 14 and 18. 50/50 schedule.

So, SO and BM have always had a shared gmail calendar that is updated with kids' appointments, practices, games, etc.  BM mostly maintains it because she's the more organized of the two of them.  

When I moved in, SO gave me the password so I could put it on my phone, too, since I need to know this stuff.  I don't think BM is aware I can access it, nor do I care if she finds out.

In addition to poisoning SD14's view of her father as a way to punish SO, BM is now starting to sabotage the schedule.  SO and SD were out of town this weekend for an SD event, and neither BM nor SD bothered to tell him that SD had to be back here for an early morning appointment tomorrow.  It's the start of an internship she's doing. SO had agreed to it, without knowing the exact dates.  He'd been planning on driving back tomorrow, but now he has to bust his butt to get back here tonight.

He spoke with SD about becoming responsible for making sure that he knows when she's got something important coming up.  She's 14, almost 15, and she can start being more responsible for making sure dad knows what's up.  It's an internship, which means it's a job, and she's got to be responsible for making sure she's got transportation to it.  She shouldn't just assume.

Until recently, BM has let SO know what is going on.  She deliberately withheld this one, because she's been trying to make SD view SO as the bad guy.  Most routes of fuckery have been cut off, so now we are dealing with this unneeded drama.  The kids are used to the parents communicating, but now BM is actively holding back information in the hopes of sabotaging SO.  Which sucks, because she puts the kids' activities at risk, but we can't control her choices.

She also recently changed the password to the shared calendar so that SO couldn't access it.  She was mad that SO would not report our vacation whereabouts to her, instead following the guidelines in the custody agreement to supply only an alternate contact method if cell phone wouldn't be an option.  (He'd have his cell on him and be using it, she was told this, it wasn't enough for her.  She NEEDED to KNOW whether he was a PLANE RIDE or CAR RIDE away, because it makes a difference.  ^^No ^^it ^^doesn't. )  So while we were out of town, we both got error messages that we couldn't access the shared calendar anymore.  By the next morning access was back.  She'd changed it back.  I don't know if she knows that we know what she did.  But we do.  The calendar is not to be counted on any longer.

BM tends to be the one to schedule kid stuff.  She's constantly researching activities for them, and will be the one to organize them.  Having SO become more involved is possible to a point, but only to a point.  He's way better about becoming independently connected with the school and with coaches.  He used to rely on BM for that stuff but doesn't any longer.  But these new activities are impossible for him to keep up with, given that she's the one moving them forward and he doesn't even have any contact information for them.

So, what can we do?  It's time to stop depending on BM for information, clearly.  And we can't just add things to the current calendar, because BM is a loon and is liable to cut off access to it at any moment.  SO will feel awful if the kids have to miss out, so the whole ""we won't do activities on our time"" thing won't fly.  Plus, he'd agreed to the internship already.  He just didn't know it started early tomorrow morning because no one told him.

I was tossing around the idea of making a new shared calendar that will go on SO's phone, my phone, and the two kids' phones.  We can enter the password on their phones so BM can't get access to it.  SO could tell the kids that they're old enough to be responsible for their activities, and they need to put stuff that falls on his time on that calendar.  And if it's not there, he can't guarantee that he can take them.  

Does anyone have any better ideas?  "

I'm not entirely sure if my mom falls under a narcissistic category, but here goes nothing. I just want to share my story and mostly get this off my chest because the situation I'm in makes me really anxious and I need something or someone to make me feel better. I highly appreciate anyone who takes the time to read this...

So last year my fiance (let's call him Jake) and I decided to move in together. It took a lot of convincing to my parents even though I am 25 and have been dating Jake for 7 years. At first my mom hated the idea and almost kicked me out one day because I sat down with her and tried to have a serious talk about it. What was supposed to feel like an exciting move and serious step in my life felt like a nightmare. It wasn't until Jake and I got my dad involved (who wasn't too happy either) to sit down and talk that my mom started to slowly warm up to the idea. Don't get me wrong, my parents love Jake, but didn't like the idea of me leaving home without graduating college first and getting married. OK fine, this is totally understandable, and me being the only child, I started to see their point. 

So last year in November, my parents help Jake and I move in. All seems happy and resolved until my mom starts to unfriend/block me on social media. She also did the same on my dad's social accounts. She asks me to delete/remove all of my cousins and close family friends so no one finds out about my move. I flip out and tell her it's 2016 and many young couples live together and that they just need to deal. She claims this is ""for my protection"" because her family is very ruthless and gossipy, but I can't help but feel like she's embarrassed of me. I am no longer the perfect daughter she wanted, I didn't finish school when she wanted, didn't get married first and then left home like she wanted. A few weeks ago I brought up the fact that my girlfriends want to throw me a bridal shower in the Fall (I am getting married in December) and that I wanted to use our lovely backyard for the setting. She said ""that sounds great, but obviously family can't come because they would know it's your apartment"". She also lurks my Instagram and makes sure I don't post ""hints"" or backgrounds that don't look like our house so people don't suspect anything. It's driving me crazy and I think it's stupid for her to keep up this lie especially when out-of-town family will be coming in the week of the wedding. I don't know how longer I can keep this up. Whenever I try to talk seriously with my mom, she cries and says ""I miss you so much, I wish you would move back, please just move back"". She literally moves me to tears. I love my mom so much and whenever this topic is not brought up we have so much fun together and I truly love her. But she is starting to make me resent and hate her for all that she's putting me through. 

I'm just not sure why she's so embarrassed of me. I didn't get pregnant, I don't smoke/drink, I am not a bad person and I'm only an internship away from my degree. I would understand if I did something horrible to her or someone else for her to hide me away from our family but I don't feel like I did. I just wanted independence and to live with the person I love a year before the wedding. I'm in tears typing this and I hate myself for feeling this way."

And, how I ended up in this hellhole apartment: https://redd.it/4nylqw

Making ends meet was difficult for me during the time I was living in Turnip's closet.  My little data transcription job paid minimum wage, but between the costs associated with school, but the time I had put into my internship and school, it wasn't enough.  It was barely enough to pay for my cheap room, gas for my car, and some food in my belly.

Turnip had no such money concerns.  When I first moved in, his grandmother would cut him a fairly decent sized check.  This, he referred to as his ""allowance"".  I never knew the numbers on it, but it seemed it wasn't an exorbitant amount, as his grandmother seemed to be pushing him towards supporting himself.  Turnip spent this on a combination of his room, subscriptions to various games, new parts for his gaming rig and of course a pile of junk food.  

Early on, Turnip had bragged to me about his amazing fiscal planning.  He lived off of this allowance without issues, and only would come up with money problems a few times a year.  When this occurred, he would call his parents, who would deposit money into his account.

But then there was crisis only two months into my living there.  Turnip's grandmother passed away.  He was distraught, not over her passing, but over the loss of the monthly check.  He'd ask us what to do, tossing around the idea of breaking into his late grandmother's house, stealing her valuables and pawning them to make ends meet.

But things worked out for Turnip.  His parents took over paying him an allowance, far more than his original grandmother check.  This was enough for Turnip to start buying extras.  There was a new laptop to complement his gaming rig.  Occasionally, Turnip would turn up with some ostentatious item, like an expensive watch or a new pair of sneakers.  He bragged that once the estate was settled, he was due for a decent inheritance.

It never seemed to occur to him to upgrade his living situation.  He seemed to like living in the ""city"", bragging about it even.  And he never went anywhere or had guests other than his girlfriend.  So the crappy run down apartment with me in his closet apparently suited him just fine.

Once and only once did I hear him talk about employment.  It was while mocking me for having an unpaid internship.  I was a chump for taking the job.  He had gone to school for mechanical engineering, and if he wanted a job, that would open doors.  I pressed for information and found out that while he went to school, it was only for two semesters.  Turnip had nasty things to say about the schooling system.

-

His mother thought he was a genius however.  She said as much whenever she called.  He would put her on speakerphone and she would talk to him in much the same tone I use when taking to a puppy.  She'd make sure he was eating, ask about his girlfriend (who she seemed to think poorly of) and make sure he was ""keeping clean"".

The latter must have become neurosis.  Turnip bathed twice a day, his room had to be kept spotless (a job he berated his girlfriend into doing), and he changed his clothes more frequently than an actor in a Broadway play.  He would pick into my personal life if he thought I wasn't being cleanly enough.  I wore the same pair of pajama bottoms twice in a row and he noticed?  I was going to hear from Turnip how gross I was.  Once, he realized that I hung my towel on the inside of the doorknob to my room to dry every day.  This just caused him to have almost a paranoia about my door itself.

This cleanliness included that, to Turnip, certain things were disposable.  This came up when he saw me folding the laundry in the common room and was horrified at my matching up my socks.  Turnip's method of doing things was to buy new underwear or socks, wear them once and throw them out.  I stared at him incredulous and pressed for more information.  It turned out every time Turnip changed clothes (which it seemed happened multiple times a day) it was with brand new undergarments.  He stared at me with equal incredulity.  When I explained I only owned seven pairs of underwear, he reacted with a combination of horror and pity.

-

This was ironic the day I came home to find the bathroom door locked.  I shrugged and walked back downstairs and used the restaurant's bathroom.  About an hour later, I hear the married couple having a debate over what's up with the bathroom.  It turns out they had been waiting to use the bathroom since before I got home.  Now, the guy had to get a shower before his night shift started, and it was still occupied, no one answering when they knocked on the door.

We tried calling Turnip, and got verification from the other roomate that the door was closed when she got there as well.  We got to the point of pounding on the door yelling, then finally started to worry that something was wrong with Turnip.  At this point, he had been in there at least two hours.  I decided to pick the lock, and the door swung open.

Turnip sat on the toilet, pants around his ankles, laptop on a tray table straddling the side of the tub.  He was wearing headphones, and in the tub was a small stash of snacks.  He didn't even notice us staring at first, and when he did it was to look up and go ""what?"".

-

Tying both hygeine and finances together, Turnip also owned a late model car which stayed parked behind the restaurant.  He only really drove it once a week, to his family dinners.  Still, I one day glanced inside it and realized it was packed with junk food wrappers.  Apparently his girlfriend didn't clean the car, and he never seemed to comment on it being dirty."
4ovr46,1,2016-06-19,Lacking a therapist for the summer.,xxonemoredayxx,whatsbotheringyou,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsbotheringyou/comments/4ovr46/lacking_a_therapist_for_the_summer/,"This is going to be kind of rambling, so I apologize in advance.

This summer, I'm in a new city. That's not the bad part. This city is pretty great, and I've enjoyed exploring it. The hard part is that I'm here for an internship, only like 2-2.5 months, and so I decided not to get a therapist.

The other hard part is I feel like I need a lot of support, and I hate relying on my partner too much for that support. He's not in the same place as me. Additionally, I have a lot of problems.

* I can't seem to eat right. I keep going to bed hungry because I can't shove food down my throat.
* I've had so many drastic mood swings, which aren't anything new, but their extremeness has started to make me think maybe I have something like bipolar disorder. There have been weeks where I'm barely functioning. It feels like rapid cycling, where the moods change daily, but I don't know if this is the actual diagnosis or just something similar. Regardless, it's pretty difficult.
* I'm questioning my sexuality for the billionth time.
* The other night, I had a panic attack, the worst one in two years. I've had lots of anxiety issues, but two years ago I was having them every other day, and it was awful.
* My sister has been pushy and commenting on my food and activity level (during the week, I don't do much because I'm always exhausted from work), and that makes it so much harder for me to do the things I want and need to do.
* I've been able to put this out of my mind for now, but I've been having issues with my boyfriend with my own insecurities. He's poly, which wouldn't be an issue (I'm not poly but I'm okay with ethical non-monogamy) except for the fact that I kept fixating on it and going over every little possibility, worrying about the same things over and over again.
* Regarding fixating on things, that's a bad habit that I tend to have.
* My job, while great at times, has been really unfulfilling lately and I'm incredibly bored and unsatisfied at work. I've talked to my boss multiple times, and my workplace is frustratingly slow at getting that resolved.
* I don't like to be unhappy. I tend to try to keep myself happy, and sometimes that makes me crash even harder when I get out of that mood.
* My partner and I are long distance, so I can't cuddle with him or anything, which is really important to me in a relationship. I talk to him frequently and we call fairly often, but it's really hard.
* I'm also really insecure about him and our relationship, and I'm scared of relying too much on him, both because I don't think it's healthy and because I don't want him to get fed up with me.

I think I need the support of a therapist. But I have a hard time getting one. Not because of money, but because of my parents. Every time I mention going to the therapists, or when I told my mom I wanted to switch last year, she cried. I feel like I'm hurting them because I can't handle my own problems. 

But that's the problem: I can't handle my own problems and I want and need help. I also want to get a diagnosis at some point: Do I have an anxiety disorder? Am I bipolar? Is there something else wrong with me? And if one of those questions has a ""yes"" answer to it, is therapy enough to fix it, and would meds help?

I've been against meds for a while. I don't want to be reliant on some chemical. But if being reliant means I can function normally, I'm willing to try it.

Thing is, my ""disorders"" aren't constant. For a while it was rapid cycling. Then it was calm for a bit, and then I had lots of anxiety about our relationship and him being poly. Then it was calm again, until I had a week where I was majorly down/depressed. Then I was okay for a few days, but then I had my panic attack really early in the morning, and I was high anxiety for the next few days. Now I'm calm(ish), and I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop.

I feel like just when I solve one problem, another one comes up. I'm never just ""okay"". Even when I say I'm calm, I'm currently stressing out about my sexual orientation. I don't know how to just be neutral and not worry about things for a bit.

And the fact that I can't do that, worries me too. I'm stressing out about my mental issues that involve me stressing out too much. Even when I'm not stressing out about a concrete issue, I'm stressing out about something.

I envy my partner. He's able to just be calm and relax. He needs a lot of recharge time when he loses spoons (he's much more introverted than I am), but overall his moods aren't as hectic and crazy as mine are. I envy that. I really, really wish I was like that. And I feel really guilty for ranting about my problems because I feel like they never go away. There's always something wrong with me. And I feel like I'm taking so much support from him and I worry about that imbalance. To his credit, he's never said anything negative about it. He's always good about listening to me and letting me cry to him. But I feel bad about needing him all the time.

I'm really worried about making it through the summer. Once I get back to college, I'm planning on seeking out a therapist that can actually diagnose me. But for right now, I'm just stuck without that support. I'm leaning heavily on my partner. My friends are all across the country, and I can't get the in-person support from them that I've gotten in the past. I am barely making it through the week. I don't know how I've survived a month with my brain feeling like it's going crazy. And I don't know how I'm going to make it until September. 

I also want to feel like I'm living, not just surviving. I'll probably make it, somehow. I always manage that, despite my depression and suicidal urges (though thankfully those haven't cropped up recently). But I want to enjoy my time here. I have so many things planned, things I wanted to do, and I can't seem to get myself up to do them. I hardly have the energy for them. Doing things I used to love, like I'm working on a theater thing back at school where we're emailing to organize it for the beginning of the semester, just seems like a chore to me. 

I don't know how to fix that. I don't know how to enjoy life. I feel like I live in either a horrible episode (like having extreme anxiety or rapid cycling or depression) or I live in fear of the next episode (and I know it's around the corner, it always is)."

Some of you love us, many of you hate us, but I signed up for reddit last night after I found that many of you visit our site frequently, despite what the Left wing ""Washington Post"" has said about my Business Partner Alex.

Of course, some of our articles are speculation, but I always envisioned the role of my company as one to counter the outright lies, bias, and disgust of the left wing media. 

I have several writers and some interns working for me, and sometimes they'll post outright nonsense. Of course, this is a part time job for me, and I try to clean out the more malicious lies completely.


A bit of background. I'm a software developer and independent web designer. I developed the Prntly blog to help promote the candidate I believed was best for America in July of 2015: Donald Trump.

Granted, bitter Cruzstacians dislike me because I constantly allowed anything and everything to fly about his campaign, as I saw him as a true liar. 

Thanks for reading and I am happy to answer any and every question you might have about our company.

4oycl7,0,2016-06-20,Am I [20F] in the wrong with ex-coworker [25/26M?] for getting with one of his closest friends? He wants no contact. Super long story.,colleaguebullshit,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4oycl7/am_i_20f_in_the_wrong_with_excoworker_2526m_for/,"For the sake of the story, I'll call my coworker Tom, and his close friend, Barney. I'll call my friend, Anna. 

Tom and I were interns at the same company, in the same period. I finished about 2 weeks ago and he's still working there. During the internship, I started having a crush on him. First, he's good looking, one of those model like guys. Second, he'd make an effort in talking to me in English (as everyone else, isn't). Third, he'd take me out to dinner, or lunch, pays, drive me home (even though it's super far away), etc.

Naturally, I developed a crush on him. I told him several times and he'd just brush it off. Of course, in the course of 4 months of that happening, the crush wore off and I started looking up to him as a big brother or a really good friend and that's honestly how I think of him. Just a really good friend.

We hang out less, and text less but we do still hang out and everytime we do we'd talk about how hot that girl is or how hot that guy is, and everything is seriously just friendly.

Come last Saturday. He texted me in the morning asking about what party is on for that night. I told him, a friend and I are going to this club to see an awesome DJ, you should come.

He said yes but he told me to come to his friend's house early around 7pm (kinda far away) to have dinner with them. Then he sent me a picture of his friend and he said don't worry he's good looking - this is motivation. Then in the afternoon he called me and told me, oh **I have 3 other good looking friends you could choose from**.

I ended up not going to dinner because my friend was too lazy to go. When Tom found out about that, he ended up at my doorstep around 10pm to have pre drinks here. Tom brought Barney and I was immediately smitten. His english was better, he was friendly, he had that easy going vibe which Tom, did not have.

Now this memory's starting to get a bit hazy cause I was both drunk, and a bit on drugs. I was drunk when Anna came but I was getting a bit sleepy so we did speed. Just Barney, me, and Anna.

Like closer to midnight, we drove over to Barney's house because he needed to change shirt. Anna and I needed to go to the bathroom so we all ended inside. Before leaving, Barney and I did a line of cocaine while Tom and my friend was watching.

Naturally, Barney and I were really pumped and in a different vibe as the two. Tom was kinda drunk, while my friend was just tipsy. I'm not saying it was the drugs, or the moments we shared ciggies but Barney and I got along really well and I just kind of talked to him more than I talked to Tom.

We got back in the car and drove over to the party, which wasn't far from Barney's place. This was a bit hazy but we had to walk quite a bit. Tom and Anna was at the front and then I was in the back with Barney, I don't know what we ended up talking about but he ended up kissing me. It was a very brief kiss. Of course I was pumped, my initial thought was that ""haha Tom's gonna laugh at me for ending up with his closest friend, I'm so embarrassed.""

That's not what happened. Once we got inside, we danced a bit, chilled then Barney and I shared a kiss again. Tom went to the bar with Barney and they ended up having this intense conversation.

Barney told me that everything's fine, and so I was confused and I was just, okay, I just wanna dance anyway. I don't really want to think or face any drama. I also saw my friends (two guys) then me and Anna just chilled with them on the dance floor.

I then went to the smoking room and I caught up with Barney, he told me hey, talk to Tom first then find me. So I did.

He told me outside of the smoking room, it's rude for you to go after my friend. I told him, wtf. Why? Even from early in the morning your texts with all the pictures, and the good looking guys to choose from you hinted that I should end up with your friend. And if anything, you don't own me I can end up with whoever I want, if you're my friend you should be happy for me.

Then he ended up in the argument that, he's had feelings for me for 4 months but he couldn't do anything about it because we were co workers etc. I told him, it's not okay because I have had that crush for 4 months as well and I told him straight up to at least have an answer. He never said anything, he brushed it off and that makes me feel rejected, over multiple times so of course over time I got over it.

I told him, what do you expect? I can't believe that you expect me to fall back into your arms after it took me so much effort to get over you. The crush isn't on and off just as you wish. I told him that he missed his shot, he rejected me multiple times and now I kissed Barney already, I'm not gonna drop him just because you said ""oh I like you now"" 

I told him though if he does want to start over then he should try to win me back because as of now we're friends and I want to hang out with Barney. Of course, I'm also under the influence of drugs and alcohol. I just wanted to party and chill.

The fucked up part, there was a window to see inside the smoking room. Barney was blowing me air kisses while he saw Tom and I talking like crazy intense. I didn't think much of it but Tom told me, alright, that makes sense. 

There's a lot of details but pretty much what happened was:

Tom became hot and cold the whole night. He told Barney and I that it was fine. He told Anna, it's not. I talked to him again, he said it's fine. **I finally got fed up and told both Barney and Tom, tell me if this isn't alright because I'm backing off the both of you. Tom laughed and said it's fine**. Barney just hugged me and took me to the dance floor.

I am seriously not a mind reader and I take things as it is. Not to mention that I was under the influence of multiple things and I just wanted to party and avoid any drama.

Not too long after, Anna told me Tom's having a moment again. Tom said it's fine but he also wanted me to ditch my other friends, the two guys, and just focus on the 4 of us. Long in the night, Tom also tried to kiss me again. Avoiding the drama, I did mdma with the two guys and then more cocaine with Barney. I got really fucked up and all I wanted to do was party. I remembered everything and I still acted normal but I was just happier, and I wanted to party more.

Tom convinced us that ""yeah it's fine"" and we partied all night. Morning comes and the 4 of us left all together. Tom helped me a couple of times cause I was having a headache. He hugged me and told me he cares for me no matter what, we're friends. He told me that I needed water but I said no, don't bother and he said no, I want to, you're my friend I care for you.

Along the way, I ended up talking with Barney. He wanted to come home with me and I said no, I'm extremely not comfortable with it because of Tom. I told Anna the same thing. Barney told me he talked to Tom and he said it's fine. I avoided everything, I told him no.

I don't understand what happened but Tom, Barney, and I ended up in my room. I was having quite the headache so Tom tucked me in, and he gave me water. Barney was passed out next to me and he tried to finger me under the blankets. I pushed his hands away and I honest to god, wanted him to leave.

Tom left, and Barney stayed. The next morning I felt like crap and I waited until the afternoon to text Tom (that was also around the time Barney actually woke up and sobered up). Barney told me nah, Tom will be fine - I know him. That's so not true.

Tom texted me.
&gt;Wow did you really do this.. Jesus that is cold.  So solving your problems with your feelings by just fucking the friend.. Hm thats pretty slutty. Btw funny the big mouth you gave me yesterday because of your uncontrolled way of using drugs.. Wish i was more sober so i have punched you in the face straight away.. Last thing: this was exactly the reason i wasnt fucking around with you.. Luckely i owed barney one so thats the good part. Don't contact me anymore, bye.

We ended up on a long argument over text. He told me he felt played, he told me that I was a slut (even though this is the first guy I brought home after I got out of my relationship). He told me that I avoided talking to him and solving it on the spot. I told him, I was on fucking drugs all I wanted to do was party, can you blame me for avoiding all this drama? Not to mention, you kept saying you were fine. You laughed, you danced, you flirted with other girls. You were so okay. Walking to the car after the party, all those things you said. Now you're saying you wish you could've punched me? I'm fucking cold? that you're not actually okay?

He then told me that he was also not okay with me inviting my 'boyfriends' the two friends who were guys. I told him, we went out all as friends so it's okay to have more friends join us. You could've mingled and talked to them. Most important of all, it wasn't a double date. You never told me that it was going to be. You never told me you had feelings for me, etc.

His excuse was that, ""I don't fuck around with coworkers"" and I told him, yeah well you never said that, you only said that last night of course I lost all hopes and started thinking of you as a friend after all those rejections. If you would have told me you had feelings for me but we should wait cause it's inappropriate, now that's different. Of course I wouldn't have gone after your friend! I wouldn't jump on you at work either but I would wait. I can be fucking professional.

He told me that, why should I even explicitly say it to you? We were coworkers, it's stupid. I'm so done. I was so confused and finally I texted him.

&gt;Tom, I’m done. I said what I needed to say. I’m not sorry anymore. You said some hurtful things… You’re willing to punch me in the face… because I was happy with another person… all because I wasn’t aware of your intentions. You said I played you but if anything, you played me. You expect me to just have this crush on and off just when it’s convenient for you. You expect that things go your way. You expect that everyone can just understand what you mean without you needing to say anything. I’m only sorry that you couldn’t just say that you liked me from the beginning and save us all this drama. I’m sorry that the whole night you were bitter and lied about it. I’m sorry that you expected I’d be with you nonstop throughout the party. I’m sorry you’re jealous. I’m sorry that I didn’t prioritize you. I’m sorry I treated you like a friend. I don’t want to bring anyone else into this conversation but I didn’t want to bring anyone home. I told Barney but he said, you’re pushing for it - it’s alright. I told him I didn’t want to. I’d tell you to ask Anna but why bother right? Of course, what does my words mean? Can’t blame him either you never stopped either of us and you acted so fine… how are we supposed to know? You know what, fuck this man… I got so much from this. I finally know what you’re like and honestly, I wish I didn’t. You are such a good person, you were such a good friend to me and I really hope this is just anger talking because otherwise - I don’t even know what else to say. Let me be the ‘slut’ that I am. Fuck man, one guy… one guy that I brought home…. I even told him I wasn’t comfortable nah fuck this… It’s all on me. I seriously don’t know what else to say, I’m at loss of words for you. Goodbye Tom, it was nice knowing you. Thanks for everything.

**tl;dr**: Fucked up story. I got with ex coworker's friend, coworker got mad at me because apparently he has feelings for me (even though he rejected me like multiple times in the past 4 months where i had crush on him). Over the night he told me it's fine, it's fine. He hugged me and got me some water, took care of me, tucked me in bed acted like it's fine then all of a sudden, I texted him the day after and he told me he doesn't want any contact anymore and I'm a fucking slut, I should've punched you etc. It's too complicated.

Am I seriously in the wrong? fuck I'm so lost and hurt."
4oycuw,3,2016-06-20,Interning/Studying in Belgium- Depression/Homesickness,AliciaDarling21,studyAbroad,https://www.reddit.com/r/studyAbroad/comments/4oycuw/interningstudying_in_belgium/,"I needed a place to vent and hear from some people who may have struggled with depression/homesickness while studying abroad. 

I'm 28 years old and married. I am used to being independent, and I used to have my own apartment before I met my husband.  I am in my second year of graduate school, and I figured this was the time go to intern abroad in the EU sector. I figured it would help with my education, meet new people in my field, and possibly set me up for a future career/PhD ideas. 

First, I was really excited about getting this opportunity. However, I wasn't expecting the barrage of ""Are you crazy? After the attacks? Aren't you afraid? Why the hell are you still going?"" to be consistent up until the week I left. My nerves were on end; I was suspicious of everyone; and I was afraid to leave my apartment unless it was for work. 

I got the nerve to go out and roam around after the second/third week. I enjoy Brussels; I don't love it. I'm not scared being by myself, but I hate doing things alone all the time. I have some coworkers that I can do things with, but not all the time. 

My husband visited for a week last week, and I was so happy. I felt like we could go anywhere, and I loved having him with me. When he left back to the United States, I bawled in the train station and cried for the rest of the day. I felt like I was back to where I was Day 1. 

I pulled myself back up, went out that night, and tried to enjoy my time. I went to Ireland to visit my parents this past weekend. I was miserable; mostly due to how my parents refused to go to any other place than the 3 pubs they visited in Dublin after I gave them a list of cool places. We went to visit Galway and only had 45 minutes to explore because they picked a bus tour. To top it off, I barely got any sleep (4 hours every night for the past 5 days). We left the AirBNB stressed out and rushing. It wasn't what I pictured, and I got depressed as to how the whole weekend went. I kept telling my parents how I am just done and want to go back home. By home, I mean back to my husband.

I stayed in bed all yesterday and binge ate sushi/chocolate covered biscuits. Today, I feel so cripplingly depressed. I don't want to do anything, and I just want to sleep all the time. 

I don't mind the living here part. I just feel so lonely and I hate that I agreed to an unpaid internship. I have never not worked and brought in an income. It is hitting be harder as my funds are depleting and I still have five more weeks here. I keep trying to tell myself it is worth it, and it will open up doors so I can work in Europe in the future. 

I don't want to leave, because I am working on some cool projects. I just find I look forward more to work than I do going home/going out to explore.

Come last Saturday. He texted me in the morning asking about what party is on for that night. I told him, a friend and I are going to this club to see an awesome DJ, you should come.

He said yes but he told me to come to his friend's house early around 7pm (kinda far away) to have dinner with them. Then he sent me a picture of his friend and he said don't worry he's good looking - this is motivation. Then in the afternoon he called me and told me, oh **I have 3 other good looking friends you could choose from**.

I ended up not going to dinner because my friend was too lazy to go. When Tom found out about that, he ended up at my doorstep around 10pm to have pre drinks here. Tom brought Barney and I was immediately smitten. His english was better, he was friendly, he had that easy going vibe which Tom, did not have.

Now this memory's starting to get a bit hazy cause I was both drunk, and a bit on drugs. I was drunk when Anna came but I was getting a bit sleepy so we did speed. Just Barney, me, and Anna.

Like closer to midnight, we drove over to Barney's house because he needed to change shirt. Anna and I needed to go to the bathroom so we all ended inside. Before leaving, Barney and I did a line of cocaine while Tom and my friend was watching.

Naturally, Barney and I were really pumped and in a different vibe as the two. Tom was kinda drunk, while my friend was just tipsy. I'm not saying it was the drugs, or the moments we shared ciggies but Barney and I got along really well and I just kind of talked to him more than I talked to Tom.

We got back in the car and drove over to the party, which wasn't far from Barney's place. This was a bit hazy but we had to walk quite a bit. Tom and Anna was at the front and then I was in the back with Barney, I don't know what we ended up talking about but he ended up kissing me. It was a very brief kiss. Of course I was pumped, my initial thought was that ""haha Tom's gonna laugh at me for ending up with his closest friend, I'm so embarrassed.""

That's not what happened. Once we got inside, we danced a bit, chilled then Barney and I shared a kiss again. Tom went to the bar with Barney and they ended up having this intense conversation.

Barney told me that everything's fine, and so I was confused and I was just, okay, I just wanna dance anyway. I don't really want to think or face any drama. I also saw my friends (two guys) then me and Anna just chilled with them on the dance floor.

I then went to the smoking room and I caught up with Barney, he told me hey, talk to Tom first then find me. So I did.

He told me outside of the smoking room, it's rude for you to go after my friend. I told him, wtf. Why? Even from early in the morning your texts with all the pictures, and the good looking guys to choose from you hinted that I should end up with your friend. And if anything, you don't own me I can end up with whoever I want, if you're my friend you should be happy for me.

Then he ended up in the argument that, he's had feelings for me for 4 months but he couldn't do anything about it because we were co workers etc. I told him, it's not okay because I have had that crush for 4 months as well and I told him straight up to at least have an answer. He never said anything, he brushed it off and that makes me feel rejected, over multiple times so of course over time I got over it.

I told him, what do you expect? I can't believe that you expect me to fall back into your arms after it took me so much effort to get over you. The crush isn't on and off just as you wish. I told him that he missed his shot, he rejected me multiple times and now I kissed Barney already, I'm not gonna drop him just because you said ""oh I like you now"" 

I told him though if he does want to start over then he should try to win me back because as of now we're friends and I want to hang out with Barney. Of course, I'm also under the influence of drugs and alcohol. I just wanted to party and chill.

The fucked up part, there was a window to see inside the smoking room. Barney was blowing me air kisses while he saw Tom and I talking like crazy intense. I didn't think much of it but Tom told me, alright, that makes sense. 

There's a lot of details but pretty much what happened was:

Tom became hot and cold the whole night. He told Barney and I that it was fine. He told Anna, it's not. I talked to him again, he said it's fine. **I finally got fed up and told both Barney and Tom, tell me if this isn't alright because I'm backing off the both of you. Tom laughed and said it's fine**. Barney just hugged me and took me to the dance floor.

I am seriously not a mind reader and I take things as it is. Not to mention that I was under the influence of multiple things and I just wanted to party and avoid any drama.

Not too long after, Anna told me Tom's having a moment again. Tom said it's fine but he also wanted me to ditch my other friends, the two guys, and just focus on the 4 of us. Long in the night, Tom also tried to kiss me again. Avoiding the drama, I did mdma with the two guys and then more cocaine with Barney. I got really fucked up and all I wanted to do was party. I remembered everything and I still acted normal but I was just happier, and I wanted to party more.

Tom convinced us that ""yeah it's fine"" and we partied all night. Morning comes and the 4 of us left all together. Tom helped me a couple of times cause I was having a headache. He hugged me and told me he cares for me no matter what, we're friends. He told me that I needed water but I said no, don't bother and he said no, I want to, you're my friend I care for you.

Along the way, I ended up talking with Barney. He wanted to come home with me and I said no, I'm extremely not comfortable with it because of Tom. I told Anna the same thing. Barney told me he talked to Tom and he said it's fine. I avoided everything, I told him no.

I don't understand what happened but Tom, Barney, and I ended up in my room. I was having quite the headache so Tom tucked me in, and he gave me water. Barney was passed out next to me and he tried to finger me under the blankets. I pushed his hands away and I honest to god, wanted him to leave.

Tom left, and Barney stayed. The next morning I felt like crap and I waited until the afternoon to text Tom (that was also around the time Barney actually woke up and sobered up). Barney told me nah, Tom will be fine - I know him. That's so not true.

Tom texted me.
&gt;Wow did you really do this.. Jesus that is cold.  So solving your problems with your feelings by just fucking the friend.. Hm thats pretty slutty. Btw funny the big mouth you gave me yesterday because of your uncontrolled way of using drugs.. Wish i was more sober so i have punched you in the face straight away.. Last thing: this was exactly the reason i wasnt fucking around with you.. Luckely i owed barney one so thats the good part. Don't contact me anymore, bye.

We ended up on a long argument over text. He told me he felt played, he told me that I was a slut (even though this is the first guy I brought home after I got out of my relationship). He told me that I avoided talking to him and solving it on the spot. I told him, I was on fucking drugs all I wanted to do was party, can you blame me for avoiding all this drama? Not to mention, you kept saying you were fine. You laughed, you danced, you flirted with other girls. You were so okay. Walking to the car after the party, all those things you said. Now you're saying you wish you could've punched me? I'm fucking cold? that you're not actually okay?

He then told me that he was also not okay with me inviting my 'boyfriends' the two friends who were guys. I told him, we went out all as friends so it's okay to have more friends join us. You could've mingled and talked to them. Most important of all, it wasn't a double date. You never told me that it was going to be. You never told me you had feelings for me, etc.

His excuse was that, ""I don't fuck around with coworkers"" and I told him, yeah well you never said that, you only said that last night of course I lost all hopes and started thinking of you as a friend after all those rejections. If you would have told me you had feelings for me but we should wait cause it's inappropriate, now that's different. Of course I wouldn't have gone after your friend! I wouldn't jump on you at work either but I would wait. I can be fucking professional.

He told me that, why should I even explicitly say it to you? We were coworkers, it's stupid. I'm so done. I was so confused and finally I texted him.

&gt;Tom, I’m done. I said what I needed to say. I’m not sorry anymore. You said some hurtful things… You’re willing to punch me in the face… because I was happy with another person… all because I wasn’t aware of your intentions. You said I played you but if anything, you played me. You expect me to just have this crush on and off just when it’s convenient for you. You expect that things go your way. You expect that everyone can just understand what you mean without you needing to say anything. I’m only sorry that you couldn’t just say that you liked me from the beginning and save us all this drama. I’m sorry that the whole night you were bitter and lied about it. I’m sorry that you expected I’d be with you nonstop throughout the party. I’m sorry you’re jealous. I’m sorry that I didn’t prioritize you. I’m sorry I treated you like a friend. I don’t want to bring anyone else into this conversation but I didn’t want to bring anyone home. I told Barney but he said, you’re pushing for it - it’s alright. I told him I didn’t want to. I’d tell you to ask Anna but why bother right? Of course, what does my words mean? Can’t blame him either you never stopped either of us and you acted so fine… how are we supposed to know? You know what, fuck this man… I got so much from this. I finally know what you’re like and honestly, I wish I didn’t. You are such a good person, you were such a good friend to me and I really hope this is just anger talking because otherwise - I don’t even know what else to say. Let me be the ‘slut’ that I am. Fuck man, one guy… one guy that I brought home…. I even told him I wasn’t comfortable nah fuck this… It’s all on me. I seriously don’t know what else to say, I’m at loss of words for you. Goodbye Tom, it was nice knowing you. Thanks for everything.

**tl;dr**: Fucked up story. I got with ex coworker's friend, coworker got mad at me because apparently he has feelings for me (even though he rejected me like multiple times in the past 4 months where i had crush on him). Over the night he told me it's fine, it's fine. He hugged me and got me some water, took care of me, tucked me in bed acted like it's fine then all of a sudden, I texted him the day after and he told me he doesn't want any contact anymore and I'm a fucking slut, I should've punched you etc. It's too complicated.

Am I seriously in the wrong? fuck I'm so lost and hurt."

I have experience with SQL databases and stuff like JDBC, but none with any kind of OLAP or dimensional data modeling. Basically my biggest concern right now is finding a simple, yet powerful reporting tool for interfacing with the data warehouse.

So let me start with telling you guys a little bit about my situation. When i came out of college i found a job as a cashier at a restaurant depot and while i was miserable there, i was able to save up about 2g. I am now a paid intern, started Jun 6, making a salary of 480 a week but my first paycheck wont be arriving till the 30th of jun. So far i have spent a little over $600 and i'm a little in shock at that. I just feel that's kind of a lot.

I currently live with my mother and sister. Mom needs $200 monthly for the apartment. Student loans are coming after me soon and i know that i will be paying them off with the income based option. These are really the only bills i have.

I guess what I am asking for is a little advice saving around the house. I am completely in charge of the kitchen and feeding my little sister and myself. I'm wondering if there is any guidelines or advice for saving when i'm grocery shopping or even some kind of easy inexpensive cook book. I also need to set up some kind of budget for myself and i genuinely no idea where to begin.

Of course the goal is to become self sufficient and move out and all that jazz but i realize that's really impossible until i'm making enough to support myself.

Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks guys"
4ozaox,5,2016-06-20,Need help on handling a situation where NDad expects me to go to an event that I never said I would go to.,kissedbyfire9,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/4ozaox/need_help_on_handling_a_situation_where_ndad/,"Hi guys, I've got two separate sort of issues/contexts that are coming together at once and I need some advice on how to either handle it, though I might already know what I need to do but I still need validation or advice on how I should feel/deal with the guilt.

I have an Nfather who has emotionally abused me my whole life. I'm at a point where I know the end game is no contact, I have a future plan (moving to a different country), but I'm being civil in the mean time while slowly checking out of our relationship. I'm going to less and less things, not making an effort to contact him, keeping him on a strict information diet of my life, etc.

Okay so context number one: My dad and our life-long family friends have been going on a summer camping trip for the past 20 years. I stopped going when I reached teenage-hood because frankly, I don't like camping the way my dad does it. He is dogmatic about it involving multiple portages and having getting to our camp site be a 6 hour long affair. I prefer easy access to a campsite, no portages, and minimal canoeing. But since my dad doesn't compromise, I decided to just stop going. In the past few years, my dad and family friends have been bugging me about coming to a camping trip again, never failing to remind me about it. I have been vague and non-commital in my answers.

Context number 2: My husband and I eloped a few years ago. My husband a year before we got married was feeling doubts about wanting to get married when we were on that path for a long time. I decided to focus on myself and my goals and moved abroad without him. Within 2 months, he said that this had given him a wake-up call and he wanted us to get married within a few months and to join me abroad. However, he wanted a small wedding because we had no time to save money. My parents haven't been in the same room together since I was 9, and I didn't want my wedding to be a test run of them being in the same room for the first time in 15 years. I always pictured them being buffered by 50-100 wedding guests, and picturing my wedding night with just my two parents and my ILs (who I'm not crazy about) was my idea of hell. However, I was afraid if I said no to my husband and that I wanted to wait until we had enough money to have a bigger wedding, that he might change his mind eventually (I know dumb thinking), so I said yes under the condition that if it's going to be a small wedding I'd rather it only be us and we celebrate with our respective families later. Well 3 years later, we've decided this summer we want to finally have a casual cocktail celebration with our families on our anniversary.

So, how these two situations are coming to a head. We're planning on having our wedding celebration the last weekend of August, which is our anniversary. This is the weekend the camping trip usually happens. An e-mail was sent out to me, my sister, all the members of the family friends by my father trying to figure out if the second last or last weekend worked best for everyone. I replied to everyone saying, ""DH and I were planning on finally having a small casual celebration for our wedding that weekend and we wanted to invite our families and friends. For that reason, we will not be there on the last weekend."" This email wasn't to say that we would therefore be able to make it if the camping trip was the weekend before, but was a head's up that if my father, sister, and family friend's would like to attend the celebration of our wedding, then maybe the camping trip should be the weekend before. However, GCSis who always attends the camping trip, is out of the country for the second last weekend. So there is this implicit threat that I feel from my NDad that if they're moving the camping trip to the weekend my GCSis can't make in order to accommodate my wedding party, then I better be there to make up for it. But I never indicated I would go, and frankly I don't want to go.

So NDad is trying to get a confirmation that I will be there for the trip when I never said I would, and I don't know how to tell him I'm not going. I think I should come up with a convenient lie, but I know I want to say, ""until you can be civil and not say something abusive, hurtful, condescending, or rude for an entire weekend, I am not going to subject myself to being around you in a place where I can't escape."" I am also feeling guilty. We call this trip ""Dads and Daughters"" and if they make the trip on the weekend before to accommodate my wedding and I don't go, then my father will have no daughters there for the trip. However, I am not stopping him from not missing my party for the camping trip (frankly that would be a blessing), I just thought he might want a heads up or at the party when his siblings and nieces and nephews ask why he isn't there, he might be embarrassed that the response they will all here is, ""oh he'd rather go on a camping trip.""

So, any advice on how to handle this? Should I just go? Am I right in feeling that he isn't entitled to my company so long as he is abusive? Should I lie to him? I was thinking of just telling him that DH can't take the time off work (he's in an internship with technically 0 vacation time or sick days) and that we have a wedding that weekend (of which he is aware this wedding is occurring sometime this summer because she's my oldest friend). Or do I just tell him straight up why I'm not going to be there? My reason against this is that until I do NC, I just want to keep a peace with as minimal effort on my part as possible. "

Therefore, I have to choose between studying abroad or strategically placing my internships so there isn't such a big gap between graduation and my first full-time job.

Study abroad during summer, take my last classes during fall, internship during spring, graduate.

Aside from programming projects, VHDL work, and some PCB layout, I've wanted to use my computer for some light gaming, which this summer is mostly Age of Empires 2 and Overwatch. I run Windows and Linux in a dual boot configuration. 

On my current T450s (i5-5200U) it's just _playable_ at around 30fps, with the lowest settings and the lowest render scale. It looks like a potato. I am not interested in additional advice to make the game run smoother, as it's as low end as possible. AoE2 is fine. 

I've just ordered a T460p with the 940MX GPU, and the medium-level i5 option. This i5 is an HQ model, not the U (ultra low voltage), with a 35W TDP instead of 15W. Furthermore, it is a true quad core, unlike my current one which is dual core with hyperthreading. I expect CPU performance will be more than adequate.

I'm sure the GPU will be supported just fine under both Windows and Linux and I have no plans on doing any switching setup; we're going full dGPU here. The Linux intel graphics drivers for the Broadwell Graphics in my T450s have been driving me insane. It's a constant juggle of screen tearing, or odd texture glitches with some OpenGL content. I've tested on multiple machines, it's not a hardware issue. 

How is power management for the Skylake chipsets and CPUs these days, though? Am I in for a janky machine under linux until things improve? "

We've been there, we've tried to help a guy out, to explain ourselves and why we swallowed the pill, to warn them after another average sloar trounces his heart. Why we are changing, why it's the best strategy. 

**warning**

I didn't think this necessary, but take heed, I'm only basing this hyperbolic parable on experience. The message is to avoid attempting conversion. (And the why of it). I'm surprised at the failure of so many to see the message being the admittedly extreme exposition. Also I apologize for my unavailability. Normally I only respond to rptheory submissions. I forget/ignore anything else. Continue the discourse in my leave of course!

And we need to stop. The best we can do is let them get hurt. The sooner the better. Make them search for a way, simply trying to hand them an image doesn't work. 

**A tragedy of perspectives**

Let us consider the average guy vs the alpha. The plate spinner. The desired male. 

Beta Billy is in an ltr, thinks he's got a unicorn. Sex is starfish a few times a week, half his paycheck goes to her either directly or indirectly. He wakes up Thursday, texts her good morning and about plans for their anniversary Friday night. He heads off to his job. 

Chad isn't in an ltr. Thursday before his alarm for the gym goes off, he wakes to an explosion into the mouth of plate #2, he fucks her good and heads to the shower, through the door she's laughing over some text from her boyfriend. When you get out of the shower she's already pushing for what you're doing this weekend, it can't be Friday, it's her boyfriends anniversary. Chad laughs and tells her to leave, he's got to lift. 

It's been an easy work day, Billy is enjoying lunch with his one coworker, discussing whether staying in and cooking his girl dinner or going out to a nice place is a better idea to show his affection. It's been a great year after all and she's perfect, he brags about the necklace he bought and the chateau getaway they'll do next week. He's been saving up his time off and he thinks this time, there will probably be anal! She must be busy, still no text from her. It's okay, she models, shoots can be complicated. He's not a controlling boyfriend after all. Back to work. 

Chad finishes his lunch and decides he doesn't want to finish the day. He calls his partner and lets him know he's leaving early, it's a Thursday and q2 profits are up, he'll leave things in the hands of the new intern and the project manager. He grabs his keys and posts that he's ""taking the day"", before his gxxr is even rumbling the texts have come flooding in. He ignores them until he gets to the pool, and checks to see three offers to chill and another message from plate 2, saying something about not being free Friday or Saturday. Cool, he messages ""you'll make it up to me"", then ignores her and checks the latest tinder match. 

Billy gets home, his girl is wearing something sexy and wants to know what they're doing tomorrow night. Modeling was crazy that day and she may not get paid until the next shoot. She snuggles up to him and asks for her present, gasping at the three paychecks in jewels he clasps around her neck. He goes to sleep with her later that evening after Netflix and some crazy hot sex (omg doggy style!). No blowjob this time, her jaw has been bothering her since the dental work. A month ago. He goes to sleep happy, what an awesome guy he is, what a great girlfriend he has. This weekend will be awesome. 

Chad's drunk, slamming down shots with his partners, plate 1 on his arm, it was a good quarter. Profits are up, Tinder built tomorrow night, plate 3 comes over Sunday - which leaves all Saturday to work on his bike! As everyone leaves he strips down plate 1 and tosses her bra on plate 2s anal tail, 'its at the foot of the bed"" he fucks her good and passes out after she calls an uber, he has a busy day tomorrow. 

This is the difference. Beta Billy can't believe in another option because the one he's living is the best he knows of. There is nothing better. He *believes this is the best life can get*. He probably makes more money than Chad at his corporate job, he has a model girlfriend who touches his dick 3x a week! He's moderately attractive, maybe some pudge around the waist. He drops 30k a year taking care of his ltr, modeling is seasonal after all, it's not stable! He cleans and cooks and no one bothers him. He has a good 401k, some stock options, and is paying off his 4 bedroom (plan for kids!) house. 

He's alone. He just doesn't know it.

He's cucked, he just doesn't know it. 

That baby his girl is going to announce as her anniversary gift, will have light skin, blue eyes, and that'll be enough for him to never consider a paternity test. 

Chad owns his business. He owns his time. He gets what he wants from every plate, blowjob alarm clocks from anyone overnight. His motorcycle may as well be a vibrator for all the pussy that sits on it. He'll never know nor care that plate 2 has his spawn. She'll never even bring it up because he'd disappear and she'd lose her beta bucks, if she even thinks of him now that she has what she wants from both worlds.

This is reality for three different people. A Chad, a Billy, and the average 26yr old girl. This is *normality*.  I'm not saying they don't see the other sides as one sees a gruesome movie, thinking ""oh man I'm glad I'm not like that"", but it's distant, not born of experience nor tutelage at a very young age. It isn't real, any more real than watching spiderman beat up doc oc to get a kiss from mj.

If you try to wake them up by force, it won't work. You're literally upsetting all the evidence they have on hand. Just let Billy discover the text messages, the snaps, the gaped asshole after a ""photo shoot"" and eventually, you have a trp sub with our numbers and growth. 

Keep your mouth shut. They'll learn, or oddly, even predictably, often enough they'll be happy.

 
**lessons learned**

- if your entire life is devoid of alpha experience, you can't believe or even comprehend its possibility. 

- this is the average girl. Believe me. This is a field report as much as anything else. ""though I didn't own a gxxr"" 

- Beta Billy is actually *happy born from ignorance*, just as Chad is happy, just as plate 2 is happy. Just as plate 1 is happy. 

- don't play wakeup. Just don't. Guide when asked, but only vaguely. This is something people must find on their own"

#This series is available legally on [Crunchyroll](http://www.crunchyroll.com/bungo-stray-dogs).

&gt;For weeks, Atsushi Nakajima's orphanage has been plagued by a mystical tiger that only he seems to be aware of. Suspected to be behind the strange incidents, the 18-year-old is abruptly kicked out of the orphanage and left hungry, homeless, and wandering through the city.

&gt;While starving on a riverbank, Atsushi saves a rather eccentric man named Osamu Dazai from drowning. Whimsical suicide enthusiast and supernatural detective, Dazai has been investigating the same tiger that has been terrorizing the boy. Together with Dazai's partner Doppo Kunikida, they solve the mystery, but its resolution leaves Atsushi in a tight spot. As various odd events take place, Atsushi is coerced into joining their firm of supernatural investigators, taking on unusual cases the police cannot handle, alongside his numerous enigmatic co-workers.

Character List - anyone new this episode will be **bolded**. They will be listed in order of their first appearance. Links are all to the Bungou Stray Dogs Wiki. Everyone's ability is put after the quick little character descriptions. If there's not a description of the ability, then it hasn't been shown in the show yet.

#Expect spoilers in this section if you have not watched the episode!

The [**Armed Detective Company**](http://bungostraydogs.wikia.com/wiki/Armed_Detective_Company) (Abbreviated to ADC in a couple character descriptions) is a company that deals with crimes that may be too violent or too difficult for regular police. Most of the members have their own special power, which are just simply called 'Abilities.'

The [**Port Mafia**](http://bungostraydogs.wikia.com/wiki/Port_Mafia) (Abbreviated to PM in a couple character descriptions) is an underground organization based in Japan. It is said that ""those who defy them will only burn and not survive."" They have a special ops squad called the **Black Lizard** (Abbreviated to BL in a couple character descriptions).

[Atsushi Nakajima](http://bungostraydogs.wikia.com/wiki/Atsushi_Nakajima) - *Introduced in Episode 1* - Young man who has white hair, with a single strand going down the side of his face.

He wears a properly buttoned white shirt with a tie, and creamy yellow tailored suit and trousers. His name and ability seem to have two different translations. For the name, the anime as translated by Crunchyroll is ""Francis F."" and for the manga scans they translate the name as ""Francis Scott Key Fitzgerald."" The Crunchyroll subs call his ability The Great Gatsby and the scans call it ""The Great Fitzgerald."" I'm not sure which one is more correct as I don't know Japanese. He is the leader of an American Organization called the guild. **Ability: The Great Gatsby**

*Special cases - These characters have never been confirmed or denied an Ability. No one knows if they have one for sure or not.

*Rip... Beep.*  
Her hands were moving almost of their own accord. Numb. Routine. No thinking.  
*Rip... Beep.*  
Two weeks. It had been two weeks now. Almost finished.  
*Rip... Beep.*

An air hostess-- that’s all she’d ever been. She didn’t do the important things, the big things, like cure cancer or rescue people from burning buildings. But she helped. Little things. She smiled at people on the street. She helped elderly cross the road. Last month, she had spent every day after work talking to John at the orphanage. An angry little kid, that one, but she knew he just needed someone to talk to.

Henry Jones was his name, the last man she smiled at on the street. He walked straight to an AA meeting after. Good thing, too, because he was *this* close to heading home instead that day, and his wife would have shown him the papers she had finally gotten back from her lawyer. Well, her mother’s lawyer, to be more accurate. She couldn’t afford it on her own, not with Henry’s drinking. It would’ve killed him. They would’ve found him on the ground next to that building on 34th street. Long way down.

She couldn’t bring herself to smile at people anymore. She had brushed past a really skinny guy a couple of days ago, sunken eyes and scars on his arms. They found Reg the next day in a rundown apartment, a needle in his arm.

*Rip... Beep.*  
She should’ve smiled.

John was a difficult fourteen year old. Ran away three times from the orphanage. They made fun of him for not being so bright because he got caught every time within a few days. He didn’t do well in school either. Punched Aron in the face when he made fun of him for it. Always angry. 

She got him ice cream. Häagen Daz mango sorbet-- now his favorite. He developed a real respect for her. His first real friend, older though she was. He didn’t know she knew, of course, and he wasn’t the type to say thank you. But once in a while, when he thought she was too busy enjoying her own ice cream to notice (she was more of a vanilla gal), he’d stare at her with wet in his eyes. He didn’t think she noticed.

They went every day to that ice cream store on 29th, at the corner of Grand street. She didn’t have ice cream every day, of course. Not with that air hostess figure to keep. But John’s growing musculature proved that it did him no harm.

It’s a good thing she saved him from that life. Prison was where he’d end up. Jersey State Prison, to be exact. Assault and battery. But now he was really trying to turn his life around. 

In twelve years, he’d be a research intern at MIT. In fourteen, he’d be the lead scientist to find a viable treatment for dementia. And they had made fun of him for not being bright. But she knew.

She always knows.

*Rip... Beep.*  
She didn’t do anything big. She left that to that guy in Gotham.  
*Rip... Beep.*  
Then again, there was that bolt she had loosened once.  
*Rip... Beep.*  
That pretty redhead would’ve been raped and murdered. Brutal. He would’ve killed hundreds the next day. Good with explosives, he was, a chemistry major.  
*Rip... Beep.*  
But the support beam fell on them. A loose bolt. The girl died instantly, him the next day. A tragedy, the paper had said. But she knew.  
*Rip... Beep.*

No. Stop. No thinking. It was almost over.

The Butterfly, she liked to call herself back in the early days. Like a superhero. It made her want to wear a cape. She’d go out every day, find the littlest things she could do that would have the biggest positive impact. She saved a man’s life, years before it was under threat, by slipping a condom in his bag. She stopped suicides every day by shaking a hand, or giving a high five.

She’d be smiling in her sleep every night.

But it got tougher. She saved eight hundred and twelve lives once, by taking two.

Then it got tougher. She saved six, by taking one.

Then it got painful. She saved the woman that would eradicate the flu, a disease killing millions each year. But she had to kill a family of four. Innocent children.

*Rip... Beep.*  
She didn’t call herself the Butterfly anymore. She didn’t smile at night.  
*Rip... Beep.*  
It had been two weeks since she became sure. It was either the towers, or the white house. There was no other way.  
*Rip... Beep.*  
It was better this way. She knew that. She had seen it. The drone strikes would stay on foreign soil, not here. The wars would be shorter. There would be no draft.  
*Rip... Beep.*

“Next,” she called. “Next!”

Her normally sing-song voice was hoarse. Her tone, normally so full of love, callous.

That was the last one. The line had ended. They had all boarded. She waited for a couple more minutes. She contemplated just leaving. She could walk down the corridor and survive. She could save more lives.

She sighed. No. No thinking. It was too much. She packed up her purse, inserted the ticket stubs into their proper slot, locked the drawer, and boarded the plane. United Airlines flight 93, bound to San Francisco. It wouldn’t get there.

But it wouldn’t reach D.C. either. She’d made sure of it. She’d spilled that coffee that ensured that those people would be on the flight. They’d stop it.

That coffee that damned so many others.

She strapped herself in, and took a look at her watch. Eight o'clock in the morning, Tuesday, September the 11th, 2001."

4p1ph3,6,2016-06-20,Is it just me? Looking for Advice,Lm0,Construction,https://www.reddit.com/r/Construction/comments/4p1ph3/is_it_just_me_looking_for_advice/,"Hey guys,

So I graduated with a bachelors in construction management last August and I've been working for an industrial construction company as a piping field engineer since then. I also did two internships with the same company before i graduated and hired on full time.

So I've been here full time for almost a year and I've noticed a lot of things... and I'm wondering if it's something I would have to deal with at any company I work for. Hoping you guys can help me out.

First off, there really seems to be no structure within the company, especially for new hires. I have been sent to training out of state but it all related to safety and culture. Both of which are very important things, but I feel i haven't gained much experience related to operations and what I actually do on a day to day basis. I sorta feel like I've just been thrown out there to figure things out for myself. And before anyone says to speak up, believe me, I ask a TON of questions, all the time. I suppose this is just part of being a new hire.

I was actually stationed in an office for the first 4 months after being hired on full time and I did pretty much nothing. I finally said something to my supervisor at the time and they worked it out for me to go to a project, and I haven't spoken to him since.

Also, I just moved out of state to go to a pretty large project, and was told the working hours were 6am-5pm, which is fine, and I'm used to it, but everyone else stays late and I don't know how they do it. My brain pretty much shuts off after 10 hours, and I honestly can't think anymore. But I still feel guilty when i leave at 5:30 or 6, even when the work day ends at 5.

Basically, I feel like the only good thing keeping me from quitting and finding a job closer to home is the pay... They pay is really good for being right out of college and I can't really complain.

As you can tell all of this has been bothering me. Do I just need to suck it up, or should something change?

I will now focus more on the current web-based version and continue to work on that as of today.

Also it's been hard finding time to code ever since I started my internship.  Working 40h a week leaves me with less time to work on DH than I previously had when I was in school.  I will do my best to keep the content rolling in as of today. (RIP sleep)

4p22rc,1,2016-06-20,Desk Jobs,Lazy_Turtle,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/4p22rc/desk_jobs/,"I started working as an engineering intern and I'm worried that this is what I'm going to expecting in life.  I'm happy to have had the opportunities that I've had, but I'm not sure if I'm going to be happy.  Sitting at a desk, staring at a computer, droning on and on.  Is this it? Is this what work is like?  I watch my full time coworkers and I cannot tell if they are happy or simply complacent.  It's a good job.  It's an easy job.  But it's not really satisfying.  Maybe I made the wrong career path, but how do I know? If I switch, maybe I'll be even more happy.  They put in about 50 hours a week, and I am drained working 40, the occasional 45.  It's just a lot of design.  I was told engineering would be a profession for problem solvers, but I don't like solving them like this.  I get home at 5 and have to go to bed by 10 or I'm exhausted the next day.  Is that what it's like?

I told a friend that I think I would enjoy being a construction worker.  I love working with my hands.  I love putting things together.  I love painting, greasy hands, and physical labor.  He just told me that his dad did that for 20 years and his body is shot now.  Is there no happy medium when it comes to work?  Unsatisfied ease or painstaking satisfaction? Is that all there is?

I don't know what I want or expect.  I mean, my favorite job has been as a cook on campus.  What does that say about me?  I don't even know what to do and I'm just going to stay the course until I figure some things out.  

What is your experience and opinion on work?"

**Prologue** 

10 months ago I posted a series of posts on a resource found on /r/coontown. The resource is a giant collection of sources to “aid those interested in human biodiversity” called the [Human Biodiversity Resource](http://humanbiologicaldiversity.com/) (HBDR). Unfortunately, various complications prevented me from completing this at the time, not least of all the immensity and lack of organization of the section entitled “HBDR general” which I intended to tackle third. As such, for this post I will take on the section entitled “On the Biological Reality of Race.”  

[Part one](https://np.reddit.com/r/BadSocialScience/comments/3cdz2z/rcoontowns_human_biodiversity_resource/)

[Part two](https://np.reddit.com/r/BadSocialScience/comments/3cjbev/coontowns_human_biodiversity_resource_part_2_the/) &amp; [part 2.5](https://np.reddit.com/r/BadSocialScience/comments/3cmhoz/coontowns_human_biodiversity_resource_part_25_the/)

Now, some people may think that this is unnecessary. /r/Coontown is dead, and the Reddit right wing is more focused on the foolhardy musings of Donald Trump than on the biological reality of race. That being said, Reddit is still one of the largest recruitment grounds for groups like Stormfront, and there is still a vocal contingent of openly racist redditors participating in a variety of subs. As well as this, I haven’t been sleeping well lately and I like to practice my writing when I am awake late so I figured I would return to something I always intended to finish.

This write-up is a learning process, and I will be experimenting with a variety of formats. My first post was, at times, overly dismissive and rather than engage with the content of the sources it criticised the nature of the sources; whether they were academic, who wrote them, where they were published. While I will still examine the nature of the sources I will endeavour to analyse the content more, particularly for the larger sources (read: books).

I am also not yet sure on the best formatting for writing a post like this for Reddit. There are various challenges unique to this project. The nature of the HBDR, the medium of Reddit, and the difference this post has to other bad-x posts all mean that I am continuously learning while I write this. As such, I will be trailing different formats throughout these posts. Part 3 will be split into multiple posts. This first post will be a fairly in-depth review of *Race*, 1974, by John R. Baker, following that I will write shorter posts on each of the subsequent full books in this section. Following this will be another in-depth post, looking at the smaller texts of the section. I may also include a final post for part 3 which will be an overview of my criticisms from the first three posts, although this will depend on how long this part takes and on my other commitments. I make no promises to the regularity of these posts (although I hope there will be no more 10 month gaps). I am currently studying towards my masters, working an internship, as well as several voluntary commitments for a variety of projects, and then I have a social life on top of all that. For this reason, I would like to invite anybody who would like to help to PM me.

**The HBDR takedown, Part 3.1**

*Race*, by John R. Baker attempts to take a taxonomic, zoological approach to discern whether or not “there is reality behind the idea of race” (Baker, 1974, 4). Baker defines race as roughly synonymous with subspecies, and further differentiates human populations into “ethnic taxon” which can be considered sub-subspecies (Baker, 1974, 4). Baker declares that categories of race and ethnic taxon represent “a truth about the natural world.”  (Baker, 1974, 5). The major criticism of this book is that it makes highly selective use of evidence, omitting not only bare-bones facts, but also entire academic disciplines and theories when they do not suit Baker’s narrative. The first half of this post will discuss the academic response to Baker’s book, and the next half will examine the first part of the book to give a more in-depth analysis of the ways in which Baker omits evidence which does not fit his narrative.

Baker’s conclusions could be considered ad-hoc. He uses a taxonomic approach to discern whether or not there is a real taxonomy of humans. Michael Banton shares my concerns, noting that “Baker assumes the importance of morphology and then investigates the ability of races to form civilizations” (Banton, 1974, 515). This is not a totally insuperable criticism for Baker, and he does seem to anticipate and respond to it in his introduction, noting that there is a coherence to his taxonomy while random alterations to it “produce nonsense” (Baker, 1974, 6). I mention this, however, because I believe that this is the major problem with most race-realist literature and is something I will mention again in this post.

 In his review of the book James C. King calls *Race* the “notes and comments” of an “academic cytologist with a strong amateur interest in physical anthropology” (King, 1975, 383). Wolf Roder is less kind, calling the book an example of “the entry into the fray [of debates on the reality of race by] scholars expert in one field but of questionable competence in another” (Roder, 1975, 519). In contrast, Owen, calls the book a “specialist approach” recognising Baker’s nine earlier works on biological themes (Owen, 1974, 271). I am inclined to agree with King’s and Roder’s assessment, however, over Owen’s. An expert in cytology is not necessarily an expert in physical anthropology, despite the fact that both disciplines could be broadly described as ‘biology.’  Similarly, I would not call a petrologist’s book on palaeontology a ‘specialist’ approach, despite the fact that both petrology and palaeontology can both be broadly described as geology.

Interestingly, Baker acknowledges that no “two authorities” will likely be in agreement about taxonomic categories of humans, however, he does believe that the general truth that humans can be divided into taxa is still meaningful (Baker, 1974, 5). The inability of human-taxonomists to generate consensus is, however, not something Baker should be allowed to just dismiss. This lack of consensus reflects the potentially ad-hoc nature of all race-realist thought. The basic contention is that if you split humans into categories and then look for differences based on those categories you will find differences, regardless of their importance or relevance, and regardless of similar differences between populations within the same category. Multiple studies have reflected this.

Jonathan Kaplan argued that populations corresponding to Western racial taxonomies could be identified through allele frequencies, however, these differences are of no more significance than the differences between any two populations (e.g. the differences between allele frequencies of Spaniards and Arabs is the same as the differences in allele frequencies between Spaniards and Portuguese) (Kaplan 2011). This also reflects the findings of Weiss and Fullerton, who noted that if you split humans into three groups; Maori, Icelanders and Mayans then all other populations will be genetic admixtures of Maori, Icelanders and Mayans (Weiss &amp; Fullerton 2005). In short, if you start with categories and try to explain how people fit into them, no matter the categories, you will always generate results. 

Baker explicitly challenges a variety of views which either outright reject, or dispute the value of, taxonomies of race. He splits these into two categories; those which reject race as discrete categories and those which assert the primacy of environmental factors over genetic factors (Baker, 1974, 5). While his thesis is totally incompatible with at least the first of these two challenges Baker is careful to not totally, explicitly reject either of them. Instead he claims that racial classification provides us with a *degree* of truth necessary for understanding humanity. This is a common tactic of even the basest race-realists, who claim that environmental factors may play some role, but ultimately that role emerges after the influence of genetics. 

King asserts that this discussion of opposing theories is at best cursory, if not mere lip-service; “the entire ethno-logical, cultural social anthropology of the last hundred years is completely ignored” (King, 1975, 382). While E. B. Tylor and Ruth Benedict are mentioned in the bibliography they are not referenced in the text at all, and Durkheim, Maine, Malinowski and Radcliffe-Brown are not mentioned in the bibliography or within the text. Banton asserts that Baker never makes “any direct attack on the understanding of race made possible by studies in population genetics” (Banton, 1974, 515).  This is indicative of one of the major problems of the text, which is that it relies on historic scholarship which was already rejected by 1974, without examining contemporary scholarship or adequately discussing why the rejection of historic scholarship was mistaken.

Tattersall notes that roughly two-thirds of the references are from before the twentieth century, and 90 percent come from before 1950 (Tattersall, 1977, 249). Tattersall criticizes Baker’s writing on Africa for ignoring both modern ethnology, and modern physical anthropology by academics such Broca and Topinard, instead relying on 19th Century “travellers” such as Speke, Livingston and Stanley (Tattersall, 1977, 249). Banton repeats this criticism almost verbatim, complaining that Baker “displays no understanding of social anthropology’s relevance to his theme, preferring to rely on Victorian explorers for his mish-mash of miscellaneous information on Africans” (Banton, 1974, 514). King criticizes Baker for displaying “consistently not the assumptions and myopia of our own time, but instead, those of a century ago” (King, 1975, 382). 

It is not, however, all doom and gloom for Baker. Eysenck praises Baker for his engagement with the work of his contemporary, Arthur Jensen. Noting that while Baker commenced work on the book long before Jensen had published his work on race-based differences in intelligence, Baker “quotes Jensen at times” (Eysenck, 1974, 668). Moreover, Bertram, in stark contrast to other critics, praises Baker for his reliance on historical sources, claiming that historic thinkers were “less blinkered” than contemporary thinkers. Bertram also claims that the “environmentalism” of Baker’s opposing contemporaries within the English speaking world is not shared by their Russian contemporaries, although which Russian contemporaries he does not mention (Bertram, 1974, 468). 

On the criticism of Baker’s bibliography, I tend to side with the more negatively critical Banton, King and Tattersall for three reasons. The first, and simplest, is that their criticism of Baker’s sources is more rigorous and in-depth than the more positive criticism of Bertram and Eysenck. For example, Tattersall and King both mention the thinkers who they think Baker should have included, but didn’t, while Bertram does not mention by name the Russian scholars who he claims agree with Baker. Secondly, it is problematic that of all Baker’s contemporaries mentioned throughout these reviews he completely omits those who disagree with him, and quotes the one who agrees with him. This one who he does quote, Jensen, also wrote the blurb for the book. When you have a small group of people who only engage with each, refuse to discuss their contemporary dissenters, and endorse each other, then this is usually indicative of pseudo-science. Banton is not quite so slanderous in his criticism, claiming that who is or isn’t included is “governed by personal whim and happenstance” (Banton, 1974, 514), rather than out-right pseudo-scientific collaboration masquerading as academic peer-review.

The most important decider of this, for me, comes from looking at the writers of the reviews, and the journals they were contained in. Banton is a social scientist who primarily publishes on racial and ethnic relations, King is a micro-biologist, and Tattersall is a paleoanthropologist who has worked extensively on human evolution. Eysenck was a notable scholar, and at his death was the most commonly cited psychologist in peer-reviewed literature, Bertram, on the other hand, was a zoologist whose work primarily focused on the Arctic and Antarctic. Given that it was their field of expertise Banton and Tattersall are more likely to be knowledgeable on the relevant literature in the topic covered in *Race* than either Eysenck or Bertram who had distinguished careers in tangentially related fields. 

Moreover, the negative reviews appear in journals dedicated specificlly to Sociology, Evolution and Zoology, while the positive reviews are in journals dedicated to Geography, and Technology and Culture. The journals of the negative reviews seem more immediately relevant to the disciplinary traditions with which *Race* should engage. Although this is perhaps a little harsh on Eysenck, I think it gives us fair reason to dismiss Bertram’s review as appearing in an irrelevant journal, written by a scholar with no relevant expertise. As well as this, Banton’s, King’s and Tattersall’s reviews are all published in journals with significantly higher impact factors (1.6, 4.6, 7.8 respectively) than Eysenck’s review (0.2). In short, Bertram is hardly an expert in a relevant discipline and Eysenck published his review in an insignificant journal, while Banton, King and Tattersall have relevant expertise and published in more significant journals.

In conclusion, while this book was not universally derided by scholars, the scholars who praise it seem to have less relevant expertise than those who wrote negative reviews, and the positive reviews were published in less reputable journals than the negative reviews. The major problems identified by the negative reviews were; Baker’s lack of expertise in the subject, Baker’s omission of contemporary thinkers in favour of historic scholarship and Baker’s failure to engage with a variety of relevant academic disciplines. The final part of this post will cover the first part of the book, and specifically look at the way Baker omits evidence which contradicts his thesis is order to construct a narrative.

There are a few reasons I have decided to look at only the first section of the book. I decided to look at just one section due to time restraints and a desire to keep this post relatively short. I picked the first section because it is the most praised section of the book. King refers to it as a “mine of information” of both well-known figures, and more obscure writers (King, 1975, 382).  In his conclusion King, who is highly critical of the rest of the book, considers the first section to be the contribution Baker made to the “problem of race” (King, 1972, 383). Eysenck is quite positive in his assessment of this section, calling it “entertaining and instructive” (Eysenck, 1974, 666). 

Moreover, the major criticism of *Race* seems to be its selective use of overly historic sources. When your book is attempting to redefine the contemporary scientific debate such criticism is damning. By not engaging with your contemporaries properly nobody has any reason to think you understand the contemporary debate, and therefore, they have no reason to consider your idle musings relevant, much less convincing. However, for an historic survey it is not quite as much of a problem. I will show that, despite the praise of King and Eysenck, the first part of the book is still terrible. My criticism is anticipated by Banton, who called Baker’s historical writing “unsystematic and unsatisfactory” (Banton, 1874, 514).   Basically, the criticisms from the reviews do enough, in my opinion, to force us to be highly sceptical about whatever Baker has to say in the three parts which constitute his scientific scholarship, however, I think more needs to be done to address the problems of the first part.
 
The first part of the book is called “The Historic Background” and concerns itself with the “thoughts of man” not their actions (Baker, 1974, 9). This is not an analytic or critical analysis, rather it is a survey of different attitudes people have held towards morphological and behavioural differences between populations. The first chapter deals with the attitudes of people from Neanderthals to the eighteenth century. Baker notes that, due to the width of the period examined in this chapter, and the lack of sources available on some parts of its time frame, the chapter can hardly be comprehensive (Baker, 1974, 9). It would be nice, however, if at tried to incomprehensively present both sides of the debate rather than merely incomprehensively presenting one side.

It is important to note that Baker seems to believe that there are two competing theories on the nature and origin or racial difference; the environmentalist view, and the hereditary/genetic view. Baker himself endorses the second option. In this chapter he even goes so far as to call the 1691 theory of Ludolfus regarding differences in skin colour “clear recognition of genetic differences between ethnic taxa” (Baker, 1974, 16). This is despite the fact that Ludolfus was writing over a century before Charles Darwin or Gregor Mendel develop the theories which would birthed genetics. 

Baker completely skips out the Roman and Greek views on morphological and behavioural difference between populations. It is odd that he would not include the views of groups which created large, multi-cultural empires. Some Greeks, including Hippocrates and Aristotle, held that environment was key to population differences. Aristotle, for example, relates perceived deficiencies in skill and intelligence among Northern Europeans to the cold places they inhabit (Aristotle, Politics, Book 7 Section 1327b). On the other hand, Roman emperor Julian the Apostate provides us with a view which does not quite fit into the nature v nurture debate, claiming population differences are a result of Divine Providence. Interestingly, Baker also fails to discuss one of the major theories of race from the medieval period, which is the view that races are determined by Aristotelian essences. This view is a precursor to the genetic account of race, as it presents race as a result of inherent qualities within a person (James, 2016). 

Baker does include the views first expressed in the *Talmud*, that the descendents of Noah formed three peoples; Semetic, Hamitic and Japhetic.  Such a view falls under the hereditary category, given its descent aspect. Baker does not, however, discuss the work of Islamic scholars, such as Al-Jahiz, or Ibn Khaldun, who endorsed environmentalist views. The omission of Ibn Khaldun is particularly notable given that he was explicitly responding to the explanation of population differences as expressed by the *Talmud*.

Another interesting omission from this chapter (and the next) is John Ray. John Ray is considered to be the first person to develop a definition of species, and while this is mentioned later in the book it is only done in relation to Blumenbach, and is not discussed at length (Baker, 1974, 73). Ray, along with Bernard Varen, also developed a classification system for groups of humans based on mostly physical characteristics (Smedley, 2007, 168). This is not mentioned at all. Unfortunately, I have not been able to find this classification table in the original so I cannot know if Ray and Varden offered opinions as to why these differences existed or if they merely created categories.

The final part of the chapter concerns itself with the views of early modern European thinkers on race. Again, those thinkers who endorsed views compatible with Baker’s are favoured. Eysenck praises Baker’s treatments of these thinkers, with a view that their beliefs on race have been hidden from history, due to the eminence derived from their other beliefs (Eysenck, 1974, 666-667). This comes across as an argument from authority. Baker is (admittedly, implicitly) claiming that these foundational European thinkers endorsed views of racial superiority or genetic-based race realism in order to make his views more palatable. Their views emerged before the modern discourse on race, however, and so there is no reason we should accept their opinions on this topic as valid today. They were all, for example, writing before anthropology or sociology had been develop as disciplines.

Baker completely omits environmentalist views from this chapter. He also presents historic hereditary views on race in manipulative, highly rhetorical, fallacious ways. I would not recommend this chapter to anyone wanting to understand the history of beliefs about race. There are much better sources for this (such as the SEP article on race), which are more comprehensive and less verbose.

The next chapter is called ‘Blumenbach and his Contemporaries’ and details the history of thought on race in the eighteenth century, stressing the fact that these thinkers writing before the theory of evolution by means of natural selection had been developed. Blumenbach is the central figure, which makes sense given that his classification of humans into seven types became the standard categories of human diversity for a substantial period of time.

Baker stresses the fact that Blumenbach was attempting to show the “unity of man and to correct the common belief in the marked inferiority of other races” (Baker, 1974, 6). This seems like something of a rhetorical trick, a way of announcing that even someone looking to study the similarities of races cannot ignore their differences, and that acknowledgement of those differences does not mean an argument toward inferiority. This is a trick because once you get out of the first section Baker does in fact make an argument towards inferiority. Moreover, the contemporary argument against race-realism is not an attempt to describe the “unity of man”, rather it generally claims that environment is the cause of such difference, or that differences between races are not meaningful.

Some of the praise Baker gives to thinkers seems slightly strange; for example, he declares of Sommerring, a theoritican who wrote extensively on the inferiority of black people to white people, that “whatever mistakes he may have made in points of detail through lack of adequate anatomical material, he was guided solely by desire to establish the truth (Baker, 1974, 27).”  This is typical of race-realist literature, and reflected in the HBDR which heads itself with the George Orwell quote ""In a time of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.""  The point the race-realist is making is that they are just seeking the truth, and criticisms of their work for racism are not fair, because their search for the truth comes before any biases or belies they held before the study. 

I believe that criticism of this rhetorical technique is justified, particularly given Bertram’s comments about the value of Victorian traveller’s views on African as people free of the “blinkers” of contemporary society (Bertram,1974, 468). This book is written within a wider ideological debate. It is characteristic of one side of this debate, the side Baker is on, to use their ‘search for the truth’ to deflect ideological criticism. If their research is riddled with mistakes, as Sommerring’s was, and just so happens to reflect the biases they held before the research, then their search or the truth is perhaps not as legitimate as their ideological allies may claim.

He also praises Peter Camper for providing the starting point for craniology (Baker, 1974, 28). Baker may be forgiven for this praise, the debate on the integrity of the findings of history’s most prominent craniologist Samuel Morton did not begin until 1981. Whatever your opinion on the outcome of this debate it is clear craniology is not nearly as popular today as it was in the nineteenth century, mostly only being used by race-realists now. The most major recent work utilizing craniology came out in 1995: J Phillipe Rushton’s *Race, Evolution and Behaviour*.

Rushton splits race into three groups, and argues that skull sizes for “’Mongoloid’ samples averaged 1,451 cm^3…Caucasoid samples averaged 1,421 cm^3…and Negorid samples averaged 1,295cm^3” (Rushton, 1995, 119). Rushton’s study, of course, came after *Race*, so there is no way Baker could have known about it, however, it is clear from the criticisms of Rushton’s book, as well as claims by other post-*Race* academics who have made use of craniology, that the method suffers from similar issues as other methods used to justify race-realism. 

Cranial capacity and intelligence only have a correlation coefficient of 0.18, too low to support the link between head size and intelligence. Moreover, Rushton was criticized for including grouping people from a single continent together, regardless of the climate they live in. People who live in hotter climates often have slightly smaller cranial capacities than those from colder climates (Cernovsky, 1997). In fact, an earlier Rushton study showed that North American ‘blacks’ have similar cranial capacities as North American ‘whites’ from similar climate zones (Rushton, 1990), yet this information is curiously omitted from Rushton’s latter book. Finally, Beale et all. discovered, in a study of 20,000 skulls, found the same pattern of cranial capacities as Rushton, however, Beale advises against using cranial capacity as indicative of racial traits “If one merely lists such means by geographical region or race, causes of similarity by genogroup and ecotype are hopelessly confounded” and that for anything meaningful results to emerge from craniology environment needs to be controlled for (Beale, 1984, 306).

The reason I include such a thorough dismissal of such a minor aspect of the chapter is because craniology is a pseudo-science; Cernovsky calls it an “incompetent methodology” (Cernovsky, 1997). Even the most contemporary uses of craniology have been shown to be deficient and psueo-scientific. Baker is prepared to include, and even praise those, who engage in pseudo-science when their conclusions agree with his. He does not include people utilizing more rigorous, better defended methodologies when their conclusions disagree with him. Baker himself engages in this “incompetent methodology” in the final part of his book, when discussing the superiority or inferiority of certain ‘taxa’ (Baker, 1974, 429). If this does not show that Baker’s conclusions are ad-hoc, and his selection of evidence driven by bias, then I do not know what will.

After his discussions of other Craniologists Baker turns to the excitement the anthropoid apes brought to eighteenth century thinkers. There was a possibly considered by these thinkers that these apes were men. He notes the conclusion of these thinkers was to maintain the separation of the species and man, however, he does not remark at all about what these debates meant for contemporary thinkers, or why he included this debate.

The second chapter continues the problems of the first. Rather than focus on what it excludes as I did in the first chapter, I have decided to problematize what it includes. This shows that it is not merely a case of Baker not knowing, or missing out, on contrarian research. If he is prepared to not only include, but praise, people using thoroughly rejected methodologies when they agree with him, while omitting everyone who disagrees with him, then the bias with which *Race* was written becomes palpable.

The third chapter is entitled ‘From Gobineau to Houston Chamberlain’ and deals specifically with theories that “favoured a belief in the inequality of ethnic taxa.”  This is due to the prevalence of beliefs in racial equality among Baker’s contemporaries. Baker believes the belief in equality emerged from the actions of Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany. This chapter begins with Gobineau as it is believed that Hitler’s beliefs began with his Gobineau’s work (Baker, 1974, 33). 

Gobineau’s work seems extremely germane to the modern discourse of race, in light of the rhetoric of certain Europeans and a particular American presidential candidate, regarding the current migrant crisis. Gobineau wanted to discover why great civilizations collapsed, and turned to racial differences to explain this. His argument was that superior civilizations would begin empires, and eventually members of inferior races would come to live within it. The hybridization of races was what caused a civilization to decline. Gobineau is clearly an influence on Baker, who later in the book tries to evaluate races based on their ability to form great civilizations (Baker, 1974, 506). In fact, Baker refers to one of Gobineau’s books as being the most important book entioned in the theird and fourth chapters (Baker, 1974, 59). What Baker does not include is the aristocratic Gobineau’s views on social class, in which he argued for the genetic superiority of the aristocratic classes who had more Aryan blood than the race mixed commoners.

Given that he is writing a survey Baker doesn’t need to counter this assertion himself, although it would be nice if he included the views of those who have challenge his thought. Instead, Baker repeats a common view of the alt-right. That the belief in racial equality is a response to the atrocities of the holocaust, and not a response to scientific evidence (Baker, 1974, 33). Rather than even look for academic, peer reviewed assessments of one of his major influences, Baker basically asserts that the falling out of fashion of race-realist views is due to feels, but he does not even try to find the reals. This view goes in tandem with the legitimization of race realist theories through the “search for truth” justification. The idea is that the holocaust was so insidious that the beliefs which motivated need to be rejected out of hand, regardless of their truth, because of their potential consequences

At this point, what strikes me is how little race-realist views change. Even in a several-hundred-page book, with an almost encyclopaedic bibliography, Baker is making claims which would not be out of place in a Reddit post, particularly those on /r/coontown or /r/European. He has the same intentional ignorance, and refusal to actually engage with literature which criticizes his views. Not only do his views mirror those of 18th and 19th century thinkers, but his views are mimicked by racists today. If it wasn’t true when Gobineau wrote it, and it wasn’t true when Baker wrote it, then why do they think it is true when they write it on a Reddit post?  Likely because they live in an isolated bubble, where they avoid any dissent with head-in-the-sand, intentional ignorance.

He also discusses the work of Charles-Henri-Georges Pouchet. Pouchet argued that there was no fundamental difference between humans and apes, and stressed the differences in intellectual capabilities between different groups of humans, claiming the “Negro…clearly inferior to others in intellectual attainments.” Once again Baker takes care to note that Pouchet “pleaded objective study of [the problem of race]” and held a strong belief that “humanitarian motives” were supressing this objective study (Baker, 1874, 38).

The next part of the chapter deals with the debate of polygenists against monogenists. Polygenists believed that the races had separate origins, while monogenists believed that they had a single origin. He specifically points out that the polygenist view was not entirely defeated by Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution, as multiple human groups could have arisen due to convergent evolution, although he does not explain how it is that human groups could produce children (Baker, 1974, 39). When discussing the difference between humans and other primates earlier in the chapter he also fails to mention the inability of humans and other primates to produce fertile offspring. This provides legitimacy to historic views which are not taken seriously in modern academia.

The chapter then examines the effect *On the Origin of Species* had on the discourse surrounding race, with particular attention given to Francis Galton. He describes Galton as a genius, because of his contributions to meteorology and genetics, his work as an explorer and his role as the “founder of eugenics.” He attributes Galton’s work to his time as an explorer in Africa, claiming that his view toward their inferiority was not “inhibited by any egalitarian feelings” (Baker, 1974, 40). This is Baker’s response to the predicted criticism of his preference for Victorian thinkers over contemporary physical anthropologists, as eventually articulated by Banton and King. He attributes the major disciplinary change to politics, rather than the failings of racial theory. 

Baker seem to think that the political nature of a theory does not give us reason to reject it. There are various epistemologies I could invoke to counter this, but the one I will use is instrumentalism, which holds that scientific theories are merely “instruments for prediction of observable phenomena.”  Essentially, if all scientific theories are instruments then we must evaluate them as instruments, which involves establishing what they are instruments for. If somebody asks you “Is this hammer good?” the response requires you to consider what a hammer is used for, and working out if the hammer in questions can effectively do it. When investigating scientific theories, we must work out what the predictive power of these theories is useful for before evaluating whether or not it can effectively make accurate predictions. If the theory is only useful for things that we do not want to do, then we have reason to reject it. This is only one of many reasons why the political nature of a theory can give us reason to reject it, and I do not actually endorse unrestricted instrumentalism, merely I hold that it provides a useful framework for explaining this particular argument.

The final three thinkers discussed in the chapter are Nietzsche, Lapouge and Houston. Nietzsche and Lapouge are included because of the Nazi fascination of them, although Baker does well to acknowledge the ways in which the Nazis misunderstood Nietzsche’s work (Baker, 1974, 46).  He is very praiseworthy of Lapouge, despite his acknowledgement that Lapouge used his theories of race to justify anti-Semitism and slavery (Baker, 1974, 48). This is congenial to the previously mentioned perception race-realists; that their work is rejected due to social, rather than scientific factors, today expressed as “feels over reals.”

The work of Chamberlain is included because of its focus on German superiority over other European groups, and its anti-Semitism (Baker, 1974, 50). Part of what Baker is trying to do is go back to before the Nazis, and try and salvage all of the pre-Nazi race-realist thought. Reflective of his belief that the atrocities of the Nazis caused an emotional rejection of race-realism which is the proper, scientific view to hold. The final chapter focuses on the middle of the twentieth century; ‘From Kossinna to Hitler.’"
4p2l5t,1,2016-06-20,Me (19M) and my girlfriend (18F) of a year broke up about a month ago and I'm still confused as to what she really wants. I need some advice,Inpachie,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4p2l5t/me_19m_and_my_girlfriend_18f_of_a_year_broke_up/,"So this is going to be a long story so I hope everyone is sitting down... We started dating at the end of my senior year of high school before I left for college in the fall. We were a great couple, inseparable and all over each other for those few months of summer but I had to leave to go to a school that was 2 hours away. From the first date I could tell this girl was special, the 2 or 3 months we had been together had been the happiest times of both of our lives. 

When I left for school I was heartbroken leaving her behind but I didn't want to give up on the relationship so every few weeks I would come and visit her when I could afford to because as everyone who has been to college knows, money gets tight pretty quick. We continued to date all through my first year of college. I took her to her homecoming and her prom, we went on vacation together over spring break and each day I was away we fell more and more in love with each other. After 5 months she decided she was ready to ""do the dirty"" because she knew she lived me and that I was genuine. I was her first and she was mine.

 Some fights along the way did occur and I have a tendency to become angry and say things I don't mean to the people I love only to turn around and realize what I had said and apologize, I'm only human. There'd be times I would say terrible things to her, telling her she was a bad girlfriend and that she needed to treat me better. I even said a few times that we were done because she would be stubborn and not apologize for things I felt she did wrong to me. At any rate I would always go back to her the next day crying and saying how sorry I was and how I never meant any of the things I said. 

Around the 10 month mark (March) I started to feel her slipping away from me, ever so slightly every day she wouldn't be as excited to see me, we wouldn't Skype as much as we used to, we wouldnt talk on the phone at night, she would still say that she loved me and still text me all the time every day but I felt something was off. By the time I was going to take her to prom I sensed something was seriously wrong, I wasn't excited to go to prom with her because I thought she was just going to be mad at me and I felt that she felt obligated to take me because we had been together for almost a year. Because she had been being a jerk to me in the weeks leading up to prom, I was childish and never officially asked her to prom because I knew it would hurt her, a mistake which I wholeheartedly regret.

 Prom ended up being fine but she stoped dancing with me throughout the night and moved on to dancing with her friends, I said it was fine but I would have rather had her be with me all night. After prom we had a talk and we both had planned to break up with each other if prom hadn't gone well. I was upset because she was treating me badly and I didn't know why, and she was upset because I didn't ask her to prom. She suggested a break but I knew if we went on a break it would be a breakup and that's the last thing I waned. I told her I loved her and I didn't want to lose her ever, and she said the same so we agreed to try to work things out.

 Things were good for a few weeks until her friends started to ask her to hang out with them more and she started to have less and less time for me. After college was out for the summer I came back home expecting to spend time with my girlfriend before I left for an internship across the country, she was too busy with school and friends and theater (she likes to do acting and stuff so theater is really big for her). I understood she was busy but I would still pick her up from school and only be able to see her for maybe a few hours each week. On the night of her play performance, the one thing that was taking up most of her time, I brought her flowers and watched as she sang and danced all night. At the end of the play I gave her flowers and told her she was great and how proud I was to be dating such an incredible person. Instead of wanting to spend time with me she decided she wanted to be with her friends and didn't want me there with them. I was hurt and lashed out again saying she was a terrible girlfriend and whatnot. 

The next day I went over to her house early in the morning and her parents let me in (who by the way adore me, her parents love me and want us to get back together as soon as possible). She woke up and talked to me outside saying she was done with our relationship, I begged her not to leave me and she agreed to have a break and insisted she needed space, space she had had for the majority of the year. I knew the break was a breakup and I was torn to shreads, I didn't text her at all for 4 days and on the 4th day I couldn't help myself so I messaged her about the terms of the ""break"" I wasn't sure if she just needed space or wanted to see other people. She said it was just space but soon after she said she wants to just end it. I was devastated. 2 days before our 1 year anniversary and she ended our relationship. Not only did I feel like I was losing my girlfriend, I felt like I was losing my best friend, a family, and a piece of myself all together. 

Her parents were furious, the didn't understand why she was doing this, they said that when she was with me it was the happiest they had ever seen her. They told me I'm always apart of the family and not to be a stranger. I gave her mother a letter to give to her when the time was right telling her to contact me if she missed me. 2 weeks later I left for California to start my 10 week internship.

 Now 3 weeks into my trip I'm sitting here confused. People had told me my ex had been posting things on Twitter about being sad and wanting me back, song lyrics about begging an ex to come back, saying that she knows she needs to move on but is still attached waiting for the impossible to happen. I still miss her so much and if the breakup has shown me anything it's that I am miserable without her. A few nights ago I told her mom to give her the letter which she did but I never heard back from my ex, I decided I couldn't wait any longer because she was starting college on Monday so I had to make a move before she moved on and found someone else. I reached out to her by texting her and wishing her luck in school she responded and thanked me, I then decided to ask her if there was a time I could talk to her on the phone. It was late so she could only talk for a little while. At first we just made small talk she even tried to make me jealous by telling me some guys asked her to hang out but she said she had to shower, I told her she should've gone with them and it could've been fun and she responded with a nervous laugh, but then I told her I needed to talk to her about something and she said she knew what I wanted to talk about but she had to sleep so she said she would text me when she has time and that we'll talk about it later. We hung up but a few seconds later I called her back and poured my heart out to her, I told her I missed her and I wanted her back and that I needed her. She said she couldn't talk about it right then and said we would talk later and we hung up.

 Now today June 20th, I haven't heard from her and im worried sick that I just blew my chances of getting back with her, I can't explain how sad I have been without her and I thought that since she's posting all these sad things on social media about wanting me back it's probably genuine because generally people don't verbalize sad things without being anonymous. I need help/advice on what I should do, I know a lot of it will probably be ""just wait for her"" but it's almost impossible to just wait around. Well anyways that's the story of my life for the past year, even now I sit in Cali thinking about her and how different everything could've been. Please anyone with helpful advice help me, I really need it. 

TL;DR my ex is posting things on social media after a month acting like she misses me so I reached out to her to tell her I want her back and she said she would talk to me later, I need advice on what to do next."
4p2p6a,2,2016-06-20,Graduating College. What now?,TongueMySphincter,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4p2p6a/graduating_college_what_now/,"So as the title says, in graduating college. Right out of the gate I'll be making in the ball park of 75k a year with possible bonuses. I get a 4K relocation package/signing bonus too. 

Thus is going very quickly and I have a lot of questions before I get out of hand spending money I don't really have. 

I haven't ever been used to this type of money as my parents supported our family of 5 on about 45k before taxes(small neighborhood cheap living). It was a struggle to get by sometimes, but we've always managed without too much stress. 

Now I have about 40k in student loans, and about 5k car note left, but other than that, I'm clean of any other debt. 

I have about 2500 in my savings and about 1k in checkings before the 4K signing.

My question is how much should I be looking to spend on rent or basically anything? And should I purchase a home or wait and just rent for a while? 
My vehicle is in great shape, so there's really no reason to get rid of that. I just don't know how to manage money much because I've been living paycheck to paycheck my whole life besides this summer where I'm at a internship. 

Help please! Thank you!"

It's just a test to see if I can write in a WTNV fashion, and manage to make the touhou characters still recognizable within WTNV vague writing style. The premises is Yukari opens a gap to Night Vale and lets the inhabitants in for Nigh Vale's...interesting take on the 4th of July, with the Gensokyians providing danmaku for fireworks which will occur during The Weather segment, as most resolutions in WTNV do (as it's the rough equivalent of something happening prescreen, only to be described later.) This is by no means a finished script.

This is purely a test, I'm all for suggestions for events to happen with specific girls, how to write in a more Nightvaleian way, any ideas to improve. Feel free to ask questions and give suggestions.


*This is Intern Michael here. I've only been at the station for a few days now, but Station Management has told me to take over for your usual host Cecil for today. They would not tell me why Cecil could not do his job or today, nor would they let me attempt to call him on his home phone. I would have questioned them further, but looking directly at Station Management makes me feel very uneasy, and I think my brain has hidden the memories of exactly what I saw when I opened their door. Everytime I attempt to remember, my head throbs quite painfully, OOOFF! And my left arm punches me in the in the gut.

Listeners, I have a very important announcement to make. The city council has informed me; via a small, dead-eyed child messenger, dressed in an adorable red, white, and blue tuxedo, that our little town will be host a few guests who will be providing some, in their words, ""Unbelievably Fantastic"" fireworks for Fourth of July Barbeque today.  

There...there is a second child...this one wearing a green and black dress with a yellow jacket and a hat. She has intricately woven blue...tubes connecting to a large, blue eye locate on her ches-...Listeners… What...what was I just talking about? I...I swear I was focusing on something that was in the hallway and break room I can see through my office window.

As with this most American of celebrations, we will have volunteers bravely go out into the desert that surrounds us, and hunt with old fashioned rifles and cannons; much like how our ancestors hunted and killed the british who tried to invade our newly discovered homeland. They will then come back with meat from the local wildlife for us to cook and eat during the festival. We will not be told exactly what the meat is, or what animals it came from, but we are assured that it will be completely safe for consumption.

Listeners, I've just been informed that there is a strange black orb, about 5 feet in diameter, floating about a foot off the ground, wandering around town. Nobody knows where it came from, nor what it's doing or what it wants. It occasionally let's out occasional ""ouch""-es as it runs into various objects. Those who have touched the orb, state their hands will pass into it, and feels very, very cold. One caller stated that the orb passed over them, and it was quite refreshing. Like being under a nice shady tree, but without the imminent threat of being swallowed by the darkness that usually accompanies the shade. Another told me it bit off their hand. Fortunately, they were able to stop getting any further injuries by running into Dark Owl Records. The black orb ran into the door a few times before it went away. More on this story as it develops.

John Peters, you know, the farmer, has promised to bring an extra large batch of his imaginary corn for corn on the cob, and for making fresh popcorn. He says we can have the corn ""smoked, boiled, grilled, raw, and even deep fried if that's your thing"". I prefer my corn on the cob, freshly grilled, and seasoned with some of Big Rico's special seasoning that he used to use on their pizza's before the ban on wheat and wheat-by-products was instituted.

There has been some ruckus at the Night Vale Public Library. The Sheriff's Secret Police report that glowing stars were seen entering the building, the librarians were heard screaming their unholy hunting cry for a few minutes. Then, a large, rainbow colored beam was seen, shooting out of the northern side of the library's upper story windows, and chimneys. Books and pages flying out of the new holes while the stars were spotted leaving, soaring away into the sky towards that blue mass above us we call the sky. Thankfully, as Librarians cannot fly through the gates we placed on the Library’s chimneys, they are still contained in the library, and the wrought iron bars that were installed on the windows have also held up despite the reinforced glass' failure.

Listeners... I've just been told that it is...snowing in Night Vale. The snow is falling near the old abandoned ruins that are definitely not the remains of the failed seaside boardwalk that was a collective hallucination by our entire town. The snow is melting very quickly, but it is becoming an issue due to the snow melting and forming puddles that are then freezing, and melting...and freezing...aaand melting again. While we don't know who, or what is causing it. Its seems to be a rather futile effort, even though it is fill up the old, long ago dried up lake that the helicopters usually tell us to avoid. So if you feel like swimming today, and don't mind a minor risk of frostbite, head down to the old, dried out lake. Which is now slowly filling up to become a perfectly normal lake.

The girl from before is back, the one who I forgot about the moment she was out of my eyesight. She appears to be singing and dancing, I do not know what she’s singing, but she certainly seems to be enjoying herself. Erm...I feel this is normally the part where Cecil would tell the intern to go get her, but as Cecil is absent and I am taking his place, I guess I’ll just have to let her wander around, as I‘m not supposed to leave the booth for any reason

Erm..Listeners...there is a...hole in front of me. And it has eyes..so..so many eyes staring back at me. It's about 5 feet wide, and a foot or so tall. If I tilt my head to look around it, it appears to have no depth, but it does have a ""back"" side. which has the same, infinitely deep appearance. More on this...when something happens. WhiIe I investigate this strange hole I take you to, the weather.

The black orb that was floating and occasionally biting people seems to have wandered over to the perpetually freezing and thawing lake. The swarm of insects from earlier also have congregated there

Listeners, a hand has emerged from the hole, It appears to be quite slender, and feminine, wearing a white opera glove. It's also holding out a note, written in what I believe to be some unfamiliar langua-...erm, the symbols have now turned into letters,magically morphing from their foreign nature to more familiar symbols. The kind we all recognise as words with meaning that is our english language. It's much more legible now. Thank you...whatever mysterious force that has translated this letter for me. The letter reads ""Don't worry about today's strange incidents, most will be resolved after the fireworks show."" I'm not sure what that means, as there are many strange occurrences daily her in our little own,and they usually do resolve themselves anyway, so we don't worry about them too much.*"
4p2rph,0,2016-06-21,Internship advice: How to get in touch with recruiters before the fall career fairs?,CrystalShimmerFluff,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/4p2rph/internship_advice_how_to_get_in_touch_with/,"Background: I'm going to be abroad in Central America this fall, will be a Junior and planning to graduate in 4 years with 150 credits. Trying to get a Summer 2017 internship. GPA is a 3.7, hoping for audit in big4 or any top 10. In the Seattle Area.

Since I will be abroad during career fairs and all that, I'm hoping I can get in contact with recruiters early to see if I can do Skype interviews or some interviews this summer. I've been working with an old professor who has sent my info to recruiters that he has a relationship with, and I've been able to set up office visits and interviews with those firms. However, I've only talked to 5 firms this way (only 2 are b4) and I'm trying to apply to a few more (side question- how many would you recommend applying for?). Everyone keeps telling me I need to contact them early, but I'm just realizing I'm not sure how to do that. How do I get the contact info for other firms or recruiters? And should I be attaching resumes at this point?

Thanks so much!"

Little about me, I'm a computer science major currently working as an intern. I currently live in Eastern US, in PA.

Couple of interesting things about me are that Im a martial artist and I know a ton of useless trivia. Seriously. If you love useless trivia I am your guy. Heres a sample, King of Prussia in PA is named after an Inn called the King of Prussia in that existed during the Revolution. The inn was named possibly to entice business from the British who happened to have a lot of German and Prussian soldiers. Or it might have been named in reference of Ben Franklins Pro-America satirical essay called ""An Edict of the King of Prussia"". So there you go. If that kinda stuff interests you I'm full of it.

If you want, send me a message with your name and a couple of interesting things about yourself and Ill send you my kik name or iMessage name, whichever you prefer."

Thank you for the people who have commented, it's really helpful as none of us have dealt with a situation like this.

Throwaway because of redditors in my life.

Tonight my sister 'Mandy' was yelling at her husband 'Nevin' over the phone begging him to come back. My parents [60 f/m] were watching my niece 'Mia' downstairs. Something like this happens every few months, and I was playing Overwatch, so I didn't think anything of it until I heard Mandy screaming sounds I've never heard before. I went to check on her and found her in her room sitting on her floor and crying. 

I'm not really close to her anymore (we had a falling out when I tried get Nevin help when he threatened to kill himself) but I hugged her and immediately could tell she was on something. After asking her what was wrong and if she had taken anything, then promising not to call 911 because she was afraid she'd lose her nursing license she said, 'Yup, heroin."" She started in the beginning of the year and blamed Nevin for pressuring her to try it. Nevin has been struggling with addiction since Mandy was pregnant with Mia two years ago. She mentioned that she took more than usual this time because she's pregnant again and hates her life. She also blamed my parents for being so judgmental of her earlier today when she left to go out. Her words were slurring and I didn't really understand most of it. 

With a little persuasion she showed me where she kept the rest of the stuff, so now I have a box full of new and used syringes, some 'bundles', and a tourniquet. She gets the medical supplies from her workplace, gives Nevin money, and he brings it home. I don't know how to dispose of these things.

Nevin then came back and joined us in her room, and admitted to still using. (It was kind of obvious, he loses a lot of weight when he relapses and acts super weird.) He blamed Mandy for starting even though he said it'd ruin her life. They went on to blame each other and I couldn't take it any more.

I got really angry at them and said that if I ever see them using at home, or notice them being high again that I'm calling the police, his parents, and my parents. Nevin subsequently yelled at Mandy for ""telling someone who would narc to the police"", asked me if I was fucking serious, if I knew that they'd take Mia away from them, and that I'd be ruining their lives. It must have bothered him when I said it wouldn't be the worst thing since my parents and I have to babysit Mia even when he's around, because he stormed off and left. 

I just checked on Mandy, she's alive, certainly not as weird as before. Mia is sleeping.

My home situation is this: 
We all live together. My Mom takes care of Mia most of the time, Dad works five days a week, Mandy is a part-time nurse, Nevin is unemployed and sometimes stays here. Sometimes Mandy and Nevin will take Mia on outings. My parents are old fashioned and somewhat religious/conservative, but I can usually talk to them about things if I have to. None of us can talk to Mandy or Nevin much as they get really defensive/argumentative, so we've just kind of backed off. They argue with each other a lot, and everyone at home can hear it. I avoid being home but watch Mia when no one else can. 

I'm going across the country for an internship in a month and then transferring to a university three hours away from home in the fall. I desperately want to get away from this mess for my own sake but now I'm really worried for Mia.

Mandy and Nevin are kind of bad parents to begin with. Even when Mandy isn't at work, she hangs out in her room all the time playing COD or leaves without telling anyone and Mia wanders the house, so my Mom watches her anyway. Same thing happens when Nevin is here. They are really controlling of each other and when they're together they become way worse. I know they both suffer from depression, and I suspect more than that, but I don't think that's an excuse to neglect Mia as much as they do. She deserves better and I want her to grow up to be happy and healthy.

Mandy asked me not to tell anyone, but I know that I need to tell my parents about Mandy using and Nevin using, I just don't know how. Nevin lives with his parents and I talked with them when he was suicidal a couple of months ago, should they be informed?

Is there a way I can get Mandy help without her fearing losing her license? How can I support my sister through an abortion if she wants one?

My Mom is the one usually taking care of her, but Mia's safety comes first. I don't trust Mandy or Nevin with Mia. Should I call CPS? 

I feel sick to my stomach. I know there is a lot I might be leaving out but I am so overwhelmed and tired. 

Any advice or input is appreciated and needed. I'll be checking this post throughout the night/morning if I can't get any sleep.

**TL;DR;** Found out sister is using drugs, BIL is using again, which really sucks for my 2 y.o. niece and my parents. Sister also pregnant, help.

4p4mr9,3,2016-06-21,[Decision] First Automatic: Montblanc Timewalker or TAG Heuer Aquaracer,thepasquinadist,Watches,https://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/4p4mr9/decision_first_automatic_montblanc_timewalker_or/,"After trying on a bunch of watches at ADs, I've narrowed down my options to these two watches, but I'm having trouble deciding between them. Any inputs would be much appreciated. 

TAG Heuer Aquaracer ($1475): http://www.jomashop.com/tag-heuer-watch-way211b-fc6363.html

Thoughts:

 * Ceramic bezel will retain color for a long time and won't scratch easily. Kinda wish the blue color was either deeper or brighter but.

* The nylon strap is so good. So good. 
 
* Fits nicely and feels solid on the hand, is chunkier than the Montblanc but I like the thickness.
 
* Feels more durable than the Montblanc.



Montblanc Timewalker Automatic ($1549): http://www.jomashop.com/montblanc-watch-113877.html

Thoughts:

 * Thin and really sleek.

 * LOVE the oversized numerals. They look great.

 * Seemed a bit noisier than the TAG.

 * The thin profile is nice but also makes me wonder whether it'll be as durable as the TAG.

 * Leather strap is pretty nice. Almost as nice as the TAG's nylon.
 
 * Dressier than the TAG. Good because I'm a college freshman who won't be able to buy another nice watch for the next few years so a dressy watch would do well for internships. Bad because dressy watches might seem out of place at college.
 
 * 200M water resistance which is pretty nice for a thin watch. Also pretty much negates TAG's advantage with 300M resistance.

Both watches use ETA movements (TAG might use Stellita) and are easy to get serviced. I'll be buying from Jomashop. 

I'd love to get your opinions on which watch is a better buy. Thanks guys.



EDIT:

I did try on some Longines watches too. I disliked the Hydroconquest because of how busy the dial is and the Master Collection chronograph (only chronograph not moonphase) was stunning (Bonus points for display caseback) but $200 out of my price range. I didn't really like anything from Oris, Sinn or Hamilton."

4p4zha,2,2016-06-21,"I [20 F] suffer from strong social anxiety, which in turn severely hurts my relationships with my co-workers and classmates.",lailajo,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4p4zha/i_20_f_suffer_from_strong_social_anxiety_which_in/,"I've struggled with severe social anxiety throughout most of my youth (think: hate getting up to go to the bathroom because I think people would stare, hate going places where I don't know at least a few people, too scared to talk to people even if they try to talk to me, turn people down to hang out if its one-on-one). My social anxiety has only gotten worse once I entered college and entered the workforce since I was constantly put in situations where I didn't know anyone.

I really want to be more extroverted because I really enjoy going out and making new friends and being social (I guess more specifically, being social with people I already know, but I would like to make more friends to hang out with too). Unfortunately, my social anxiety causes me to tense up around people I don't know, so the words I want to say dry up in my mouth and I always end up turning down people I don't know very well if they ask me to do something because I'm afraid of one-on-one situations.

I have a few some-what close friends in college, but I would like to be closer to them and make new friends as well. The few times I have tried to put myself out there and ask people to hang out have not ended very well because I feel like the friend groups are already somewhat cemented, so people usually aren't very willing to hang out with me outside of classes or clubs (breaking the barrier from classmates/ aquantances to actual friends). It's kind of hard for me to put myself out there as well because I am very close to my boyfriend (21 M, 2 years), so he is my default person to go to if I want to try doing something new because I am so comfortable around him.

The reason why I'm posting this now is because I just started a new full-time internship, and my new team is super friendly and inviting. Unfortunately, because I'm super shy and socially-anxious, I often stay quiet and never know what to say to them in group and one-on-one settings. I really want to get to know them better and hopefully be friends, but my anxiety makes me incredibly nervous and scared to approach them first to start a conversation. I'm always scared that I'll say the wrong thing, that I'm not being interesting, that they don't want to talk to me, etc.

Do you guys have any tips or advice on how to get over this fear and become better at making friends? Any tips on how to break down that initial barrier to begin to feel comfortable around each other and put yourself out there would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!
   
**tl;dr**: I am extremely socially anxious, so while I really want to get to know people and make new friends, my fear always leads me to stay quiet in conversations and to turn people down when people ask me to do something."

Advice?",collegegradtrp,asktrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/4p5t4a/recently_graduated_college_but_have_no_job_hows/,"So I graduated from a top private university with an econ major just a month ago, but am stuck living with my parents in my suburban hometown with no job. Living with conservative Asian parents as a college grad fucking blows, to say the least. Right now, I'm reevaluating my plan to get a job and live on my own, and am wondering if I could get some input. 

For the past month, I've been trying to keep myself busy and be as productive as possible. I apply to jobs on my school's job board, and have had a bunch of phone interviews lately, all of which led to nowhere. I got flown out for a final round interview a couple days ago, and am waiting on the response for that. I also hit up some of my contacts from my school/past internships asking for career advice and whether they know of any positions open for me -- a lot of their advice has been helpful, but they have not been able to hook me up with an actual job so far. On the side, I have been learning some programming and technical stuff (Python, Excel) to build up some skills and make me more marketable as an employee. I usually go to the library for a couple hours every day to study up on programming as well as apply to jobs. 

Outside of career-related stuff, I have been meditating and lifting every morning. In addition, I used Tinder during my first few weeks back, and met a couple girls that way. I have been getting no matches recently, and already have a FWB who comes over once a week, so I've decided to stop worrying about girls and direct 100% of my focus on my body and getting a job. At the same time, I have been making a lot of progress with my game recently, and don't want to see it atrophy away completely due to my lack of social life. In terms of friends, I only have 2-3 friends who I keep in contact with in my area, and I usually just meet up with them a couple times a week just to catch up. 

Overall, how would you say my ""game plan"" is so far? Are there any things I could do differently to make better use of my time as an unemployed college grad? I've really been feeling lost and hopeless recently, and could use some advice. "

Help?",yaboiMarcus,sex,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/4p6mkx/tinder_hookup_advice_great_connectionhookup_now/,"So, this is gonna be longer than I want it to be, but I want to provide as much detail so that you guys might be able to help me make sense of it.

I broke up with my girlfriend of more than five years at the beginning of May and it's been since before then that I've had sex. After then, I graduated, saw my friends off, and moved back home. Needless to say, I've been quite lonely.

In a spur of the moment decision, I downloaded Tinder. Messed around with it for a while, had some conversations that went nowhere, and so on. Last Thursday, a girl I'd matched with finally responded to something I sent earlier in the week. We get to talking and she basically asks if I want to ""smoke and cuddle"" with her at her place. I told her that I'm spent, but she still wants me to come over. Before I leave, she tells me that she's only in town for another week or so for her internship, but even still, she's not terribly far from where I live.

Make it to her place with a 12 pack of beer to fill our gap of inebriation and we start chatting it up. I'm a bit awkward, so I don't know what to expect. A few beers later, she and I are making out in her bed to the soulful musings of Bob Ross on Netflix.

Things are going great, I'm going down on her, and she's seemingly really liking it. In between, she's lifting me up to kiss me and then she sends me back under. Eventually, she says she wants me in her and so we move towards the main event.

Unfortunately, and I'm not trying to make excuses, I have some difficulty getting hard. Between being a little drunk, on some medication that gives me this kind of trouble (ran into it on more than one occasion with my ex), and the fact that I'm pretty nervous (it's been some time since I had sex, and definitely not with anyone this attractive), I apologize and tell her that I don't think I can do it. She smiles, kisses me a lot, and says that it's okay. We cuddle and before too long, we're asleep.

I leave early the next morning because she has to go to her internship, but before I leave, she asks if I wanna come back over that night. I don't remember exactly what I said, but probably something along the lines of ""absolutely"" with a stupid-ass smile on my face.

We're texting throughout the day, and after she passes out for a while after dinner, she frantically texts me apologizing. For accuracy, I'll just provide what was exchanged.

Me: Did you still wanna hang out or nah? (11:38 PM) 
Her: I wasn't blowing you off I swear! I was sleeping off my fettuccine and never woke up again. (1:01 AM) 
Her: That was supposed to be an hour nap... D: (1:02 AM) 
Her: If you're awake and bored, you have an open invitation. (1:04 AM) 
Me: Haha, you're okay. Honestly, I had to do a bit of the same after my quesadilla. (1:05 AM)
Her: Okay, thank you for understanding. Haha (1:07 AM) 
Her: I also did not obtain much rest last night. It's like someone was here keeping me up. Hahaha (1:08 AM) 
Me: Oh, man. That sounds like a terrible problem to have ;) (1:11 AM) 
Her: I know it's lat now, but would you like to come over? (1:14 AM) 
Me: Yeah. That'd be nice. Cool if I make my way over now? (1:16 AM) 
Her: Yes, please come over. (1:17 AM)

So, I drive over, we get to work immediately, but I still have problems staying hard. We were able to get to the point where I was inside her, but it only lasted for a few seconds, and I started to feel terrible and embarrassed. She could tell something was wrong but didn't seem mad at all. She leaned down to me, whispered that it was okay and asked if I wanted a massage. I said yes and she proceeded to give me one of the best massages I've ever had. We made out for a while more and then eventually fell asleep.

We messed around some more and had coffee the next morning, but around noon, we left each other to their day with the (seemingly shared) expectation that we'd meet up later on that night. A few sporadic texts later, and it doesn't seem like anything's gonna happen, which is fine, I think. I start day drinking, and before too long, I decide I'm not going anywhere.

Around 11:40 PM that night, I text her if she wanted to get brunch the next morning. We had talked about some decent sushi and pizza places in the area (which wasn't exactly brunch), but I wanted to see if she wanted to do something like that. No response.

A short time and many beers later, I text her again. Just before 1:30 AM, I ask if she'd like to come to my place since I was too drunk to drive. Nothing terrible, but completely honest. Again, no response.

The next day (Sunday), I shoot her another text mid-afternoon asking what's up, and still, all I get is radio silence. I'm worried, obviously, that I might have done or said something wrong. Was brunch a bad move to suggest? Was my bed performance more of an issue than she made it out to be? With her leaving in a few days, did she want to avoid any further interaction? I don't know.

So yesterday, I send her a follow-up text saying: ""Hey [name], I'm sorry if what I said earlier made you uncomfortable in any way. That definitely wasn't my intention. I've had a lot of fun with you and would like to hang out some more before you leave if you'd be up for it. Either way, I hope you're having a good day and are having fun out in the dirt."" (she's doing an archeology internship)

So, here I am, without any sort of response. I know I shouldn't let it be bothering me so much, but I just felt a real attraction to her. I don't know if it's because I've been so lonely or just something else, but I'm really beating myself up about it, since the only thing I can think of is that I messed it up.

If you guys can offer any sort of advice or your take on the situation, I'd really appreciate it. Sorry for being so overlong with all of this and I apologize if my formatting is shit. I'm kinda new to posting here."
4p6so6,2,2016-06-21,3 years out of college feels like I blew my chance big time and have huge regrets about decisions made to slow down due to sports injuries,shoulda_couldawoulda,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/4p6so6/3_years_out_of_college_feels_like_i_blew_my/,"Here's my story of immense regret - I swear this feeling has been KILLING me;

I got to college in 2009 and was accepted to a top 5 accounting business school.  My parents ALWAYS made sure that I made academics a priority, and I am glad.  My health&amp;fitness, and social life suffered through high school, but when I got to college, I did the right things to improve in these areas and became a very happy camper.  I was planning to be a licensed CPA by 2014 and my social circle, network, and self-esteem were building very nicely.  

HOWEVER, just like a train that hit outta no where, life kicked my ass.  During my junior year, the company I interned for the last summer asked me back for a 2nd term (thinking I had this tied up), and everything was good.  However, I got mixed up with a bad seed in my family (my uncle) who tried to micro-manage where I was headed and what I was doing.  Down to drinking and smoking habits, creative habits (he completely shamed and humiliated me for creating rap/hip-hop music in my free time), trying to fuck with how I saw my friends and how I interacted with people, and also how I viewed exercise.  Obviously, no one has any power over any of those things if you don't let them, but he did this stuff in a very snake-like way and subtly I started a downward spiral.  By the time my second internship arrived, I was in bad shape mentally and emotionally and I had no idea how.  This was also the first year out of dorm life.  I was struggling bad.  Also, I messed up with a few relationships and felt like a complete moron.  Goodbye to the company basically (I was no where near as sharp as I was the first one), and because of some very radical views I was expressing socially, it felt like my reputation took a huge dive.  

But if that weren't bad enough, the beginning of my senior year, I got hit with a CRIPPLING shoulder injury when I stupidly played football with no pads.  It was a practice for a big event among 4 big schools in the area and I ended up sidelining myself big time.  The pain was just so bad this was the first time in my life I said, ""okay, God, just put me out of my misery.""  I went to the doctor and it turns out structurally it was only a partial dislocation, but from then on my nerves just never felt right.  And guess who else had a similar thing happen (my uncle).  Just my luck.  By now I started aggressively avoiding this man and his toxicity.  

Then I made a decision out of the blue to, instead of taking a semester off to heal my injury, to switch the major that I had planned on finishing from the start to something that felt like it would have been easier to finish, which is marketing.  Now, I ended up finishing, but that degree doesn't really mean shit compared with the level of prestige the accounting degree would have from this university.  Then, socially, I became a ghost because I literally couldn't go out and have a good time with the people I had been for 2-3 years prior.

I fell into depression and here I am, still coping.  I am in a labor/stock job that pays $13.50/hr (my marketing degree is lying in waste), still feeling the effects of past injuries, and just never felt the same outgoing, crowd-loving dude I became socially back before the injury and the run-in with the devil (metaphor, but probably true).  

What it comes down to is the feeling of NOT BEING IN CONTROL of my own mind, body, and decisions for such a long time that it became a bad habit.  Now, I am getting a grip again on my health, my fitness, ACTIVELY moving through old injuries (ankles, shoulder, and jaw) to restore mobility, flexibility, and functional strength, and have been getting back out there when I can and feel up to it.  But I am making way less money than I could be, I am spending way less quality time with people that matter to me than I could be, I'm single when I am a good looking fun loving, healthy funny interesting guy, and am just feeling like complete garbage (not overall but just with this one huge regretful feeling).

I don't know what else to say.  Feels shitty to have someone you trusted completely shit on your life goals and dreams, and feels so shitty to feel like an injury and pain rule your life.

I am a computer science student and I just got an internship with a company that develops apps for android. I'm beyond excited to start work next week, and I was thinking of getting a new phone because currently I have an LG G3-Vigor. The problem is that it's a phone I've had for a while and as you all know phone USB ports fall to shit sooner or later, and mine now randomly disconnects sometimes while testing apps.

The internship is a paid one, and I've decided that since I'll have some extra cash I want to get a better phone for testing and running apps. Given my current situation I'd be willing to pay about $350 for a phone that it will be my job to use. I may or may not get a deal on the phone depending on what my contract says (AT&amp;T). I've had Samsung and LG phones in the past but I have no particular loyalties to either brand. Most of all, I want the phone to be able to run quickly so I can work faster and have enough storage for my projects.

I think that's a good steady drop! I really changed my frame of mind from quick results to viewing this as a lifelong effort. 10 weeks ago -- I would have never considered starting the 5k to 10k program but now I realize I need to continue on this journey.

I'm not at 5k yet, but I can run 35 minutes and yesterday I ran 2.5 miles without stopping -- could have continued but I think being gradual will be better in the long run.

I have a 5k event on saturday -- people are so supportive and even my doctor said I would probably run most of the way because of the added energy from all the other runners. 

Was concerned about eating -- I usually run before I eat since I do my runs at around 6am. His intern suggested I eat an hour before something light like toast and peanut butter. Was thinking about one of those Belvita things. 

I'm continually amazed at the lessening of effort for casual walking -- i'm finding that I'm parking further from buildings and not worrying about being tired. 

Have a great day everyone!"

4p8hy8,1,2016-06-21,"GF(28) left me calling me (23) ""the absolutely craziest person she ever saw, including movies""",yarrakhasan31,saneorpsycho,https://www.reddit.com/r/saneorpsycho/comments/4p8hy8/gf28_left_me_calling_me_23_the_absolutely/,"Hello people, sorry that this might be a long one but I wanted to include everything for a healthy judgment so that's why.

I was going through a freshhhh breakup. Then my then-future gf got transferred to my uni class, she sat in the back corner speaking to nobody, I went, we spoke, we hit it off, she added me on facebook, and after I was like ""nobody will love me or even fuck me ever again :( "" she said ""actually I'd fuck you right now if I didn't have a bf"" (she was in a 4 year relationship with this guy, kinda engaged, living together for 3 years). in time, she encouraged me to ignore her bf saying ""we are just roommate practically, he doesn't even see me naked, I hate him so much"". we talked about love and sex stuff so much. and believe me she led me on because I was reluctant to hit on someone else's gf. anyhow, the night I went away for a month to do some internship, she comes over, we fuck (wasn't good at all), she is disappointed, she goes. after I came back to the town, we speak more again, and the same thing, she comes to my house, we fuck, wasn't good at all, she is disappointed, she goes away, and starts sharing these pics of hers with her current bf, I get pissed because I feel led on and cheated, I cut her loose, 3 months later she adds me and claims that she is single and ready to mingle, we fuck all summer (awesome sex this time), go out hand in hand, practically dating. suddenly, she met some guy online and stopped answering my texts and eventually told me that she doesn't want to see me anymore in this way, I cut contact with her, then I lose my house and she suddenly opens her house to me and I move in and suddenly we are together again AND moved in. everything is awesome, love is in the air. she stops speaking to the other guy altogether. we fuck we share everything. but our major is a really really really heavy one and it took a toll on uus, she was stressed and edgy all the time (we are talking about the end of 2013 by the way and she is still stressed and edgy. I can't blame our major or myself for it anymore), I take it as much as I can but I snap too once when she included my grandmother into her insults. then she tells me that she took a plane and went 3000 kilometers to the other guy and fucked him. later, she says that ""I just said that to make you angry"". yet the trust is so gone. but I suck up as I love her. weeks later, she is outside, her dog goes into her wardrobe and starts peeing, I try to take him out, he bites my arm ferociously and doesn't let go and with the heat of the moment I throw the dog away and he hits the wall and drops down like a bag, passing right then and there. my girlfriend comes home to see me giving mouth-to-nose, yells at me, sits down and watches me, as I try my best, then I take it to a vet but nothing the vet could do, so I go bury it. I come back home, she throws knives at me, kicking me out of her house. I do. I beg to come back and talk. she accepts. we come back together. she swears not to talk about the dog incident or hold it over my head ever again. yet even when I drop a pen she gets pissed and says she hates me for killing her dog. I can't take it anymore, decide to transfer to another country, go through interviews and huge paperwork processes, she kicks me out again, I go to the airport to sleep there as I have nowhere to sleep, after some days there my flight time comes and I finally go to my ""new home"", she calls me as soon as I land and says she wants me to come back home and she loves me and she'll kill herself and she'll never do such bad things or say these ever again and she'll buy my plain ticket back home et cetera. she makes me cry at the airport for hours and I get the ticket and just come back to her. everything is perfect for another 6 months. then suddenly the police busts her in a really shitty way (they treated her like a murderer or something) for smoking MJ and forces her to attend a weekly 6 month therapy. then her mood swings start, constant depression, random fights, even going as far to say out of the blue ""I hate your breathing, I wish you stopped breathing altogether"". the same police busts me too so I start doing the therapy too (in the meantime having to pass the hardest exam of my life which required constant studying for months) but I didn't let it get to me. btw both of us still continued MJ as it was needed for our studies. then one day, she is ""sad"" again (and believe me, I loved her and seeing her like that killed me and every day I asked her what is bothering her or is there anything I or anybody can do, and I offered everythingggggggg you can think of to her, taking her to a therapy, to her parents, to a vacation. I even said that I can go and come back or just go forever if that's what she wants. for. 4. years.) anyhow she starts attacking me wildly, rips my clothes, breaks my phone, and then attacks me with a knife so I push her (hit/push. not a punch. not a slap. not a swing), she starts yelling that I'm killing her so I take her mouth and close it and beg her not to yell because I will go anyways, but she kicks me and yells more, and police comes in the middle of the night and I am forced to leave et cetera et cetera. and after that day, she starts telling everyone and herself that I'm an abusive bf who ""beats"" her (as in it happened many times before and it's a regular thing). shit gets worse because of this, we have more fights for no reason, she says she doesn't love or trust me but is forced to stay with me, then she says she loves me, then she says she hates me, this vicious cycle. and then a big fight happens again that resembles the previous big one with the physicality of it (actually she got tipped off by the fact that I scored higher than her in some fucking exam that nobody even cares about.. oh I forgot to tell, she kicked me out 5 times, all before my major exams, had to study under the street lamp shivering in 0 degrees. I know I would really never do this to her), and then police shit happens, I get kicked out, we say sorry, we reconcile, but still, whatever I say, she downright takes it wrong and starts yelling at me. one day I asked if she wanted a Marlboro or Camel (as I did all her shopping, cooking, cleaning, any errands you can think of, I even went to exams under her name and passed for her), and she starts yelling that I don't know what she likes. I suck up. then the summer comes, things all seem really good (of course, no sex for months at this point), I go to my parents, she goes to his, and then she suddenly is so distant to me on the phone and then she suddenly says something horrible about my grandmother as I was crying over her and I lose it due to her insensitiveness and she USES THIS EXCUSE to break up with me over the phone. I beg her to talk. she doesn't. blocks me from everywhere. all summer I'm dead, crying, suicidal, writing long e-mails to her begging and telling how I miss her and love her and will change myself. she says she fucked 3 guys already that summer and if I'm okay with this, we can try. I (funnily am suicidal since the very first day I met her, and tried to carry it out a lot of times only to see that my subconscious is too much of a pussy to every carry it out) say that I am ready to bury the hatchet, and forget about the past and all of it. she says okay. some good months follow. then her studies get harder and she starts playing this LoL game, and meets this guy from there that is from our school. they start playing A LOT. like 10 times a day. and when they don't play, they speak. she'd go out telling me she will meet him. all during this time I didn't comment on this situation or spied around even. then one day he hurts his hand (super minor accident), my gf rushes to him and takes him to a hospital and shares a picture on his wall of his hand. at this point I'm feeling some things are going hella wrong. then one day, I see on her phone a message that she has sent to him saying ""my love &lt;3 "". I lose it, she calls me a jealous freak and says that she calls everyone that way and if she did this it's because she is distant from me because I BEAT HER (again with the present tense). big fight, she attacks me again, and as whenever she attacks me she claims I have beaten her because I push her away and protect myself (yet when I beg her to come back or when we reconcile I always said sorry for the pains I've caused her especially for the physical ones whereas she didn't say sorry once. what physical ones?). she keeps saying I beat her. in her brain she has this image of me beating her that haunts her forever but I haven't even touched her except for the mouth holding when she screams (she fucking screams bloody murder EACH TIME WE HAVE A FIGHT). and she makes me say things like ""if I really did beat you, you'd be bone-dust right now"" just to prove that I wasn't ""beating"" her. all these happen, and I notice that she goes now, she doesn't kick me out anymore. she goes but lies before going saying ""I'll come back in an hour, don't worry, just going to my friend to get some notes"", and she doesn't come for a week. she says she misses me, reconciliation, but no sex, no happiness anymore, even though I try, I hug her kiss her look into her eyes call her the prettiest thing that's ever happened to me. she is like ""meh"". then one day I see on her phone a message from BAE?!? (the ""LoL"" guy) saying ""sweetie are you okay? &lt;3"", I lose it, I take her phone and as I was about to look at other messages she starts screaming bloody murder again, attacks me with a bigass knife, tells me that if I open the messages she'll never ever ever be with me, I cry and ask for some explanation but all she does is blackmail me by saying she will leave. I really don't want her to leave. or be mean to me. I want to good old times back, she knows, she knows it's the most painful thing in the world to see her go, she uses it like this. anyhow I cry so much, then she cries, then she says ""propose to me right now and I'll say yes"", I tell her she's pumped with adrenalin of the fight and we should decide on it with our wits about us. she says okay. she promises to change herself and stop this shit with this LoL guy (btw did I mention that the LoL guy is in our school too, and my gf ditched me for a year and went alone to any social event or any time that she can be seen with me outside and we aren't even facebook friends. then I found pictures of her hugging this LoL guy intimately at events where she went ""alone"". people stop believing in the fact that she is my gf and people start thinking they are together. I mean wow) and promised that nothing happened and she told me that I HAVE TO TRUST HER (meaning ""don't check my filthy disgusting messages). we were okay. then one day (oh she didn't allow me to have FEMALE FACEBOOK FRIENDS, OR AN INSTAGRAM PROFILE, SAYING THAT I'M A GUY AND I CHEAT AND SHE IS A GIRL WHO IS IN CONTROL SO SHE DOESN'T CHEAT btw), she is soooooo into her cell phone, literally hiding it from my sight, when I hug her she says ""you are spying on me"". it disgusts me, I go secretly log into her instagram account and BAM. there are pictures of the LoL guy making dragons with a hookah captioned you make me smile #my dragon, there is pic of them hugging again at a social event I was banned from by my gf, and another picture of just my gf saying ""I always have, I always do, I always will"" and another one just saying ""my dragon, he knows ;) "". I see these, I flip. I totally flip. oh and she told me that she invited him over to our house one night I had to be out of town. she says ""I could hide it but I told you the truth"" but this is just saying ""heheh now that he is my ""friend"" he can come spend time with me alone at night, I mean I told you he came, I'm not hiding anything, you are the sick freak for thinking of stuff"". 

after all these, she still says I'm a sick jealous freak AND she felt distant from me BECAUSE I beat her (?!?!) so she had every right, but after years of same shit over and over with different guys involved, I lose it, tell her that she is cheating on me the way she cheated on her ex-bf with me, everything is the same as those times except I'm the cuckold party this time, everybody calls me the pimp of the town, what reason can be there for calling him your love your bae your sweetie and your dragon publicly and inviting him over at night to our house when I'm not there, you jump from lap to lap, et cetera, you can imagine my heartbreak. then I tell her I won't let them be together even if that's the last thing I do in this world. then she looks calm, says she needs to go buy cigarettes, I say ""but you told this kind of lies many times, you will never come back"", she says ""I promise over my parents' graves"", she goes, blocks me on every messaging application, not coming back, making me cry and running around trying to find something, anything to sooth my pain. 

today I receive a message saying that ""she might allow me to talk to her in 2 weeks maybe"". then I see a new pic on her instagram in a house (not a hotel room), I ask her whose house it is, she says she won't tell me, I ask what happened with this LoL guy, she says she won't tell me, unless I accept the 2 week thing. I say okay, she says she hates me. I don't reply, I go, for the first time, write to the LoL guy (whom I saw IRL before and I was really fucking nice to him thinking he is my gf's friend.) asking to speak on facebook, not even in real life. he doesn't answer, I say it's so important and I beg him to answer. he doesn't. then I start saying things like ""how can you do this with a girl who is committed, she just pitied you, what the fuck have you done with her, what are all these sweeties hearts baes, what did I do to you you honorless fuck that you do this to me, how? we broke up thanks to you so enjoy her, you killed me you son of a bitch"" et cetera. then the son of a bitch LoL guy says ""nothing happened leave me out of your drama I have important things to do bye"". then I receive a message from my ex saying ""you did it finally, didn't you?"". I still haven't opened that message.

so so so sorry for the long post but I wanted to tell everything from the beginning that led up to now because sorta like HIMYM, it's all connected. the last things she said to me basically were that I'm a psychopath, a crazy mentally ill mad disgusting person who should be institutionalized and she is scared of me so it was good for her in her opinion that she dumped me (word by word). 

so, please, I beg of you. who is crazy here? me for still being in love with the idea of her (not really the idea though. when she is nice like old times or even now, she makes my heart fly, she has a charm over me, she knows it, she uses it in every tiny aspect of our life to threaten and blackmail me)? or her for being with and then torturing and then being with and then torturing a guy that she calls ""chronic abuser, liar, woman-beater, dog-killer"" (except for dog-killer which was so unfortunate but true, I refuse these terms honestly).

Lastly, you should know as well as I do that I actually wanted to (and still do, if she stops this crap) marry her. I really love her. I did my best for her, to make her happy. I starved so she could eat. hell I starved for 6 months and lost 60 kilograms to look hot for her and she didn't even care or acknowledge.
 
so tell me please people. who is crazy and who is sane? and how to get over this whole situation, be it alone or with her? and what should be my next actions regarding these in your opinion? other than stopping loving her, that is... I know we should be separate but but but when we were great we were the greatest and this poison of a knowledge is killing my brain from the inside...

p.s. I think I'm going to have to beat up that LoL guy. since I am a beater apparently, let's live up to our name shall we? and my hands are itching for it since I've seen Jon Snow beating Ramsay like that in GoT s06e09. and I cannot sleep thinking of him and them and those pics and hearts and he has to pay.

btw do you think this is Karma hitting me? because my gf's ex-bf has a super hot new gf that loves him now. why doesn't stupid Karma hit my gf too sometimes? because she was the one who enabled me and she was the one who enabled this LoL guy."

4p8qsn,3,2016-06-21,I [20F] lost my dream job just as my parents [50M&amp;F] began planning an expensive trip to visit the city it's in. I don't know how to explain without disappointing or scaring them.,firedandmoping,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4p8qsn/i_20f_lost_my_dream_job_just_as_my_parents_50mf/,"All right, Reddit. This is a bit of an odd one, but I'll try to explain as best as I can.


I'm a college senior—I'll be graduating this December a semester late. Just over two years ago, one of my best friends helped me to get a job at a fairly prestigious nonprofit. It was everything I'd ever hoped for, and I *loved* it; work-from-home, flexible hours, amazing coworkers, unusual and interesting tasks… I couldn't have asked for a better workplace. Technically this job was only temporary, but they renewed my work license with them every six months without fail. They'd even hired several people previously after similar 'short-term' internships, so I'd had distant hopes that I might be able to stay with this place forever. 


I wouldn't be coming here if everything was amazing, so… on to the problem. I've had an anxiety disorder and depression for pretty much as long as I can remember. I never realized it was 'unusual' or decided to seek treatment until a little over a year ago, though, when the self-harm urges and emotional instability *really* became too much for me to handle. I went to therapy, I got prescribed medications, but none of that was a miracle cure; I got better, then worse again, and I was pretty much a carved-out husk of a person from the past January through early May. I could barely get out of bed and go to class, I spent more time staring at my plaster wall than any other activity combined, I stopped reading and drawing and playing video games entirely, I forgot what it meant to look forward to something… and, unfortunately, I also neglected my job horribly. I couldn't keep up with my tasks, and a whole lot of extra work fell on my coworkers as a result. I still feel absolutely horrible about how useless I was during those months; they gave me every possible out, tried their hardest to back me up and take care of me, and each time I let them down. I was so deep into my spiral of numbness and fear that I couldn't even bear to admit something was wrong and let them help me like they were willing to. I messed up big time.


The tail end of May, things started improving, and June's been a lot better. (I finally found a medication that doesn't leave me completely unable to feel emotion! It's very exciting!) I feel like a person more days than not, I remember what having fun feels like, and my job performance (I think) has been improving a whole lot again (though I'll admit I'm still not back up to the level of the employee I was before). 


Unfortunately, it's too little too late. Yesterday I opened up my inbox and found an apology letter instead of a renewal slip. The job I loved more than anything doesn't want me anymore. July 1st is my last day.


The main problem—what on Earth am I going to do with myself now that I don't have this in my life anymore—is something I'm slowly working out. I'm going to finish out my last week, give my coworkers my best goodbye, and try to find something new. The secondary problem is my parents, and they're the ones I really and truly don't know how to deal with. (For a bit of clarification as to this next part: my college is on one side of the country, my family home is on another, and the nonprofit's actual physical location is a long distance from both.)


I'm staying with my parents and younger brothers at my family home over the summer. My parents know how much I love this job and how badly I'd always wished I could meet my coworkers in person, so a few weeks ago they started planning a big family vacation to the city the nonprofit is headquartered in. This isn't the *only* reason we're going there, but it is a big part of it. We leave in just over a month. Up until yesterday, this trip was going to be the highlight of my summer.


I can't not tell them I lost my job—I'd never forgive myself for lying to them like that, and anyway they'd know something was up the moment we made it to the city and I didn't want to visit my friends there. But I also can't lie and tell them I quit or that it was a mutual parting-of-ways: they watched me bundle myself up and log in for a Skype meeting when I had a fever of 101, they were there when I stayed up until half-past-midnight finishing my shift quota before waking up at five in the morning to attend my other, less fun internship. I truly was a motivated employee before depression knocked me over and kicked me when I was down, and to them I never stopped being that person. 


They know I had/have some sort of anxiety issues going on, but I deliberately never told them just how bad my mental illness had gotten because I was far too ashamed to deal with how broken-down a person I'd become: I'd make up fake activities, hang out with pretend friends, act like I'd finished my homework the week before it was due instead of at five minutes 'til midnight. My parents are great in almost every way, but they don't really 'get' the idea of depression and frankly I'd preferred it that way; anything to keep the image of the cheerful, happy daughter I wanted them to see me as. It was easy enough to do when we lived fifteen hours away and I only saw them through Skype.


Now, though, I have no idea what to do. I can't lie to them for the next two months and go on the vacation under false pretenses and I can't *not* lie to them without telling them a whole lot more about my screwed-up head than I ever wanted to. The very thought of sitting them down and explaining I was fired terrifies me. Just imagining it makes the very worst of my anxiety start clawing its way through my ribcage again.


I know this is a hard one to give advice for, since… well, since I already pretty much screwed up everything I possibly could. But I really could use some help on how to explain just what happened to my parents without clamming up or making things sound even worse than they are; I don't want to make them think I simply neglected my job because I wanted to be lazy, but I also don't want to make them worry for me any more than they already do. Does anyone have some thoughts as to how to handle this conversation? (Or, heck, ways for me to wrap my head around the my failure and stop mourning my job as if it were a person?)


**TL;DR** I lost my beloved job just as my family was planning a big trip to visit the city its headquarters (and all my former coworkers) are located in. I can't lie to my family and say I wasn't fired, but I can't tell them the truth without explaining the reality of my mental illness and the very thought of that horrifies me. How do I broach this subject with them?"

Before this summer, I'd never really dated much. My last relationship was 4 years long and ended in November 2014. Since then I've had 2 short 3-month long relationships and no hookups. The only person I've ever slept with is my ex-boyfriend. This info is all relevant because I feel like a fish out of water in the situation I'm about to describe..

Since I have little experience and am finally over my ex's, I decided to give casual dating a try in LA. It was great. I've met and gone out on 6 first dates in the past two weeks, and have met some semi-interesting people. I'm not too into any of them yet though. HOWEVER, I live in a building with summer internship students, and we've all be hanging out and getting closer. I've had a crush on one of the guys, Adam, for about a month now.

Adam and I have always been flirty, and I've always been up-front about all of my dates. He knows that I haven't gone on any second dates yet since I just started dating. He also knows I haven't slept with any of my dates.

This past weekend, the built up chemistry and sexual tension between Adam and me finally resulted in him and I hooking up. I slept over at his place and one thing led to another, we ended up doing oral. Since that night, I can't stop thinking about him. I know he's interested in pursuing a relationship with me because his friends have told me so. I'm completely fine ditching my online dating life and seeing where Adam and my thing can progress to. I'm really into him, and we're both very compatible.

BUT, I'm nervous about his expectations of me now. He knows that a) I've been going on a ton of dates and b) I gave him a blowjob the night we first kissed. He doesn't know that I haven't had sex in more than a year, am rusty and nervous, and attach a lot of emotional significance to sex.

Is there a way I can dial back our relationship sexually, while still getting to know him? I feel like if I suggest that we just make out, he'll be really confused or think of me as a tease. I also don't want to lay down my entire history and thought process on the table, since it seems too early for that.

TLDR: I have little dating experience and planned on having a bunch of summer flings, but met a great relationship-material guy instead. I want to take things slow and at my pace, but I'm nervous he thinks I move lightning fast and will feel miffed."

(The title is a slight exaggeration, but it's how it felt until I figured it out.)

Here's the story: I buy my g900. I'm super happy with it, this thing is great. I set it up on my desktop, and then to get the most out of it, I tune it for my Inwin mouse pad. And, out of habit, I keep the mouse in onboard profile mode (not sure if this is relevant).

The next week, I ride into town, with my laptop and plug this thing in my laptop. It doesn't track. The mouse buttons worked, though. I was dumbfounded. I felt like my mouse was bricked by moisture or something. Installing the drivers didn't help. What the hell? It also doesn't work on my friend's Mac. So much for showing off my toy -- I'm thinking I'm going to have to RMA this thing. But the mouse did move one tick each time, so I hold out hope that it's a driver issue. An hour later, I realize after scrutinizing the drivers for a while that no surface is selected. Is that normal? I dunno, so I just poke the button that selects the default surface. BAM! The G900 starts tracking again.

I think I know why this happens. Let's say the default indices for surface tuning are 0, 1, 2. Let's say my configured surface tuning index is 3. When the mouse is in onboard profile mode, and surface tuning is applied, the mouse assumes the existence of surface tuning 3, but surface tuning 3 is stored in LGS. When the mouse is connected to a computer without LGS installed, or without any configured surfaces, surface tuning 3 does not exist. I don't know how the drivers were written, but that's my first guess. Don't cheap out on coffee for the interns, guys."
4p9nct,71,2016-06-22,Terrified for my Life: An Intern's Tale,nsmara,childfree,https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/4p9nct/terrified_for_my_life_an_interns_tale/,"Hi all, I'm here to share with ya'll a story as to why I'm childfree for good (I always have been, but this experience has sealed the deal FOR GOOD.)

I'm currently interning for a children's program (Ironic, isn't it?) that primarily deals with children from low income backgrounds. (While childhood development isn't my background, I'm using this experience get into law school as I want to pursue a position as a family/divorce lawyer [This is a story for another time]). 

Anyhow, a lot of these kids have limited resources and access to things that most privileged kids would have access to/experience. Except there's one kid in particular that is the deal breaker in me continuing my internship.

Now this program runs on some sort of pseudo psychological child development theoretical bullsh*t where they don't believe in disciplining children and encourage free play. 

What got me F*CKED up was when I, my co-intern, and a mother of one of the other kids spotted signs of compulsive lying and manipulation this Hellspawn was exhibiting. (This mom confided in me and pulled me aside and said she didn't want her kid hanging around Hellspawn because he's tried to put his hands on her and her kid.) My supervisor and his case manager blew me and my co-intern off when we voiced our concerns by telling us that he's just a ""difficult"" kid.

Anyhow, Hellspawn's reign of terror began today by running into the storage unit and stealing one of the prize toys we give to kids. I and another peer of mine caught him stealing, and when I confronted him, he threw the toy behind and shelf and claimed that he didn't steal anything, when clearly more than ONE person saw him doing it. Red flag #1.

Within 20 minutes, Hellspawn went on to play around in the water tub with some of the other kids. As I walked over to close the lid on the tub (One of the kids had their face facedown in the water WTF, so I was taking safety measures by closing the thing) he proceeded to dump water on me. The other kids he was with backed away, knowing they were in trouble, and luckily my supervisor caught him in the act. She pulled him aside and told him to applogize, but he thought it was a game and began running around a table... and so she gave up and that was it. She didn'the find any alternative discipline him, she just told himloop to apologize and moved away from it. Ok, red flag #2, he's unable to muster any sort of empathy/apathy and makes a game out of it. Ramsey Bolton, much?

After drying myself off, I re-enter the space and another little boy was running tripped, rolled on to his back. Hellspawn comes over AND STEPS (applying pressure and all) on this little boy who's physically smaller and said little boy proceeds to whimper in pain. At this point I'm like; ""Screw the rules"" and I jump in, scoop up the smaller boy and berate Hellspawn for being the POS he is. I never understood how cruel children could be, but witnessing this first hand scarred me. 

I told my co-intern what I had experienced and she froze, staring at me wide eyed as she recounted him throwing stuff and attempting to trip her as she was helping another kid. We both decided we're going to stand up to our boss and voice our concerns.

TL;DR some vile Ramsey Bolton clone isn't worth risking my personal safety and the safety of others and now I'm preparing myself to stand up to my boss. 

All suggestions are welcome! I just figured I'd like to hear everyone's thoughts on this and whether this POS is exhibiting behaviors of sociopathy or if he needs a good dropkick."

My current city has a population of over 200.000, almost 8 tiles filled, and my pc seems to be having trouble coping with this. I can no longer play at triple or double speed for a while now... maybe since the population reached 120.000 or 150.000 or so not really sure.. since my pc is 3 years old (and civilization 6 is coming) i'm wondering if it is worth upgrading.

Here is my current PC:

* Intel Core i5 4430 / 3 GHz - 6 MB cache - LGA1150 Socket 
* ASRock B85M-HDS - Micro ATX - LGA1150 Socket - B85 - USB 3.0 - Gigabit Ethernet - HD Audio
* Crucial Ballistix Sport - 8 GB : 2 x 4 GB - DIMM 240-pins - DDR3 - 1600 MHz / PC3-12800 - CL9 - 1.5 V
* Palit GeForce GTX 760 JetStream - GeForce GTX 760 - 2 GB GDDR5 - PCI Express 3.0 x16 - 2 x DVI, HDMI
* XFX Core Edition PRO550W - ATX12V 2.2/ EPS12V 2.91 - 80 PLUS Bronze - 100-240 Volt wisselstroom V - 550 Wat
* Seagate Barracuda ST2000DM001 - 2 TB - intern - 3.5"" - SATA-600 - 7200 tpm -buffer: 64 MB

* Samsung 840 Series MZ-7TD120 - Solid state drive - 120 GB - intern - 2.5"" - SATA-600
* Corsair Carbide Series 200R - Midtowermodel - ATX - geen voeding ( ATX ) - USB/Audio

I'm wondering if it is worth upgrading my pc, i'm considering the following upgrades (CPU/graphics card/motherboard):

* Intel Core i5-6400 / 2.7 GHz - 6 MB cache LGA1151 Socket
* Gigabyte GA-B150-HD3P - ATX - LGA1151 Socket - B150 - USB 3.0, USB 3.1, USB-C - Gigabit LAN
* ASUS STRIX GTX970-DC2OC-4GD5 - GeForce GTX 970 - 4 GB GDDR5 - PCI Express 3.0 x16

Will this noticeably speed up Cities Skylines? Is this what i need to fill up 9 tiles completely with no slow down? If not, what CPU is recommended?

Your advice would be appreciated!"

I'll try to keep it as short (but thorough) as possible.

___________________________________________

**My Situation:**  I'm 23, and will **finish my Master of Science degree** (2 year program) **roughly one year from now (after this year long, unpaid internship.)**  Luckily, I chose a field in medicine that I am passionate about, in which jobs are plentiful, and where salaries are increasing steadily *(Avg was 49K in 2005, 65K in 2015).*

**Unfortunately,** pursuing one's ideal job comes at a cost in the good ole USA.  I attended a large in-state university with one of the best undergraduate/graduate programs in the country.  **Maintained a 3.9, graduated with honors, did research/generated publications, etc. so I made the most of my time here.**  

However, all of my hard work didn't negate the fact that it would **still cost me roughly $80,000** to get where I need to be.

So here I sit, ready to start my ""grown up"" life after my upcoming unpaid internship.  

Out of school, according to this year's salary report from my field's governing organization, I should make roughly **$50K to $53K** annually.
___________________________________________

After years of reading, **I've concluded that the best way is to pay it as quickly as possible (to avoid increasing interest) while still saving a portion of my income for unexpected issues.**

**It's also important to note that my parents have agreed to pay for groceries, gas, cell phone, and car insurance until I pay this off. (They made enough last year, alone, to pay me through college twice and still have money left over...they just chose not to.)**

**But I digress:** I will need to cover is rent and utilities **($500 to $600/month around here.)**
___________________________________________

**How I imagine paying off my loans:** 

-Say I take home $39,000 after taxes, and pay $500/month to live.  

-I would have $33,000 left over, with everything I need to live already paid for (Other than frivolous items that I personally don't spend money on since I've been pretty much broke for 5 years.)
____________________________________________

**HERE IS THE $80,000 QUESTION:**

**Is it feasible for me to take a short term risk, and pay down $25,000-$30,000 annually to hammer down these loans and move on with my life?  Being poor for 3-4 years sounds so much more appealing than being chained by my loans for the next 15 years.**

____________________________________________

It's been very stressful to know that I'm in such a predicament, and I want it out of my life as soon as realistically possible.

**Thank you so much for reading, and I would appreciate any constructive advice that you would be able to provide!**"
4paunc,2,2016-06-22,[Breeds] dog breed recommendations for a newly independent college grad who may go to graduate school in a year or two?,HenryKushinger,dogs,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/4paunc/breeds_dog_breed_recommendations_for_a_newly/,"Hi /r/dogs,

Basically, I've just graduated college, and after this summer (in which I'm accepting my parents' gracious hospitality and living at their house due to having a summer internship very close to them) I'll be living on my own (possibly with roommates). I've always had dogs growing up, and I feel that they're an essential part of my life. Once I'm on my own, I feel like it won't be long until I feel the need to either adopt a puppy or rescue an adult dog.

That said, there are a few considerations which complicate this future decision:

1- although my current goal is to work for at least a year or two and save up some money, I do plan to go to grad school in the future, and so I'd probably need a breed that can cope with his or her human companion being away for somewhat long periods during the day. A dog that gets separation anxiety would probably not do well with my current and immediate future lifestyle plans. Also, given how busy I'd be, a dog that only requires at most weekly brushing/grooming would be ideal.

2- I'm not exactly made of money, and will probably end up living in a smallish to tiny apartment near Cambridge/Boston. As such, the only exercise my prospective dog would get would probably be a daily run and/or walk, and a dog that needs a yard to run around in or a large space to occupy would be out of the question.

3- again from a financial perspective, a dog that requires less food and other resources- so probably a medium- to small- sized breed- would be preferable; at the same time, though, I'm not really a fan of ""lapdog"" types like Pomeranians, Pugs, Chihuahuas (oh god why would I even mention Chihuahuas, I'm really not a fan of them), etc.

4- Although I grew up with dogs, my dad was really the primary caretaker and, more importantly, **trainer** for the dogs. As such, while I have an understanding of the basics of dog training, I'm not super confident in my abilities, so a breed that is more receptive to training and less stubborn would be ideal (I love my parents' Samoyed, Bode, but he can be really willful at times- my dad is the only one he respects enough to almost-always obey his commands).

5- I tend to like Spitz breeds, but this isn't really a requirement.

So in short/TL;DR, should I decide that I need a dog in my life when I'm living on my own in a few months, I'd be looking for a breed that is small- to medium-sized, somewhat independent itself but relatively easily trainable and not stubborn, doesn't require a ton of exercise or space, and is a good companion. With all of this, would it even be a responsible decision for me to consider getting a dog? Or should I wait until my life is a bit more stable and I'd have more time to dedicate to caring for this hypothetical dog?"

So I've been a lurker on this sub for sometime now and I have a question. 

I've been trying to workout a lot this summer but I'm living in a large city for a smmer internship 8 hours a day where my commute is between 1hr-1.5hrs. So I'm up at 6 to get to my job at 9, and by the time I get home around 6 Im *starving* (And also not very motivated to go to the gym because of the commute and long day).

So the main question is: Is it okay to eat dinner before lifting?

I currently, everyday, have 2 eggs with a protein shake for breakfast. A homemade sandwich with banana for lunch. Then a cooked chicken breast or tenderloins an hour before working out which is around 7 usually. Im trying to keep my protein intake very high so ill have a protein shake after working out as well.

What are your thoughts on eating a bigger dinner before lifting?
Is it okay or should I have something really small then have chicken/protein shake after workout?

Thanks Guys"

A short back story: I started dabbling in code at about the age of 12 using BYOND (A free 2d game development engine and community). From there I took all the business and computer classes in highschool, and went into a technical college to achieve my Associates in Computer Program Design and development. Surprise this degree only grazed the surface of many languages including ruby, sql, java, visual basics, and c. It basically was a ""get to know code"" kind of degree. From there I did 2 website design internships but never learned what I needed to get an actual software development skills. I also attended KU for a year but ran out of money and did not complete.

I have been working in wireless sales/management for about the last 7 years and recently made my move to KC to further my career. I have decided to return to my passion for software now that I have landed in the area and am considering a 10 week boot camp in swift through the ""Disruption Institute"". I believe I have what it takes to put in the hard work and be successful with the knowledge that I obtain; however I had a couple questions about the swift language and my personal situation.

Firstly, I don't love Apple. I say that because I used the first 4 iPhones before moving over to Android which I love and use to its fullest potential. On the other-side I have been working with  iPhones and other various Apple products for a very long time. The product isn't bad, it just isn't my first choice. I do love apps however and I don't think it would bother me to develop IOS apps. Is this a red flag to you?

Swift is obviously gaining transaction and with it becoming opensource there may be a lot of opportunities in the future. Do you believe that with it's current state and projected future that would be a positive choice due to potential of cross platform? Reminder I have no intentions of sr. developer status  for at least 2-4 years.  

Lastly you may ask why not finish school or go back? Time and money, I don't want to waste 3 years going part time to finish while racking up huge loans. I feel like I have to work to stay afloat and lets be honest we already have loans to pay. Also I have finished most of my general education as well as a few core classes that transfer to Universities as well. Does it make sense to go for the meat and potatoes and make the best of it?

I appreciate everyone's opinion, thank you ahead of time for sharing"

I had a policy from State Farm last year, had it for only 3 months as I had leased a car for my internship and as internship got over, I stopped my policy. Now, I am leasing a new car for my full time job and I was wondering if I restarted my old policy, will the insurance premium jump because I had stopped my policy.

Also, can I shop for better deal on my policy premium based on previous policy.

And, is it wise to get the insurance from another firm rather than StateFarm.

The thing is I've since become more of a Java, and Node.js developer and much more OSX inclined. 

I also haven't done any C# since so I'm probably very rusty. 

Since then .NET is now available on OSX I hear? Is it in a limited state? Like can I only do certain things or do I require something like an emulator?

If I'm all good to go, can someone tell me what I need and point me towards a good C# server side tutorial?

4pc9rm,12,2016-06-22,Haven't played in months. Just rolled a character for fun. Turned out awesome.,jibbroy,traveller,https://www.reddit.com/r/traveller/comments/4pc9rm/havent_played_in_months_just_rolled_a_character/,"[Richard Von Nuemarck](https://i.imgur.com/Rt98Jdh.png)

A cousin of the main Nuemarck family line, Richard took on an intern position in the Diplomatic Corp at the ripe age of 18. What came next was nothing but a stellar 11 year career serving various diplomats and functionaries as secretary, consultant and representative. During his 12th year an incident on his home world involving his cousins in the main Nuemarck line left his superiors wanting to distance themselves from his family name. After being forced out of a very promising and fulfilling career he found himself cutting all personal ties to his family. 

Angered that their (now public) debauchery and depravity had cost him dearly he vowed never more to associate with them. Leaving his diplomatic career with nothing but his personal Yacht and a good deal of savings he set out to find his own way in life. His grand visions of adventure and commerce on the frontier would be for naught as the second border war with the Sword Worlds broke out. He was drafted into service with the Imperial Army. Although still a widely respected individual in the subsector he lacked the required financial backing from his family to buy his way out of the draft. So rather than resigning himself and begrudgingly doing his duty he secured a commission as a Lieutenant in an Armoured Regiment and took to his new role with the same vigour and passion that he brought to the diplomatic corp.

His skill at organization and diplomatic strategy lended itself well to a life in the army. Military tactics were not so different in principle than diplomatic ones, for Richard it was simply a matter of understanding and controlling ones enemy. Always mentally two steps ahead of his opponents. His natural ability allowed him to move quickly through the ranks, his tactical and strategic prowess lead him to accept command of his regiment at the age of 42. By 46 he was a Brigadier General, by 50 a Lieutenant General with half a dozen Campaigns on 3 different worlds under his belt. 

About a week after his retirement party the reactor in his Yacht powered on for the first time in over a decade. Last anyone saw him he was at a bar in orbit over Regina in search of a crew..."

this is my first reddit post but hopefully someone here can help me out. I just graduated with a ChemE degree, with a decent GPA (3.3). I've been job hunting throughout my senior year, and got very serious about it the last few months. I haven't had a lot of luck and ended up and took an R&amp;D internship after graduating that I am doing now as I continue to look. I had an interview yesterday, but the job was listed as a salary of 42,000.  Not only this, but its in an area where the cost of living is very high. If I get the offer.. should I take it, or keep looking for a job closer to the average range of a chemical engineer?? Also any job hunting tips/ ideas are appreciated..

&gt;For weeks, Atsushi Nakajima's orphanage has been plagued by a mystical tiger that only he seems to be aware of. Suspected to be behind the strange incidents, the 18-year-old is abruptly kicked out of the orphanage and left hungry, homeless, and wandering through the city.

Whimsical suicide enthusiast and supernatural detective, Dazai has been investigating the same tiger that has been terrorizing the boy. Together with Dazai's partner Doppo Kunikida, they solve the mystery, but its resolution leaves Atsushi in a tight spot. As various odd events take place, Atsushi is coerced into joining their firm of supernatural investigators, taking on unusual cases the police cannot handle, alongside his numerous enigmatic co-workers.

Life was good. Then I started interacting with her less and pretending to be busy. I did that thinking that this is going well and that if I'm not around her as much, it's gonna pull her in more, cuz when you're scarce, you become missed and wanted more. But lately, she's been hanging out with this guy on her floor and spending lunches with him. She talks about him every time I see her. 

At first I thought that since they're on the same floor, maybe he's just more accessible to her than I am and she needs to eat with someone when I'm not around. But then I started noticing that even when I chat with her on company skype just before noon, she'd converse with me normally, and then she'd lock up her computer and go off to lunch with him (I know that from both their skype statuses showing AWAY at the same time) and she'd never ask me to join them. 

Today, I learned from someone in my floor that she and her new friend are going to a park nearby to see an outdoor magic show. I'll call this girl on my floor, my informer. So my informer told me that she was going with them too. I stopped and wondered for a few minutes about the best way to deal with this. Then I decided to message the girl I like on skype, just to see how her day's going and see if she'd invite me to the park. I even gave her a chance to mention it to me after awkwardly seeming like I ran out of things to say for a few minutes during our chat session. To my surprise, she didn't mention it. 

So I decided to tell her that I heard that there's a magic show happening at the park. She said yes, I'm going with my new friend. So I asked her if she minds me joining them. She said of course not. So I went down to the park with my informer and met both of them there. 

When I met the guy, I was really curious to know, what it is about him that she likes. Like, what does he have to offer that I don't. And from talking to him, I really couldn't see it. I mean the guy stutters when he talks. And he doesn't seem to be better than me in any way. This might be my opinion, but understand that I'm usually the type of guy who thinks, I wish I was that guy or looked like that guy. 

So why then does she exclude me from their lunch plans? Does she like him? Are they dating? Or are they just friends? And if she does like him, how did I fail her? What was it that I did that pushed me into the friend-zone? Or even further out from a friend zone, because if she thought of me as a friend then why wouldn't she ask me to come out to the park with them?

I feel like I had s chance and I blew it. Cuz I knew her before him. And now here I am being left out to eat alone. But at this point, I'm happy enough to learn from my mistakes and move on. But what is it that I did wrong? "

Hi, thank you for looking at my post. It's revised with headers to try to improve readability. Otherwise there's a tl;dr at the end. I don't have anyone to turn to that wouldn't be involved with the issue, some outside opinions would really be appreciated. I started my ""real"" job after graduation and am maybe coming to the realization I made a huge mistake.

I spent 5 years at IUPUI for a double major in accounting/finance. My family isn't wealthy, my mom raised me alone. Because of this all of my free time was spent working and studying. Whereas in high school I was social and somewhat popular, in college I never was able to make those connections. After class time was either spent working, or unable to go out with classmates due to the financial situation. For example the last 2 summers in college I spent taking 12 credits, and doing an internship for the company I'm currently at. 

I completed the internship in an international tax planning role, working directly on $1B~ in projects. Afterward I was offered 40% of what they were paying over the summer. Due to the long commute time the offer would barely cover my gas expenses, so I felt I had to decline.

Under the impression I would be able to return to a similar position after school, I did two heavy course loads while scavenging in order to finish and get back to work. 

**Not What I Thought**

Upon accepting the offer and starting the job, my responsibilities now are completely different from what I did for the internship. I was under the impression I would be able to touch international work again, but this is not the case. I do get along with my team, that's why I returned at all after the internship. 

Due to letting friendships deteriorate over the years in the pursuit of this, upon graduating many people ""ghosted"" me. Essentially deciding because I have a long commute outside of town that I'm not worth the time to keep up with. I can understand this as its hard to maintain friendships (impossible?) where you don't see each other.

**Your Advice...**

Would I be crazy to resign, return the bonus, and get a restaurant job downtown? In order to position myself to re-develop my soft skills / make new friends? It feels like I've been wasting these years. Money isn't a worry right now, but I don't have anyone to share it with so it's kind of like... what is the point yeah?

Ideally I would find an IT / finance firm downtown or to the north with some home/work life balance. Being a workaholic runs in my blood, but I need passion for what I do. My dream is to learn coding in a work environment. I'm no stranger to 12 hour shifts on my feet, though I would rather have 12 hour coding sessions. My first job was grand-opening one of the larger restaurants in indy, we eventually hit top10 on Yelp. I loved the fast pace and quick thinking needed. Wish I could find this culture in an IT firm.

**Thank you for reading if you made it this far. I would really appreciate some advice. I don't know what to do. It feels like I was mislead into this position but I can't tell if that is normal.**

For the IT aspect I had looked over Fuzion Analytics a few years ago, if anyone has knowledge of them I'd love to hear about them. Or other similar firms.

My skills:

- IT (PC building, troubleshoot,basic java[plan to invest in coding more], PC gaming history, held all time CompTIA+ record in HS)
- Finance (extensive forecasting, estimation, and financials knowledge. Automation of first two in list, behind Economics, Finance was my favorite subject)
- Accounting (current job, various reconciliation items, majority of time is spent finding/pulling/cleaning/presenting data from our systems for audit inquiries)
- Rock Climbing (5 yrs experience, former job, majority of time spent teaching/refining my lessons/saving ankles)
- Restaurant (3 years with restaurant from day 1 open, eventually became front manager, taking care of all things in dining room of 500)

Have BA in Accting / Fin, 3 credits off both a computer science and Econ minor. Started college to start a PC repair business.

Could you recommend some life advice for me? Even if it's restaurant ideas to check out, or if anyone knows of an IT firm that might be a fit. I feel alone. 

**tl;dr**
 recent grad at F500 who worked all through college, would ""taking a step backward"" be more fulfilling

Thanks for your time, I appreciate it."

4pcvv2,5,2016-06-22,"My grandmother has offered to sell me her car, a 2004 Jaguar X-Type with 76k miles, for $3150. Is this a good deal?",AriaOfTime,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4pcvv2/my_grandmother_has_offered_to_sell_me_her_car_a/,"Hello!

I am currently twenty years old and a rising college senior majoring in computer science and business. This summer, I am working as an intern at the same company for the second year in a row. I make 23.74 an hour and work full time for the summer. They have made it clear that they wish to hire when I graduate. During the school year, I work as a tutor for 9.00 an hour, working anywhere from two to six hours a week and I bill for one hour a week to my current job for paperwork reasons. My only current expenses are $9.00 a month for netflix and $5.00 a month for patreon, along with clothes or any fun things I want to do.

Currently, my parents have a car that they allow me to drive (my commute is roughly 15ish miles each way). I had planned to save  up and buy a car next summer, as I have managed perfectly fine on my college campus without a car, though it would be nice to have one on campus. My little brother, though, is going to get his license in about six months, and I will need a car to commute to my full-time job, so obviously I will need a car next summer. However, an opportunity has presented itself.

My grandmother is getting rid of her car, as her husband is disabled and they do not need two cars. She is selling a 2004 Jaguar X-Type with 76k miles on it. I am not yet sure if it is a 2.5 or 3.0. The car has never been in an accident but it has not been driven in a while. She is offering to sell it for $3150, but I will have to pay Maryland taxes, tags, and inspection. My father estimates that, all in, it will be about $4,000. He did own a car repair shop when he was younger, so he has offered to help with any necessary repairs that he is able to (my dad is the best). I currently have a bit over $2000 in the bank and take home about $740 a week, so I'd pay her a lump sum now and pay the rest in a few weeks.

On one hand, it is a good deal (or at least, it seems like a good deal to me). But, on the other hand, I'm not in desperate need of a car at the moment, though I'll need one in a bit less than a year. Insurance, since its a jaguar, will be a bit more expensive. I plugged in some numbers to a couple different insurance sites and got numbers around $60 - $80 a month. I was in an accident that I was at fault for four years and nine months ago, so in three months it will age off and I can say that I haven't had an accident in five years, so that should help with insurance too if I wait. Tires will be expensive. It will also delay me on paying student loans, though all of my loans are under 4% and I don't have to pay them yet. I was just getting a jump start.

I expect to graduate with around $40,000 in student loans and will be earning a salary in the $65,000 to $100,000 range. It is my goal to get my loans paid off ASAP.

So, I'm asking for advice. Is this a great deal I should be jumping on? Or should I wait? I'm really conflicted. My grandmother wants an answer by the end of the week.

EDIT: Thank you all so much for the great comments. I've decided to pass on this for now, make do without a car until next summer, and then try to find something boring and dependable! My bank account thanks you all!"

I have read about claiming more allowances or exemptions, but if that's accurate, how many am I able claim? I don't want to owe money in April.

Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you 

Edit: I am a college student, my internship is in LA, but I live and go to school in Arizona. 

Side questions: Being that Cali's state income tax is way higher than AZ, and my permanent residence is in Arizona, will I be able to get any of the state income tax back?"

But now I have a doubt that has paralyzed me. Right now, I am studying law in Brazil, I am in the half of the graduation course. Since the begging I was not identified with the course, but I continued because of my parents expectations, ""the certainty of get a job"", ""the possibility to become a diplomat"". But as I got more mature I saw clearly what are my real possibilities. I risked from my options the diplomat career (since I would need to continue studying for a long period and develop my weak languages proficiency).

I have already made a volunteer internship in an NGO as a sales pitcher (that I didn't liked) and I've worked in a Rough Stones sales company as a sales person too - with a bit of product design (what I liked). Both work experiences were before discover the mbti test. I had a work experience as a judge assistant that I hated, because I was oblige to judge others in concrete situations.

I am doubt about what to do in my life. Now, I am doing my finals exams from this semester, but then I want to direct my life to my goals.

There are some other points: my inability from distinguishes my wishes from my family's come mostly because I didn't want to disappoint neither my mom nor my dad. And this feeling was increased because, I thought in an aspect, I should develop a proper career because I had strong issues to relate to my inner feeling and world, that mostly comes from my disturbed relation with my schizophrenic dad, my previous inability to accept that my mom has cancer and my fear of being an homosexual.

4peg7q,1,2016-06-22,Not sure where to turn,buckeyes20,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/4peg7q/not_sure_where_to_turn/,"I have been dealing with depression for a fairly decent amount of time, about a year and a half. Not sure what caused it, it sort of just happened and I denied it for the first three months just trying to tell myself that school was stressing me out and all the changes I was going through my freshman year of college was the root cause of it. It never went away though.
I went through last summer with a pretty mild depression. Tried hiding it the best I could but eventually came out to my girlfriend at the time about it. She blamed herself and told me she was sorry she wasn't good enough and it made me fell absolutely horrible. Then I began to hide it, telling her I felt fine, never venting my feelings and always keeping how I felt a secret. Soon got angry all the time and later found out that those types of actions are fairly common for someone suffering from depression. Needless to say, depression ruined the best relationship of my life when summer was over. Put her through a lot of pain that she never deserved.
School rolled around and depression struck harder and harder. I feel it is important to note that my grades are good and not the issue. I had constant suicidal thoughts, anxiety attacks, and just always angry. I reached out for help from my school's counseling service towards the end of this past spring semester. They did a whole interview with me and told me I most likely suffered from depression but with school ending and me not staying in the city for the summer, there was really not much that they could do.Towards finals, came very close to ending it, honestly the only reason I didn't was for the fear that if I lived, the consequences I would face would be even worse.
Once school ended, started an internship in a very rural area of the country. For a perspective, nearest Walmart is about an hour away. Depression was still heavy on me and suicidal thoughts were almost daily occurrence up until about a week and a half ago. I had people I would turn to for advice but just like everyone I know, they stopped speaking to me. One of those people eventually got me to call for help down here at a place an hour away. That place told me they couldn't fit me in and they forwarded me to another place. That place also told me they couldn't fit me in and they really were not sure where else I could go. Feels like no one cares and I just have to get this off my chest. Really trying to hold off until I start school up in mid August to see a good doctor about my depression and anxiety since clearly no one here wants to help me. Lately have been in a positive mood but I feel like after a week and a half/two weeks, I always fall back into a depressive state and isolate myself. I figured I would post on here before I get like that and hope at least someone sees this and will hopefully give me some sort of advice. I apologize for such a long post, I know no one wants to read this but I couldn't hold this in any longer."

What are your solutions or tips for adding negative keywords at an enterprise level? We have a client with 10x more SKUs than we've worked with before. We usually add negative keywords once a week for clients but it could take hours if we let it build up that long for this client.

Scripts? Tools like karooya? Interns? Manually?

All help is appreciated! Thank you"

I'm currently a CS major at Georgia Tech. I'm interning at Google this summer amd I've realized that software engineering isn't for me. I'm pretty sure I want to go into medicine, and GaTech doesn't have a very good pre-med program or medicine opportunities (shadowing, volunteering, etc). So, I have decided to apply to transfer to a school with a better pre-med. These are some of the options I'm considering, though I'm open to recommendations:

+ UNC Chapel Hill
+ Boston University
+ Georgetown
+ John Hopkins
+ U Penn
+ University of Washington
+ Cornell
+ Northwestern
+ UT Austin

Other than my Google internship, my stats aren't super impressive:

+ GPA: 3.48  
	+ English 1 - A  
	+ English 2 - A  
	+ Scientific Foundations of Health - A  
	+ History of the US - A  
	+ General Psychology - A  
	+ German 1 - A  
	+ Intro OOP - B  
	+ Calculus 1 - C  
	+ Data Structures and Algorithms - C  

I'm registered to take biology and sensation in perception in the Fall, along other CS courses I don't want to take anymore :P

Other stats:  

+ ACT: 29 (30 composite)  
+ 4.0 High School GPA (from a good school in Canada)
+ Latino
+ I was pretty highly ranked in VEX robotics programming skills in high school
+ Academic chair for the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers
+ AI Club
+ Literary Society

Let me know if there's anything more you want to know :)
I really appreciate any insights or advice."

And while I am fulfilling the minimum requirements  of the program at the moment (taking my second math course in Calculus I via CLEP) I feel like I do not have the requirements to be a strong candidate of the program.

My current strengths:  
*Strong Mathematics Skills (Tested out of College Math Courses) 
*Couple Micro and Macroeconomic's Courses (Don't know if it would apply)  
*GIS Skills-Useful for Economic Analysis on a Spatial Level  
*Internship With Economic Develpoment Corporation in the town of 3,000.

And that what I feel like is what I can point out that can make me stand out. Currently, I am trying to get the basic of Python down but still, you know.  
  
What more can I do to improve my application?"
4pf1qk,2,2016-06-23,:(,FuddGubbler,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/4pf1qk/_/,"****************** Some Back Story *********************
Mark and I started out as friends. I still remember exactly what our first words on messenger were, when he asked me if I remembered the names of some girls that we had seen earlier that day, when we had first met. I didn't like him at the time, I think I found him kind of annoying... or maybe I didn't know him that well. But I think he took an interest in me because I had mentioned I was into playing video games, or was interested coding/computer science. Probably both. Well, soon after we met, he asked if I wanted to work on coding a Pokemon game with him. I thought: ""Why not, good experience anyways."" Well, coding together led to us talking, and before long we were chatting every day and playing Starcraft together. I think that's when I realized I actually liked this guy. He was incredibly smart, and funny. We both had the same sense of humor, making stupid and crude jokes with about 70% of them having to do something with dicks. He was really nice about teaching me, both in coding and in video games, and he quickly became my best friend. I got so excited whenever he chatted me and I would stay up for hours just telling him about my day and how I felt and interesting thoughts I had. 

So, skipping forward, we ended up dating. And it was amazing. Like fairy-tale amazing, the love and the support and everything. It was always long distance, or at least mid-distance with a long commute. We were both starting our first year in different colleges, both in LA but about 3 hours away from each other (by public transport) and we never really got to spend long periods of time together. In the beginning, it was perfect. The excitement of slowly getting to know each other, exploring each other, our minds and our bodies. Knowing there was finally somebody there, if we needed. Turning on the phone to countless messages of funny links or compliments. 

But of course there were problems. Long distance took it's toll. I had a harder time in school than Mark did. He always said it's because my school was harder, but the truth is that he's a fricking genius and I have some academic issues. Anyways, it led to him having more free time than me usually. There were days where I was just too tired to open some links or really talk to him. It was also so lonely in the first year of college. Academic life was so stressful that either I would have no energy to go socialize, or the friends I had were too tired to really interact with each other. I lived in a single and to be honest, the loneliness in the first year of college was something I think I've blocked from my mind because it was pretty shitty. But Mark was always there, I remember walking back from Sprague (which is where me and my friends studied/played League until the wee hours of the night) at about 2:00am in the morning and calling Mark and just lying in bed and talking to him before I went to sleep. Hearing his voice made the room seem less empty, and claustrophobic. And he would visit often, more often than I could visit him. I knew that if I called him and told him that I needed him, he would come. 

So time went on and we kept dating through the second year of college. Things got a little rockier. He got an internship over the summer and I didn't. I think that brought out some resentment in me, and I started to blame him when he didn't have time for me. But I knew it wasn't his neglect - he tried as hard as he could to do well at his job but still give me the attention I needed. I don't really get along well with my family, in the sense that I haven't really talked to my parents in a few year now. So when I was home for the summer, the night alone with nobody to really talk to got to me and I just got sad when Mark didn't have time for me. But we visited often, I drove down to where he worked and hung out with him late into the night before we parted ways to our separate homes. I still remember those nights. You know how a certain memories give you a certain feel? I remember that feel really well. Driving down, the anxiety of seeing him. Excitement, some anger, some dread, love. Seeing him, everything melts away. You're just glad that you're being hugged. Human contact, his warmth, his smile, bringing me a soda in the parking lot. And then later... fighting. A relief of all the loneliness and not talking and sadness and resentment, pinned on him, unfairly. But that that moment right after, when things aren't really resolved but you're crying and he's holding you because that's all he can do and things are kinda ok just for that moment because you don't want him to leave and you don't want to leave. The crying feels so good. And then after, the loneliness is back again when you're driving home. There's nobody on the road, because it's so late at night. You're remembering what you guys said to each other, and it's just this strange feeling of the love and loneliness and sadness and the dark. 

Anyways, some more problems starting second year of college. I got really stressed out with academics. Failed one of my classes, almost failing another - this is coming from a strict asian family that stuck into me the belief that bad grades are literally equivalent to killing a baby hamster and sticking it up a giraffe's asshole. I think that, in the first year of college, I had become too dependent on Mark emotionally. Whenever I felt bad or lonely or sad from grades or being shunned socially, I would go to him. And that's ok, maybe, if the guy is close or goes to the same college. It definitely did not work when the guy was 3 hours away. I would use him to escape, but the escaping only caused more stress because work wasn't getting done. During visits, I would get increasingly anxious. I think in my head, I started to blame him for ""making"" me come over so often, or visiting me when I was busy and had work to do and distracting me from my work. Obviously that's not the case, I looking back on it I feel so bad for blaming him for all my problems. He just wanted to love me, he just wanted to hang out with me and spend time with me. But I couldn't let go of my anxiety, I could manage my time. I wasn't able to make myself happy, and I looked to Mark as a source of all my happiness, and when he couldn't deliver the impossible, I didn't react well. 

So, recovering from the horrible first semester, I changed my attitude second semester of my second year of college. I couldn't rely on him for everything. And so I reached out for a support system from the friends I had at college. I spent more time and effort on the people I had around me. Suddenly, weekends were spent on hanging out, watching anime or playing video games, with people at my college instead of commuting 3 hours. The visits went from being every week to every other week. I found other people to have those deep conversations with, and suddenly, Mark wasn't the more important thing in my life anymore. I didn't have to fall back on him every time I fell, and I was more hesitant to ask him for help. I think I closed myself off from him, because I couldn't afford to be that ""starry eyed girl that needed her boyfriend all the time"". Instead, I realized I had to find a way to make myself happy, on my own, without his help. That was the key to a healthier relationship. I don't think that was wrong, but maybe I distanced myself too well. There's a lot more to this story, but I'm going to skip to the part where we broke up. This was last Thursday (from the time I'm writing this). 

*********************After the Break Up ****************

I think this entire time, I've been focusing more on what I SHOULD feel instead of letting myself just feel. I've tried to myself feel really really sad, and cry, and get it all out. I've tried to tell myself that I don't care, that breakups are just a thing and I'll be ok. I've tried being the angsty person who is angry at those around her who don't get what she's going through. Truth me told, I have no idea what I'm feeling now. I guess I'm sad. I'm really just more confused. And definitely guilty. I feel guilty at how I treated mark during the relationship. I was so mean to him, I insulted him all the time when I felt anxious and stressed and I don't think I appreciated as much as I know he should be. He is an amazing person. He is kind. Loving. So caring. Strong and smart and resilient and he is going to do so so so so so well in life. He will be happy because he knows how to be. I still love and respect him more than almost any other person I know. I always felt guilty when I was with him. I struggled with my "

up until i started college last fall, i'd never been overweight in my life. i was on the heavier side of the ""normal"" spectrum, but near the end of junior year, my mom made a couple disparaging comments about my weight. i went on a super restrictive diet, which set off a restrict/binge cycle. i was still basically maintaining until i entered college, when the stress + lack of parental oversight sent my weight shooting up, and now, after my freshman year, im squarely at the lower fringes of the obsese range. 

honestly, i'm completely fucking mortified. i've always considered myself a pretty disciplined person - outside of my weight struggles, i'm doing okay. i'm currently interning at a really big tech company in the bay and there's amazing food everywhere and i just want to enjoy my summer + the new city... but i've finally decided that my health is more important than that. there's always ways that i can enjoy myself that doesn't involve eating.

my goal is to hit my pre-college weight by the end of the internship! for now, im just going to not eat unless it's a social meal where it would look weird when im not eating. for the other meals i can easily get some tea to drink, and go find some alcove to relax in so my cubemates don't know i'm skipping a meal. and im going to buy myself some adidas superstars when i hit this first milestone!! 

anyway, im so excited to finally post here :) really looking forward to working toward this goal and seeing more information and inspiration from all of you!! xoxo, vi"

I created an account because I have quite a few questions about ANU/Australian universities in general, and Reddit seems to be reasonably active.

Firstly, I am in my final high school year, looking to study at ANU/other Australian universities next year. 

Does anyone know what computer science/software engineering is like at ANU, and specifically does anyone know what the Advanced Computing/Advanced Computing (R and D) course is like?

- is it more practical(more programming) or theoretical?
- good internship chances?
- good lecturers?
- class sizes?
- is homework assignments set regularly or is grades up to final exams?

Also, if anyone knows how Advanced Computing/CS in general @ ANU compares with Melbourne/UNSW/USyd engineering then please share your opinion.

Thanks for reading. Your opinion is much appreciated :)"
4pg7fq,3,2016-06-23,Advice on SEO/Digital online courses + recommendation?,miasmatix93,digital_marketing,https://www.reddit.com/r/digital_marketing/comments/4pg7fq/advice_on_seodigital_online_courses_recommendation/,"I'm coming to the end of an internship and am going to be offered a contract.  This is all well and good except for the fact that I'm not really learning anything more than what I'm googling and figuring out myself.  I could be doing that anywhere, while having other professionals here with me to give me tips.  That is not the case - I am the only marketing staff and I don't know what I'm doing.

My conclusion is that I should request they put me on a course in order to keep me.  I think that if I learnt SEO I would be very desirable to other companies in the future, not to mention I could freelance with that skill.  A number of online courses such as Squared offer digital marketing packages without SEO; I'm dubious to approach these as I don't understand what concrete skills I will be gaining.  Can anyone recommend an online course for SEO and other valuable marketing skills?"

4phmfp,9,2016-06-23,Have you ever had a song completely change your perspective?,ProfessorRootBeer,CasualConversation,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/4phmfp/have_you_ever_had_a_song_completely_change_your/,"One day I was listening to Regina Spektor with my brother and the song Two Birds came on. He turned to me and said ""you know, this song is sort of about you"" and I was taken aback. The lyrics are like this:

Two birds on a wire

One tries to fly away and the other

Watches him close from that wire

He says he wants to as well, but he is a liar

I realized in that moment that I was the second bird. At the time, I was 19 years old and living at home literally in my parents' basement while commuting to school. My parents made me apply to college when I hadn't wanted to and so I was attending simply because I had to, pursuing a major I hated while spiraling deeper and deeper into a messy depression. I was constantly saying that I was going to leave, that I was going to get out of my town and go far away, somewhere else, but I had neither the means nor the motivation at the time. I was stuck on my wire and foresaw a horrifying future for myself where I was stuck there, forever a basement dweller, never getting out of my one-horse town and never becoming a person I would actually like to be. 

My brother had said the comment so off-handedly, but it really stuck with me and I thought about it a lot. I realized I had to do more with my life and try to make the best of the hand I'd been dealt. I changed majors. I arranged to move into a language house on campus where I could better my German while living downtown in a much bigger city. I started to pursue fitness and weight loss, eventually losing 65 pounds. I started applying for internships in a field related to my new major and landed the best job I've ever had. My life really turned around and it's due, at least in part, to the realization I had thanks to my brother and this song. 

Has music or prose changed your life in some way? If so, what's your story?"

Need Advice Please,licensedthrowaway1,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/4phnco/could_this_ruin_an_offer_need_advice_please/,"I graduated recently with my BS in Accounting and a decent amount of credits but still short some accounting credits for full CPA certification eligibility (I can sit, just not be licensed). I was thinking of enrolling in a masters program to get those credits and also get a crack at recruiting again. I wasn't able to land any internships during undergrad so I think this would be a good chance to try again (I was heavily involved on campus and attended events, just couldn't break through I guess)

However, if I get an internship with a Big 4/Top 10 firm and land an offer, will dropping the master's program hurt me in anyway and possibly lose the offer? I am mainly interested in Audit, specifically IT Audit if that helps

I'm essentially doing it for the extra credits and recruitment opportunities through the grad school (I also plan to use my undergrad school as well to maximize opportunities and network). Neither I nor my family can afford the entire program, experience/career is the only reason I'm doing it and I'm not sure how it would look if I only took classes as a non degree seeking student without much experience. Or should I just stick it out I in the end and hope I'll be financially stable coming out of it? I'm honestly not sure where else to go with this anymore and am desperate to get an internship/full time job at a firm

Any help/advice would be greatly appreciated

Selling a condo under my SO name. Using proceeds to pay off our debt. I'm trying to get approved for the new home solo. I just switched jobs in April to accept this internship with an Oil company. It was a 20% hourly pay increase plus per diem. The broker said my numbers will be good to get approved for the amount I'm asking.

I got a preapproval letter with just him using rough numbers and used it to put in an offer on a house. It was accepted and now were under contract. He sent the verification form to my employer, and now I'm worried about the Intern status. I have been told by my boss that it's very unlikely that they'll let me walk away after the summer with my certs and background, but it was only verbal and from my boss not the director of the group. 

I called the Director this morning letting him know my intentions and asking if I can come on Intern status to get this approval, he said he'll talk with the VP since they are in a hiring freeze right now.

I'm just trying to see what you guys think my chances are getting approved are. I know HR will put Intern down for position and I dont know what theyll put for probability of continued employment. What should I do? I haven't told the Broker I was on Intern status. Just looking for good insight. "

My GPA is a 3.10 Overall and an accounting GPA of 3.33. During the time that I was in school I focused hard to catch up on my degree plan since I left Biology about halfway through due to having better job prospects in Accounting, and so I did not take any Internships, nor did I work in a relevant field during school (it was an office setting, just zero Accounting involved). I only had Accounting Society and VITA experience under my belt. Looking back it seems that I did make a mistake, but all I can do is look forward. I began applying for the following jobs just 2 fridays ago: Accounts Payable, Accounts Receivable Clerk, Entry Level Accountant, Jr Accountant, and Accounting Clerk jobs. I immediately received a call from a local recruiter and after a few days I am now in the position of them offering me a job as a Cash Applications Specialist. This is a position that does not require an Accounting degree, yet they insist it will be good experience for me and that it is roughly what i should expect coming out of college. The pay would be around $34,000 salaried. So my questions are this: Should i take this job? Am I being taken advantage of? Should I keep expecting to hear back from entry level accounting positions? or is there no hope.

I saw them once at Skate and Surf just as they reunited and man, did they tear shit up. I was alone in the crowd, and my ears were gone by the time the set was done. Sadly, my friend who I was with, had a seizure in a moshpit and had to be transported. 

Flash forward to this year, we had plans to go to the NYC date but something came up at work, and I made the smart decision to go to a company event since I am a new intern there, and she was also presented with a good professional opportunity for herself. Mind you, they also had another date in my home state in NJ. 

I also hit up another friend but he was too busy, and by the time I hit up my last option it was too late. The show was sold out and the tickets on stubhub were $90 and I was a little ""eh-ish"" about the setlist so I decided to stay home. I didn't want to go alone because while I know that it can be fun to go to shows alone, I really wanted to share the fun experience with my friends, and I made a promise to myself that I would be seeing them with others this time around. But by the time I did research about why it's good to go alone, it was too late, and when I looked up the setlist, it was totally banging, so now I am totally regretting missing it. 

I know I sound needy, but does anyone have any advice or whatnot on how to make myself feel better? 

TL;DR--Thrice is my favorite band, and while I did get to see them at Skate and Surf, I decided to miss out on their tour dates in NJ because I had no one to go with and did not want to go alone. Now I completely regret it and need some advice on how to cheer myself up. "

I'd appreciate any and all advice. This is all about self improvement.

I'm 22 and have never been in a relationship. There's a lot of reasons for it (shy, not particularly good looking, etc). Another reason is that I've always been very picky and can only think of maybe one or two girls off the top of my head that I really liked.

This summer I've moved to a new area (where I don't know anybody) for an internship and have been forcing myself to try new things and improve. I'm particularly forcing myself to leave my comfort zone, and that includes forcing myself to learn how to show my interest to a girl I like.

There's another intern (~22F) at my job that I've kind of fallen for. She's not just beautiful, but I just find her personality and spirit unique and amazing. The best way I could put it is that she's like if a sunny day could be a person. Every time I talk to her I feel like I'm laying in a field feeling the sun on my face and a light breeze blowing. Sorry if I sound a bit corny, it's just the best way I have to describe her.

I've been trying to show I like her, but I worry that I'm not making it obvious. I also have no idea how she feels about me. My impression is that she isn't interested in me. That's fine, I can deal with that. But I want to make sure I'm not giving up too soon. I've been guilty of that in the past, and I want to make sure I improve on that. So here is an overview of my interactions with her. 

First day we're some of the first people to show up for the intern introduction meeting. We talk on and off. As the internship continues, I don't see her often (we work in different departments). We did set up an intern group chat, so I talked to her a couple times on there about random things. I complimented her photography ability (she's an incredible photographer) and generally tried to react warmly to her through the group text.

On the day we took intern pictures, she came in in a dress. From what I can tell, she was excited about it. I overheard her talk to one of the other girls about wearing a dress for pictures and she sounded excited. So I thought it was a good opportunity to compliment her and show that I liked her. It was tough for me, I've never really complimented a girl before because I worry that I'll be seen as creepy or awkward. So I told her that I liked her dress, and that it was pretty. It went alright, she seemed surprised but it wasn't super awkward or anything.

Since then I've been looking for signals that she might like me as well, but haven't seen many. It's been a couple weeks since then. One of the few signs I can think of are her jokingly calling me her bff in the group text since I understood one of her obscure jokes, but that's not much. I've seen her a couple times at intern meetups but only a few times a week.

We're going hiking together this weekend. She is super into hiking, and I enjoy it as well. When i first moved into the area, she wrote up a big list of hiking places for me since I mentioned I wanted to try some places in the area but didn't know any. I've hiked at a couple places since then, but recently mentioned to her that I don't find doing long hikes as fun when I'm by myself. I was thrilled when she offered to come hiking with me sometime. I tried to play it off casually (""sure! sounds like fun, etc""), and sent her a text the next day asking if she was free to hike this weekend (I didn't want to ask her in person because I didn't want to pressure her to go, and I wanted to give her and opportunity to back out if she didn't want to). She said yes!

So now we're going hiking. Unfortunately, I'm pretty sure she's just going because she's super nice, not because she interested in me. But oh well, this is still a good sign that I'm learning to overcome my social anxiety a bit. And it will still be fun to hang out with her.

So I want opinions. How am I doing here? Am I too subtle? This is really tough for me, so I'm only going to be able to improve slowly.

God this was long. If anyone makes it this far, I really appreciate it.

TL;DR Tried to show intern girl I liked her. Don't know how it went. Trying to improve in general.

So, here is a little bit of background information. My ex boyfriend left for California at the beginning of May for an internship. Before he left we were both in the process of taking finals. I'm in nursing school while he is studying construction management. The stress was hard to endure for both of us while we weren't getting a lot of ""us"" time either. 

When he finally arrived to California I knew I would have to ""back off"" a little, meaning that we wouldn't have as much time to talk/text as we did when he was home because of the three hour time difference. I broke down and told him what was hurting me, how he wasn't making time for me before he left, I wasn't getting the assurance or affection I needed, and on top of it all we were having countless arguments. 

I went days without talking and when we did talk it would end up in another argument. When I was ready to talk again and try to work on our relationship is when he wasn't. He turned the tables on me. He is now saying things like ""we've dug a hole too deep."" or ""we can't work on things right now."" and ""I wish it didn't have to come to this because I do truly love you."" 

Every time I talked to him again I found myself looking like a fool begging for him back. It's been a month and a half since our break up and two weeks since we last spoke. It's killing me. Not only did I lose a relationship of over two years but a friendship of over ten years. I miss him everyday and just wish he knew how sorry I truly was. 

They say if somebody wants to be with you they would. I find myself counting down the days until he comes back home in August. 



Please help!

   
**tl;dr**: Do you think it is possible we can work on things again? How much space should you give someone without having the person forget about you? Does he just need space? What do guys experience during break ups?"
4pk854,4,2016-06-23,Small companies vs Medium-Large sized firms for Little-No Experience Accounting Graduates,quantitative_fun,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/4pk854/small_companies_vs_mediumlarge_sized_firms_for/,"Right now, I'm applying to accounting/AR/AP clerk and analyst positions on Indeed to look for a full-time job. I graduated with an accounting degree a month ago.

Most of my friends can’t help me with this because they have gotten job offers through their co-op work terms so they don't need to deal with this. I never took an internship so I need to figure out the best way to find a job.

I have three questions that I’m hoping someone can help me with.

1)

As far as I know, the majority of recent graduate accounting jobs for big companies such as the Big 4 are posted in September. 

From what I've experienced so far, the small companies I've applied to require someone to fill in ASAP. This means they don't have the budget or time to hire someone with zero experience to train them.

Larger firms have the time and money to train recent graduates with no experience, but I believe they still take the candidates with most experience, such as someone that already took an internship at their company. This is due to the large volume of applications sent to big companies.

Both large and small firms do not care about your GPA. GPA only matters to large firms when seeking for internships because there is little other criteria to judge a candidate.

Is this all true?

2)

I've been getting interviews from small companies but only because my resume includes accounting experience I've worked with in startups at my school. All the interviews I've had so far were at companies that were only looking for one candidate, so there was someone more qualified than me at those times.

I know that if I keep grinding out these interviews and job applications, I'll eventually get a job. However, I prefer to work at a big firm such as the Big 4 first before deciding whether I want to stay or to move to a smaller firm.

Since September (recent grad hiring season) is coming up soon, how much of a chance do I have landing a recent grad position at the Big 4 or any other large company after already having graduated for a year?

3)

I know that one difference between large and small firms is that large firms have the money to train you. I will most likely be competing against candidates without relevant work experience. Will I have the advantage if I spent the summer after graduation working at small companies, or will most of the qualified candidates already have relevant work experience?

Well in the last month I've been through a ton. I finished up my last quarter of the school year, and jumped into my internship down in LA. I will say it's going very well, my job is very demanding but I'm getting alot done. I still feel a little nervous at work, the hours are really long and I've had a bit of trouble keeping up. But overall I'm doing a good job.

My social life has been way been way better without her in my life. My ex used to consistently slam me for being antisocial and out of sync with people- I don't drink, smoke, etc. And as a college student she made me feel like that was pretty damn abnormal and shitty. Really it was just because that's what she was into and I think she may have needed validation that it was the right path- thus resulting in her treating me like my choices were radical/stupid. Last weekend I ran downtown to a brewery with a bunch of people and had a great time even though I didn't get a drink. Just enjoyed some company.

I still think about her alot though- that's the thing that hasn't left me. I sometimes get distracted at work because I'm thinking of her, thinking of being back with her, or her being with other people, hooking up, going out, whether she'll get through school, whether she'll even live in the same town when I get back in a few months. Any of it. I had a dream about her a few nights back. In this dream she was being a huge jerk and wouldn't talk to me, so I guess that's a good thing. It's shitty that after a couple months I still had a dream about her, but at least I didn't have a dream about her being the raddest person ever. 

I think I'm starting to let go. She's no longer this person that I want or need to see again, or have the support of, or throw my support into and see succeed. I don't really care if she thinks I'm a complete shithead, and I don't care if the phone call I received two days after we last talked was from her (the number was blocked, didn't answer because I was in class). 

I haven't connected with anyone else the way I connected with her. Looking back I still can't believe some of the conversations we had- the level of understanding was pretty unreal. But she was not the one for me. It's going to take a little time to find the right girl, but she'll be waiting for the best version of myself that I can muster up. 

Side note: In the past month I have started learning japanese, practiced and significantly improved at drawing, read an excellent book (Zen and Motorcycle Maintenance, I highly recommend), and should be doing some serious car work in the next couple weekends. The world has really opened up. Here's to a good month."
4pl81h,5,2016-06-24,Life is good [0].,blobcat123,trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/4pl81h/life_is_good_0/,"I apologize if this doesn't belong here, but I felt the need to share. I'm going through a difficult part of my use of cannabis at this point. Recently, my parents have been coming down harder and harder on me for using pot. I had a lot of childhood issues, and throughout the years I found it easier to obsess over anything else, because it let me escape my life's problems (bullying, or depression whatever, but it was something that was making my life not okay). Also recently, I have gone through amazing personal development to realize that no one is to blame and I am now living life for myself :) 



However, my parents believe my pot use to be a ""bad habit"" or a ""problem"" and my answer is always the same.


Me: ""I don't need ANYthing or ANYone other than myself to be happy. It's the summer after my freshman year in college and I am also working 40 hours a week. Pot is my relaxation and my way to explore life's various facets. It isn't a problem, and I wish you wouldn't worry unnecessarily, is there anything I can do to alleviate your concern?""


My mom always replied with (because she was the one constantly remanding me for my use for whatever reason and this is the same interaction that ensued everytime) : Okay fine, just be careful. I still don't approve of this but whatever. 


But her reply was basically just brushing it off until later to ""get out of my hair"". 



One night, I came home and both my parents confronted me. My dad told me that if I didn't stop using pot, he wouldn't be cosigning my college loans anymore. I looked to my mom for help but she gave me a look that said, ""I understand, and I am fine with you doing it, but this is really between you and your father now"". 



I felt so betrayed! How could my mom, who was the only one with a problem with it, do this to me? To escalate this so far, that now it is my Dad's concern as well??!!! And then she wouldn't even help me???


So I looked to my Dad, staying calm and said 


""You're claiming that this is a 'bad habit' and that this 'problem' is what will ruin my future. My dream is to graduate college, and to get a job in corporate. Right now, all I can do is work part time, and I have a Marketing job related to my major on campus, as well as an internship lined up for next summer. If you decide to follow through with what you're saying, who or what is actually ruining my life? Pot or you?""


My mom at this point looked up at my dad and showed a look of understanding on her face as this logic seemed to pass through both of their heads. My dad responded with 


""I wont agree with your use, but how do we know its not a problem? We think you need help from a therapist.""



And so I asked them to follow me on a trust exercise between us. I told them that I would give them my backpack (which contained all of my weed and weed stuff) for the month and remain clean for the month, if they BOTH promised to give it back. 



I also promised to see a therapist. Perhaps a professional will help me to orient and frame my past a little better than I, as some of it still comes back to haunt me from time to time 

The way I see it now.


-I have two amazing parents paying for my mental health's improvement. 


-My father recently cosigned a loan for the next year of school.


-I have an internship lined up.


-I have a good employment for now and for when I get back to school. 


-I will have had an almost month long t break in 6 days, and I cannot wait for that. 



I apologize again for the wall of text, but this was for every other ent facing similar conditions of conservative religious parents and the adversarial struggle that is enjoying cannabis :)

TH;DR
Life is good, and if it isn't right now, work more on how you can alleviate the concerns of your loved ones in a rational manner :)

4plrf2,51,2016-06-24,I (24f) just took ex (21f) to be admitted to hospital because of suicidal thoughts. Worried it's a mistake not to tell her mom,Throwaway98705,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4plrf2/i_24f_just_took_ex_21f_to_be_admitted_to_hospital/,"Sorry for this being longer than intended. Totally understand if you only read the tldr.

Tldr: took my ex to the ER to be admitted for being suicidal. She's begged me not to tell her mom because her mom will make her move back home. I'm wondering if I should tell anyways.


I broke up with my ex about a month ago, but we still live together for another month because shes supposed to be leaving for a multi month internship in another state in about a month. 

She deals with a lot of depression, a personality disorder, and had attempted suicide when she was 19. For the past several months she had talked about suicide a lot, but refused to get help or even take her meds regularly. This was a big part of why we broke up. I couldn't take the stress anymore. She would tell me she was thinking of suicide and then ask me to do stuff. I'd be out with friends, and then she would spend the next couple days talking about suicide. If we argued about anything, even things like her folding the laundry sometimes, it guaranteed she would talk about how terrible she was and should kill herself. Also she's trans and sometimes  she'd compare how we look and talk about how much worse she felt she looked.  Like she would compliment my breasts and then talk about how ugly hers are and how pointless living was since she wasn't going to grow breasts like mine. She'd refuse to listen when I'd try to tell her that I've been developing since 11, she's only been for a few years and it takes time.  In the end, I couldn't take living like this. 

Well once we broke up, this didn't stop. It got worse. Things came to a head 3 days ago when she started telling me how she planned to kill herself, that I shouldn't blame myself when it happens, and refused to promise that she wouldn't do it in the next couple days. At that point I told her that she had to choose, I would either call her mom or 911. At that time, she chose her mom. Her mom was all set to drive for about 5 hours to come get her, but she convinced her mom that she would start her meds again and seek help so not to come up.

Today though, she texted me while at work and told me she needed to go to a hospital because she was going to do something if she didn't. So I left work early and took her to an er. She made me promise not to tell her mom though because her mom would definitely make her move back home if she found out. She's semi financially dependent on her mom still so her mom could force her to do it. 

It's just that they had to move her to another hospital that had an open bed, and that place has a 1 star rating online. There's a about 23 posts specifically about how terrible their mental health facilities are and how they just force people to stay to milk insurance. It also really worries me that since she is trans, the place is gonna try to do something like put her with men and make her dysphoria worse.

I'm really worried it's a mistake not to tell her mom. Like if this place is bad, then I don't even know if I can do anything to help her get out. Like wouldn't that be something that you need family to sign to get you out ? And isn't her mom going to find out anyways since she is on her mom's insurance?

I'm also really scared that this means she's not going to go on the internship and will want to stay living with me. I can't take living with her for some unknown period of time. I really want to move on with life and date other people, but don't feel comfortable doing that while she's here. Part of me thinks I want to call just because it will force her out of the apartment. Isn't it really selfish and wrong if that is my motivation though?

So should I keep my promise to keep it a secret from her mom? Will it hurt her for me to break her trust by telling? Will it hurt her more for me not to tell?



UPDATE: thanks everyone that responded. I just got done calling her mom. She agreed not to try to contact my ex at the hospital until after I have a chance to talk to her. She definitely wants my ex to move back home though. At this point, it's just waiting for calling hours so I can talk to her tonight."
4plvd4,5,2016-06-24,I need to vent.,Iamaloneanddepressed,bipolar,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/4plvd4/i_need_to_vent/,"I want to apologize first for just coming out and posting and not knowing the decorum for this particular sub I just have too much on my mind. I need to get it out so I can sleep. Maybe my words will resonate or mean something to a bunch of strangers.

A little about me without saying too much. I am 24, diagnosed type 2 bipolar,   I have had at least three manic episodes since my late teens and was hospitalized last October for wanting to kill myself. I dropped my classes for the quarter and didn't work. When I got out I agreed to get help again. I started getting help at a place that work with mental illness and eating disorders because in addition to being bipolar I have disordered eating. I starved myself, restrict, binge and purge and overall have a poor relationship with food. I deal with a lot of situational anxiety around food and other people. I have panic attacks and shut down when I feel overwhelmed by food or people or situations. I am also a closeted bisexual to my immediate family and most friends. I told my girlfriend of 4 years and two friends who no longer talk to me. My discomfort around eating keeps me isolated because I hate situations involving eating around people. So this is a bit about me. 

Lately I have felt lonely and more anxious in my isolation. I live with my parents right now because I can't afford to live on my own because I am school and only working part time. I recently got a kitchen job washing dishes. My girlfriend of 4 years is doing an internship in Washington DC all the while I am in Seattle, WA a great distance. I wake up depressed because she is not coming back until September and I can't visit until August. I also feel anxious about potentially moving in together in a few months and me still working through my food issues. I have contemplated going back to smoking or self harm because she isn't around to see the wreck I am right now. I sleep poorly.


I apologize for this all amounting to a massive word soup or vomit I just felt like I had to write this all out. I feel alone. I miss my girlfriend. I live with my parents but I feel alone because no one seems to know or care what goes on in my head. If I died spontaneously or disappeared I don't think a lot of people would be at a loss. I don't have any friends besides my girlfriend and my job is not very significant. I am a long way from where I want to be academically. I want to starve myself thin again but then I just end up eating my emotional and feeling sick and gaining weight back. I feel like a massive wreck.


Thank you to anyone who gave thought to reading this. I always felt more comfortable bleeding out to strangers on the Internet more than people I know.

4pm1ku,30,2016-06-24,"My story and something that has been bothering me about ""nicotine addiction""",brownman19,electronic_cigarette,https://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/4pm1ku/my_story_and_something_that_has_been_bothering_me/,"Please excuse any typos as I am in the midst of jetlag from overseas travel and typing this on my phone.

I am in my early twenties and never smoked a thing in my life until I got to college at 18. I occassionally smoked cigarettes at the bars when I drank but stopped after a few weekends of doing that. I had mild cravings for a few days after that, especially when I drank at the bars but it was manageable.

Then my friends introduced me to hookah and I loved how it was less harsh on the lungs and tasted great. Fast forward a few months and I was smoking hookah (along with some other ""herbs""), everday. I enjoyed the activity greatly and loved the idea of large amounts of smoke. I also read all the (bullshit) research on hookah and my friends and I (we are both stellar science students who do some amazing undergraduate research in our own fields, neurobiology and biomedical engineering) decided to do our own research and deemed hookah smoking is a lot less carcinogenic than cigarettes, and continued our habit. Sure, it wasn't good for us as nothing but air in your lungs really is, but to this day I can say I never developed any nasty health problems from properly prepared hookah bowls (that actually vaporized the glycerin and nicotine covering the tobacco with no combustion) that I saw in my cigarette smoking friends. My pulmonary exams and respiratory tests came out perfect every time (had to take them for internships). 

I then went on vacation with family for 2 months halfway across the world. I was going from a hookah bowl or two every day along with a few bowls of the other stuff to absolutely no smoking for 2 months, cold turkey. I never had any withdrawal symptoms from what I could tell. My caffeine withdrawal headaches were infinitely worse than anything I could have presumably felt from nicotine/tobacco cessation. I thought it was weird but just shrugged it off...

A few months later, I got tired of setting up and smoking hookah bowls every day and it was expensive! I looked for alternatives and came across vaping. It started with small dinky disposable e-hookahs, then EVOD/eGo set ups, then mech mods. Finally box mods came about and I was vaping up a storm every day, doing crazy subohm builds and loving every moment with 3-6mg juices.

I was fortunate enough to never get really sick in my two years of vaping until a couple months ago. I got a nasty upper respiratory infection and developed bronchitis. I decided to quit vaping, ready for the horrors of withdrawal. A day later, nothing. 2 days, 3 days, 4 days, nothing. A week later, absolutely nothing. I had zero cravings or withdrawals while I sat there in misery wishing my nose would become unclogged and I would stop coughing up wads of greenish sputum. But I never once wished ""man I really need a toke"". 

I have read the research on nicotine and can safely say it is pretty similar to caffeine in terms of CNS and cardiovascular effects with a possible carcinogenity profile. However, I would venture to guess my McDonalds cheeseburger and milkshake has done more damage to me than a day of vaping.

It also makes me question the validity of doctors in the field of cigarette and nicotine ""addiction"". How come when I ocassionally smoked cigarettes, I had cravings yet daily heavy vaping and hookah smoking did not remotely give me the same results? 

I truly think doctors, especially those who have never smoked anything, try to treat tobacco/nicotine addiction as a physiological problem and it perpetuates the stereotype that you will become addicted if you smoke X or Y, whether it is cigarette analogs or vaping or hookah. That is a Catch-22 and makes the issue inadvertently psychological because people are trained to think that they are addicted to these things. My research has told me otherwise and here I am, baffled at how I haven't had the slightest craving or withdrawal symptom after 2 months of cessation from all nicotine or smoking products. 

Can anyone chime in and/or provide some papers on this issue? I would think that cigarette addictions come from other compounds in the combustion of tobacco, such as the aldehydes, much like how research shows alcohol hangovers might come from the metabolism of ethanol to acetaldehyde and drinking more can overcome that hangover, hence hair of the dog). Could it be that nicotine causes mainly psychological dependence (due to the societal notion that it is very addictive) and it is actually not all that awful? I'm really confused and frustrated by the possible misinformation that has been spread around on this subject for years. Doctors are always welcome to comment.


Tl;dr: smoked cigarettes for about a month 3-4 times a week, had cravings and mild withdrawals. Smoked hookah (correctly prepared to vaporize) for a year daily and quit cold turkey with no withdrawals. Chain vaped daily (sub ohm, mech, high wattage, 3-6 mg juice) and quit cold turkey, no withdrawalw or cravings from day 1 to now day 62. What the hell is going on?"

I started visiting a therapist and after a few months I felt much better  and went on to be pretty happy and fine for about 2 and half a years.

 Then about 6 months ago a series of events led me to feel very depressed and I broke down and went into an anxious state. It got somewhat better in the weeks after, but then  the summer started and all of my friends moved away and I moved in with my cousin to start an internship. Now my anxiety is at the worst it's ever been. I have a lot of anxiety over health and often freak out thinking I have various diseases and practically convince myself I am having the symptoms. Recently I have started freaking out something is wrong with my brain like I have MS or something. When I get anxious I sometimes feel like I have to faint and I will get headaches or I will sometimes feel numb. I also struggle with derealization. Recently I have had started really struggling to talk to people because it's almost like my mind is so anxious I can't think of words to say. When I am having conversations with people it's almost like I can't focus on what they're saying and I feel like I'm zoning out.  Just in the past couple of days I have started doing a weird tunnel vision thing where my eyes focus on one thing and it almost feels like I'm zoning out and not being able to focus on like noises in the background. Then I start to have a panic attack thinking something is seriously wrong with me or I'm going crazy.

 Also I have been feeling hopeless like I will never be happy or feel normal again. I haven't been able to really talk to my friends or family about it because they have a hard time understanding so I've been feeling so alone. I want to go see a doctor and make sure nothing is seriously wrong with me or go back and start seeing a therapist but I'm just really scared and since I really haven't talked to my family about these feelings it would be hard to explain why I feel the need to go to a doctor. I hope this makes sense. Has anyone else experienced these same things or have any advice?

Hello, /r/GiftofGames ! Here I am once again requesting videogames! My motivation is still the same from the last time, as you guys will notice down below.

___

**What I want**

I was always really scared of horror games. I used to run away even from Resident Evil titles, but I've been working on these senseless fears for a while. I believe the turning point was Bloodborne: even though it is not a horror game, it scared me quite a few times, and the whole atmosphere is also very creepy. I also play with a very good pair of headphones, so it took me a while to get used to creatures moaning in the distance and kosm creatures jumping on me from the bushes.

After this I decided to get into more scary stuff. I went to a friends house and played a Slender game for the Xbox One. It was not exactly good, but I got really scared during some moments. It was 4 in the morning and my friend's presence wasn't exactly helping.

But then came my girlfriend. She LOVES horror movies, and nowadays she's very into videogames. She's currently using my Vita, and she is almost beating her second game this month (Gravity Rush, the last one was Ghost of Sparta). Every weekend she comes to my place and we play games or watch movies. There are some problems though, like the lack of couch coop games in modern consoles. We decided to play single player games, but we are always switching who's in control.

The first *horror* game we tried was Outlast. I kinda disliked the game. She loved it, but she still can't handle FPS controls. We went into the action genre for a bit, she completed Metal Gear Rising and almost managed to beat Bayonetta (it is way harder than MGRR, but we'll return to it someday).

When Until Dawn got released, everyone in her class was talking about this game. She did her research and loved the game. We talked about it for a while, but since I couldn't afford it at the time we left this game for a future opportunity.

Until Dawn looks amazing! I love this kind of adventure games (like those old PC classics), and this modern approach on this genre is formidable. Multiple endings, the whole atmosphere, good graphics and good acting... man, I always wanted this game, but I can never get a good deal, or when I do find one copy at a good price I can't buy it (like **RIGHT NOW**).

I love my gaming moments with my girlfriend, and I believe this game would offer me an amazing experience with her!

___

**Why can't I buy it**

I got some money after selling my LTD guitar, but I compromised most of this money to pay for college. And I can't really ask my mother for money. I mean, I'm 23, jobless (I can't count my internship as a real job) and my mother is already going to give me a nice couch next month (I'm getting ready to move with my girlfriend as soon as I get a better job, so this is a very welcome gift).

I also NEED to buy a motorcycle, so most of my money is getting saved for our new house, new bike and college. I'm not poor (just gifted some 3DS games this month), but sometimes one can't spend his money at his will. I have my priorities kinda sorted, but the need for new videogames is real.

So, please, help me get some nice scary moments with my girlfriend!"

One of the tasks I've been given is to shorten the control ID's for each web part.  An alternative I've started poking around at is to change the ClientIDMode property to static.  Now, I can do this in the web.config, but i've been warned that this could cause problems with the Kentico admin interface.  I should also be able to set this property using a web part, so it works on a page by page basis.  Has anyone tried something like this before, and if so, any pointers as to how to go about implementing this?"
4poc3o,22,2016-06-24,"This series has destroyed my romantic life (removed from /r/asoiaf, was told you guys might like it)",LegalSC,asoiafcirclejerk,https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiafcirclejerk/comments/4poc3o/this_series_has_destroyed_my_romantic_life/,"I'm not one of the OGs of this community. I wasn't reading these books in the 90's, I wasn't there to whine about season 1 inconsistencies with the books. But I really started to devour this story as soon as I was exposed to it.

I didn't pay attention to the ads and the posters. I didn't care about Seen Bean on an uncomfortable looking chair. But all the same, someone finally convinced me to watch the show. 

I got to the end of episode 1 and had read ""A Game of Thrones"" before next week's episode. By the time season 2 started, I had read through the whole series twice, and by the time the third season started I had read enough to convince myself that ""A Feast for Nuncles"" was the best book in the series.

Here's where the problem starts. I can't seem to talk about anything else. People ask about things that happen outside the story (I think it's called reality) and I draw a blank.

They ask me about that jerk, king Stanley, and suddenly, I can't keep my mouth shut about how Stannis is misunderstood, how he's the rightful King of Westeros, how he kept his daughter warm while every other girl in the North was freezing, how all the usurpers would get their due when the rightful king came into his kingdom...and that some would lose more than fingers.

My love life has become this: ""Hey I like that show with Kelly C. and her dragons too! That Melly Sanders though...I think she's just using Stanley Barton.""

Apparently, to me, that's a carte blanch to force my worst theories on people, irrespective of what normal humans would actually be discussing. ""What do you do?"" she says. ""What are your plans for the future?"" Like that shit has anything to do with what we're talking about. Instead I say:

""This show had the only self professed atheist in the books burn his only child alive because he thought the fiery man would make it not snow for a bit!"" She looks confused, but still tries to keep the conversation going. ""Where did you go to school?"" she says.

""And anyway, we're really supposed to believe that the greatest military commander in Westeros would walk on foot to his target, with no scouts, no siege weaponry, no cavalry, no nothing except for the barely paid dudes next to him!?""

""I think....I think I'm gonna go,"" she says.

I don't notice, I'm ranting to the chair she sat in three days ago, saying ""And where the fuck was the 'Even the cook' quote? How can you even put this shit on TV and claim it's the same character?""

Inexplicably, this girl stopped talking to me. After the last episode though, she tentatively tried to communicate with me like I was a person again.

""I liked when those dragons did some things..."" She says, trying to ignore that I've spent the last few months ranting about the North having amnesia and Varys being a Blackfyre/merling hybrid who shaves his head not to disguise his Targaryen heritage, but because he thinks it looks super cool.

This poor woman had spent weeks hearing me rant. She could tune it out with Netflix, but at night, when she closed her eyes all she could hear was a muffled, ""Then we shall make new lords, Ser Davos"" coming from the hallway.

On more than one occasion she had to tell her boss she would be late because some guy was outside muttering ""the mummer's farce is almost done"" or something something ""smirking worm"" something something ""wearing a dragon's name.""

Still, every couple weeks she'd try to strike up a conversation again. On the few occasions we weren't discussing punishing the usurpers, she was typically turning down my unsolicited offers of meat pies.

I'm still not sure she understood why I asked her to play ""The Rat Cook"" but she doesn't seem to miss her cousins much.

Then HBO decided to air what they called an episode. Apparently some one in their office asked, ""who the fuck would watch this?"" ""No one,"" Mylod answered, ""No one in their right mind."" 

And so, an episode got its name.

I know this will stretch your ability to believe this obviously true story, but there was an intern who claimed to enjoy ""No One."" She tried to tell the director that it was worth putting on a screen.

""Didn't you watch?"" Said Mylod. ""The waif shut the door behind her. Super lucky for mastermind Arya, right? I bet cutting a candle would have looked really dumb with the front door open. I'll laugh if people watch this shit.""

And so, an episode made it to TV.

After hearing Jaqen/Gendry (next post) tell Arya that because she had acted like a moron, she was truly ""no one,"" I became silent. I sat down in the hallway outside the room of the girl who once asked about my opinion, thus proving we were super serious.

I let the torrent of HBO dialogue wash over me. ""Bad poosy."" ""Your sister."" Is all I could hear while I saw flashbacks of Areo Hotah being killed with a letter opener.

The words echoed again and again. I began to question my basic assumptions about reality. ""Your sister,"" he said, ""did they think I'd get confused by Littlefinger's pet cat?""

I was lost. I wondered if maybe I had given the wrong impression by ordering capon at Applebees. That maybe waffle house doesn't have rashers of bacon and two of those little fish. Even my nuncle frowned when the grease dribbled down my chin.

As my world fell apart, my mind was consumed with the repetition of ""your sister"" again and again. ""Why did they cut to credits on that? Does it mean something? Should they have cut to credits after 'Bad poosy?'""

And so I sat in silence, slumped against the wall. This poor woman, our main character, thought she might be able to step outside her own door because I hadn't said ""Stannis,"" ""Usurper,"" or ""By right"" for nearly fifteen minutes. Maybe the crazy man had left the hallway.

She cracked open the door ever so slightly; she even went so far as to peak around the corner and say, ""hello?""

I'm sure you all know what happened next. ""Hello"" obviously meant, ""please be really patronizing and tell me all the things I couldn't read into the text on my own."" So naturally, a 5'8"" man(ish?) kicked in her door and yelled ""Stannis is the one true king! Benjen is Daario! What do you know about time traveling fetuses?""

I'm really not sure why I'm still single, I'm not even sure why Cleganebowl can't just happen regardless of narratives making sense.

I can only imagine now that she's super busy. I haven't heard a word since I tried to demonstrate D+D=T in person, so she's probably just stuck reevaluating everything in the light of an obvious truth.

She used to go outside and stuff but ever since that one time that she tried to talk to the guy who liked dragons, she's only been willing to talk to the guys who are aware that the Cleveland Calves exist.

I can't help but wonder if these books are interfering with my ability to relate to my peers.

Edit: A few portions seemed slightly out of touch with reality."

So I graduated from school a year ago with a degree in audio (Mostly post-production).  I managed to find an internship at a small (very small) audio company in Chicago, and I've been there for about a year.  But at this point, it's pretty clear that it isn't going anywhere.

I'm really struggling to find any kind of work.  Any kind of studio in the Chicago area is only hiring people with years and years of experience.  So I'm pretty SOL there.  And most smaller/freelance jobs either require that I have my own equipment (Which I can't afford because I can't find a job) or don't pay.

I can't afford to move.  I can't afford any nice equipment.  I can't afford to work for free.  For those of you that are making it in the industry, if you had to start all over again from my current position, what would you do?  "

Wall of text below. Might contain typos. 


Hi fellow redditors! As title suggests, after 3.5 years of relationship, my ex (Jane) and I broke up. I am having trouble moving on and I was thinking about her every day. The guilt of not knowing whether I did the right thing was killing me. I really want her back but I am unsure whether it was appropriate. 


Background:

Jane and I knew each other since middle school but we didnt really talk until university. We were both studying overseas, five thousand miles away from our home. We were in the same course in uni and we hit it off very quickly. Jane basically spent the entire day in my dom for the first year and by second year of university, be moved in together. We spent the third year living together as well. We are serious about our relationship, talking about marriages and financial arrangement for the marriage and how much money we should save for it monthly when we start working, where to get mortgages etc. We were inseparable at the time and we were both crazy for each other. We were best friend and we can talk about anything. I would say our relationship with each other is prefect when we are not arguing with each other. 

 The relationship was so loving and caring until we had fights. The subject matter of the fight are usually trivial, sometimes I dont really get why we fight. The frequency of the fight is roughly once every two weeks. The usually flow is like this: she criticized me -&gt; I said yes to all her criticism -&gt; I still get annoyed but I didnt want to talk about it in that exact moment -&gt; she get annoyed -&gt; I burst out -&gt; she burst out too -&gt; she cries in the end because she felt we could not agree on anything -&gt; I got soften and we resolve the matter usually compromising in the middle. I said yes to all her criticism at first because I dont want to argue with her. The matters are so trivial and the argument was so painful for both of us so I dont want to argue at all. But I just could not hide my emotions from my face and that is how fights break out. Later on, we both learn to communicate better but it usually ends up me saying yes. ( I got better at hiding and not caring as much so I can take her criticism better) I will still give my countering opinion but in a more calming manner but I had a feeling that I became the 'yes man'.

After 3 years of living together, our course ended and we both move backed to our home. To qualify to work in the profession we studied in our home country, we need to take one more year of post graduate studies. The selective process is quite hard and usually half of the people doesn't get in. 

Both she and me are obviously nervous about getting into the program. She got the offer first. I was so nervous and pessimistic and I basically told her than I would not get in. I start saying if I could not get in, it will be the end of my career and I would not deserve her. ( Well I know how it sounds now.) She tries comforting me but I told her I need some space alone and I didnt see her for a week. Later, she could not get into the program because she failed in some very easy test and need to apply for next year. The next day I got my offer, presumably taking her place. She took it lightly. I tries to comfort her but she said she was not upset at all. She ended up getting into another program to spend the year, which she really liked.  This incident was quoted as one of the reason for our break up. She did not elaborate more the exact reason why this troubles her so much and I am confused. 

I admit I am an insecure person on my career. I had extreme good public exam record, but I struggled in university. We provided great support to each other but I was very grateful for that. Without her, I probably would not be able to graduate, let alone doing the post graduate program that I wanted to. She was also critical of my physical appearance and I could see where it was coming from as I need to be presentable. I would also complain to her my future in a very pessimistic way. She would give me a few cheer up, but get extreme frustrated after a few sentences when I disagree with her. During breakup, she said she felt like a sister to me, taking care of me all the time. 

We both knew moving back to our home will be a great challenge for us. Renting a flat together is simply not possible because of how expensive the rent is. However, we still tries to see each other as much as possible and skype as much as possible. We text each other everyday. Of course as we are now doing different courses and living separately, there are some distances between us. We still managed to be as loving as possible and tried our best in communicating. 

 During the course of our studies, we both made new friends. She used to be insecure about my female friends during undergrad but not here. She said she didnt care much because she knew our relationship was very stable. In the other hand, all her new friends were male. She had a history of only knowing guys friend because she thought females are annoying. (which I totally agrees, part of the reason I loved her is because she is just like a dude with vagina, very straight forward, no bull shit style. She joked she had a micro penis all along). I had no problem at all. Things got complicated towards the end of our relationship. Several of her friends develop feelings for her. She turned down most but kept one still going.I will name him (X). The reason was that X was a mature student, with a senior managing position. He said he could get her an intern position. She said she need to keep 'hooking' him to secure the internship. Our field is very competitive and I know it is some kind of an agreed acceptable 'practice' so I support fully of her action only on one condition that she fully disclosed her action to me. She told me she was not proud of this and this was her darkest secret. I comforted her and supported her. The was like 3 weeks before our break up. I told her that we would try our best to handle this situation and even if it fails, we are not meant for each other (literal wording) . She burst into tears after this. After she calmed down, she said she was hurt because I view our relationship pessimistically. It was like a glass half full/ empty mentality. I was confused and explained that I didnt mean that and all I wanted to say is we had to try our best in keeping our relationship alive. I dont think she understand (or willing to understand). 


A few days later she told me she drew a picture. She finished exam earlier than me and she would draw sometimes to pass time. It was an unicorn with blood bleeding from its eyes. She told me later that she channeled all her negative energy into the picture when listening to blue music and it was the masterpiece of her life. I did not know what to think about this. I was busy for my last week of exam so I complemented her drawing but I did not relate the two things together until the break up. She did not express any discontent towards our relationship between the showing of the drawing and the earlier conversion, at least not I could remember. But as I said, I was in exam and I would miss some subtle hints. 




In hindsight, I should respond more positively to her comfort and acknowledge more of her effort in cheering me up and show more appreciation. I also think I did my fair share of support for her. She has her own insecurities and things that can improve on and I supported her all along in terms of her development. I thought we complement each other as she sometimes talk without thinking the consequences and I express my feelings too little. I dont think the support is one sided and I think her comment is uncalled for. 


So after the conversion with X, within a day or 2 she got her job. She was very surprised about it too. Her work would commence on the next week. I was a little upset because it would means that we could not spend anytime together after the exam. I had to start working in middle July so it left us about a month to spend time together. Our field has very long working hours, a lot of times until 10 PM. Therefore I cherish a lot about the last month when we can spend our time freely together. But I didnt tell her about this as I want to support her venture as much as possible. But I didnt think I hide the emotion sufficiently . In hindsight, she may think that I was jealous/insecure out her new internship similar to **problem 2/4**. Her work would commence right after my exam, (it is about 2 week before the breakup). 

My family has planned a much waited family trip after my exam. I could only see her twice for dinner before I leave with my family for a week. 

The first dinner was when she has just started the work and she told me X was with her all the day. She told me they spend sometime together shopping and was amused by X's fully of love face. She said X would stare at her like a little puppy and she found this amusing and I admitted that I am not a big person as I thought I am to be and I was a little disturbed by it. Nonetheless I did not say anything. She was talking on phone with X during our meal for 15 minutes and I was not pleased from that. We once agreed that using the phone when you are having meal with your SO is not respectful. Towards the end of the meal she said she was not feeling well and I sent her back home. 

The second dinner was similar. She seemed cold and distant to me. She told me I should not find her as often and I should find something else to do. Both of us know how precious our free time is together and I was quite upset. She said again she was not feeling well when she did not had any symptoms in the beginning of the meal. I has getting suspicious and upset that she did not want to see me so maybe I did not show too much care for her alleged sickness. She also quoted this as the reason of breaking up that I was not caring for her. I did try to explain to her at our break up but it was quite emotional and I did not think she get the message.


**The breakup**

  Next day I went with my family for vacation. For the first few days we texted fine. One day she suddenly sounded so cold and I asked her why. She got defensive and she told me that I was over-burdening on her. I told me she wanted to think about 'what is left in our relationship' and we should not communicate for the rest of my trip. I got scared fearing the relationship and after some discussion, we agreed to do so to clear her mind. I was crying outside of the hotel room for a few hours. That night was rough. The next night she apologize to be via text that she backed off because of my 'depression' and told me that she was sorry. I had a lengthy discussion with her and I promised I will be more positive. I also learned about the emotions contained in the picture she painted and I tried to explained that I am very optimistic about our relationship and I did not mean what she thought I mean. (Honestly I am not sure what she thought it means). I didnt press her to talk more in depth but just giving her my view of things during the discussion. The following few days we loosely texted and did not talk about it again. I was trying to give her as much space as possible and prevent overloading her. 


When I come back from the family vacation, we were meant to go to our own vacation after two days. She said she wanted to re-ignite our relationship during our trip. I offered to talk about our problem in the airport that she could talk to me whenever she felt like. 

Long story short, she was extremely pissy and critical of my action ( for example, when we were walking side by side, there was a spider web on my side and I turned to walk behind her on her side. She was frustrated about that and told me that I was not protecting her and expose her to danger.) I was pretty upset but I asked her to considered my feelings several times. She would agree and said sorry but continue doing so. I could not stand it and finally asked her what is going on. She told me she wanted to break up with me. She said I was a burden to her. She wanted to work on herself and for self-development without the burden of relationship. She said she does not want to be a relationship currently. I didnt resist it because I saw it miles away. She also told me that she was a selfish person to break up with me. Anyways, I was so heart broken and I did not want to know more about the reason. I bought a plane ticket immediately and flew back to my home. 


However, I screwed up after the break up by asking her can we just have sex one more time. I guess I was just looking for something to do to get the situation off my mind. I know it was so shitty and it was the only thing that I really regretted for the whole relationship. I apologized to her on the spot and before I left. We didnt cry, no argument and things went calmly. She was even texting happily on the phone :(



I wonder if I  was appropriate to fly back home immediately? Should I asked her to stay or beg her? Did it convey the wrong message that I didnt care about the relationship?
   

I went back home and I had kept straight NC, deleting everything. No closure. I want to give her as much space as possible.  I didnt have the courage to see whether she entered into a new relationship. 

Now I want to get her back someday in the future. We were inseparable and she was the love of my life. I am not sure if I can get her back before I work out the problem in me. 


**tl;dr**: Prefect relationship turned downhill in the course of 3 week. I wanted her back

4ppbnd,4,2016-06-24,"My boyfriend [21M] of a year has been getting upset with my [20F] work schedule lately, and I have no idea what to do.",throwitaway12398,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4ppbnd/my_boyfriend_21m_of_a_year_has_been_getting_upset/,"J and I met in college and have been dating for the past year. Right now we are a four hour drive apart for the summer. He stayed back in our college town for an internship and I went back home to work.  

His parents have a lake house like 30 minutes from where I live, and he drives up almost every weekend. Last summer I was able to see him a lot because my job didn't demand that many hours from me. I worked in HR for an amusement park. The end of last summer I was promoted to the leadership team of my department- I'm basically a back-up supervisor. I decided to return this summer and was given the same position. The only thing is that my job has become a TON times more demanding. Even when the park was only open 3/4 days a week- I was working 40ish hours a week. 

Due to this increase in demand, I have been working a lot of doubles during the weekends. J still continues to come out, and usually ends up driving 8 hours during the weekend. Even if I work 12 hrs and get out at 9, I make it a point to try and get ice cream or go to his parents and watch a movie with him. I've even met his god parents and have got dinner with all of them! If I am blessed with a half day, we always make plans. I always inform him what hours I'm working, but lately he has become very short when I try to talk about it.

The most recent example is in regards to this upcoming weekend. I am scheduled to work 8am-9:30pm on Saturday. I told him last weekend if he came out a little early on Friday we could see each other then, he was kind of neutral to the situation. 

A couple days ago I mentioned how I was asked to stay later on Saturday, and he got very upset with me. He thought I originally had the day off and then agreed to work an extra day when asked. Basically he thought I decided to go to work instead of seeing him.

I was so confused, I tried to give him an alternative (meeting up during my lunch break) and he wouldn't listen to any of it. Told me he would have refused if his supervisor had approached him specifically, asking him to stay later. The thing is I need to work. I will be graduating next semester from my undergrad, and plan on continuing to at least my masters. My parents have basically supported me for the majority of my undergrad, but have made it very clear that once I graduate, I will have to buy my own car/start paying for my own phone/may have to start paying rent if I move back home. Furthermore, paying for my masters will be all on me. I will be graduating with a B.S. in biology, there aren't many well paying careers that come from just a B.S. in biology. 

I would rather work 50 hour weeks during the summer and have a little bit of money saved up for when I graduate. I explained all of this to him, but he was still upset.

Last night he asked me if I would be working July 4th, I said I had no idea because the schedule wasn't done out that far yet. I then told him I wasn't sure if I could even get the day off because another one of the girls already asked for it off. He then got upset with me that I didn't ask for it off before her. I started crying (very stressed with work and this ongoing argument), and told him I didn't think it was fair of him to get upset over this. There are only 4 people that work in my actual department in HR, and the office needs to remain open as long as the park is open because we work in employee services. I reiterated everything I mentioned before. 

He finally understood a little and agreed that it was unfair, but he was still upset about it.

Are my reasons valid? Am I just picking work over him? Honestly this is just stressing me out and I need to vent/get outside perspective. 
   
**tl;dr**: Boyfriend travels every weekend to family lake house. I only live 30 minutes away from lake house, instead of 4 hours from where he is staying for the summer. So we try very hard to see each other during the weekends, except I work for an amusement park that is now open 7 days a week. He keeps getting upset with me because of my work schedule that I have little control over. I don't know what else I can be doing. "

I'm working a quant internship, and given that it's a temporary gig, I seriously did not expect taxes to ruin my take-home pay. Here's a breakdown of the taxes I've been charged and my stats from a 2 week paystub:

1. Federal Income Tax: 14.51%
2. Social Security Tax: 7.20%
3. Medicare Tax: 1.95%
4. NY State Income Tax: 4.49%
5. New York City Income Tax: 2.85%
6. Marital Status: Single
7. Federal Exemptions: 0
8. NY Exemptions: 0
9. Gross Pay: 1760

I feel as though I'm being screwed over by the government. Is it normal for a 20 year old to be charged this much in taxes?"
4pqa5l,2,2016-06-24,To co-op or to internship (for CS)?,KING_FAGET,cwru,https://www.reddit.com/r/cwru/comments/4pqa5l/to_coop_or_to_internship_for_cs/,"Salutations my fellow spartans,

Sophomore CS dude here and now that it's summer, I've started thinking about what I want to do next year. 

My question today is do my fellow CS folk recommend co-oping or interning? To my ignorant mind it seems the main difference is a co-op will give me more $$$ but an internship will allow me to finish school in 8 semesters. Personally I don't care about graduating a semester later than my friends, but it seems that a lot of CS companies are bigger on internships than co-ops, or so I think. 

Also, would it be easier to get a good co-op or a good internship? Here's my ""stellar"" (/s) resume: 3.3GPA, I know Java decently well, learning python and HTML, but I will only have maybe 2 months of work experience (not CS related), and my github only contains junk right now.

Also, after taking a quick look on glassdoor for some of the co-op companies (Rockwell, GE) it seems that the pay is only about $20 an hour--seems rather low especially since the Case website says you can expect to make 2/3rds the starting salary of a entry level engineer in a co-op. 

Any info here or advice would be much appreciated!

4prq1q,1,2016-06-25,[Support] I'm probably mentally unstable.,Neverlivid,confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/4prq1q/support_im_probably_mentally_unstable/,"I am a math major with an associate degree. I'm halfway through my bachelor's with a 3.46gpa, at a fairly low tier university, 7grand in the hole, and no internships.  Lately I have just been thinking if I should just stop. 

 I started out going to CC and doing really poor the first semester and then I pulled it around and started getting better grades. I started spending tons of time doing mathematics and came to enjoy solving problems,  but as still didn't know what to do with my future so I was stuck. When I look at all my failures(no 3.5gpa, low tier college, no internships or relevant experience, always putting important things off till the last moment, small work history, very old wardrobe, broke, etc) I just feel like I want to quit. 

People can just say shit like I will move to X and  get a job at Y, go to Z university. I will still be thinking. How can I move to X without any money? I am always thinking about what I might do as career and I would like to do anything that involves problem solving so I am looking at taking more computer science and statistics classes. But when I think, "" How are we gonna get a higher paying job?"" I have no driver's licence, so if what I need to get to town C? Walk? What do we eat and drink on the way? Speaking of eating when will we get paid our small check? 

I spend hours looking up how I can get out of this situation.  Google searches look like :

1. How to work through hunger(results: how to lose weight)

2. What can I do to get into X career ( results:Pay ______ for fees/exams/transportation and have _______ years of experience)

3. How do I get experience?(results: Internship, volunteering, start your own projects  )


4.  Textbooks for X career (textbook.pdf)

5. How do I work through hunger.(...)

Everytime I look up something, I just come to the conclusion that maybe I should kill myself. Then I say, ""No brah, I am a savage. Depression,  and poverty,  better kill me through disease or misfortune, because I am not doing it myself.""

Years of this has gotten me to the point of several silent breakdowns and ongoing neurotic tendency such as: random yet extreme contained burst of rage(watching TV alone, grab remote throw it against the ground, continue watching TV), talking to myself, and occasional thoughts of suicide(which trigger the anger). 

I don't know what I can do at this point, honestly. This shit so clearly stops me from doing the most basic of things. It's like being trapped on a train headed for a cliff with the driver thinking that if we go fast enough we might make it over to the otherside. 

I can't talk with family about this, no real friends can talk with,no money for psychiatrist. 


Idk man.

Așa că , am venit aici cu o întrebare , pe care o pun din numeroase motive : **Cum vedeți România în viitorul apropiat (15-20 de ani) , și ce schimbări considerați că ar fi necesare acestui sistem al nostru , care , din câte am văzut , este o mizerie și / sau o totală bătaie de joc?**

Acum că am pus întrebarea ce mă macină de ceva timp , să aduc și motivele pentru care întreb asta :

* rata natalității este *mult , mult mai mică* decât cea a mortalității ( ~267.000 decese / an &amp; ~173.000 nașteri/an , după [cel mai recent studiu](https://demograffiti.wordpress.com/2016/06/17/populatia-romaniei-la-1-mai-2016/) )

* numărul pensionarilor este aproape la fel de mare , dacă nu chiar mai mare ca numărul salariaților ( care încă lucrează în România ) , ducând la un declin al economiei

Și în ciuda acestor negative , am și motive bune pentru a pune această întrebare de mai sus , deoarece , recent , din ce în ce mai multe [adevăruri](https://www.reddit.com/r/Romania/comments/4phu04/mesaj_de_la_remus_cernea_cum_a_fost_posibil/) sunt aduse la atenția publicului ,  oamenii devin [mai comunicativi](https://www.reddit.com/r/Romania/comments/4plt8g/așa_se_schimbă_o_țară/) , iar industria pare să intre într-un fel de reformă , sau cel puțin să încerce , cu recentul scandal de la Hexi Pharma și cu alte [miracole](https://www.reddit.com/r/Romania/comments/4pigwh/ce_mai_mare_combină_din_lume_a_intrat_în_serviciu/) pentru noi românii care s-ar putea să ne ajute economia , atât pe plan extern , cât și intern.

Cine știe , poate vom vedea din nou cum ne punem pe picioare și facem și noi ceva mai bun decât să importăm ~80% din produsele de pe piață și să oferim salarii mici ( în ciuda fondurilor pe care le avem și ce se duc în [alte părți](https://www.reddit.com/r/Romania/comments/4pivgw/navem_bani_pentru_mariri_salariale_din_invatamant/) )care îi fac pe tineri și , în general , salariați , să plece în alte părți pentru un trai mai bun ( ~ 2 milioane de salariați români în străinătate ).

Deci , după acest text lung , și mai mult ca sigur plictisitor , ce părere aveți despre țara noastră , și cum ați răspunde la întrebarea de mai sus?

Should I let this one go?",morganelafee,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4pt3kd/me_30f_with_my_mother_60f_i_cant_handle_how_she/,"As a bit of background, my mother is from a western european country and my dad is arab, but we have been raised us in an arab country. As a result, childrearing is slightly different since people in that country believe in supporting their children financially as much and as long as possible. 

This is where -in my opinion- the heart of the matter lies. I'm the eldest, and back then my parents didn't have much money so I was never spoiled and tried to become financially independent as fast as possible. My siblings were raised in a much more financially comfortable period of our lives, and as a result are not making any effort to become financially independent. 

While this is understandable for my brother, who is still a teenager albeit very spoilt (gets all the games he wants, my mom won't even let him prepare his plate and does everything for him), the fact that my sister is not doing anything to help drives me crazy. My parents bought an apartment last year and she's been living in it (rent-free obviously) but lets my mom pay the building fees and associated taxes without care. Considering she earns a 1,100 euro salary for her internship and university is free, I'm shocked she's not doing anything to help. Every time I raise the issue, she tells me that she helped furnish the apartment and deserves to keep her money to go on vacation. She has been costing my mom quite a lot since she also went to a private university for a few years and let my mom bear the cost almost all on her own (10k euros just for yearly school fees).

However, whenever I try to talk to my mom about this and tell her that she should let my sister handle financial issues and teach my brother he won't always have a personal maid taking care of his shit, she shuts me out and complains that I should let her parent the way she wants to. I feel very strongly about being taught to handle chores and bills life throws at you because the way she does everything around the house made us very lazy, but she sees no problem with that. 

Should I just let this go and accept that my siblings will be spoilt kids, or should I persist in trying to make her see the light? It obsesses me to the point that every conversation we have will touch on it one way or another. 



   
**tl;dr**: My mom has been spoiling my sister and brother and refuses to acknowledge the way it impacts them. I'm the bad guy for bringing this issue up and getting angry about it. Should I forget about it and accept the situation, or keep up the fight? "
4pt6zv,2,2016-06-25,Not Sure What To Do [Update 1],allkindsofmessedup2,Divorce,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/4pt6zv/not_sure_what_to_do_update_1/,"Hello people.  I've had to make a new account because the previous one was a throwaway and I can't remember the password.  Previous posts here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/3dvqjv/not_sure_what_to_do/?

So, it's been 11 months.  It's been a while.  I'm no less confused.

So, since my last update I did indeed find a new job, at a bar and restaurant.  I'm actually huge into the restaurant industry, so while it's a significant pay cut I actually like my job for the first time in years.  I've gotten a promotion this year and am now Bar Supervisor, on track to be Assistant General Manager.  At this point my goal is to open my own place in the next year or two.

Things with my wife were actually on an upswing in the months since my last post.  We moved back into her family house for financial reasons, and while it sucked it also went well because I think we do best when we have a reason to have each other's backs.

Then she left the country.  She quit her job, which was admittedly a pile of shit professionally and for her emotional well being.  She also jumped careers into resort hospitality, which is something that she wanted to do.  She took a mostly unpaid internship (boarding and a small stipend) for 6 months in February.  Yeah, right before Valentines Day.

As I said, things had been on an upswing at that point.  However after she went out she progressively distanced herself.  It would be a call a day, then text messages, an then I wouldn't even get text responses for days.  I dunno how well I handled this, because I specifically called her out on it.  It was also one of my fears that I voiced before she went overseas.

Probably a turning point was when she stated that she was planning on taking a permanent position.  I was obviously upset by this, and my wording wasn't great (has since been clarified), to the extent of ""if this job is whats going to pull you away from me, then fuck that, it's my enemy"".  Like I said, not great wording.

At one point she upset me to the point where I couldn't deal with speaking to her for several days, and about 2 months ago there was an almost month-long period where she wouldn't speak to me on the phone.  Not that she was blanking me calls, but that she never initiated any contact and I was too insecure that that point to call and get dissed.

She's been back this week, for her brother's birthday.  She landed on Friday, and is going back this Sunday.  Sunday we met up, and to cut a long story short she said that she doesn't see us having a compatible future.  She hasn't worn her rings in an undisclosed time.  And she's not interested in discussion on the matter.

Since then, we've seen eachother twice.  I requested we go out Wednesday for a night where wee could just ignore the greater issues and enjoy ourselves.  She was also here Thursday to collect various items.

Side note: for most of the time that she's been gone, I've been crashing at my office (literally my office, in a shared building).  I havn't had much choice as I've been supporting her financially while she's overseas.  I'm honesty not here much, as my schedule is a lot of late nights and a lot of transit.  I'll pop in for a couple hours sleep and to wash up, then I'm back to the grindstone.  No, it's not 100% legitimate, and it's certainly not beneficial to me mentally, but I get buy.  Honestly, I've done worse.

Her immediate plan was to take everything she owned from the office, but that was impossible due to time constraints.  We spent the evening going through boxes for things that she immediately wanted, and then watched the sunset from the rooftop.  From her words, she doesn't want to leave me but she either doesn't trust me or doesn't see things working out perfectly in the long term.  I've been adamant that I don't agree, and pointing out that in the past few months she's missed a lot of my development.

So moving onto specific points...

1.  I'm here on a visa.  I'm not willing to sign on divorce papers, and the least of reasons is because I'll lose my visa.  We've discussed what my option are, but they're not great.

2.  The two of us have differening perspectives.  She's no longer interested in dealing with the problem, but a lot of her argument has to do with impressions of me that indicate things not working long-term.

3.  She has a lot of hangup due to the fact that she's been physically improper, whereas I haven't.  I know of her past incidents (as mentioned previously), but I'm also aware that she has ""fucked around"" while she's been overseas.  I don't care.  Is that an issue?

4. Especially with this Brexit shit (oh, can you guess my political leanings?), my visa status is to up in the air that it might as well be in orbit.  I'm considering applying for immigration to Israel (I'm a jew, that's where she is, and I'm not interested in returning to the USA), but I'm facing the possibility that my 6 years in the UK will go to waste.

Ok, I'm at a loss now.  Ask me questions as you will, as I havn't been terribly detailed.  Advice would be welcome."

The line stretches down the block as students wait to enter Alpha Sigma's first party of the semester. I stand on the doorstep of the opulent fraternity mansion, arms folded in a way that shows off my bulging biceps and rippled chest. The collar on my Abercrombie polo is up, obviously, and I scan the line for any lithe young pickings that I could have fun with. I dumped my Theta slampiece over the summer - I said I had to focus more on my Goldman Sachs internship, but the real reason was I was just... bored of her. Who knows what I'll find tonight? Maybe a girl truly worth showing off to the high society I had been born into...
_________________________________________________
Hey, thanks for reading! So the premise of this roleplay is pretty simple. I want to play a douchey, All-American frat bro who gets to corrupt and use a naive young first year. You could be a spoiled, stuck-up legacy blonde, a small-town busty brunette or even an ebony/latina girl who'd never dream she'd abandon her people to suck on the cock of a rich white guy. So long as you're creative and imaginative, I'm game!

This can be played short-term, but what I'd really like to do is create a little world of opulence and privilege. I want to seduce your character with promises of the high-life, taking you to all sorts of exclusive events and country clubs, all the while making you into a more and more depraved slut. By the end of it I want you to be my bimbo, a good, obedient little girl who smiles and sticks her chest out while the men discuss business.

Detail, creativity and good grammar are key. I'm pretty open to most kinks and this scene can go from plain vanilla to extremely dark.

Hope to hear from you!"

What should I do?,stillcantdrivehelp,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4ptdxv/my_21f_parents_53m51f_still_wont_let_me_drive/,"Hi r/relationships, this is such a ridiculous problem I don't know what else to do.

I am currently an international student in the US and I go home in the summer and winter. I love my parents and they love me back. They've been there for me when I've succeeded and made mistakes.

So I passed my driving test last summer finally after lots of gaps because of college and trips. You would think that that meant I would FINALLY be able to drive whereever I wanted right? NOPE.

First of all, most of that summer was my internship and I had already agreed to carpool for both a ride to and from the office. So the rest I could have driven whenever. But my parents prevented me from it. I was allowed to drive when they were in the car but they thought my driving could improve, which I was okay with because the country I live in has a very bad driving problem since a lot of people speed and are generally careless. This is of course something that happens everywhere but it is a lot more prevalent here. I can tell you that I haven't gone a week without seeing someone speeding over 200km/h or an accident. So my dad would take me out and test my parking skills. He said I was a good driver but because I was under 21, he and my mother are worried that if anything would happen to me, the repercussions of it are bad as anyone under 21 who has been in an accident faces more problems such as more points on their license and even confiscation, plus insurance is a lot more expensive. I was mad but I didn't fight with them too much about it.

I am back home this summer and have to go back to the US early for summer school. Its been nearly 6 weeks and I'm still not allowed to drive alone. I can drive with my parents but alone is apparently a no-no. I'm 21, I've already driven in the US with no problems but I haven't mentioned this to my parents for fear of making the problem worse. My parents say I drive very well but because of my weakness in reverse parking, they won't let me. Well I think that's crazy because I know how to do it in little time and they were there and said it was mostly good but I need to fine tune it.

Well reddit I'm so tired of waiting. If they wanted to fine tune it why can't we take a day and just do reverse parking and fix it? Sometimes I think they're making excuses just so that I don't drive alone. Also they say they don't trust people on the road, well you can't use that forever.

it's not like they're shielding me from everything, they know where I go and what I do and all they tell me is to be careful. But this is ridiculous. I'm considering just going driving alone without their permission because I'm so tired of fighting and trying to explain to them that they can't protect me forever.

What do I do reddit? This is seriously upsetting me and I can't believe it. I feel so behind. Everyone my age and younger are driving around and I'm still here like sorry can't go anywhere not allowed to.
   
tl;dr: It's been a year since I've had my license and parents won't let me drive alone. I think they're being crazy and making excuses and that they don't trust me."

However, I have always continually wanted to improve myself and push myself and am extremely fortunate to have been hired as a full time software developer at a pretty awesome company.
  
I started at a salary of 44k and this is a tremendous amount of money to me. Prior the most money I have made is $9/hr working retail and ~$11.50 at a previous internship. After the first couple paychecks I have the most money I have ever had and the feeling is amazing. However, as the ""honeymoon"" feeling wears off I want to make sure I am using this extra money to good use. Here is a breakdown of my expenses:

Rent: Currently ~$700/month +/- $25 based on utilities  
Car insurance is paid by my parents / car is fully paid for (Mom gave it to me, though it is sort of beat up at this point the car itself is almost 15 years old)
  
Gas: ~$120 if I am only going to work as I have a decent commute. If I am stopping back home to see family it can jump $20-40
  
Groceries: ~$150 +/-
  
Other Expenses: Honestly this is where I spend my most money. I have tried to limit my spending with the whole ""just because I can"" mentality as taking my girlfriend out I don't have to check my bank account every time now (which is awesome btw) so I am trying to make sure I don't spend too much. But this can definitely be anywhere from $100-$500 / month its just a mixture of dates/eating out/movies and maybe a cool event to go to. But those are not that often like a concert or something like that.
    
My take home per month is 2.6k. Anyways, sorry for what feels like rambling I just wanted to make sure everything is known so people can give me the best advice on what to do.
  
As far as what the heck I am actually asking. I am sure many college students, once they get their first ""real"" job don't make the best decisions with their money. I want to make sure I am doing everything I can to ensure financial security. Whether its budgeting or investing or whatever. I lurk on this sub a lot so I am sure you guys will be able to help out.
  
Thanks in advance for any help sorry for TLDR.

I'm hoping to make a few new friends to play a variety of games with on PC. I'm looking to play some fun games, try to win sometimes, goof around other times, and chat about anything. I'm going to do my best to organize as much info about me below, so I apologize if it is wordy.


**About Me:**
I'm currently a student in Aerospace Engineering. I like to play and watch sports, mainly basketball, and I love being outdoors. For a while, I thought that I wanted to own a landscaping company because I really enjoyed doing work outside, but I decided that wanted to make more of an impact with my job, which is why I chose the major I'm in. I grew up in the northeast, but have moved to North Carolina for school and I am loving it! I have a lot of interests from music, space, computers, sports and more


**Why I'm looking for Gaming Friends:**
When I was in high school, I played mainly on Xbox with my high school friends. Towards the end of high school, I built my own computer and made the switch to PC gaming. I made some good friends on PC, but time and interests changed, which caused me to not really have much of a group anymore. Since I made a big move for college, I've spent most of my gaming time in college playing single player games; however, I've recently been getting back into playing multiplayer games and I'd love to have a few people to play with!


**When I'm Available:**
My internship actually has me on some strange hours, so there will be some days during the week when I am only available during daytime hours. On the weekends, I will mainly be available during nighttime hours. My schedule can be a little all over the place, so for that reason the timezone should not be too much of an issue. The biggest thing is that I can't promise that I will be on every day or that I will be around at the same times.


**What I'm Looking For:**
While I would prefer people who are 18+, I'm not going to say no to anyone just because of age. I was once the 16 year old just looking to play games with a few people, and I always appreciated the people who gave me a shot. I'd like to be able to talk while we play games, so some voice communication software would be preferable, but it doesn't matter to me which one. I'm always happy to play to win, but I also like messing around.  I really like to make people laugh, so if joking around is your thing, then we will get along great! Most importantly, I'm not looking to join any large groups. I'd like to have the chance to get to know a few people well, but I find that I often get a little bit overwhelmed with larger groups, at least at first.


**Games I'm Playing:**
I'm currently playing a lot of Overwatch, but then again who isn't? I've also been playing a fair amount of Rocket League. Over the last few days, I've been messing around a bit with Terraria and Space Engineers. Also, I've sort of been feeling like going back and playing some Minecraft, since I haven't played in a few years. I have something like 50 games in my steam library, and I will likely have more after the summer sale. I'm pretty willing to play anything and I am also willing to get new games. For me, I think the people that I play the games with are what really make the game! If you'd like, here is my [Steam Profile](http://steamcommunity.com/id/Thallion)


**If You're Interested:**
If you've read this far.. well that's awesome because I wrote a lot. I'd really like to get to know you! Feel free to comment below or shoot me a PM, whatever you are comfortable with. I'd like to know a little more than just what name to add. I look forward to hearing from you!"

I'm getting very close to having a surgery date for the gastric sleeve (I'm so nervous excited!) and I just want to be fully ready for when I can start introducing solid food back into my diet. My roommate just moved out and took a good portion of our kitchenware with her, so I'm looking for advice on what I should buy and what I should avoid in terms of kitchenware, tupperware and the like. What is really going to help me or hinder me? Are there any things that I wouldn't think that are considered everyday items that I should toss out? Are there any cookbooks you've found to have been especially helpful? I'm a full time student starting an internship in the fall, so I'm ~really going to have to rely on meal prep. 

Onto the closet. I've been browsing threads and have seen that leggings are the obvious choice...but what about during the summer? When did y'all start wearing jeans post-op? 

You can guarantee I'll be back with more questions...ttfn!

Edit: Wow, thank you all for the advice and encouragement! Y'all are awesome. I can't wait to get shopping!"
4ptu0d,3,2016-06-25,I see no bright future for me after wasting 4 years in university.,whydidyoulook,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/4ptu0d/i_see_no_bright_future_for_me_after_wasting_4/,"Last week, I've dreamed a dream which is the last straw that broke the camel's back. This is how it went:

I was in my old elementary school,studied with my middle school classmates and did high school activities. In that dream, I was perfectly aware that I'm an adult in a teenager body so I tried made the most out of it. I started practice martial art again but more serious this time (because I have my fitness experience now), I could hang out with my friends and still topped the class because I knew how to arrange my works.... So basically, I had a lot of fun in my dream, I was on the right track and kept improving myself...then my alarm went off.

In reality, my life was completely the opposite: 

* I didn't have any friend in middle school (I even once shoved a towel into my mouth so my mother wouldn't hear me cry after I got bullied).
* I got into a martial art club but quit because I didn't advance at all. Actually, it's because I don't know how to train the right ways. To give some idea, I was like the guy who'd come to the gym everyday FOR YEARS and always do bench press without a rest day then get confused why the muscle doesn't grown.
* Even this is my final year of university,I can't I still procrastinate doing important tasks such as searching for an internship. Hell, I'm a BA student yet I don't even know how to be financially responsible (The only working experience I have is working as a server in a coffee shop for 1 month).
* I'm held back a year because I've failed too many courses while all my ""friends"" were graduated before summer.

So you can say the dream is my regret. Those are what I wish I could have done to make my life better, yet I didn't

But you know what the SCARIEST part? Let me give you a hint: In my dream, I've only dreamed about my elementary-middle-high school life. There wasn't anything from my university life! Which means compare to the time that I got bullied, ignored, failed to achieve something... my university life is just empty. 

No conflicts, no joys, no event that makes an impact strong enough to crave into my memory, nothing. And I had to ask myself: ""4 FUCKING YEARS??? NOTHING HAPPENED IN 4 YEARS? HOW COULD THAT BE POSSIBLE??"". I'm totally clueless right now. I'm repeating the same mistake that I've done many years ago. But this time is worse, since I don't even know what I should regret if I don't do it.

I don't even know what I should do after graduating because the only thing I'm kind of good at is teaching, giving speech (at least compare to other skills). I want to become financially independent at early age (before 40s) but I fear that I won't even manage to achieve it.  It's not only because of my lacks of skill in general, but also because I don't even know where to start. The depression I've been having since high school doesn't make the situation better.

**TL;DR: After wasting 4 years in university without gaining anything (friends,knowledge,experience...) , I feel clueless and scared. Depression makes the situation worse. I don't know when the last straw will break the camel's back because I've thought about committing suicide several times before.**"
4pu62h,22,2016-06-25,The redhead intern and me (MF),MickeyKuzak,eroticliterature,https://www.reddit.com/r/eroticliterature/comments/4pu62h/the_redhead_intern_and_me_mf/,"I had forgotten how tight Hannah’s pussy was.

So, when I slipped inside her from behind, and looked down at the pale, white skin of her back, leading up to the long, curly, red hair flowing over her left shoulder, I felt a nearly overwhelming urge to cum inside her. 

“It’s been so long,” she said, looking back at me. “I missed you, Mickey.” I missed her too, but probably only for the fact that she was 22 and I was 40 and she gave amazing, earth shaking blowjobs. 

She wasn’t kidding, though. It had been about six weeks since I fucked her last, just a day before she left to go back to college. Her sweet moist pussy gripped my cock as I slowly eased in and out of her.

“I missed you too, Han,” I said, picking up the pace.

“Fuck me hard, OK?” she said, but it was more of an order than a request.

“And don’t stop.”

I firmly held her hips as the light claps of our bodies and her soft, sexy moans began to get louder as I bent her over the coffee table in her tiny, but nice, apartment near campus. Her tight cunt felt so good and just being able to pleasure her was amazing. I wanted her to believe I was fucking her slow because it was more intimate, but there was no question it was because I wanted to last as long as I could. Pounding her would end that.

“I told Sami she should find someplace to stay tonight,” she said, as she slid forward and my cock popped out of her.

“Why? I said, coyly. 

“Because we haven’t seen each for six weeks, Mick” she said, as she pushed me back on the couch. “And I wanna be loud tonight …”

She swung her hips over mine and gasped as she lowered herself onto my cock, sliding slowly down until she was completely filled. I laid back as her milky white hips moved sensually and she let out a set of long, slow groans. As the pace quickened, Hannah got louder and louder, until she stopped moving and I started pounding hard up into her pussy until she pushed up without warning and shuddered as her orgasm overtook her.

I eased her lightly to my left and maneuvered behind her, running my fingers across her pink pussy. Pulling her to the edge of the futon, I ran my tongue from the small of her back down, past her cute little pucker to her sweet, moist gash. Letting my tongue linger on her clit brought out a long, slow moan, followed by a sharp “fuck” from her lips. I slipped two fingers inside her pussy and rimmed her ass while I fingered her. A few loud moans preceded the shaking of her legs and another intense orgasm left her gasping.

I rolled her over and climbed on top of her, guiding my cock inside her juicy pussy. I leaned into her and eyes widened and she let out a long groan. “God,” she said. “Either it’s been too long or you’ve gotten much bigger.” 

“Now you’re just sucking up,” I said, as I pushed her legs up into the air and began pounding her as hard as I could. As I thrusted away, her eyes locked with mine as her moans echoed through the living room. “Oh God -- fuck me! Fuck my pussy!” she commanded. 

So ... I pulled my cock completely from her. 

And she was pissed … until I dropped below her waist and went down on her again.

I didn’t just eat her. It was more like devouring. 

With my face buried in her crotch, Hannah held my face in place while she began to grind on my mouth. I easily slipped two fingers inside her and sawed them in and out while continuing to furiously flick my tongue across her clit. Her thighs slapped against my head and damn near deafened me as she came yet again.

“Hooooooly fuck,” she squealed, while pushing my face away from her crotch. “Fuck. Fuck. Fuuuuuuuck. Holy … I need a breather,” she said through gasps. “Jesus Christ, we fuck so good.”

***
Hannah and I met about two years ago. She was 20, a summer intern at my office and I was, well, freshly divorced and a little gunshy of real relationships. I swear I didn’t see anything except for a young, pretty girl who was a whiz at marketing for such a young age. Besides, I was fucking a waitress that I’d met a few weeks before. The summer came and went and I didn’t think anything more about her, to be honest.

The following fall, I went to her college on a recruiting visit. I met with 14 students in all that day, including an attractive young blonde, whom I later found out was Hannah’s roommate, Sami. 

She was the last person I interviewed. Afterward, I was tired, but needed a drink.  “Is there a place I can get a drink near here?” I asked Sami. “Something with some light music and good bourbon.”

“Yeah,” she said, describing an out of the way bar near my hotel. “My roomie is picking me up and we will drive right by there, if you want a ride.” I agreed and a few minutes later, a blue Corolla pulled up. “That’s her. Hop in the front.”

Long story short, it was red-haired Hannah in the blue Corolla and, a few hours later, after the two ladies joined me for a few drinks and a shot or two, she confessed our co-workers that summer had told her not to get involved with me -- even though she found me attractive -- because I was on the rebound. 

When I excused myself to take a phone call at one point, Sami was gone when I returned. “Where’s our ride?” I asked.

“It’s a quick walk to your hotel,” she said, with a side look that made me feel like an idiot for not noticing that she’d sent Sami on her way to get me alone. As we walked, she told me that she was really happy to see me again. We stopped, knowing the moment, and I kissed her.

When we got to the room, I opened the door and she pulled me into the room. “I want to take a shower with you,” she said, unbuttoning her blouse. A few minutes later, I looked into the mirror as Hannah’s red nest of curls bobbed at my groin. 

That’s how our affair started. 

And that’s what it was. Pure lust. Well, not just lust, I guess. We went to the theatre or a concert every once in a great while, but mostly it was just fucking. Neither of us was getting hurt because we knew we were just enjoying the orgasms.

“Everyone needs to have one person in their life that just teaches them what’s like to be completely, sexually taken by another person,” she told me once. “That’s you for me. No one has ever eaten my pussy like you … NO ONE … I’ll never get fucked like this by anyone else ever again.” 

***
After a quick drink in the kitchen, we moved to her room, where we sat on the bed naked, talking about other things for a few minutes before she got that look in her eye again. I kissed across her collarbone and started pawing her 34Cs, gently pulling her pink, button nipples as she squeezed my stiffening dick.

“Lay back,” she said, as our lips broke. I didn’t need further coaxing. 

She quickly moved into 69 position and began sucking my cock, while I buried my face in a well-kept mound of crimson curls between her legs. Swiftly, I found her clit and began circling my tongue around it, as I felt her warm mouth break free of my manhood and let out a nice, slow moan as she buried her face in my left thigh. 

We continuing pleasuring each other until I pulled her off of me, rolled her onto her back and slid my dick into her moist cunt. I moved forward and our faces were inches apart as I stroked in and out of her wetness.

She arched her back as I wrapped my arms around her shoulders and fucked aggressively. I felt her pussy spasm and tighten around me and after hammering her for a few more minutes, I slowed down and pulled myself from her hole.

She slid down and turned around, facing me between my legs. 

“I hope you’re ready to cum,” she said softly and looking right into my eyes. I didn’t answer, but I knew what was coming as she spit on my cock. “I’m going to make you cum -- hard.”

I looked down to see her hand wrap around my fullness and begin stroking it slowly. Her ice blue eyes stared at the head and she kissed it softly before wrapping her full, red lips around my thickness. She swirled her tongue around me and I felt her wet mouth take it deeper into her throat. 

She was so fuckin’ good at sucking cock. 

Her eyes never left mine as she blew me, then she backed off of it slowly but didn’t take it out of her mouth. I felt her saliva coat my cock and she started sucking me frantically as her tiny, freckled hand stroked me powerfully as well. She pulled her mouth off and stroked my throbbing tool harder. “I want that cum,” she said, squeezing my balls with her other hand, sending me closer to the edge.

“Give it to me,” she ordered.

She worked the head with her mouth, then worked her way to my sack. Taking each of my balls in her mouth, she gave them a quick suck while jerking my rod with her left hand.

“C’mon … you know you wanna cum for me,” she coaxed. “Just tell me and I’ll give you what you like.”

I don’t if she got the sign she was looking for, but before I knew it, Hannah slipped her mouth over the head and began furiously milking me as I tried to hold back the inevitable.

But I couldn’t take it anymore. I shot three big streams of jizz into her mouth, which didn’t appear to phase her at all. She continued moving her mouth swiftly up and down.

She gulped and swallowed my load, then licked her lips before cleaning me off with her mouth for a few minutes as I writhed in pleasure on the bed. 

“Next time, I want you to cum inside me,” she whispered, before standing and bounding toward the door. “I’m going to the kitchen, you wanna glass of wine?”

“No,” I said, still recovering, but starting to climb out of bed.

“Don’t get up,” she said, smiling. “We’re not done here.”

She stopped at the door. “You know, I hope we never stop doing this … ”

4puc2v,2,2016-06-25,I feel absolutely worthless to the core.,ayzle,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/4puc2v/i_feel_absolutely_worthless_to_the_core/,"Let me start this by saying i'm at the end of a gap year, having graduated in 2015. It was never planned that I would take a gap year, but I did much better on my exams than expected (39 in the IB) and decided with my parents that I would take a gap year and apply to better universities. I did, and I got into some very good universities in the UK.
But since this gap year wasn't planned, I didn't have a plan! I didn't know what I would do for 1 and a half years...I went to Munich and lived there and studied german for 2 months, and then when I came back home, I had to find something else to do.

Now, this is important. I have always had a very rocky relationship with my father. I was an accident, and if i'm honest, my parents shouldn't be together. My father has a serious anger problem, and whenever he would have an outburst, I would run to my mother. Because of this, I guess he felt jealousy. Instead taking the blame, he thinks i'm ungrateful. He thinks he can buy love. I appreciate his support, but even from an early age I remember saying ""I would rather be poor and have a loving family, than what we have now"".

So, my dad has always had aggressive outbursts, often when he drinks. Last year on holiday, he drank, and had one of these outbursts. He called me an idiot because I never worked in my life.

I graduated highschool at 18 because I went to an international school in our country, whereas he graduated from public school at 16 and began working (as is custom here). Yes, I could have squeezed in a 2 week internship during summer once, but i'm sure he still would have complained.

So, skip forward to this year, and I thought I should get a job, so that he couldn't say that to anymore. I found a 3 month internship, and picked it up. The first few weeks were fine, but it slowly got more boring, and tedious. Working from 8am until 6-7pm, doing boring excel work. It has taken a toll on my mental health. I've always struggled with self-confidence, but my sense of self-worth and my self-image has absolutely plummeted. I've spent the past months thinking i'm fucking ugly, no girl would ever want to be with me. Constantly obsessing over how I look. Anyway, i've had this job for 3 months, next week is my last, thank god.

A few weeks ago, in another outburst, he said some stuff along the lines of ""my work is pointless, I do nothing"" and when I said that i'm finally earning money (very little, but still) he said ""barely, $ ____ is nothing"". Nothing makes this guy happy. He has to make me feel bad about everything.

Now. Today. The reason i'm writing this. We were at dinner, drinking wine, and talking about Brexit. I said it was ridiculous that such a big decision was allowed to be judged over such a slim majority. He said that's democracy. I said that the fact that they held a referendum was democracy, but that the 50/50 thing was a matter of how you define majority. It blanked my mind at the time, but what I meant to say was that they should have imposed a supermajority rule..

Anyway. He gets up and says he is very surprised, can't believe that I don't understand democracy. I thought he was joking, but he kept saying it, more intense each time. I said that I do understand democracy, and that it was a misunderstanding. He then said that ""he didn't send me to that fucking school and pay all that money so that you don't even understand the basics"". I got upset, and said that there was no need to make such stupid statements over such a small thing. He called me a fucking idiot, and some other things. I called him names back (it was very heated), and he said that I have never achieved anything. That I shouldn't talk because i've never achieved anything in my life.

As someone that struggles with confidence (mainly due to the fact that my father is a control freak, an aggressive abusive person), this really stings. Really makes me feel like fucking shit. My father thinks that. This is my fucking father, and he is able to say shit like that. This isn't just a spur of the moment thing, which is the worst part, he actually believes it. This means that when he's acting nice, because he's in a good mood, or when he's not drunk enough to let it spill, my father is thinking, at the back of his mind, that i'm a worthless **** that hasn't achieved anything.

I don't know if it's his own sick way of convincing himself that, my apparent non-love for him, is not his fault, but because i'm messed up.

I honestly don't know if I love him. I feel like I have to, because he's my father, but he makes it very fucking difficult. I do appreciate that he has payed for my education, and supports me financially, but when he uses that as a reason why I should tolerate everything horrible he does, I just feel like saying fuck it, I don't need your support, I don't need you in my life.

By the way...he's never apologised for anything he's said. He didn't have a father, and I think he doesn't really know what being a father means. I think that in his mind, a father can never be wrong, and for that reason, should never apologise...

And I don't know if i'm overreacting, but this shit makes me feel worthless. On top of it, since i'm doing a gap year and all my friends are in uni, I feel incredibly lonely. I've always struggled with finding love, i've generally been fine finding friends, but at the moment, in the last few months, i've felt like shit. Worthless dogshit.

Sorry that this has been incoherent, but i'm writing this write after a major argument, and I still feel the adrenaline and anger and sadness. I just needed to get this off my chest.

4pui8l,3,2016-06-25,How can I cover more of my student expenses while avoiding private loans?,Always_posts_serious,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4pui8l/how_can_i_cover_more_of_my_student_expenses_while/,"Hello,

So a quick summary of my situation:

I'm a 23 year old independent student going to college this Fall. I've been working in less-than-stellar fields and am ready to take the plunge to better myself so I can move on to better things. I'm currently enrolled in community college and have been for the past 2 years. I have about 2.5 years left in school (including one summer for an internship) before obtaining my bachelor's degree.

My calculated costs (including food, housing, gas, tuition, fees, and all of the rest) comes out to about $21,000 for the Fall/Spring. I chose an off-campus housing option, as it is less expensive than on-campus housing (almost $2,000 less for the full year). 

My parents are not helping me with any of the school, due to them not having the financial ability to do so. I joined the US Navy a couple of years ago in hopes of obtaining the GI Bill and having most of my college paid for, but I ended up receiving a medical discharge in recruit training. Therefore I do not qualify for any of the benefits that one would normally receive. I did, however, manage to qualify as an independent student and qualify for need-based aid.

So I received my financial aid award on Friday afternoon. I was given $7,000 in Federal unsubsidized loans and $5,500 in Federal subsidized loans. This is for the entire year. That means I'm almost $9,000 short for the year.

I have applied for grants and a plethora of scholarships, both through my university and through other sources, but have not heard about any of them. I also plan on doing work-study to help pay for expenses. I also project myself having roughly $5,000 - $6,000 in savings by the time I leave for school. I looked up private loans, but that is a slippery slope that I would like to avoid if possible. The advice that seems most common is to max out federal loans before looking at private loans.

So I guess here are my questions:

1. Is it possible to ask my school, or ask the government for more federal subsidized loans? I've never used any of the loans before, so I should still qualify for the full course. I shouldn't even max them out at all before I graduate if I can manage a few scholarships. I've been working full-time and paying out of pocket for the community college.

2. If I do have to go with private loans, what would be the least terrible place to obtain them? I bank with Navy Federal Credit Union, and I think they offer student loans. Would that be a good source, or should I look into places like Sallie Mae?

3. I am familiar with the repayment programs for the Federal loans, but not with private loans. I'm not too worried about finding work placement when I graduate, as Computer Science is a booming field and I found that I have a knack for it, but I want to make sure I can keep my head above water.

4. I've never been in debt before. Do student loans hurt your credit score?

5. Anyone who has done a Computer Science internship, were you compensated for housing and expenses while you were there? Or was the pay you received expected to cover all of that?

Thank you all."

4pun7p,2,2016-06-25,I [22F] get along well with people but have zero friends.,Uhl-zak,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4pun7p/i_22f_get_along_well_with_people_but_have_zero/,"Hi guys!

I am a 22 year old almost college graduate. My whole life I have struggled with one very important thing: Making friends.

In elementary school and secondary school I was often bullied mercilessly. I also never really had good friends. Sometimes I would have one ""core"" friend, which usually disappeared as soon as their other friends showed up.

Now that I am in college, I thought that I had improved a lot. I made friends and we developed a little group or clique. We usually did group work and projects together, went on different events with one another, chatted online frequently, etc. However, as soon as we have left the building I am no longer really relevant, which is understandable.

Right now I am feeling pretty hurt/disappointed because we have all finished writing and presenting our bachelor thesis'. An occasion I would deem worthy of celebration. I created a group message on Facebook and suggested that would could all go out and celebrate our victory together. On my first try (a few weeks ago) the resonance to this idea was...minor. I got a like, but no replies. This time I suggested doing something as a group again and the response was even worse. People saw my message but I got no reactions whatsoever.

As far as I know nobody is harboring any animosity towards other members in the group and I am also on good terms with everybody. It makes me feel really bad that the end of my college is passing by so unceremoniously. My family doesn't really care for my achievements, my friends won't celebrate with me either and the official graduation will take place in October. By then I'll already have moved halfway across the country and I'll get my diploma in the mail.

I have done a lot to get out of my shell and be more sociable. In fact, I have even taken a class for social interaction, where we could practice different situations with different people. So far this hasn't really done much to help me develop better friendships.

My plan for the future is that I want to make even more use of the sports and exercise programs that my future grad school will offer to its students. That way I'd meet people with similar interests and work on my fitness. Depending on how much time I have I'll also look for a job or some clubs I can join in my free-time, hoping I could meet people outside of a college setting.

Like I said earlier though, I have no problem getting along with others. At my previous jobs and internships I also felt like I wasn't some kind of weird social outcast that can't communicate properly. I guess I am just kinda nice, but not interesting enough to keep hanging out with? Idk. This sucks.
   
**tl;dr**: Like the title says, I seem to get along well with people but as soon as I try to reach out, everybody ignores me."
4pus7n,2,2016-06-25,Been an intern for a while and I'm starting to realize I hate working in an office,Sheehan7,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/4pus7n/been_an_intern_for_a_while_and_im_starting_to/,"I'm 20, 3rd year business admin major at college, and I've been an IT intern at this great company for 8 months now (4 months of summer each). It's been ranked one of the best companies in the US, the office is really chill, and there are great people who work there. 

And I don't like it that much. I was alright for a while then I had a panic attack last week (hasn't happened to me in years) and I freaked out and left the office but it only got worse. It's in the center of a big city and there is nowhere to find peace if you need it. I was scared and now I'm dreading going back in. I could feel my anxiety going up since returning to this job a few weeks ago. It was pretty much non-existent when I was just in school and retail.

Aside from this in general it's just not what I like to do. The days feel insanely long because I work maybe 20% of my time there if that. Even my boss has a lot of downtime and I usually get whatever work the other three IT guys don't get to which usually isn't much. I have no passion for IT like I thought I did. When they start talking about new software or whatever I instantly get tired and lose interest. People in the office are a lot older than me and aren't very friendly. A lot of fake smiles. I also really don't like working in the city everything is so expensive and it's crowded and insanely busy travel wise, my commute is over an hour long or more. 

Here's the thing. I also work retail (same company for 7 months now) and I actually enjoy it. I work with a small team and usually make good sales. I set goals for myself and make them almost every shift. Sure it has it's bad points but generally I'm mostly happy there if only it wasn't a dead end/low paying job. 

I love fashion, cars, and fitness but haven't found any ways to integrate them into my possible careers. I see all my friends working jobs like restaurants, airline support, and landscaping this summer and they make triple what I do and have way more fun doing it. I want that, even if this internship is setting me up for future success, I don't even think I want to be in IT anymore.

I don't know what to do. Part of me wants to take a step back from the internship, pick up a ton of hours at the retail job, and reevaluate my career goals maybe with a counselor at school. They both pay the same anyway, just the internship is full time and retail is part time. I also want to enjoy the summer, yesterday (when I called in sick after the panic attack) was my first day off in 5 weeks. But then I'm supposed to go this route because I want to make a living wage in my future I guess. I would totally take up a trade like being a mechanic but I feel like I wouldn't fit in there or be happier than I am now.

I'm not sure what to do."

4pvlt5,236,2016-06-25,Here's a list of the major events each season's cast missed out on.,RegularGuy815,survivor,https://www.reddit.com/r/survivor/comments/4pvlt5/heres_a_list_of_the_major_events_each_seasons/,"Inspired by another thread from yesterday.

Quick notes:

1. I used the True Dork Times calendar for filming dates. In most cases I started from the day before Day 1, even though they were probably there for a week beforehand. Later seasons had more concrete fly-out dates, so I used those.

2. I tried to only pick the most impactful or interesting “events of note”. Stories that were big on the day they occurred may have ultimately been forgotten with time. I came across dozens and dozens of mass shootings and terror attacks that were just one in a long line that no one outside those affected would remember anymore.

3. As the cast of Survivor is American, this has a heavy American bias.

4. This does not include as many pop-culture moments that I’m sure took the country by storm during the following time periods (think “The Dress” or Gangnam Style). Feel free to add any that you think would have baffled the returning cast members.

4pwc6a,0,2016-06-26,Haven't felt happy since 7 years ago. Don't know what to do to make myself feel better.,depres111,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/4pwc6a/havent_felt_happy_since_7_years_ago_dont_know/,"Throwaway because I know a lot of people who use reddit.

I don't know if I'm depressed, its just that nothing has been able to make me happy since 7 years ago. I won't go into details about what happened 7 years ago, but a very important family member to me passed away.

Fast forward to now, I recently graduated high school and I have just about everything I can ask for. I came from a very well off family and I can graduate debt free. I'll be attending a high ranked school in the fall and I already have a sought after internship without really having to do much to have earned it.

But even with everything  that I've been given, I still feel sad. In middle school my work ethic took a plummet from Asian standards. I spent all day playing video games to forget about everything else. When high school, all of a sudden having ""it"" friends mattered and girls came into the picture. I tried so hard to be on top again throughout the first 3.5 years of high school. I don't remember the last time I enjoyed life, but I internally thought/think that I can't enjoy life unless I have everything that I want. 

During senior year, I was very worried and depressed about college decisions. Even though I'll be attending a ""good"" school, I still don't feel satisfied since it isn't top 10. In terms of friends, I began to realize towards the end of this year that I just hate the constant clawing for popularity. Maybe I'm actually just introverted, but me wanting to be on top means that I have to hang out with these kids since like me, they want to be good academically and socially. I'll probably only keep in contact with 2 or 3 kids from this group. As for girls, I don't think I'm ugly by any means. I dress nicely(but then again so did just about everyone else in my school) and girls that I would deem anywhere from 6-8 have hit on me before, but they never cut it because they always lacked something to me whether it be brains or traditional girliness(I really don't know how to word that better). There was one girl this year and we did get to become close; but, she ended up rejecting me. Looking back, I was probably friendzoned, but I still don't understand. She told me stuff that she wouldn't normally even tell some of her friends because she ""wanted me to know who she really is"". The rejection still hurts since she was someone I genuinely liked hanging out with and was happy to be around. Looking back, hanging out with her is probably the only thing that made me want to live life for reasons other than hoping that I'll be better off in the future. 

On vacation right now and I still can't enjoy myself. I don't know what to do. This is the first time I even have time to go on a lengthy vacation since middle school started, but it doesn't feel any different. I just feel like crap and I don't know how to change to make myself feel happy. It'd make sense if I came from less fortunate beginnings, but I don't know if I'm depressed or if this is just me always wanting more. 

Tldr: I don't remember being happy since 7 years ago. Not satisfied with school I'll be going to, hated most of high school friends, and rejected by girl who made me happy. Even so, I've been gifted a great life but always want more. "

A little bit about me - I have a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science but I haven't had any work experience because I knew I was going to migrate and I don't want to screw over a company, I worked for a company that sold condominiums for a while but quit because they made us work overtime without paying us for said overtime and my last job was an events assitant which was really fun and I got to practice my social skills. 


I tried looking for programming jobs but there were barely any entry level jobs and I know deep inside that I was probably going to hate it. I was a programming intern for a bank one summer and I hated working in a cubicle and not talking to anyone. I'm almost at the point where I'll just settle for a job at Tim Hortons or something so I can build a PC here and play something that isn't Plants vs Zombies. The knowledge I have regarding computer hardware comes mostly from my own computer breaking down and just searching for a fix online or upgrading hardware. I have knowledge on fixing some software issues too. Anyway, I was checking where I can buy parts and then it dawned on me - my big eureka moment - I can get discounts if I work in Best Buy (mwahahaha). Just kidding. That wasn't really the big eureka moment. I realized I would have fun if I worked in a place that is surrounded by things that interest me and I like helping people and giving them good value for their money. 


I'm thinking of applying online but is it possible to apply in their store? Do you think they'll consider someone that's relatively new to this country? Thank you so much for reading this. Cheers!

tl;dr New to Canada and want to work in Best Buy. Will they hire someone that doesn't have Canadian work experience?"

After this summer I will have earned some money from my summer internship, and I plan on spending some of it on a new laptop. 


What I know is that I want to get away from windows. My first though was to buy a MacBook pro 13"" (heresy, I presume). But after some browsing I got my eyes up for a ThinkPad. They seem to have some really nice hardware, and I was really impressed when I saw the beating one could take and still run. What they seem to lack compared to a MacBook Pro might be display-wise.


I am a master's student in Electrical engineering and plan on using my new laptop for everything. Lots of programming and heavy Matlab simulations come first to mindIt would be nice, though not necessary to be able to play some sc2 at times as well.


The models I am choosing from are the x260, the t460 (s or p) and the x1 carbon.


I will be carrying this laptop with me a lot, but I think all of the models above are very portable. The x260 seems to be the most portable of them, due to the small screen size. I am a little worried that moving down to 12.5"" might be a tad too small of a screen for me. The x1 and the t460 are somewhat equal in my eyes. I am however interested in that the t460p, since you can get some better hardware at the cost of portability.


I am planning on permanently moving away from windows, and currently I am thinking about running Linux Mint on the laptop. It doesn't have to be compatible with mint, but should be working well with atleast some distro. Please give me tips on your favourite distros aswell.


Hopefully this post was not all that unstructured. thank you in advance!"

The first part to the story is back in January when ahe wanted a male friend of hers to fly down and visit, I said i was okay with I just wanted to meet him when he first arrived, then on the morning he came she flipped out and saod never mind id rather you not skip part of work for this and was addement and said we could all get dinner and she promised to answer my text. Through out the day she never answered me back and said where to meet for dinner. When they arrived they we just had a normal dinner, then her and i headed back to my house where we got into a fight a out it. She said she would answer my text the next day, she didnt and we got into another fight that evening and i just drove her to her dorm to sleep there. The following monday she said she wanted to take a brake and broke my heart and i asked her if this had anything to do with him, she said no everytime. A few days later she called me and said she wanted to talk and we ended getting back together because at that point i couldn't belive she would cheat on me. Fast foward to april on our one year anniversary date, we were at the Microsoft store because they had a demo for the vive, when she went in i held her phone for her and she got a text from him, i dont know why but i jusy did, and looked through her phone and there it was, all the sexting going back to January and talking about what they wanted to do with each other. When she was done we headed straight to my car where i confronted her. She swore up and down the she never actually did anything and to give her a chance and i said yes because i loved her so fucking much it hurt. I said she could keep texting him as a friend because one of the things she said was she had so few friends that she wanted to keep the little she had. I said okay to that. The next week were exploring part of her school and she handed me her phone to climb up something and she got another text from him, and i looked through her messages. I saw her making fun of me and laughing about not having sex with me and then saying what position she wanted him to do to her and saying she loved him. It broke my fucking heart i ran out the building and collapsed and he was so angry at me for looking at her phone and yelled all the way back to her dorm room. She collapsed there and kept telling me the next day how she didnt want this to end and i agreed that i wanted to be with her because i still loved her for some stulid reason but i said it was me or him and she wanted me she had to delete and block him from everything she lost it and said it was unfair. She ended staying at a friends moms house for the night while stayed home. We just texted and argued and eventually she agreed to talk and answer my questions and when i come over the next day shes there with the moms son asking if i wanted to plau a board game i just said no and left and then a couple hours later i texted her saying i gave her all her stuff back and it was in her dorm and she begged me to come over and talk to her and i did. When i got there she didnt want to talk and just delayed the talking until the mom came out and it was like that for over an hour and when she finally did come out she still didn't talk and i just left to work. She texted me around ten that night saying if she still could block him and i said i was coming over. She ended up blocking him and we got back together for about two days until i realized she was smarter than me, and going away for the whole summer for a internship and could just unblock him. And i realized i didnt know if i could love her as much as i used to. But this is where being young horny and a fucking idiot comes into play and i let her stay with me for the last week and we have sex everynight so i would agree to hold onto her stuff for the summer because we talked about being friends still and i wanted it. But for the past two months i just cant stop thinking about how much she always texted him and how she acted and it drove me to the end amd i keep goingnoff on her when we trybto talk and its killing me, im so fucking tired of being angry all the time and i dont know how to just forget her and i still have to see her one last time to give her stuff and i offered to move it in before and she said no because she thinks im going to break it and i dont want to i just dont want to have to see her again. Im scared if i do im either going to fall for her bullshit again or just lose it and hit her and i dont want to do either. I just want this to be over."
4pykjn,0,2016-06-26,Soul Crushing Doubts,deep_seething_anger,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/4pykjn/soul_crushing_doubts/,"Men need purpose in life to feel alive.

We want to dominate, achieve, conquer, be appreciated for our skills,
work in something we believe in.

In the past, men had a purpose as a protector, hunter, teacher and warrior.
I can see that being depressing. So few choices. There must have been huge
proportion of men who detested this life. Yet, they pressed on to survive and
provide.

Those days, there are many options for humans to pursue. Acquiring resources,
providing is still fundamental concept in nature that requires expansion of energy,
hard work and is not always fulfilling endeavour. I imagine that many people are
working jobs they don't like because they either do not have opportunity, do not have
fundamental talents for that profession, possess little discipline to reach necessary
proficiency, or like most, are yet to discover their natural talents and employ those abi-
lities to achieve greatness. My problem exactly.

I was going for CS degree at amazing university for 3 years and learned a lot of amazing ideas and concepts invented by brilliant human beings. I feel depressed however, because I don't find programming to be that interesting. I don't have natural talent for it and I envy my classmates who are extremely smart, passionate people who grok programming. Since young age, I HATED feeling of inadequacy and wanted to be great. It is my fundamentally rooted need as a man to feel good about what I do and continually progress. In 3 years, I failed to create those apps I was telling myself to create. I don't think it is laziness or lack of discipline(I play musical instrument, lift weights, can stick with them through sheer discipline). Maybe, I am just not into creating software. Maybe, I lack natural interest and talent for it. As a 23 year-old, I find it excruciating and feel like I wasted my youth years to pursue something I don't really want to do. My track record proves that.

I jumped into programming because it was interesting at a time, was the least commitment from other choices(medicine, scientist(biochemistry)) and I had no strong inclinations for anything. In the past 2 years, I found myself to care loads about fitness, nutrition and read human body in general. However, I don't know if I would be capable of putting up with bullshit in medicine, scientist or programmer life if it paid peanuts. People say that one should be doing something they like doing for free. No such thing for me.

I was diagnosed with depression by a doctor to whom I could not admit that career uncertainty is a major cause of it. But no one can fix that except me. I am afraid to jump ship into medicine, science because bachelor in science requires PhD after that and medicine ... I love sciency details but not dealing with patients and their issues.

Or maybe my depression drags me down and I don't see that my life is not that bad. I have an internship with a bank that starts tomorrow but I am not excited because I don't see how I can succeed working on what I am told when I can't even proceed with my own projects. Any advice is very welcomed because my intellect can't produce a solution to this except complain which makes me even more depressed."
4pzha8,8,2016-06-26,"[D.O. APPLICANT] Found out my MCAT is expired, what are my chances now that I won't have new scores till September?",TrillTaskforce,premed,https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/4pzha8/do_applicant_found_out_my_mcat_is_expired_what/,"So, I had completed my AACOMAS application and had it verified in mid June.

Initially I took the old MCAT in August of 2013, thinking that since I would have all my applications in by August of this year, that I would meet the 3 year cut off. I made some calls and learned that some schools say your 3 years are from your matriculation date, which for me would be in 2017, making my old MCAT score invalid. I had a good score at a 32 (11/10 VR/11) but alas, i have to retake. I've started to study and am scheduled to take the August 20th MCAT, meaning i won't receive my scores back until September 21st of this year. At that point, I'll immediately update my application and send the scores to AACOMAS.

Just to be on the safe side, let's assume I get a 508, which is just under what I scored last time.

What are my chances given that I am no longer applying early in the cycle and that some schools won't have a valid MCAT score from me till like October 1st, 2016?

Here are the rest of my stats:

cGPA: 3.54, sGPA: 3.51

I have a lot of courses that I retook but these are my verified stats from AACOMAS

I have three good LORs that I've submitted, two from professors and one from an MD physician.

My ECs are as follows:

1. Summer internship with an oncologist reading patient charts to compile data on prognostic markers of testicaular cancer - 640 hrs

2. Summer internship working alongside two nephrologists on a study in childhood obesity and hypertension - 420 hrs

3. Hospice volunteer - 100 hrs but currently on going so I'm regularly adding more time.

4. President on fundraising for a club at school dedicated to raising awareness and funds for research into rare genetic diseases and genome sequencing for patients - 180 hrs

5. I have other ECs but those are my big ones, everything else is of less importance tbh.

No publications to my name

BSc. in Molecular biology with a minor in psychology

California Resident - White Male (technically Egyptian but somehow that's considered white)

I've applied to 17 DO schools:

1. AT Still - Arizona
2. Campbell University
3. Chicago COM
4. Des Moines COM
5. Kansas City COM
6. Lake Erie
7. Lake Erie Bradenton
8. Marian COM
9. NYIT COM
10. Nova Southeastern COM
11. Pacific Northwest University

13. Rocky Vista University COM
14 Rowan SOM
15. Touro COM - California
16. Western Univeristy of Health Sciences (my number 1 school)
17. Touro COM - New York

My personal statement is good, I'd say, though I don't really know how it stacks up against others' I put a lot of thought into it. Let's just assume it's slightly above average.


What are my chances of an acceptance?"
4pzq76,2,2016-06-26,[Breeds] What breeds are right for me?,falkentoast,dogs,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/4pzq76/breeds_what_breeds_are_right_for_me/,"So I'm getting close to the point in my life where I can finally have a dog, and I'm just starting to think about what I want. I know I definitely want to rescue a dog so having a purebred isn't important to me but I want to decide generally what to look for when I do start looking. It probably won't be for about a year since I just started a new job and moved into a new apartment and want to settle in, but I'm starting to plan!

**What breeds are you interested in and why?**
Not entirely sure which breeds I want, I love too many different kinds. I don't want to rule anything out really.

**What role is your dog expected to fill and how do you envision your dog fulfilling that role?** 
I mostly just want a companion. A dog who will come along with me on hikes, runs, to the beach, etc. Just a fun somewhat active sidekick.

**What experience do you have owning dogs? How about training dogs? Have you been the primary caregiver of a dog before? If yes, what breed(s)? What is your experience with puppy or senior dog care?**
This will be my first dog - I've been waiting pretty much my whole life. But I do currently live with two dogs, a German Shepherd and a Shepherd mix, that I'm helping take care of and spend time with but not am not the primary owner.

**Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? If so, what breed/type, age, and sex are they? Please include cats and small animals.**
As I said, I live with two other dogs (my cousin's). They are both young, about a year old. We would only be living with them for 2 years, then my cousin is moving out. 

**Do you have children or are you planning on having children? Do you often have children as visitors, such as nieces, nephews, cousins, or friends' children? If you have children or children visitors, what are their ages? If you're planning on kids, when?**
I don't have any kids and won't for a good ten years I think. I don't have any nieces or nephews and am not sure how long it will be before I do, so for now, no kid visitors.

**Do you rent or will you be renting in the future? If so, what breed or weight restrictions are on your lease? What type of building do you rent (condo, apartment, high-rise apartment, townhome, single-family home, etc)?**
I'm currently renting an apartment (it's a great size and super dog friendly with a dog park onsite). We're not allowed to have Pit Bulls, Rottweilers, Cane Corsos, or any mix with those breeds.

**Who lives in your household and who will be responsible for taking care of the dog? How do the other members of the household feel about having a new dog?**
I currently live with just my cousin and her two dogs. I would be the primary caregiver for the new dog, she's in charge of the other two. Everyone would love having another dog around. 

**How often do you have visitors to your home?**
Probably about once a week, but usually just one of two people at once. It's never very crowded in here.

**Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a knowledgeable and reputable breeder?**
I would prefer to adopt.

**Do you want a puppy, a young adult (1-3 years), an adult, or a senior? Why?** I would rather have a young adult or adult dog so I'll know what I'm getting into and not have the crazy time commitment of a puppy. I want the dog to be fairly young though because I want to get lots of years with him/her.

**What size dog are you looking for?**
I'd like a medium sized dog - something around the size of an Australian Shepherd (not saying that's what I want, they're just a great size). I would be fine with a smaller dog too as long as it has the right personality.

**How much barking is too much barking? Are you put-off by other, quieter vocalizations like grumbling or mumbling?**
I definitely appreciate those good ""someone is at the door"" barks but would like my dog to quiet down once I greet the visitor. Any other noises would just be entertaining, not annoying. 

**How much regular brushing are you willing to do?**
I wouldn't mind brushing however much the dog needs to be brushed (like, once a day wouldn't ruin my life, it's good bonding) 

**How much shedding do you think you can handle?**
Medium-ish shedding is fine. Nothing crazy - I don't want to get fistfuls of fur every time I pet my dog but I don't mind vacuuming when I need to.

**Are you open to trimming your dog's hair, cleaning ears, clipping nails, or doing other grooming at home?**
I'm fine with all that. I did an internship as a vet tech so I've clipped and cleaned a lot of dogs. It's easy enough.

**How do you feel about slobber? What about farts?**
I wouldn't want a really slimy dog. Farts are fine. I grew up with brothers.

**How eager-to-please or independent do you want your dog to be? Eagerness to please is known as being ""biddable"". Do you want your dog to listen to you because that's what dogs should do, or do you not mind if your dog ignores you unless you have something they want? Are you okay with something in between?**
I would want a pretty biddable dog. I've never trained a dog before so I think I would need more of a ""beginner"" breed. It would be fun to teach my dog a bunch of unique tricks but it's not necessary. I would just kind of go with what's right for his/her personality.

**Is there any behavior you can’t accommodate?**
My dog would have to be friendly with other dogs since we'll be living with two others, and often visiting with my friends' and brothers' dogs. It would also have to be pretty easy going around strangers just because I want to be able to take it with me as much as possible wherever I go.

**How important is being able to let your dog roam off-leash in an unfenced area?**
Off-leash would be really important to me because we would be going to my family's beach on most warm weekends and it's way better if the dog can run around and have fun without me worrying too much than to have to keep it super close to me all day. I would feel terrible holding him or her back from some good running and swimming.

**How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What kinds of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly?**
I would say I can put in about two hours a day on weekdays. I go for a ~2 mile jog most mornings (I'm working up to doing more like 5k on average so we'll keep each other in shape), we would go for another good walk in the evening and/or an hour or so in the dog park. Since I work all day I would probably sign up for doggie day care a couple days a week, and our apartment has a dog walking service I would use on the other days. On weekends I like to go for longer (half day) hikes - not very intense hikes though I live in the suburbs - or would be spending the whole day at the beach. Bonus would be a dog who would enjoy going with me on the stand-up paddle board.  

**How long do you have to devote to mental stimulation each day?**
Probably not a ton since I would be spending a lot of time exercising instead. Of course I would spend time on basic obedience at home and puzzle/game toys but probably not very intense training. I would guess around an hour a day on that.

**Where will the dog be kept when alone and where will the dog sleep?**
This depends on the dog - he/she could be left to roam the house if it was well behaved enough, or a crate if it was more comfortable in that. I don't want the dog in my bed but otherwise he/she can sleep wherever they like.

**How often and for how long will the dog be left alone? On an average day, how long will nobody be in the house?**
I would be out of the house weekdays 8-6pm, but my cousin gets home around 4pm. 
 
**If needed, could you hire a dog walker, pay for doggy day care, or come home during lunch to take care of your dog?**
Would definitely hire a dog walker/sign up for doggie daycare/maybe a mix of both.

**What is the average temperature of a typical summer day where you live? A typical winter day?**
I live in the Northeast, so summer gets up into the 80's (F) and winter can get down to 0 (F).

**On a scale of 1 to 10, how prepared are you to care for a dog and prioritize its well-being over your career, entertainment, or other life choices for the next 12 or more years? Do you have an emergency plan for the dog in case something were to happen to you or your living situation?**
10 - I've been waiting for this my whole life and have basically planned aspects of my life around getting a dog. This dog would be everything to me.

**Are you aware of the costs associated with dog ownership on an average annual basis? Have you budgeted for additional emergency veterinary care and/or pet insurance?**
Yes, I have a whole dog fund that I'm working on (this is why it'll be another year or so until I'm ready). Watching my cousin raise her two puppies has shown me all the unexpected costs that come with dogs."
4q039i,1,2016-06-26,"22 [F4M] California/Anywhere - I am bad with titles, but let's talk!",jjellyxfishh,r4r,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/4q039i/22_f4m_californiaanywhere_i_am_bad_with_titles/,"Hi! I am a 22 year old female, and I am looking for a guy to chat with, with potential of being more than just friends. I am not too picky about looks, but I do prefer a guy that can make fun of himself as well as joke about things that most others won’t joke about, like death and other things that aren’t exactly politically correct, although I am pretty good about not touching on subjects that are found to be offensive. This is sort of long, so bear with me, I would prefer you read the whole thing, but **tl;dr at the end.** 

Personality wise, I can be a bit flirty, but I can also be a bit sarcastic and condescending, maybe even insulting (Although once I am told someone is bothered by something I say, I will not say it anymore. It would make me a complete dick if I didn’t stop lol.), but it’s all in good fun. I can also take jokes really well, maybe play a little ‘yes, and’ with them. I am also not past making fun of myself, or pretending to be overconfident and things like that, because if you can’t make fun of yourself, who can you make fun of? One things that puts people off about me is that I have a very morbid, and inappropriate, sense of humor. I can laugh at almost anything, and it has caused me to lose a lot of friendships. With all that being said, I am also really sensitive, and am always around to be a friend to anyone in need of it. My goal is to make everyone I become friends with feel like they are very important and special, because I know what it is like to not have a friend to talk to, and I don’t want anyone else to feel that way. 

When it comes to looks, I am a shorter kinda Hispanic woman (I am not really sure what to label myself when it comes to race or ethnicity.) At 5’2, I still stand out a bit, as my sass levels exceed my height. This may not be apparent when looking at a regular pic of just my face, but I am a bit overweight, and am working on my goal to lose a few (or maybe a bit more) pounds. I wear glasses and have almost shoulder length hair. I also almost always wear jeans and a t shirt, I am far more partial to comfort than I am to looking hot. I can provide pictures of myself once we get talking as well.

As for things that I do and am interested in, there is a lot of things to list. I am almost always talking about my dogs, or dogs and cats I encounter at work, as I am an intern at a vet clinic, and am hoping to get a job at one soon as a vet tech. If you have any questions about how important spaying, neutering, and vaccinations for your pet are, I will be able to tell you, as I am very passionate about those topics. I love movies, I can pretty much watch movies from any genre, but horror will always be my favorite. There is something about being terrified that will always make me feel great once a movie is over. Another thing I absolutely love is music, I listen to a lot of different thing, but most of my favorite bands/artists are things most people I meet don’t know about. I love to read, at the moment my two favorite authors are Chuck Palahniuk and Joe Hill, but I am getting more into Lovecraft and Stephen King. There is a lot of other things I like and am interested in, but those come out in random conversation. 

**tl;dr sarcastic, chubby, vet tech, horror fan needs new friends, possibly more. PM me with a description of yourself and your age, and I will only get back to you if you provide those things, at least. I have kik, skype, snapchat, or we can talk here (although I may take a bit to reply here), so if you’d like add your info for one or more of those to your PM.**

Living in SF Bay Area",passaround,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4q06qz/18_dad_sole_breadwinner_passed_away_mother_only/,"Hey guys. I'm trying to keep my mind off things and thinking of the next step. I can't believe this is happening and life is bullshit, but anyway I gotta do something. Anyway, I should start. I have no idea what's going on so appreciate the help.

I'm 18 years old, just graduated high school going to a $30k private school next year for college. I have a sister (sophomore) who is in a $20k high school, and my mom and dad, living in a $1m house in the silicon valley. I guess we were relatively well off.

Shit just hit the fan today when my dad passed away - he was the only person making any significant money on a very high salary (enough to pay the mortgage, three cars, send us to school, etc.). Now he's gone and we have no clue at all about what to do. We get some money off life insurance and company insurance but I have no idea.

Where do we start? Cost of living is obviously immensely high - my school is in Texas so maybe my mom and sister move out there. But that means screwing up my sister's education to move out. She hasn't been good at making friends so moving here equals social disaster for her.

I'm so scared for the future. Financially we were sound and my dad had dreams of moving to London, both my parents retiring at 65, I would be able to get internships with the companies my dad had connections with, my sister could go to one of the best high schools in the country. We were pretty comfortable. Maybe I'm a stuck-up rich kid. But now it seems like my mom is going to work for the rest of her life and my sister's education will be screwed. I can't let that happen to them because it's totally out of their control, but maybe I can do something.

Please help me guys, I have no idea what to do. My mom can't afford to send me to college and my sister to that high school. Is it normal to take on $120k in student loans? Maybe I stop going to college and let my sister finish high school while I work? I don't know

Thank you. I need as much help as possible"

A little background on me -  I have  BS in Biology, a Post-Graduate Certificate in Forensic Investigation, and an internship completed under Medical Examiner Investigator position. 

Next month I am going to be taking a 50% written and 50% simulation test for the position of Crime Scene Technician Trainee. They said they will be sending out study materials two weeks before the test. I really have no idea what to expect with this test. My plans are to search the internet for as many crime scene related terms as I can and study as much as possible before I even get the study materials. If you have taken a similar test can you tell me what type of stuff was on it? What was the simulation like? Computer based or did they set up fake crime scenes, etc.? 

I am out of state and they have agreed to do a phone interview with me if I do well enough on the test. (I will be driving there to take the test portion). 

If I pass the test and the interview, I will then have to take a polygraph test. Can anyone tell me ANYTHING about this polygraph test? I have a generalized anxiety disorder, it doesn't prevent me from doing anything and I have learned to manage it very well, but I do get more nervous than most would, I think, and therefore i'm sure I have physiological signs of such, i'm concerned it will look like i'm being deceitful when i'm not.  Also, I used to be a pretty big pot head.. I want to be honest with them about this. Will that kill my chances? 

I'm looking for any tips, advice, or information at all regarding the test, interview, and polygraph.. it would be so helpful and I'd truly appreciate it! "

I wont go into too much detail but I have 2 more months left of my 4 month internship and I want to make them count.

I work in a department with kinda two sub departments. We work pretty closely and that is how I met Brad. Brad is just amazing. He's smart, funny, attractive and very genuine. He is also single. 

I love spending time with him and have developed a pretty serious crush. The problem is that I don't know what to do about it. I've always been pretty bad at interpreting guy's feeling so I don't know for sure how he feels about me.

So far since I've been at the workplace I have went out to lunch with him twice. Once with a third person and once just the two of us. Both times he was super insistent on paying for my meal BUT he is a really nice guy so that might not mean much.

I've texted him outside work a couple times and he always responds. I asked him to get coffee over break time, he usually goes anyways with other guys who work there, he accepted. I met him there and he was waiting for me with a coffee. It was incredibly sweet and I couldn't stop smiling all day.

I ended up going out with him and some other coworkers this weekend and had a great time. It gets a bit awkward that my coworkers are aware of my crush and do make some pointed comments. For the most part though, I think he is unaware of my feelings (or maybe not, idk?)

I want to believe that he likes me and is going to ask me out but I'm terrified he doesn't and I'm just making a huge fool out of myself. All of our one-on-one actions have been facilitated by me and not him. He has never texted me first.

My coworkers are convinced he likes me but I deep down am not convinced. BUT one of my coworkers did make the point that it may be awkward for him to make a move when I am a student (intern) and he is a full time employee. 

I am super conflicted about what I want to do. I feel like if I just sit around and wait for him to make a move it wont happen. 

I have always been very straightforward and maybe even a bit aggressive about pursuing guys I like. I know that its not really normal for the girl to make the first move but I don't think there is anything wrong with it?!

Its not that I am looking to lock him down as my boyfriend or anything. I just legitimately like him and want to get to know him better. I have ""liked"" a lot of guys in the past but never has someone given me butterflies like Brad does. Just having a nice chat with him in the morning will make my entire day.

I don't want to not do anything and regret it BUT I also don't want to make a fool out of myself. The last thing I want is to make things uncomfortable or awkward between Brad and I. 

What do you think I should do reddit? Should I just go for it and ask him out on a date or back off??

Please help.

TLDR: Have a crush on a coworker, want to know if I should make the first big move or not."

*""When you take away everything that makes a man a man, when you strip away everything that makes him human and turn him into a machine,  he will come to hate the world, and he will hate you most of all.""*

*[Theme Song](https://youtu.be/oXRLoiD7G2k?t=124)*

*Aliases: (Previously) King, (Currently) Tyrant*

**Background:**

""Can we rebuild him?""

""Not only that, but we can *improve* him.""

[Alec Tuttle](https://www.reddit.com/r/WhoWouldWinVerse/comments/3j5sql/respect_king/) was as good as dead. He had taken the initiative and attempted to steal a journalists interviews with countless metahumans. Unfortunately for him the journalist was secretly a member of [Lupus-Armstrong](https://www.reddit.com/r/WhoWouldWinVerse/comments/3jpt8c/respect_lupusarmstrong/) and soon after giving the tape recorder containing the interviews to King, he pressed a hidden detonator and [blew the entire city block off the map.](https://www.reddit.com/r/WhoWouldWinVerse/comments/3mp60h/a_journalist_looking_for_metahumans_to_interview/cvh1ltd) Unknown to the rest of the world, though, LA agents recovered what was left of King, and in keeping with their research on metahuman abilities, experimented on what was left of him, keeping him alive with their sinister science. They believed that by enhancing his abilities with cybernetics, they could create a loyal cyborg assassin which could be used to increase their world influence.

The man heading this research was one Fredric Keller, a brilliant metahuman and cybernetics expert and one of LA's top scientists. He was a cruel man, and did anything to progress his research, no matter the damage to Alec's mind. As a result, after almost five years, Alec was reduced to a rage-filled ghost of his former self with no memory of his past life. Afraid that he would damage himself and realizing how close to completion the project was, Keller placed an experimental device in Alec. This device allowed anyone who wore a special bracelet total control over Alec's actions through the use of mental commands. His transformation into mindless cyborg assassin complete, Alec was dubbed ""Tyrant"", and LA was ready to begin their reign of terror.

Then disaster struck, and Clive Cole caused the destruction of Lupus Armstrong, damaging Tyrant in the process. Keller escaped the destruction of the base and, with a small cadre of followers, set up a secret lab in a ruined district of Chicago. Now with less resources, it took some time to repair the damaged Tyrant, but eventually Keller was ready once again to take back what was his. His first target was Clive Cole, but once again something would go wrong before his plans came to fruition. One of Keller's best proteges, a young scientist named Norman, went into the lab late at night and stole Tyrant's control bracelet. Norman resented Keller's position as leader and believed he could do much more with Tyrant's abilities than right old wrongs. That night, he blew up the base and fled into the night with Tyrant. Unbeknownst to him however, he wouldn't make it far...

**Description/Artwork:**

[Tyrant is a cyborg](http://imgur.com/IqbUWYQ), and has had almost his entire body replaced by machine. Underneath his helmet is what remains of his charred face, a wisp of golden hair and a single blind eye all that is left of the once attractive boy's visage. His cybernetic body is sleek and streamlined, designed for maximum stealth and efficiency. His voice with his helmet on is modulated, sounding deep and robotic. Without, his voice is raspy and deathly quiet, a testament to how little of his actual body remains.

His robot body stands 5' 11'' tall and weighs 200 lbs.

**Alignment/Attitude:**

Tyrant is a chaotic evil *villain*. Unable to remember even his real name, all Tyrant has left are fleeting remnants of his past self. For reasons unknown he attempts to maintain an air of calm during conversation, though it may seem robotic in nature due to his voice. Despite this, he suffers from bouts of extreme rage, and underneath it all is his ever present compulsion to steal.

**Intentions and Tier Listing:**

Tyrant will be used both for RP and stories.

Tyrant sits in *Delta Tier*.

****

#**Powers:**

**Cybernetic Body:**

Tyrant's body has been almost entirely replaced with cybernetics, leaving only parts of his head intact.

*Enhanced Survivability:*

Tyrant is capable of surviving massive damage to his frame. So long as most of his head is intact and he hastily retreats to make repairs, he is capable of survival.

*Enhanced Computation, HUD, and Combat Prediction:*

Complex computer algorithms, prediction technology, improved optics, and a combination of Alec's enhanced brain confer a massive increase in reaction times. As a result, he has 1 ms reaction times. However, once he perceives a threat his psychic powers massively overload his body's speed, increasing his reactions to 800 microseconds.

This also includes his enhanced senses, which include 10x human hearing, the ability to magnify his vision up to 15x, and special vision modes like thermal and night vision. Unfortunately, Tyrant is unable to smell.

*Cybernetic Immunity:*

As most of his body is robotic, Alec is immune to biological hazards and does not need to eat or drink, instead being powered by a special reactor, designed by Keller, inside his chest. The schematics for this reactor are programmed into his brain, and he can replace them.

Tyrant's body is immune to electromagnetic pulses and resistant to electricity attacks. In addition, he cannot be hacked, because his brain is still mostly human.

Tyrant is resistant to temperatures between -10 C and 2000C

**Psychic Powers:**

Alec was granted psychic abilities by the white event, and much of LA's research went into taking Alec's psychic powers and focusing them internally and amplifying them. As a result, Alec's powers have been increased massively at the cost of some of their functionality.

*Teleportation &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; Spacial Awareness:*

Tyrant's signature ability, it allows him to teleport anywhere he can see or has been to before within 1 mile of his current location. He can choose whether to maintain momentum or not, and cannot teleport inside solid objects or people. Tyrant can teleport as fast as he can think, or approximately 1200 times every second. He cannot bring others with him when teleporting, but can bring objects up to 250 tons.

In addition, Tyrant has spacial awareness out to 200 meters of himself, able to detect projectiles as small as grains of sand. Within this field he can tell if someone is a White Event metahuman or not, but is unable to tell what their powers are. 

*Psychic Defense Matrix:*

Tyrant's psychic internalization has caused a sort of 'psychic energy field' to surround him and protect him from mind reading.

Tyrant is immune to in tier mind reading and telepathy, seemingly invisible to people using these powers.

*Psy-Sabers:*

Added to the agenda by a plucky intern who wanted Tyrant to have ""cool weapons"", the Psy-Sabers are blades manifested of Psychic energy. They can be [created](http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/powerlisting/images/f/fe/Galvatron_Energon_Sword.gif/revision/latest?cb=20151031170814) in Tyrant's hands (a process which takes 2 ms).

The blades in conjunction with his speed hit with 35 GPa of cutting power and are near indestructible.

The blades glow purple, can be made anywhere from 5 to 48 inches long.

**Enhanced Physicals:**

For simplicity, Tyrant's physicals will be listed here since they are derived from both of his powers:

*Strength:*

1 ton overhead.

Due to his speed his striking strength is 50 tons.

*Speed:*

Travel:~100 mph

Combat: Due to his psychic powers sending his body into an accelerated state during combat, Tyrant has mach 5.5 combat speed.

*Durability:*

It takes ~40 MJ, 3.5 MN, or 700MPa to seriously damage Tyrant's frame. Anything less is not significant and can be mostly ignored.

****

**Weakness:**

* Unable to smell.

* Has lost most of his memory and is partially insane, and could therefore be manipulated.

* There is an implant in his brain which, by the use of a specific remote, can be used to control him.

* Has very low durability for his tier.

* Is unable to bring people with him when teleporting.

**Skills:**

* A master of using his teleportation in combat as well as out of it.

* Very good at stealth and infiltration.

* After extensive training and programming, is intrinsically skilled with his psy-blades, using them like extensions of himself.

* His training with Thespian has been augmented by his cybernetic programming, making him adept at hand to hand combat.

* Can speak English, Spanish, Russian, Italian, and German.

* Of everything that was erased from his memory, his chess skills remain, though he is out of practice.

**Standard Gear:**

4 sticky explosive charges, each with the same force as approximately 10kg of C4, and able to be primed and detonated remotely.

Two energy machine pistols, which can fire rapidly (100 rounds/second) for 10 seconds before needing to recharge inside his legs (sort of like how robocop's gun pops out of his thigh), or fire 2 charged shots. Rapid fire shots are approximately the same as .50 BMG rounds, and powered shots explode for 40 MJ. They look something like [this](https://cdn3.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/001/246/735/large/jisoo-kim-2.jpg?1442929277).

2 Smoke grenades that release opaque red smoke in a 20mx20m area.

A few spare power cores at his base of operations.

**Base of Operations:**

His repair equipment is currently in storage in what's left of Fredric Keller's base.

****

**Feats:**

*Durability:*

* Tanked a tank round to the chest.

*  Took a 100 ton punch to the face.

*  After having a building collapse on him, he had to teleport away for repairs.

*Speed:*

* Dodged a Mach 3.5 attack from 1 meter away by teleporting.

* Deflected continuous minigun fire from 6 directions with his swords.

* Teleported to the other side of the planet in 20 seconds.

*Damage:*

* His gun's charged shot blew open a vault door.

* Stabbed into a delta with cap durability (but no special cutting durability) with his psy blades.

* Destroyed a tank by repeatedly punching it."

I'm going to be a CS freshman this fall, so I'm basically looking to put anything on my resume to make it not blank.

For the code, a decent portion of it is exactly as he showed in lecture; however, all of the advanced / additional features I added were all my code. So I was wondering if it was appropriate to put the project on my github and resume, despite not all of the code being mine? I won't and don't want to claim his code as my own.

Additionally, I realize a calculator app isn't all that impressive to internship recruiters, and I'm looking to make some more advanced apps in the future as I continue learning. But for now, I figure it's better than nothing."

Basically, I started my paid internship at the beginning of the summer (my only W-2 job for the year) and I'm having taxes withheld as if I'm making over $60k, but obviously I won't be making that much because I'm only here for the summer.  I went to the IRS's website and used the [tax withholding calculator](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/irs-withholding-calculator) to determine what my allowances should be (without factoring any tax deductions) and applied tried to apply it before the first check but it didn't take effect until after the first check (the ""number of allowances"" was around 10). According to the calculator, the first check's tax withholding (which included a taxable stipend for various expenses) apparently covered my tax burden for the entire year.  So what should I do at this point?  I don't really want a sizable tax return, I'm a student and I kind of need my money now.  Should I put in a huge number for the allowances?  Should I check the box that says I'm tax exempt?  I'm really not sure what to do here because if this keeps up, I'm going to have &gt;$1000 tax return and I really would rather have that money now.

tl;dr I'm being taxed like I'm making &gt;$60k but I'm not.

Thanks."

First, you're the young summer intern who keeps making very forward advances towards me that I try to ignore but then one day I find a pair of panties in my bag when leaving work and you text me asking if I got your present.

Second, You're at a party where I had bought booze for the non 21 year olds and ask for me to drive you home, but because you told your parents you were staying at a friends you can't go home, so you come with me instead.

I wake up to find I've been turned into a young girl, and you either orchestrated it or help me adjust.

It's Halloween and you convince me to dress up as a girl in costume and then eventually you fuck me with a strap and show me what it's like to be on the other end of a rough fuck that I usually dish out.

Let me know if you are into any of these or have another idea of your own you wanna explore!"
4q1dk3,1,2016-06-26,Transferring from Stevens Institute of Technology to City College of New York. Much needed guidance.,xbxvx97,CollegeTransfer,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeTransfer/comments/4q1dk3/transferring_from_stevens_institute_of_technology/,"**Intro Paragraph(You can skip this paragraph)**

Hello. I am a rising sophomore currently enrolled in Stevens Institute of Technology. Over the past couple of days, I've been debating on whether or not to transfer colleges based on a couple of recent rumors and events. Basically, my current university is rumored to decline drastically in my field of study(Cyber security major) with less funding and support to the program. I value my education a lot and unfortunately, this rumor is leaning on true. I can go into more detail, but that's for another time. Not only is the program declining, private school is getting more and more expensive as the minute goes by. II'm blessed to be free from any major financial difficulties so far, but I'm not rich and this situation can change in a matter of seconds. I am very worried about my money situation.

One of the selling points about Stevens was the ROI and career support post graduation. However, they have not been much of help towards me in my job. I have an internship right now as an IT technician and I found that job all by myself, no help from Stevens. So considering that, Stevens is looking less and less attractive by the minute. I am sad about losing some friends, but I am across the river so I can easily see them at anytime. After much thought about my situation, I've decided to start transferring.

**Help me**

I've decided to transfer from Stevens Institute of Technology into City College of New York's computer science program by the start of this Fall 2016. My current major is Cyber Security and CCNY offers a bunch of courses in that field. So, I need help in the entire transfer process.

This includes:

* FAFSA transfer

* High School Transcript Transfer

* College Transcript Transfer

* Credit Transfer

* SAT/ACT

* Documentation and processing.

* School refunds

I've been looking on the CCNY website and they offer walk in admissions up until July 12th, so I have some time. I plan to be completely transfer by then. I need help on where to start and how to do things. Please someone help me, I'm a little stressed out at the moment.

Thank you everyone for reading.

4q1fhw,4,2016-06-26,holding this in for 2 years,gottathr0waway,venting,https://www.reddit.com/r/venting/comments/4q1fhw/holding_this_in_for_2_years/,"Get ready for a long post, been meaning to get this off my chest for such a long time. Needed to put all my thoughts into words.

2 years ago on a Saturday night, me and my best friend since pre-school went to our friend's house to watch the USA world cup game. Had a beer or 2, was feeling good. At halftime, we decided we'd walk to the bar down the street to finish up the game. I was 20 at the time, wasn't carded, didn't buy anything. Friends bought me a couple mixed drinks, was feeling drunk. Then one friend ordered an ""adios amigo"" and I was done. Completely blacked out. My friends slung me over their shoulders and walked me back to the house we were at originally. I had every intention of sleeping over or waiting to sober up and go to my uncles house where my family was.

Somehow, my friends put me in the backseat of my own car, and my best friend takes the wheel, thinking he was feeling ok. Somewhere along the drive to my uncles house, he sideswipes a car knocking out my passenger mirror and window, which must've spooked him cause he obviously didn't stop. 

I woke up from blackout in my passenger seat with my GPS in my lap, screaming out the window to stop the car. We were apparently near my uncles house because I found out at a later date he had heard screaming from his back porch and thought it was me. 

Not more than a minute later, impact. We were approaching a T-intersection, about to turn left. At this time of night, our direction had blinking red lights meaning STOP. The cross traffic had blinking yellows meaning slow/caution. It seemed as though my friend had slowed to take the turn, but someone turning left from the cross traffic turned sharply and we collided front to front basically. Airbags went off in my car, my friend hit the steering wheel and got a concussion, I got a face full of bag giving me a busted lip, slightly burned cheek, and a bloody nose. 

My friend and I are freaking out. We get out of the car and run to the sole passenger of the other car. I was in a Pathfinder, she was driving a Dodge Stratus. A mid-20s slightly overweight woman got out confused and in a panic, claimed she'd never been in accident before. We all just kind of hugged for a little bit, I was fading in and out at this point, the initial shock had woken me right up and I was slowly losing coherence. I attempted to try and move my car, but it wouldn't turn over. From behind the steering wheel, I saw my friend in a frenzy. He was crying and yelling, I had never seen him like this before. All during our childhood he wanted to be involved in law enforcement, talked about the FBI at some point, and he was in phase 2 of 3 of becoming a state trooper at this time. All these thoughts started swirling around my head in my dizzying state and I thought about how this would affect him, would probably end his chances if the academy ever found out. I put my face into the deployed airbag in the steering wheel, leaving a trail of blood from my nose. I got out of the car and my memory stops there. 

I don't remember police. I don't remember being handcuffed. I don't remember being put into the back of the cop car. I wake up crying somewhere in the station getting my mugshot taken, wondering what was happening. I was offered a phone call to be picked up, I didn't want to hear my disappointed parents, or anyone else for that matter. Declined the call, was escorted to a cell, and passed out. 

Woke up the next morning in a fuss, officers were somewhat sympathetic, and I called me dad, too afraid of what my mom would think. Called one of my friends from the night before, he bailed me out and drove me home. 

I was in the middle of my summer internship at the time, and about a month until my court date. I was advised to get a lawyer from one of my friend's dads, and began going through the steps. He told me to get letters from my peers and supervisors, showing what a good person I was, but also prepared me for the worst case scenario: attempted manslaughter. If for any reason the passenger of the car we hit was injured or claimed injury, I could be charged with it. He told me not to dwell on it too much but to be aware.

When my best friend who was in the car with me came to, I got an essay's worth of texts telling me how sorry he was for what happened. How he thought he was sober but the alcohol hit him during the drive. He told me he pleaded with the cop, saying he was driving but that the police didn't believe him since he was the son of a town cop, and thought my friend was trying to save me the trouble. 

At a later meeting with the officer regarding my license suspension, he verified this by saying my passenger attempted to tell him he was driving, but said that ultimately, it was my bloody nose that doomed me, as my friend was not bleeding from his face, and therefore couldn't leave any blood on the steering wheel airbag. It was my car, my blood on the steering wheel, and my fault. So I was taken away. 

Now I don't like to think of it as me taking the fall, but in those few moments where I saw my best friend crying uncontrollably, I could not help but think that this would hurt him a lot worse than it would me. It would ruin his potential career, and everything he worked for. I am not sure what I would of done in a conscious state of mind, but in my unconscious state, I didn't fight. I didn't argue. 

So I appear for my court date. I dressed nicely, blazer and slacks. In the waiting area I was approached by several people, asking if I was there to represent them. Thought it was so strange. I enter the courtroom, hand the judge my letters of recommendation, and my lawyer does all the talking. I must have had a guardian angel because I was fined $50 for running a red light, and sent to alcohol counseling.

A few days later I went to the counselor who would determine how I fulfilled the state requirement, 10 or 15 weeks of education. After a brief interview with a very intimidating man, I left with a sentence of 10 weeks to fulfill the counseling, and a 45min MADD session. Seeing as I was starting school in just under 2 weeks, I could not afford to take time away to spend in the counseling, so I went back to the court and they informed me of a 36 hour intensive program in a different state. I had 1 year to complete it. 

I had a very rough semester at school. First time without a car. Bumming for rides, walking everywhere, not even being allowed to drive. I was very sad, couldn't sleep most nights, awoken by a flash of headlights in my nightmares.

Come winter break I go to the MADD session. I had not participated in one since high school where they give it to the whole school. I sat in the front row and was made out to be some sort of villain by the mothers speaking. They looked me in the eyes blaming me for their losses. I was so saddened by their losses and photos, it was very emotional. A few weeks later my mom drove me to the overnight program where I spent a weekend with mainly middle aged men who had been drinking and struggling with their drinking for longer than I had been alive. I felt so out of place. I could not connect with these men at all. I didn't like participating in the conversations, and didn't even share my story with them when we were all going around. I was disconnected and didn't want to be apart of their group. 

At the end of the weekend, I had ""passed"" but was recommended for future counseling for my apparent alcohol tendencies. When I got back to school in the spring, I began looking for alcohol certified counselors. There was a clinic close by that I tried first. Did a screening with a pee test, but was informed the counseling would not be covered under my insurance so I walked. Already financially drained enough from the ordeal. I found another therapist that covered me and met with her. She also asked for a pee test before speaking with her, and after 1 session with her, she determined I had a serious alcohol problem and needed further counseling. I was completely frustrated at this point, determined that I really didn't have a problem. My close friends that I told could not believe I was going through this as I had a reputation for being the ""nerd"" staying in and not visiting bars or going out to parties with them (especially tough being in a frat house for 3 years). I went to my school's alcohol counselor and explained my entire situation, which was backed up by the counselor I was already seeing for my anxiety, and received a ""clean bill of health.""  I took this paper to the court as soon as I was home for the summer, and was done with this whole incident. It was wiped off my criminal record, but would stay on my driving record for quite some time. I had finally rid myself of the sadness and depression I felt, holding a guilty conscience all this time.

My best friend who was with me in the car was there for the most part. He felt extremely guilty and was offering to buy me a new car, and pay for all this stuff. He wasn't in the best financial position to actually do so, but I appreciated the offer. I told him I didn't do it in order to be paid back. But he knew he would be making a lot of money soon, as he was accepted into the state trooper academy by this time. He had almost a full year of work ahead of him by the time I graduated school. 

So after another successful summer internship, I graduated college and have a full time job ahead of me. I have saved up my money and got myself a little car to get me to and from work. I am finally past all of this...

Or so I thought. The offer I accepted is at-will, and I got a phone call last week letting me know they saw my driving record, and are a little concerned because I may need to use my car during work hours (which I hadn't known previously) and that it would not be allowed under company policy because of my record. I told them I understood and would be more than willing to take public transportation if needed. I am supposed to receive another call this week to see what my bosses say. 

I am extremely worried my career is now in jeopardy, as well as any future opportunities. I hope they can overlook this matter and keep me on board as I only have a few years left with this on my record. I had no idea my job would involve driving during the day and I assumed that if it was necessary, I certainly wouldn't be going alone. In previous experiences I was always escorted and driven around everywhere.

My best friend continues to show guilt towards this situation, I'm not quite sure how he's doing mentally about it, maybe he doesn't think he's paid me back yet? He says he'll give me money eventually, to help out with my expenses (although I'm not really in a desperate need for it anymore, but it would be helpful) but I've yet to receive anything except the occasional dinner and a movie. 

I'm not really sure how to feel. I don't think I would feel that much better if I received a large sum from him, especially knowing he has it since he's still living at home with very little expenses. But it would be nice to have something to kind of even the field. Maybe I'm feeling to smug or materialistic about it.

Value of car at the time: ~$3000
Cost of lawyer for the year: $1500
Actual fine: $50
Cost of education program + MADD: ~$700
Cost of various counselors &amp; pee tests: $200

So like $5000 right? Would having that much money added to my bank account help right now? Yea it really would, but in 2 weeks when I get my first paycheck, I'll have at least that. I'm happy I'm still friends with him for the most part. Although many other friends and even my family disagrees and feels like he owes me (which maybe he does but is money the answer?) 

Anyway, thanks for reading if you did. Needed to get this out there even if nobody reads it. "
4q1kfy,2,2016-06-27,Me [19F] feels that my mom[42F] and flatmates [33F and 53F] jumped too much into my privacy. Now I am being depressed and afraid of every thing that can harm me. Help!,Ihaveatasktodotoday,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4q1kfy/me_19f_feels_that_my_mom42f_and_flatmates_33f_and/,"I have been studying abroad since the age of 14, alone, no family, no relatives in London. Only me staying in the doom for 2 years then I started living privately. My dad in Vietnam supported me financially. I love him so much! He is my role model in every way that I can see him, at my highest respect. He is kind and thinkable man. However few years ago, he cheated on my mom because they did not see things in the same way anymore but staying together because they think it'd be better for me and my brother (15M) having parents living in the same house. Jesus Christ! You don't know how much I was stressful during that time, obviously that's not what me and my bro want! They got divorced and I am with my dad. Due to my (highly) ignorant characteristic, I think our parents's problems always belong to them or their responsibility. 

In reverse, I had serious relationship problem with my mom. After I came back from UK after 3 years I have been living alone, things just got so different to me! I cannot handle anything that control my freedom, but my mom kept doing things like: ""where did you get your money from?"" ""Why did you use $1 to buy snack?"" ""Who the hell did you speak to? Was that your bf?"" ""No! you can't have your own money even if your dad gave it to you. I have to be the person taking control of your finance...""  I was 17 at that time and through the entire period of summer vacation, I can never find the right way to talk to her. Until now when I am 19, she still doing things like that. I have no motivation to understand someone always being aggressive toward me. Simply is that: if there is thing that I cannot solve now except from my work task (I am workaholic), then I will just drop it without any excuse and explanation. I don't wanna stress myself. From that on, I talked less to my mom and about 1 year ago, she went bankrupts because of her mistakes in doing business strategy. She was so stressful, and she brought all of that into the conversations with any family members. I was depressed before and tried to commit suicide but did not success when I was 14. So this was st dragged me back to the path of depression. I felt too much of negative energy every time she talked to me, so I stopped communicating to her in anyway. She said that I was not sympathized her, I was not respected her and my reaction telling her that she is having a stucked-up and betrayed daughter. I was wtf and kept my silence. But every once per week, she kept hitting my phone and yelling and swearing at me. I started losing my respect to her and told her to leave me alone. She hasn't yet! 

When I entered my 1st year of university, I felt really down since I did not get into my dreamed university due to all of the depression. So I missed out my Cambridge's offer. When I got my 2nd choice in a university in Central of London, I cannot find the place to live in since the confirmation of school was too late (like the end of Aug). I then lived in a flat with a family business friend's niece who has been in UK for 10 years. She let me rent that place for a quite high rent fee comparing to the area. However she is quite nosy and believe me or not, her daughter [5F] kept going into my room without knocking the door or even when I am not in my room and stole my stuff! I told her something like ""I am finding my ___, it looks quite cute, so just in case your daughter saw it and borrowed it for a moment, can you plz ask her to bring it back to me?"" and she told me that her daughter is so innocent. What the hack I talked about. I was speechless. I started feeling really annoying whenever her daughter kept jumping into my room like that (since my room has no locker at all! so I always shut the door). After 3m I've been lived there, I found out that she reported everything about me to my mom via phone! I told her that I am not feeling happy with that at all and asked her to stop that. 

My dad is always worried that I not good alone in UK. So when I lived at her place, he seemed to find a bit of security. I don't wanna make him worried about me, so I stayed at her place for the 2nd year and kept perusing that I can do that. I never stayed at home during the daytime and always be back home at 11 PM. I started dating my bf from Mar this year and sometimes weekends he was overnight in my place. There was a week around May/June, I had a surgery in my stomach area, bad bleeding and cannot take care of myself. He was over for nearly a month to take care of me. Ofc due to my injury, we cannot even have sex for that long of time! However, the flatmate called my mom and said that I was dating to a man and he kept staying at my place for a month. I don't think she has the right to spread out the word about my privacy like that? I always keep my relationship things to myself only, not even sharing to my dad or my bff. 

Now my dad feels disappointed about me because in our culture, older generation always think dignity of a women being defined by her virginity. Ofc I have different point of view. So I simply just keep my stuff to myself. However because my mom always feels bad about me, she called me once during the peak time of my exams and told me that If I am not being good to her, she gonna telling my dad about my bf and 1-month thing. I told her that whatever she is up to, I am fed up with her behaviour and plz leave me alone. She told my dad and he was so disappointed about me :( 

So now this summer when I got back to Vietnam, I had a community service project (which helped improve working skills and confidence of the youth in VN). Ofc I am not rich on my own. I'm just an intern at a big company. But in my own term, if there is something not even money that I can give out to other ppl, I am happy at all to help out at my best. From the project, experiences and its social impact are two lines that keep my head on it. I am super full of schedule this summer because I am being interning at 2 international companies at the same time and my community service project. In a week, I can only be at home for 6 hours. I feel guilty because I cannot spend my summer w my dad more :( My mom just knew I was back for a week and on the day I took a train to home (place I am interning is 2 hour far from my home) 2 days ago, she shown up at my house and started yelling and swearing at me. She was about to hit me but my dad turned up and asked her to go home. My mom's side is not as rich as my dad's side. Maybe that was something bothering her. She knew about my CS project and kept messaging me things like: your family's members are so poor, if you have your money and the fact is that you are a failure and all using your dad money,  give it to your mother's side and stopping showing like you are a hero of someone. She doesn't even know about my project is giving a skill and confident to ppl but she kept talking about shit. I ignored her. She started telling every ppl around me about how bad I was, how stupid I am and bla bla. I am so fed up. 

My interning salary now is not even enough for renting a good place  in the central of vietnam, but I managed to stay temporary a place at my family's friend until I can find a place to rent at low cost and my dad after a while of disappointment, he lent me some money and ofc I had to pay him back later after I got promotion to graduate place. My mom called the host's women where I am living and started telling her about I did not talk to her, I was doing wasteful CS project, I was disrespected and blabla. Thing is the host's women thinks that she has the right to say whatever she wants to me because I am living freely at her place (I offered to pay her but she refused to take it, so that's why I am finding a place to move out as quick as possible now). That women kept yelling at me whenever I arrived her home at 10:30 PM because I had too much on my back and always had to work extra hours. She said is that I am dating to a dude so I always be back home late, my perfume and my body always smell distinguishing, I am stupid and wasting my dad money into CS project (where ppl don't know I did not have his support during my stay in VN at all), I am being too grooming, using my money into dress-up and whatever.

I work in account management for a very large global ad agency doing digital/ direct marketing. I have always enjoyed technical work, I was a nuclear electrician in the Navy (subs) and I have taught myself some basic coding in HTML, JavaScript, Ruby, Python, etc for my marketing job and for my own self interests, but I have been told by my HR department that I won't be able to transition to the development side of our business because that is too far away from the 'scope of my position'. 
I have a friend that is a director level software engineer at a large firm. His groups build a lot of the ecommerce and payment processing software. He told me he can get me a paid internship at his firm. It would be 6 months, and I would have to find a job somewhere else after but he and others would give me recommendations. He says that I would learn a lot and have some projects under my belt to discuss for other positions. I'm trying to figure out if it's worth it. I have a young family, I feel like I need to settle into something for a career before I get too much older (I'm 33), and the thought of working for internship wages is kinda scary, but I don't really know that I want to continue working in marketing. 

a. Anyone else that has made a similar jump to development care to share their opinions? 
b. Would it be worth it financially? I make $50k now, would a junior developer in the Southeast do better?"

I am a rising senior, studying to get a degree in computer science and business administration. I am currently at a summer internship that I am earning some decent money at. I want to throw it at my student loans, but am unsure where to start. Here is the breakdown of my loans:

Direct Unsubsidized Loan - $6,035 - 3.860%

Direct Subsidized Loan - $3,500 - 4.660%

Direct Subsidized Loan - $5,500 - 4.290%

Direct Unsubsidized Loan - $2,051 - 4.290%

Private Loan - $23,159 - 3.500%


I do have one more year left. I'm working hard to find scholarships and scrounge up what I can. Worst case scenario, I'll need another $20,000 for the year. 

My internship has made it clear that they would like to hire me when I graduate, where I will predict that I will make around $60,000 - 70,000. Getting my loans repaid is my top priority.

So what should I do: pay off the higher interest loans that aren't yet accumulating interest, the lower interest loans that are accumulating interest, or save so I don't have to take out as much next year? "

When we met, I was still struggling to get over a toxic, emotionally abusive relationship more than half a year after it ended. I felt numb all the time, like something was filtering all my emotions and I only felt to like five percent the capacity I once could. 

This girl changed all that. I'd rather have lived the two years we spent together than my entire life before I met her. She taught me how to feel again. We lost our virginity to each other. She was my first real love. And now she's gone and my world is crumbling away. 

A month and a week before our sophomore year of college let out, we had our second anniversary. The letter she wrote me, in part, reads ""I love you sooooooooo much and I'll always be thankful for everything you've done for me... I can't wait to see where we are in the future."" Less than a month before she broke up with me she was still telling me she loved me and that she always wanted to be with me.

We were long distance for the second time this summer with her being ten hours away for an internship. I knew things got kind of weird near the end - we weren't talking like we used to. We started only talking once every other day, because she wouldn't answer the same day. I figured she just needed space. I asked her about coming up to visit her.

Wednesday night, she called me up and said, ""I don't think you should come to Cincinnati.""
I said, ""Okay...?""
She said, ""I don't think we should be in a relationship anymore."" and went on to tell me that she felt like we met when we were both in a bad place and we connected over it. She said she changed a lot and she learned a lot about being happy and I hadn't changed as much because I'm still depressed and angry at the world in some ways.

I said something like ""if the roles were reversed and i was the one who was happy and you were sad do u think i would just have ended our two year long relationship out of nowhere with a fucking phone call or stuck with it and made that sacrifice and helped you get through your worst times""

and her response to that was ""we never said we would get married or stay together forever."" (we never said we'd get married but we both said the second part regularly so not sure what was up with that.) I asked her how the hell she can want to throw two years away based on a difficult period of long distance and then she told me that she'd been thinking about breaking up with me periodically throughout the entire relationship but this time felt different and this time she didn't think she was going to fall back in love.

This is a girl that made me feel like I could watch the world burn to ashes and not give a fuck as long as she was there in my arms. I could achieve every one of my dreams and get everything I ever desired and more and it would all be for shit because she won't be there to share it with me. And the fact that this whole fucking time she was consistently on the edge of breaking up with me is too fucking horrible to comprehend. I never even knew she was fundamentally unhappy with our relationship, she gave no indication of that whatsoever. And all this time we felt completely different things for each other. I thought everything was fine and we were going through a rough patch but we would stick it out because we were committed to each other and to staying together. When she texted me ""we need to talk"" before the call I was ready for maybe a minor fight or something that would end in us working together to work it out like we always did with our problems. 

I have a few questions and if you have any advice for me or input at all on any of them or anything else to say please go for it. 

How do I come to terms with the fact that I cared about her more than anything in the world and this whole time she was vacillating between strong feelings and no feelings for me?

Should I be angry at myself? Should I be angry at her? I don't know what to feel.

She said she still liked me as a friend and I told her it would be a long time before I was ready for that. How long should I wait? What if I never get over her? I can't imagine cutting her out of my life forever even though she was willing to do the same for me.

4q2fpi,1,2016-06-27,Choosing Framework for template-customizing app,rurarz,web_design,https://www.reddit.com/r/web_design/comments/4q2fpi/choosing_framework_for_templatecustomizing_app/,"Hi.

Company I work for has this customizer app, which loads template (i.e. through iframe) for one of the CMSes we use and allows user to customize font family, font color, backgrounds, container width and so on. 
At the moment there is an early beta version written in Angular 1 by some intern, but 75% of it is in jQuery, so there is a ton of spaghetti code which makes it basically unreadable. 
Adding new features is hard as hell, because no one thought about it earlier and whole app works very slow, because it adds selectors and rules to &lt;style&gt; tag in head of iFrame or directly into style="""" attribute of a tag using jQuery. The whole point of Angular here is $scope and template directives which load parts of user interface, which I believe could be replaced with some other, lightweight framework.

I was given a task to rewrite it and make it faster, more responsive and open to future add-ons. 

Could you recommend me the best way to do this? 
I need these features to be available:
- loading external .html page (probably through iFrame)
- dynamically updating CSS properties (colors, fonts, sizing of elements, :before and :after pseudoelements)
- optional - saving/exporting customized values to JSON format.

I was thinking about React but I'm not sure if it can handle loading data through ajax requests without some external module. Also Vue.js looks like lightweight alternative to Angular, which I believe is not well suited for small app like that.

Thanks in advance and sorry for my bad grammar.

Good Monday once again, masters and masters.  Another week, [another issue of SarcasmDump™](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DxYUT3FnvHsxoFoWGV1Pa3tTsTb-nrV-9FZnoPfad4c/edit?pref=2&amp;pli=1), the only series committed to keeping the F/GO masses informed in all fields of knowledge.  Be it scientific, religious, romantic, or, as is the case with today's issue, political.  So take a seat, close your emulators, open your minds, stay informed and enjoy the show!

Here at SarcasmDump™ News Network (SDNN), we value journalistic integrity.  Unfortunately, neither the company that funds us (you know the one), the political party they belong to (you know the one), nor their lizard overlords who only care about pushing their agenda (not the ones you're thinking of) are quite so open minded.  But, what they lack in honesty, they make up for in money.  Lots and lots of money.  Through giving me their money, they've taught me many interesting journalistic techniques.  For example, did you know you can get away with any statement, no matter how bold, slanderous, or downright wrong it is, simply by wording it as a question?

...I forgot where I was going with this, anyway, today's topic:

#Should Archers be Banned From Chaldea?

Love them or hate them, you have to agree last week was a bad week to be an Archer.

The controversy started last Monday, when resident badass and Engrish aficionado EMIYA was arrested.  To the surprise of no one, he was charged with running a one-man sword counterfeiting ring.  At the time of his arrest, he was reportedly on parole for another counterfeiting incident.

“Why do you people keep doing this?” Questioned an angry EMIYA to the arresting officers.  “You *know* my history.  It's what I do.  Why did you even summon me in the first place?”

“You spooked us during the Arjuna rate up,” replied the unnamed officer, voice filling with disdain.  “You aren't even half the chuuni he is.”

Immediately following the incident, Gilgamesh filed a lawsuit against EMIYA.  His suit claims that, as their original owner, he has rights to all weapons, and that “this faker” is infringing upon those rights by copying them.  Gilgamesh soon learned that a countersuit had been filed against him by Thomas Edison.  Edison claims to have the copyright to lawsuits, as well as several words used in Gilgamesh's suit (such as “counterfeit”, “rights”, and “the”).  This provoked a violent incident between the two, which left Edison in critical condition.

“[Edison] is fine now,” reported Chaldea medical staff.  “But we had to use a command seal to bring him back.  It was pretty touch and go there for a bit.”

This violent outburst was the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back.  On Tuesday, Chaldean officials passed the controversial “Gilgamesh Law”, which states that “being Gilgamesh” is now a punishable offense.

“To understand why this bill was passed, you have to realize something about Gilgamesh,” said Chaldean officials in a press statement.  “See, Gilgamesh has a *long* rap sheet of charges.  We have it here, in fact.”  An intern then strained as he placed what appeared to be a heavy tome upon the podium.  “Every time we try to arrest him, officers have to spend hours reading him what his charges are.  By the time they're done, he's already escaped.  So not only will this save us paperwork, but also manpower.  All his previous offenses will be turned into a single count of 'being Gilgamesh', thus saving everyone a ton of time and headache.”

When asked for comment about this new bill, Gilgamesh reportedly just laughed, then went back to being an asshole.

The following day, an unrelated incident occurred that did the Archer class no favors.  On Wednesday, several anonymous men came forward from ancient Greece, claiming to be victims at the hands of two archers – Euryale and Atalanta.  The two men, who had been members of the “Male Victims of Greek Mythology” support group, claimed both women had slaughtered many who sought their hands in marriage.

“It was senseless,” said a spokesman for the support group.  “These men were only guilty of the crime of loving too much, and met a horrible fate.”

“Atalanta even made a game of it,” said one anonymous victim.  “She'd turn it into a race and make you think you'd won, but then at the last moment, she'd pull ahead, and...and...”

On Thursday, police were called to the home of Orion over a reported domestic disturbance.  Neighbors called the police to report sounds of violence, stating that Orion had been caught hitting on other ladies, and was being “punished” by his wife.  Police arrived at the scene, where the door was answered by a woman.  She was initially believed to be Orion's wife, Artemis, but she soon proclaimed during questioning that she *was* Orion.  Orion told the officers on the scene that everything was fine, and also to please ignore the talking teddy bear.  The officers, either too distracted by the woman's cleavage to do their job or simply unable to find any evidence, left shortly thereafter.

On Friday, an anonymous individual tipped several news agencies, including SDNN, to a 140 year old warrant for the arrest of Billy the Kid.  “Billy”, real name Henry McCarty, is wanted on grounds of theft, murder, evading arrest and escaping prison, among others.

“We're looking into the statue of limitations on this one,” stated Chaldean authorities on the matter.  “It's important to do these things by the books.  Besides, Gudako has this great Quick party set up, and Billy crits, just...so, so hard.  We'd like to maintain the integrity of that party, if at all possible.”

On Saturday, Robin Hood found himself in hot water when evidence surfaced that his charitable organization, the *Give to the Poor Foundation*, was funded entirely by taking from the rich.  Robin Hood could not be reached for comment, mostly because nobody could find him.

In light of this incident, rich people everywhere became outraged.  They began calling for a complete ban on all Archers.  One particularly outspoken individual, who refused to be named for this article, shouted to protestors at a rally “I say we throw them all out of Chaldea!  Build a wall around us and make the Archers pay for it!  Make Chaldea great again!”

This has sparked a movement within the Chaldea organization, with several mages claiming that Archers are nothing but outlaws and criminals, not realizing that both words mean the same thing.  Protests were filled with resounding cries of “won't somebody think of the children?!”

Well, we thought of the children.  A field reporter interviewed a child on the scene, named Jack the Ripper.  “I think Archers are fine,” she said.  “I mean, I've killed way more people than they have.”

Protestors then ignored this comment, both because Jack is cute and because it didn't fit in their political rhetoric.

SDNN took to Chaldea Gate to ask random servants their thoughts on the matter.  We found an anonymous Lancer, who happened to be in the middle of farming.

“GAE BOLG-  Huh?  Banning Archers?  Ah, if you're talking about that guy in the red coat and the one with the gold armor, then yeah.  Definitely get rid of them.  Those guys are nothing but trouble.”

Another anonymous servant, who we mistook for a Saber but turned out to be an Assassin, had a different take on things.

“I don't know about Archers, but you know who the *real* problem is around here, right?  Of course, I'm talking about Sabers.  All those Arturia clones running around, ruining the good name of Saber!”  She then went into a long rant about a Saber-based economy collapsing, which we don't have the time nor space to repost here.

However, not everyone quite agrees with banning all Archers.  Resident Ruler and lady-who-loves-all-servants Jeanne D'Arc spoke out in their defense at a meeting at Chaldea on Sunday.

“This Holy Grail War has rules, and those rules must be followed.  Those rules state that all classes must be allowed to participate, no matter what their past.  It is important that we allow them a fair chance at obtaining the Grail.  Besides, Archers provide a much needed balance against the Sabers, and are an important part of-”

The meeting was then interrupted when the Assassin from the previous interview got triggered by the mention of Sabers.

Will Chaldea see a day when Archers are removed from the organization?  It is tough to say.  As we enter this tumultuous time for Chaldea, we must remember the good Archers have brought to our parties.  After all, how else are we going to farm Saber days?

...With Berserkers?  Oh, yeah, I guess that could work...

****

Thank you for joining us today!  ~~Please look forward to next week, as our reporters do an in-depth investigation into that comment by Jack the Ripper that no one else was questioning, and we uncover some shocking things about the Assassin class.~~

EDITOR'S NOTE:  Tragically, several members of our writing staff were found dead this morning under mysterious circumstances.  Covered in knife wounds, no witnesses or evidence, almost as if they had been assassinated.  A note was left at the scene of the crime, with the words “DON'T PUBLISH IT” written on it.  A tragedy indeed.  So for *completely unrelated* reasons, we'll be posting something else next week.  Something that in no way implicates any Assassins of any wrongdoing."

We both have summer internships this year.  Mine is pretty chill, doesn't pay a lot, and allows me to socialize.  His is busy, isolates him, and stresses him out, but it also pays decently well.  He's a computer science major, and from what I understand of the field (both my parents are in computer science), it can be very stressful and isolating.  My boyfriend tends to shoulder a lot of burden, and rarely admits when he's overwhelmed.  Because his resume was so impressive, his bosses have given him extra projects, which he's happy about but also tiring him out.  He works 10 hours a day, with an hour's commute on top of that, and rarely has time to decompress.  Once he's at home he works some more, watches his siblings, and collapses in bed.  He does make time to talk to me, but he always seems so tired whenever we skype.

I can't really help him now, considering I'm in another state, but I worry about us living together.  Will I be a help or a burden to him?  What if we never get to spend any time together because he'll be so busy?  I already plan on providing him with a hot meal and a hug whenever he comes home, is there more I can do to relieve his stress?  Any advice on this would be great.

I connected with a 27 year old man in the area and I agreed to meet up with him for drinks one night. The date was short, about 45 minutes, but we hit it off.

He's asked me to come over to his house tomorrow night. I know he's not super wealthy or anything, so I'm not expecting him to buy me tons of nice meals in town, but I'm not sure I want to go over to his house after just meeting him. I would much prefer hanging out in town.

We seem to be the same level intellectually and we click really well. 

I would like to loose my virginity before I get too old, but I just don't feel like going to this guys house immediately. Am I over reacting? Do people just hang out at each others houses at that age?

I'm a 21 year old college student who's home for the summer. I've struggled with anxiety and OCD since I was around 9 or 10. As of lately, my panic attacks and obsessive thoughts have been coming back. I've talked to my doctor and he's upped my dosage of prozac and it seems to be helping, but here's where I'm not sure what to do.

My anxiety has been worse while working at my internship. This has to do with stress of being confused and more importantly, a lot of times not having a lot to do mentally besides watching my code run to see where things break. Since I'm frequently just passively watching, that's when my thoughts get worse and my anxiety gets worse. 

Lately I've been doing a lot better. Still, I've been considering taking off for the rest of the summer (although I only really have a month there left) just to rest and take care of myself since I haven't really had a mental break in a while, but I don't want to be idle at home either. The difference is at home I can read or do something to keep my mind from spinning into anxious thoughts. I just don't want this to be like I'm avoiding work or being lazy, because that will make my anxiety worse.

I've called my doctor and hopefully he'll call me within the next few days, but I wanted to see what you all thought.

tl;dr should I take off for the summer for my anxiety"

My father was very manipulative and would threaten my mother a lot (not physically, just emotionally), and she would act like there was no issue. On the outside, and especially when he was with me, he was the best father ever. He was cool with me being out late when all the other girls weren't, he taught me how to play video games and came to all of my volleyball games. He is a good father, just a terrible husband.

My parents sat me down and told me they were getting a divorce my senior year of high school, so around two years ago. I wasn't surprised, my mother had found out my dad had been using all of our savings to fly out to Thailand and was cheating on her for years on ""business trips"" which just meant prostitutes and cocaine. I wasn't supposed to know all that, but I would hear things from my mum on the phone and them yelling at each other.

Now my mother has always been very overbearing. She's loving and caring, but I grew independent of both my parents through high school due to she ignoring my father's abuse and me being mad at her for it, and my father just being on ""business trips"" constantly. She wasn't there for me through 14-18, and neither was my father. I had a really rough time where I was constantly sad and tired, and I lost most of my friends. I spent senior year in my room, reading and watching shows, turning in my exams for college and just getting ready to leave this house for good. I pretty much was alone, my mother was spaced out, locked in her room, and my dad was overseas. So I learned how to manage myself at 14. I'd cook for myself, if I needed help for school I'd ask my grandparents or uncles, and it was like my parents and I were strangers living in the same house.

After her divorce, she came to me and apologized for not leaving sooner and not being there for me while I grew up, probably the most important years of my life. I told her I understood and I was glad they both were better off now, and that I was old enough to be able to maintain a relationship with both of them. However, this doesn't change the fact that I have a terrible relationship with men now as well as no friends from high school. I guess I can't really forgive her that easily. We spent the last months in uncomfortable peace, and I was glad to be abroad for college.

Now I am back home for summer break. I have a 9-6 internship that is really hard on me physically and mentally, and she doesn't work so she just lays in bed all day (she hasn't worked since the last 20 years or so). She expects me to cater to her constantly, and I just never had that relationship with her and I probably never will after this point. She wants me to tell her about boys and life and school, and although I try my best to share how school is going well and how my friends from college are doing, I have never been friends with my mother, and I don't want to. She doesn't understand this. Although she isn't old, she acts like a child and begs me to tell her about my boyfriends which I am very uncomfortable doing. I also have hit a rough patch in my internship recently where I'm workig for 10 hours straight at work, not even with a lunch break, and she expects me to come home and be sunshines and smiles and talk to her and go shopping with her. I hate feeling like I have to be the adult, once again, when I'm on summer break from college and all I want is a break, really.

I need advice. I feel like she's going to go insane. She lives in a three-story house by herself, my father is gone, I'm at college, and her friends are all married with small children. Her brother and his family lives in the same neighborhood, and her sister also lives close, so she has people to depend on. I suggested a pet but she says she doesn't want one. Since my father spent all of their shared savings and she doesn't work, she can't go travel or anything either. She's depressed and attention-deprived, and I can't fix those things for her especially considering I am still uncomfortable around her due to the past. She wants all to be forgiven but I can't do that, not yet.
   
**tl;dr**: Visiting mother from college abroad, she acts like we have no past issues and tries to be my best friend, but I've grown up very distant from her and am not comfortable with the way she's acting. She's very lonely and I don't know how to help her. Help me reddit, I love my mother but I cannot be a husband/best friend replacement for her."
4q3nu6,1,2016-06-27,"[20/m] My girlfriend of 2+ years just broke up with me out of nowhere, how do I come to terms with this",thewizard323,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/4q3nu6/20m_my_girlfriend_of_2_years_just_broke_up_with/,"My now ex-girlfriend and I met senior year of high school. We're both 20 and we dated for two years and almost exactly three months. When we met, I was still struggling to get over a toxic, emotionally abusive relationship more than half a year after it ended. I felt numb all the time, like something was filtering all my emotions and I only felt to like five percent the capacity I once could.

This girl changed all that. I'd rather have lived the two years we spent together than my entire life before I met her. She taught me how to feel again. We lost our virginity to each other. She was my first real love. And now she's gone and my world is crumbling away.

A month and a week before our sophomore year of college let out, we had our second anniversary. The letter she wrote me, in part, reads ""I love you sooooooooo much and I'll always be thankful for everything you've done for me... I can't wait to see where we are in the future."" Less than a month before she broke up with me she was still telling me she loved me and that she always wanted to be with me.

We were long distance for the second time this summer with her being ten hours away for an internship. I knew things got kind of weird near the end - we weren't talking like we used to. We started only talking once every other day, because she wouldn't answer the same day. I figured she just needed space. I asked her about coming up to visit her.

Wednesday night, she called me up and said, ""I don't think you should come to Cincinnati."" I said, ""Okay...?"" She said, ""I don't think we should be in a relationship anymore."" and went on to tell me that she felt like we met when we were both in a bad place and we connected over it. She said she changed a lot and she learned a lot about being happy and I hadn't changed as much because I'm still depressed and angry at the world in some ways.

I said something like ""if the roles were reversed and i was the one who was happy and you were sad do u think i would just have ended our two year long relationship out of nowhere with a fucking phone call or stuck with it and made that sacrifice and helped you get through your worst times""

and her response to that was ""we never said we would get married or stay together forever."" (we never said we'd get married but we both said the second part regularly so not sure what was up with that.) I asked her how the hell she can want to throw two years away based on a difficult period of long distance and then she told me that she'd been thinking about breaking up with me periodically throughout the entire relationship but this time felt different and this time she didn't think she was going to fall back in love.

This is a girl that made me feel like I could watch the world burn to ashes and not give a fuck as long as she was there in my arms. I could achieve every one of my dreams and get everything I ever desired and more and it would all be for shit because she won't be there to share it with me. And the fact that this whole fucking time she was consistently on the edge of breaking up with me is too fucking horrible to comprehend. I never even knew she was fundamentally unhappy with our relationship, she gave no indication of that whatsoever. And all this time we felt completely different things for each other. I thought everything was fine and we were going through a rough patch but we would stick it out because we were committed to each other and to staying together. When she texted me ""we need to talk"" before the call I was ready for maybe a minor fight or something that would end in us working together to work it out like we always did with our problems.

I have a few questions and if you have any advice for me or input at all on any of them or anything else to say please go for it.

How do I come to terms with the fact that I cared about her more than anything in the world and this whole time she was vacillating between strong feelings and no feelings for me? Finding that out its like a nightmare I can't wake up from

She said she still liked me as a friend and I told her it would be a long time before I was ready for that. How long should I wait? What if I never get over her? I can't imagine cutting her out of my life forever even though she was willing to do the same for me.

4q3w7l,101,2016-06-27,"Meanwhile, on Satoshi's Interstellar Comet, another smart contract executes flawlessly",spookthesunset,Buttcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/4q3w7l/meanwhile_on_satoshis_interstellar_comet_another/,"With all this speak of DAO's and other scam coins, it is time to speak the truth.  On Satoshi's Interstellar Comet, smart contracts are used all the time.  Let's say you decide to beat your wife with a lead pipe and she was smart enough to code in a clause specifically saying ""do not beat your wife with a lead pipe"".  Provided you beat her with a lead pipe and not a plastic bat (which was not coded into the contract), a trusted oracle will instantly and irreversibly transfer bitcoin from your account to hers.  Unfortunately you do not have enough bitcoin in your wallet.

The developers of your marriage smart contract are good at their jobs and were experienced enough to foresee such such an exception occurring. They inserted a clause into the contract that says :
    
    if (account &lt;=0) { 
        print(""no funds available. please settle in private courtroom"");
        gosub 0;
    }

You both sit down at your kitchen table and calmly go through the list of private courtroom reviews on the blockchain.  You settle on *AAAA Courtroom* down on 85th street.  This courtroom is owned by Judge Dave, a 28 year old entrepreneur who runs a brothel in his basement and is famous for his grapefruit flavored fentanyl e-cigs.  

After a quick trip in your unregulated coal rollin' lifted pickup, you and your wife arrive at an old  craftsman house that reminds you of a burlesque parlor--you have arrived at *AAAA Courtroom*.  As you walk into the building, a petite young woman offers to take your coat and asks if you want a drink.  You ask for a double jack daniels and coke and your wife asks for a ""Ultra-bomb"", which is a cosmopolitan spiked with delicious 25I-NBOMe.

Judge Dave sits down at the bench and eyes both you and your wife.  Four developers walk in and begin formally verifying the smart contract on a not so clean whiteboard off to the side of the room. This whiteboard has been used to formally verify hundreds of smart contracts over the years.   While this goes on,  Judge Dave puffs away at a grape flavored 4-Fluoromethcathinone e-cig and inspects lead pipe you used to beat your wife.  

A few hours later, the developers nod at each other and the leader quietly brings a slip of paper over to Judge Dave containing the verdict.  Judge Dave steadies his hand while the powerful stimulants he inhaled earlier kick in and gives his verdict.  Your wife should not be awarded any funds.  The smart contract programmers specified that the lead pipe must weigh at least 10 pounds and measure no less than 2 feet long.  The lead pipe in the judge's hand was 9.8 pounds and a mere 23 inches long.  

You begin to smile as your wife pleads with the judge.  With tears in her eyes, she claims that before arriving, you chiseled away some of the pipe so it would fall under what was specified in the smart contract.  She says the intent was to keep you from beating her.  The judge won't have any of it.  Nowhere in the smart contract does it mention tampering with evidence and even though he can clearly see the chisel marks, she is shit out of luck.

""Sorry for your loss, Ma'am.  The intent is whatever the code says the intent is, and the intent here is he should not beat you with lead pipes weighing over 10 pounds and longer than 2 feet.  Next time"", continues Judge Dave, ""hire better programmers.  Even my interns would have added couple of lines to cover that condition"".

Once you are home, you write up a favorable review of Judge Dave on your laptop, hit ""submit"", settle back in your chair and take a quick bump of heroin.  As the room goes fuzzy and warm, the chisel you used to modify the lead pipe falls out of your pocket and onto the floor.  You stare at it for a good minute, smirk, and say out loud ""just another wonderful day on Satoshi's Interstellar Comet"".

As you can see, on Satoshi's Interstellar Comet, justice always prevails.  No jack booted thugs or oppressive nanny state needed.  Just keep buying and holding bitcoin and someday soon, you too will be able to partake in the galaxies free'est market ever."
4q4hnt,4,2016-06-27,I got a summer internship!,ThatOneGuyWithPoop,CasualConversation,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/4q4hnt/i_got_a_summer_internship/,"So I am a studying electrical engineer  and I always strived for a hard working ethic. Mostly cause I'm a first generation student, and only one who went to study engineering in my family. Anyway I hit the jackpot and got my second summer internship with a paper company (not what I've always wanted to do, but getting any internship is something to rave about). The internship has been fun. Met a lot of engineers. Every now and then (like now) I kinda run out of things to do since I'm in the projects section and sometimes you have to wait on quotes and stuff. I try to stay busy, even go to the process controls section to learn when I can. Kinda stinks I'm the only one in the projects section that's an intern and the other 7 interns are in process, but I still see them every now and then so it's okay. 

Anyway just wanted to see what you guys have to say and I would like to hear about everyone else's summer jobs!"

Perhaps this sounds lazy, but I just want to actually finish *building* a game and not continue wasting all of my time *playing* games.

I have a bachelors of science in computer science from a big private school in Ohio.  I have 7 years of full-time programming experience, and 2 years of part-time paid internships before that.  While none of that experience was specifically for game development, it has certainly provided me with the skills to figure out how to do w/e I want.  Besides, I have dabbled quite a lot with game programming on my own time.

While I am very skilled, time is my biggest bottleneck.  I would be able to devote at *most* 10 hours a week to a project (which I would have to be very passionate about).  5 hours a week is more likely.

Building an html 5 web game would be my preference, but I could potentially be persuaded to do something else if all the pieces were already in place.

Please ask questions if you think I left something out.  While I will respond to private messages, **I would prefer all discussions take place in this thread.**

4q4xxm,3,2016-06-27,Taking Interest Theory class in the Fall but don't know much probability.,SESginger,actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/4q4xxm/taking_interest_theory_class_in_the_fall_but_dont/,"I'm taking a math class for my major (actuarial science) called Interest Theory which has a Probability course prerequisite. 

I took the Probability course this past semester, but the mix of having a bad professor (in that he wouldn't teach much and had really easy exams, so I didn't learn much) and not trying very hard led me to not be nearly as knowledgable as I should be in probability. 

Obviously, probability is one of the essential classes for my major and career in general, so I plan to relearn and learn everything in time. However, I am curious as to whether in depth knowledge of probability is essential for learning interest theory. And assuming so, what specifically is used the most?

I ask because I am going to take exam P in late September, so my plan is to learn what I haven't yet learned and study starting around when Fall classes start (early August). I feel as though if I start studying now, I won't study as hard in the few weeks before the exam and may forget a lot of what I learned (I have a horrible memory). 

However, if in depth knowledge of everything I was (or wasn't) taught in probability is essential to the interest theory course, I will start studying much before. 

The course is described as follows: *measurement of interest (including accumulated and present value factors), annuities certain, yield rates, amortization schedules and sinking funds, bonds and related securities, derivative instruments and hedging and investment strategies.*

This whole question may seem silly. It may make you say ""why not just start learning &amp;amp; studying now and continuing studying hard up to the exam?"" The answer to that is that I am currently doing an internship and taking two courses, both of which end just before school starts again in the Fall. Also, interest theory will be my only difficult class of the semester, so I won't have the workload I do now. 

Any help/advice is greatly appreciated, thank you!"

4q5iwl,58,2016-06-27,[Review] Daytona Leathers Custom Sci Fi jacket: A Leather Jacket Odyssey,A_username_for_ants,FashionReps,https://www.reddit.com/r/FashionReps/comments/4q5iwl/review_daytona_leathers_custom_sci_fi_jacket_a/,"Daytona Leathers / Discount Mart / Designer Look 4 You Custom leather jacket.

Pictures: http://imgur.com/a/Aje2U

Lurking around r/rep fashion or other subreddits one might discover this custom leather shop based in Pakistan that goes by a few different names online. They don't seem to have a single account or website but their name on their email is listed as Daytona Leathers. They specialize in making replica leather jackets of different designers like Saint Laurent Paris, Balmain, Julius, etc. I found them on Ioffer under the name Discoutmart. 

I was immediately interested in their service to make any custom leather jacket by request. “Any leather jacket?” you might ask. Well after doing a little thinking, soul searching and looking around the internet for inspiration, I came up with an idea for a custom jacket of my own design and I sent an email to Daytona asking if my idea was possible. 

They emailed back saying they could make the jacket and sent me a payment link. 

I wanted to make this review because my experience with Daytona Leathers was terrific. At $350 for a custom leather jacket I think it's one of the best values i've gotten while shopping for clothing. 

My expertise / ethos: I want to mention my experience because often when Daytona leathers is mentioned on reddit it's a question of how the leather quality compares to the labels it tries to knock off. The two other leather jackets I’ve owned are a lambskin perfecto type jacket from Marc by Marc Jacobs and beat up thrift store calfskin jacket. I have handled a couple of high end leather jackets however. I just graduated from college in NYC. while I was there I worked as a fashion editorial intern for 3 national publications. At my last internship we would frequently get samples of leather jackets from Hermes, Dolce and Gabbana, Saint Laurent and Burberry (to name a few). I'm not a leather jacket expert, I didn't study fashion or leather working or anything like that, but I had the opportunity to handle high end leather jackets so I have some sense of what is good, or at least what is expensive. 

Price: $353 Including shipping 

Ordering: I placed my order on March 16th and I received the jacket on April 8th. 

The team at Daytona leathers were very responsive when I sent in a request for the jacket. They responded to my first emails within 20 minutes of me sending it. I also found that for the most part they give very prompt updates. For the specific color I requested, they first had to get the leather seperately from a tannery. Daytona sent me images from the tannery to confirm that the color was right before they started to make the jacket. They also sent me pictures of the final product so I could see how it looked before they sent it. This was pretty nice. 

For measurements they asked that I take several measurements of a jacket I already owned that I wanted them to emulate. When there were some measurements that didn't look right to them they asked me to take a second measurement to make sure everything was correct. 
 
Design: I found it really delightful getting to come up with a jacket design and then actually have it made. Readers of my review might find the design tacky, but I really love how it turned out. 

I wanted to draw from design houses who’s jackets I admire. When I requested the specific jacket, I sent a description of each part to the Daytona Leathers team and included images as a reference in my email. They then confirmed each detail and sent me an image of the pattern they drew up for the jacket. 

So! I wanted to make something futuristic looking. Something you might wear if you were a space renegade or if you rode around on that red motorcycle from Akira. I thought it would be cool if the jacket had ribbing on the arms and the back, similar to a Balmain or Burberry biker jacket. I wanted the jacket to be calfskin because I wanted it to have a similar feel to a Schott jacket. I wanted the jacket to have an overexaggerated wind guard in the front like a Rick Owens leather jacket and I wanted it to have a big pocket in the back with a flap similar to Fear of God bombers. I wanted the right arm to be a different color than the body, I was inspired by a Helmut Lang denim jacket from his tk collection. I also wanted it to have the same bondage straps that Helmut Lang pioneered. For the fleshy off white color of the body I was inspired by a Christian Carol Poell leather jacket. I suppose it's something of a Frankenstein's jacket made up of all different parts but I was thrilled to get all these little elements I love in one jacket. The Daytona team followed through with every request even putting three internal pockets like I asked. 

Quality: When the jacket first arrived the calf skin was rigid and substantial. To the touch the leather feels pretty nice. it has right thickness that I was hoping for and in the places like the arms it has broken in very well and is developing a more supple texture. It feels like a primo leather, probably not the nicest leather imaginable but it feels nicer than a lot of thinner or lower end jackets one might by for the same price. 

The hardware is all YKK. The zippers were stiff at first but they now move without any problem. The lining of the jacket is a beige cotton in the chest with a type of nylon material in the arms. I don't mind the cotton on the inside, it looks kind of cool with the color and look of the jacket but other people might consider it a little cheap feeling.  

The stitching and craftsmanship looks professional. I have worn the jacket quite frequently since I received it and there are no apparent flaws or parts coming undone. To be absolutely critical, there are a few spots where a single threat seems like it's coming loose but no seam looks like it's going to break open at any time and I am pretty rough with the jacket. How would I compare the quality? I suppose it might be similar to an All Saints jacket, maybe one step above it. I don't think this is the most primo expertly crafted jacket but I also think it's pretty good considering the leather is breaking in nicely. I am satisfied with the quality, I think it's terrific for the price.

Final thoughts: When I finally received the jacket and wore it around the big city I constantly got compliments! Strangers would come up to me and ask where I bought it “oh this old thing? Its custom.” And classmates thought it looked rad. Its my own fault but I ordered the jacket too small. I based it off of my Marc Jacobs jacket which fits tight. I wanted this jacket to fit tight also but the MJ jacket is a thin lambskin and when I first got the jacket it was a stiff calf skin. It has stretched as it broke in, and it now fits nicely. With the leather breaking in and stretching It fits a l m o s t perfectly, but it's still a little snug when I zip it up. I suppose biker jackets (even futuristic ones) are supposed to fit snug anyway. I hope to order another jacket from Daytona in the future but when I do I’ll give myself a little more space. 

If you want a custom leather jacket, I don't think you can beat the price and quality. If you just want a leather jacket period I think Daytona Leathers offer a pretty great deal. How would they do at making a replica jacket? I’m not entirely sure, they seemed pretty capable to make the exact jacket I requested. A lot of people on r/rep fashion claim that Puerhomme make a better SLP biker replica than Daytona. If that's true, than Puerhomme’s jacket must be pretty phenomenal because in my experience Daytona does a great job. "

4q66bf,1,2016-06-27,Please help need advice! Nightmare situation.,InPursuitOfTruth,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/4q66bf/please_help_need_advice_nightmare_situation/,"Hello everyone. I'm totally at a wall. I'm very uncertain how to proceed in my current situation. It's overwhelming. I'm not perfect by any means.
But here's the situation:

I have been single for about a year when I met this guy I'm now living with. Which I wasn't interested in doing ( living together) until we were boyfriend and girlfriend for awhile. 
I feel as though the whole situation was not even of my free will. 

When we met I was living in my own place renting a room with a couple and their children in another town. I took a internship in a town where I knew no one really but the internship was great. I get paid a pathatic salary. Just enough to get by on. 

This guy was a sweetheart I really adored him. He was into everything I was including video games. I like video games.  Gamers get a bad rap because yes they spend allot of time banging away at their keyboard and controllers. So what I said I spend allot of time doing my own hobbies. 

His current roommate when we met was very promiscuous and often times told me that he wasn't holding his end if their arrangements.  I didn't think anything of it at first. But when i went over to his house all her things where with his. And he would let her completely destroy their house. She had animals using the bathroom everywhere. The place was filthy. Really really filthy. Mold garbage trash grime etc. I thought holy crap this girl is running a huge amount of game on him. 

And that's exactly what came out. She claimed they had a sexual agreement and she could do whatever she wanted. 

Why was he looking for a girlfriend ? He has one.. He would ditch me only a couple days later on Valentines day to hang out with her and his friend. 

I actually stopped the whole situation between him and I and straight told him if he's going to be doing this with his roommate I do not want to get involved whatsoever. He said he was interested in her and that she didn't like him. But still gets the perks and pretty much shits on me . 

We talked more and I thought maybe he doesn't understand what's going on and what he's doing. Girls can be very manipulative. He said clearly that he did not have any sort of arrangements with her over and over.

So I told him shit or get off the pot. He told me she needed to go. I said I would support that why we are dating. 

She basically started harassing me none stop with crazy amounts of drama and trapping me in there business. She convinced me that she wasn't going to leave and would start using legal support to stay. Not my problem. But he kept making my problem I couldn't believe the drama and amount of spiteful crap she would pull. Anytime I would see him 1-3 hour conversations from this girl would come flying down on me from her. Literally turning into 20 hours a week of her bullshit. Which weren't about me. I kept reminding her she has plenty of resources and family and guys she knows that want to help her. 

He finally tells her to move out. She runs a huge manipulation on my family to give her money to move saying she would be homeless. And that her car was going to be repoed any second. I gave her $1,250 on the down low and told her to use it as a deposit ( which she never had) then she left but went to my father and asked him to pay her car payment taking another $1089  plus a gas card to help her get to work. When I saw her again to move out her belongings she told me and this guy that her ex boyfriend paid off her car payments.  Then left. I didn't know at the time she had swindled my father for that as well. My father and I had plans to go on a trip and spend time together. My father said she came over for 3 days and refused to leave claiming that this guy I was dating was sexually  and financially inappropriate with her. I didn't know this until she was gone and I was in this trip with my family. I was shocked. I told my dad i already gave her money to move.  She kept telling my father she was homeless and had no one. On and on and I said I would help her. Which i did I gave her a deposit money for a new place. Holy Fuck. I was really in depth at that point. $2000 plus from this drama of his. 

I come home from my trip and walk in my apartment door to find a notice from my landlord saying i need to move immediately. I thought what the hell is going on. That same girl roommate of the guy I was dating called immigration on my landlords wife and family. Omgod. That's it I'm telling this guy what it's going on. 

Now I am really fucked. I do not know anyone here. Everyone i know is states away. Beyond my job that barely covers rent and food. 
Keep in mind this guy I'm dating works 40 hours ($19 hour) a week. His parents pay for everything including the Mortgage for condo he lives in and owns.  He was getting roommates to pay $800 of the $1,000 bills his parents wanted him to pay for a two bedroom apartment and making it seem like that was fair. He had no reason to ever take money from me to get rid of his prostitute ""roommate"". 
Surprise surprise he tells me to deal with it. I was left homeless . i ended up moving into a crack house literally. My whole life was spiraling. He's going home to a empty two bedroom apartment fully covered and I'm staying in a crack house. 

A week goes by this guy keeps wanting to check in on me and date. I'm confused in complete hell. He made himself the only thing that brought me happiness.  He kept telling me that he never asked me to help that girl leave when she wanted to. It's not his problem. I told him I need help. This is not a joke. If we keep seeing each other something needs to give. He kept saying he had no room in his 2 bedroom place. His friend was going to move in in a couple months or when ever he gets a job here. 

I couldn't believe this. Eventually after seeing me struggle and struggle he said "" you know my friend isn't moving in . If you want to live here that's okay. This is your home now"" I was speechless.  I was really done with the drama . But that saved it. 

I move in. two moves in one month. Wow. I'm exhausted.  I thought the nightmare was over. The fear was over. 

The guy I was dating told me about a girl he was dating accused him of sexually abusing her. We were sharing prior crazy ex stories. I felt bad that someone would lie about something like that. I have brothers i know some girls say mean things about guys they don't like after a brake up.

I was wrong. Everyday I go to work . Come home and he just complains . He's tierd he's exhausted . The  amount of disgusting filth that piled up from the roommate and him.  Digging out of a hole here just to use the bath bathroom kitchen . So everyday I come home and clean. Organize. He sits back playing video games . Complaining. I change more and more things to meet his forever demands. Ie. I don't want to spend money on going out. Now I'm making dinner 2 hours a night ontop of chores.  He dumps garbage and piles of dishes in the sink. Leaves them for weeks. I do them over and over and over. 64 days of slave work. He plain refused to go out. I exist to bring him food and drinks why he laughs and talks with all has friends via video games and private chat rooms. .he put out a nasty vibe if I said anything to him while he played video games every second I saw him. Making impossible to even speak to him. I tried to compromise I do everything in the house he spends two days with me a week. 
Never really happened. I kept explaining he's hurting my feelings. I have not even unpacked one of my own boxes. I'm sleeping on the couch. I'm giving him oral sex. He was not interested in having sex for two people.  Just himself. I thought all this would blow over if i was patient and continued to confront the issues we were having. But it just got worse. 
Like he agreed i wouldnt pay any rent until i could save money from his roommate situation i paid for.
Then my atm card number got stolen. For 40 days straight with out me noticing my saving account got drained for another $2,000 dollars out of my savings. My bank said they can't reimburse something that wasn't reported within 24 hours. Are you kidding me. I lost another $1,800 total that was not covered by my bank fraud. 
No one had access to my bank number in my home but the guy I'm dating and myself. 
My phone gets broken. Just weird things. 
I confront these things as they come up creating a distraction and chaos which never seemed to bother this guy I'm living with and dating. This is awful. Some of his friends put up swastika symbols On there chat when I walk in and start laughing. I didn't make a big deal about it. I just said I'm not comfortable and walked out. He hit me so hard in my sleep it on "" accidentally "" i had to go to the emergency room the next day . It hit a disk and cut off blood flow to my body. Again sleeping on the couch in terrible pain.
I had been putting out $120 bi weekly to by grocery that i didn't eat 80% of anything ontop of paying for outings and ridiculous broken items mold on my make up brushes one day? My broken phone? Ontop of utilities $159 on set up $150 to change internet. I couldn't use wifi because i t was really unsafe and glitching . Only him. 
Crazy.  Anyways I walk in the other night to his gaming cave... I say it's getting really late let's grab some fast food for dinner. Two hours go by he Walks out and says
"" I'm dumping  you and I want you to move out ""
""I given you plenty of time. I'm dumping you because your shaming me"" 
My response

"" we can't brake up because you never asked me to be your girlfriend. I don't know what your taking about. I'm not your slave ""

1 hour He is on the internet in dating section telling people he went through a horrible brake up and is looking for a serious relationship. OMG . 

What the Fuck is happenings?  I feel like I'm crazy? I feel exhausted?  
Please someone help me I'm seriously hurting"

If you did or did not make a similar choice, can you share your regrets/findings/advice?

Answer is within? I think there is no answer. So just do it? Life doesn't matter that much?

---



**Details:**

I live in a 3rd world country but quality of life is decent here. I have option to move to Silicon Valley. Here is the roadmap: Masters &gt;&gt; Work &gt;&gt; (Work or Startup or Go home). I actually got accepted from a gradschool in Silicon Valley and am about to get my US visa.

WHY DON'T DO IT:

If I go, I'll have to study *WAY* more than I'm used to (to be a good software engineer candidate). I'll need to be more sociable than I'm used to (to network, to find a job, to build a life). I'm not skilled enough in these areas at the moment. I need to be more alert, streetsmart, outgoing, energetic. Based on my experience, there is a good chance I don't have the physical and intellectual energy to do all those things. Why Masters? Because H1B lottery. Why software engineering? It's my only skill that can make me employable. It pays well in US. It is a little relevant to entrepreneurial side. But I don't like it because I don't like to think hard. I don't like to think hard for very complex, detailed and trivial things. Example: https://www.careercup.com/page?pid=algorithm-interview-questions 

If I go, it will cost me $60K. 2 years of Masters degree and 2 years of living costs. Rent is [ridiculous](https://sfbay.craigslist.org/search/roo?search_distance=5&amp;postal=95054&amp;max_price=700). During those 2 years, I'm not allowed to work more than part time for 1 year and 3 month for internship. 

$60K here can sustain a family of 3 for +4 years when no one is working. It can buy you a 1200sqft house in a decent location. It can sustain me and 1 employee for +4 years when I'm trying to create the ""next facebook"". Currently my monthly expense is $200/month and I live with my parents. An average 1BR condo costs $200-300/mo here. A dinner at a decent restourant is around $20. $1000/mo would be enough for a wife, kid and all other expenses here. 

If I stay, life would be safe, relatively comfortable, clear, defined: Get a job. Get married. Get old. Die. Meanwhile maybe get lucky with a startup and get rich. If that happens, I'd do more fun things and I'd get to choose what I want more frequently. It would partially satisfy my need to be important and I'd find comfort in being uniquely good. Then I'd die. 

I'm a fresh graduate (BSc in CS). Even though I live with my parents right now, I have an ability get my shit together here. I can start a good job next month, get my own place, *theoretically* find a SO and get married, have a baby next year. I'm lucky/blessed/whatever to be in a position where most people dream of. But thinking about my life becoming a typical life makes me depressed. I'm supposed to do something greater with my life. Money, sex, food, helping others, or somethings I need to excel in.

If I go, eventually I will get a greencard (in ~5 years). I'll be double taxed in some cases. Sell a property in home in a shitty economy? Pay 1% tax to the government. Pay 25% tax to US. Weird, weird laws. It is very hard to find someone who can give advice in this area. 

My academic advisor at my university, who is from US and graduated from MIT but had been living in my country for a decade, told me that I have a good thing going here. I should appreciate my university, the opportunities I have here. Life at US will be much harder, expensive, with disappointments. 

WHY DO IT:

If I go, I will increase my chances of creating a successful startup. If war in middle east spread to my country, I will have option to work as SWE in US in the future where salaries are good. 

If I stay, I will do a Masters part time to delay mandatory military service. Relatively easy program, cheap cost. If I work on my startup full time, I will be alone. I will need to find ways to be social, to be outgoing, to make friends. Otherwise I'll end up as an asocial grumpy person most likely cause I'm headed in that direction. I will also need to maintain a disclipline/motivation to systemize my work and my life. It will be a 1 man game. At the end, finding good contacts, advisors, investors, selling the startup will be less likely. 

I live in home mostly. I don't have a life here. Maybe I will create one in US. I will need to create a life for myself at some point, right? I'm 24 but I still don't feel like I need it.

If I don't create a successful startup here, I'll have an upper middle class life, no matter how hard I try. I will forever be an employee. Meanwhile government steals from the nation and some supporters eat the money with them. Situation here is extremely ridiculous. A farmer here becomes a minister of tech because he is family of president. So I'll be watching such people. I'll skip details but no sane mind is happy with the shit here. "

I am a U.S. Citizen, born in Texas.

I studied at Universidad Autonoma de Tamaulipas (Tamaulipas University of Anatomy)

I have had and continue to have high grades

I have finished my studies

I am now in an intern programme to be able to practice as a doctor

If I do not finish studying this year I forfeit all my education, training and experience

I work part time at night

I have no family or friends who can support me

I was living with relatives until my uncle tried to abuse and rape me, his family believe I was the one who tried to seduce him

I am married to a non-U.S. citizen, British, who is trying to immigrate

We are in love and trying desperately to make things work

My husband is unable to work legally (We both don't want to jeopardize his immigration by working illegally)

My husband's visa is now about to expire

My husband travelled via the Visa Waiver Programme

We are unable, and have been unable for the past year to find a sponsor

All our savings have now gone (We did have quite a lot of savings, but without a sponsor cannot even start the immigration process)

I am seemingly unable to apply for any loan or grant through state, federal or non-profit; at least all avenues I have tried have not even considered me

We do not need much money, just enough to survive until either my husband or I can work full time

My husband keeps insisting I carry on with my studies, but I am everyday getting closer to dropping out and working full time to support us

We are both very scared and alone. Neither of us have direct family living in the U.S.

The stress of being unable to immigrate, unable to work and being financially unstable is too much




We really need financial help and advice. I don't know where to turn or who ask. I have asked for help everywhere I can think of, which has led me to almost getting scammed a few times. We never wanted or needed assistance, but without a sponsor and me studying, all our savings have gone. If you know of any government assistance, grants, loans that we might be eligible for or any organisation which may be able to help us (I have searched and searched and we never get anywhere). We will be eternally grateful.

4q7ys1,62,2016-06-28,A Salute...,Derpsteppin,KitchenConfidential,https://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/4q7ys1/a_salute/,"I would like to say a few words.

Hello Kitchen confidential, I have been a lurker in this sub for a few years, 2 or 3 maybe. I'm not sure. But what I have been for much longer than that is a cook. Line cook in a small, family-owned Italian place in the middle of nowhere to be exact. I have done this for the last 8 years of my life. 

At 24 that's a third of my life, and it's the only job I've ever known. 

Well not just cooking, of course. I mean who would let a 16 year cook? Right? I started when I was 16 because I needed a job and as many of you could imagine, a 16 year old with no job experience is going to end up doing dishes. It's almost like a right of passage in a restaurant. I know many of you have started as dishwashers also so you know what it's like, but there are some who haven't. I wish I had days to talk about washing dishes as it was some of the most fun years of my career, but I'm trying my hardest to keep this brief. 

I washed dishes, maybe 4-6 nights a week for like 2 years straight. It's really amazing how well dishes teaches you about a restaurant. After two years I knew the place like the back of my hand. And damn was I good at organizing shit. After that I started picking up shifts in the mornings helping out prep cooks. And pasta. 

Yeah, Pasta. We had an entire shift dedicated to do nothing but make pasta. 

All.
God.
Damned.
Morning.

I absolutely loved it. I still did dishes like 80% of the time but any chance I got to work for better pay AND a better, cleaner workspace, of course I jumped at the opportunity. I picked up open shifts whenever I could. Over time I got really good at that too. I knever knew my hands could actually move that fast. Trust me, if you took a Styrofoam cup and basically weighed out thousands of portions of cooked pasta into little sandwich baggies for hours a day, you'd be surprised how fast your hands could move too. Oh and my organizational skills went through the roof. Having to keep track of counts of a dozen different types of pasta and how to cook each one. 

Once again, I'm rambling. Apologies. 

So I eventually worked a steady dose of prep cooking, dishes and pasta for a few months maybe a year before I went to the owner and asked if I could cook on the line. I had basically been making my own food for over a year after one of the cooks got pissed at me for ordering the same buffalo chicken sandwich every day when I worked dish. 

""Shit Derp, you order the same fuckin thing every day. Come over here and I'm gonna show you how to make it yourself so I never have to again"" 

So the next day I ordered a burger and he lost his shit. 

I can't thank that cook enough. Seriously. 

He saw it as an opportunity for me to learn how to cook. He basically told me I could order whatever I wanted as long as I made it myself. (managers here, calm down. I'm talking only lunch portions and no steaks, veal, seafood, etc.)

He basically took me under his wing and showed me how to cook anything as long as I actually wanted to learn. 

That still wasn't enough to prepare me for cooking on the line. After talking to the owner, he agreed to give me a month to learn the menu and allowed me to work as an extra during mornings on slower days of the week. I basically shadowed the 2 head chefs (I use that term loosley) while they ran the whole kitchen by themselves. It was really incredible how much I learned in that month. 

Our line is not very big. We staff 1am and 3pm cooks a day. (2 &amp; 4 on Fridays and Saturdays) we have a fryer guy on one end and a pasta guy down at the other with a sauté right in the middle. Fridays and Saturdays we throw in an expo to help keep things moving and organized while everyone else is 110% focused on their station. 

After a few shifts, my schedule moved heavily toward cooking. I started working 5-6 cooking shifts a week with only Friday night left for dishes. 

I never could have imagined how satisfying cooking would end up being. It's been an incredible experience as slowly I gained more and more skills and responsibilities. Cooking was only the tip of the iceberg as any given day I could be asked to do any number of things like deliveries, catering parties, helping the owner keep the building up and running, helping customers and employees with anything and everything, helping Pedro landscape, you name it. 

I can't possibly sum up everything from the last 5 years of cooking but my point is that it became less about just cooking food and more about helping out an amazing group of people and working together to kick ass night in and night out through some of some of the best and worst nights you could imagine. 

But all good things must come to an end. 

This past spring I finally got my degree that I had been working toward by squeezing part-time classes into my full time work schedule for the past 5 years. 
It was time to move on. It had never been a secret. That was the whole bittersweet part about the whole thing. The owner knew my plans within the first few years. After graduating high school he asked me what I wanted to do. I said I wanted to work as much as I was able to in order to pay my way through community college to get an engineering degree. He supported my decision 100%. 

The last year or so was tough. As I got closer to my degree I eventually got a full-time internship with an engineering firm that I accepted in a heartbeat. At first I simply worked 2 jobs at a combined 70ish hours a week on top of finishing my last two semesters of college. It was stressful to say the least but slowly I worked down my shifts at the restaurant to the point that I was simply helping out twice a week. 

That led up to just about 2 months ago when I graduated and my internship turned into a full time job. It was time to focus 100% on my new career. After 8 years, putting in my two weeks was very surreal. Told the Boss it was about that time and he nods his head pulls his calendar out and we both looked for a good day to go out on. 

I told him I wanted to do Friday dishes. 

He just smiled, shook his head and said that it would be a night to remember. 

The internship had caused me to have to give up my Fridays so it had been almost a year's since I was on a Friday night and I hadn't even done dishes for almost 2 years. I couldn't wait. 

It was an amazing feeling to get to kick ass on a massive Friday night along with everybody for one last time. Toward the end of the night the owner shut the kitchen lights off and had the whole staff come sing ""for he's a jolly good fellow"" and they brought me a raw steak with a candle in it. 

It was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen. 

I want to simply say thank you. 

Not just to Kitchen confidential, but to kitchens all over, especially my coworkers, all of whom are like family to me. 

I will definitely miss it. 

That is for sure.

4q89q9,8,2016-06-28,I've started an internship and feeling out of my depth. Could you guys help steer me in the right direction?,ThumbForke,MachineLearning,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/4q89q9/ive_started_an_internship_and_feeling_out_of_my/,"I didn't think I was going to get this internship, as I have no experience with machine learning. I was upfront with them about my lack of experience, and they still decided to take me on for some reason! Basically, I was hoping that some kind stranger out there could tell me specifically what areas to study, so I'm not blindly searching through the vast field that is machine learning until I find what I'm looking for (if ever).

We use tailored push notifications to try and encourage people to use our client's apps more basically. Once a user turns off push notifications, then we really have nothing more we can do to encourage that customer. So what they want me to do is try and construct a predictive model that can tell them what users are likely to turn off push notifications in the next week. Every time a user does an activity, that is logged with like literally 100 statistics, so there is so much data to work with. I understand that I should probably just pick the stats that I deem to be most useful, and then run a machine learning algorithm on those, right?

For a little background, I've just graduated with an undergrad in maths, with a little computer science. We're hoping to use numpy and scikit-learn. Would those be sufficient? I have a good background in Python, and I know how to use numpy a bit. So that would be the best for me anyway, given how much I need to learn about the theory as it is! If anyone can give me the name of like a particular model or algorithm or topic, or even just a book or a series of videos on the internet that would be helpful, I would really appreciate it. I'm feeling rather stressed about the possibility of not being able to deliver on this!

*You are male, of average height and lean build. Dressed in standard office wear, your five inch member (erect) is concealed and behaving within your pants.*

You are an intern at Global Papers Inc, a multinational paper distributor. Having filled up all the mindless paperwork for the day, you fall asleep on your 'desk' - a conference table you share with five other interns - for a quick nap before the 5pm quitting time.

You wake up groggy, feeling well rested as though having had a full night's rest. As you stretch your limbs and yawn you freeze, realising that you are no longer in your office building: in place of the cold grey walls are lush green trees, and the conference table and chairs now stand on an uneven matrix of roots and leaf litter, rather than a dusty discoloured carpet. **It appears you are in a dense forest.**

To further your surprise, you hear a high-pitched voice begging for help. Upon investigation, you find the source to be a woman, seemingly trapped in some branches. *She is of short height and lean build, with messy short black hair. She is mostly naked, with only a few torn rags covering (but failing miserably) her breasts and privates. Her breasts are small, her pussy seems tight with sparse hair atop.* Starting in an upright position, the more the girl struggles, the more the branches seems to force her into a face-down-ass-up position.

Having observed this scene for some time, you realise that **the branches are actually holding her in place with force.** Twigs forming from the branches seem to gravitate straight towards her breasts, gentling squeezing them together. A phalic root seems to have grown straight out of the ground and is headed straight for her slit.

**She notices you and continues to begs for help.** The branches have already pushed her down to her knees, soon her head will be touching the ground.

Do you,

1. Join in the fun and take her forcefully,

2. Attempt to save the poor girl

3. Jerk off to the scene

4. Attempt to wake up before you cream your pants in the office.

This story has been around 2 months in the making, but the culmination of the story just happened last Saturday night. I'm a long time reader of this subreddit, so I wanted to share this with you guys while the details are still fresh in my memory. This might be a long read, so thanks in advance for bearing with me. 

&amp;nbsp;

 A little background before I begin the story at hand: I'm a 35 year old guy (though people usually guess my age as 27-29). I just split up with my wife of 9 years 2 months ago. We split up for several reasons, chief among which was that she lost her sexual appetite, as well as personality differences. We haven't had sex in around 4 years. I've always been a highly sexual person; I simply can't get enough sex and I jerk off to porn daily as well. Anyway, after a year of trying to make it work for the sake of our mortgage, I decided that sex was simply too important to me to condemn myself to a sexless marriage for the rest of my life. We have no kids - which makes it a lot more straightforward - however we are still living together for the time being while we finalize our divorce.  

&amp;nbsp;

I work in a creative field, and our company has an arrangement with several local high schools and colleges to provide internships and work experience placement to students who have an interest in the field. Most of the students who come through are in their last year of high school or freshmen in college, and they'll either spend a week here full time, or come in one day a week for two and a half months. 

Very occasionally the boss will put a student under my care for a few hours. No big deal, I just do my job and sometimes explain some of the processes for his/her benefit. What I do is a lot less exciting than the other jobs here, so usually the student suffers it for the allotted time and shuffles off to a more interesting part of the office. 

&amp;nbsp;

I suppose that this is as good a time as any to mention the fact that I'm a bit of a perv. From what I can gather, that's not uncommon among posters and readers here, so I won't apologize for it. However it definitely takes a special kind of pervert to look at teenage girls in a sexual way. So when the work experience kid just happens to be a hot girl, I don't stop myself from using them as fap fodder. Of course, they would only remain fantasies. Though the thought of betraying my sexless marriage has tempted me from time to time, the thought of the ramifications it could have on my marriage or my job have always kept me straight. 

But I would allow myself taboo daydreams. At my age, the opportunity to interact with attractive young girls are few and far between. Previously, I'd never entertained the thought of actually pursuing any of them. Firstly, I was married. Secondly, the students were always between 17 and 20 - far too young for me to hit on without rightfully being labelled a creep. Thirdly, something about ethics in the workplace or some such. 

&amp;nbsp;

Well, apparently removing just one of those reasons (splitting with my wife) was enough to get me to break my admittedly very thin ethical code. 

Laura started her work experience just over two months ago, the week that I split with my wife. Though she was a high school senior, she was very quick to point out the fact that she had recently turned 18. Only 3 weeks prior, in fact. She was undeniably hot: a short thing of around 5'1"" with a stunning face. I noticed that she had that thing that a lot of shorter chicks have going on, where they have a big butt, big thighs and big tits. Her makeup accentuated her most striking features: clear grey eyes and perfectly formed, pouty pink lips that were devilishly inviting. Not many of the work experience girls had worn make up, a fact that planted the seed in my mind that perhaps she wouldn't be adverse to a little male attention.  

We were left alone for the rest of the afternoon. After I showed her my station and explained a few things about our company and the job I do, I was surprised that she wilfully steered the conversation to become more personal. What started as a discussion about her career aspirations turned into a deep and meaningful conversation about the principles of love, sex and friendship. We seemed to click with each other on some level, and although she was obviously lacking in life experience we found ourselves in a genuinely engaging conversation. She constantly surprised me with the maturity of her attitude to work and life, and I found out that her sexual history was also quite extensive considering her age. It wasn't exactly like I was talking to a peer, but this didn't seem like an average high school girl. 

&amp;nbsp;

She came in once a week for 10 weeks. She always seemed happy to see me, and over that time it seemed as though we became quite fond of each other. I found out that she had declined the opportunity to do more interesting activities at the company in order to spend the time at my station. I could ask her highly personal questions about her sex life without her batting an eye. I knew that she liked me on some level, but I convinced myself that she most likely viewed me as some kind of mentor or platonic friend. It couldn't be more than that, right? I mean, I was basically double her age. That didn't stop me from masturbating to the thought of fucking her as soon as I got home afterwards, though. The fact that we got along so well exacerbated the fantasies I had, making it easier to imagine a scenario where she would allow me to do whatever I pleased to her tight, incredible 18 year old body. 

The only thing that bothered me a little bit was that every now and again, I would catch a whiff of a strong smell, which I thought to be foot odor. I thought it strange because she seemed to be otherwise quite well kept. 

&amp;nbsp;

The second last week of her placement here, she mentioned to me that she had broken up with her boyfriend. I could have sworn that as she told me, I saw a flash of something in her eyes. It almost seemed like hopefulness or joy. She definitely wasn't too upset about it. I feigned sympathy as my mind went haywire with more perverted thoughts. I mentioned then that I had also recently split with my wife, and was going through a rough time of my own. 

&amp;nbsp;

The week leading up to her final day of work experience at the company was filled with masturbation and deliberation. If I was going to make a move, this was it. I replayed all of the signals in my mind. Was I reading the situation correctly? Would she be receptive to an offer to spend time together outside the office? Or was I simply allowing my perverted mind to distort my perception as fuel for my masturbation sessions? Would she recoil in disgust if I expressed interest, or worse - say something to my boss or HR? It was certainly a possibility, after all I was a 35 year old man and she was an 18 year old high school student. Surely, this was just my sex-starved mind playing tricks on me.  

Not long after joining me for what would be our final afternoon together, she said that she was sad that it was her last week, and that she was going to miss the people here. Trying hard not to sound sheepish, I said something like: ""Well. Feel free to shoot this down if it's too weird, but I'm going to miss our conversations as well. If you wanted to keep in touch after today, I'd be open to it as well."" I gave her my number (not taking hers), putting the agency solely in her hands. If she was just humoring me, I'd likely not hear from her again, and hopefully no harm would come of it. Otherwise, hopefully my attempt at initiating an out-of-workplace relationship was veiled well enough to sound platonic. However, on the slim chance that she was as interested in me as I thought she was, this could be the start of a deliciously inappropriate episode of my sexual history. 

&amp;nbsp;

She messaged me an hour after work finished, ""so you'll have my number :)"" My heart skipped a beat as the prospect of me actually having sex with this girl seemed to be a step closer to reality. We texted back and forth over the next few days, continuing conversation threads and topics that we'd had at work. I suggested that ""we should hang out sometime"". ""I'd like that :)"" was the response, which triggered another masturbation fantasy session. That Friday night, at 11pm, she called me out of the blue. We spoke for 6 hours. It was her that brought up the topic of sexual kinks as a conversation topic, which led to us admitting our feelings for each other. She'd wanted me since the first week she started, but like me was being coy and vague due to the age difference and general inappropriateness of suggesting anything else. She told me that after our conversations at work, she would go to the bathroom and masturbate while thinking of me. Some of the times while talking to me, her panties were soaked. She said that she was so wet that juices would roll down her thighs. The last few weeks, she wasn't wearing any at all. I realized (though I didn't mention this to her) that the smell I thought was foot odor was actually the smell of her dripping wet pussy. It turns out that we had both been masturbating while thinking of the other the entire time. 

&amp;nbsp;

As our phone call continued into the early hours of Saturday morning, she said several other things that sent pulses of excitement through my body and left me rock hard and reeling. She had a thing for older guys. She loved rough sex. There was no way that anyone could ever fuck her too hard, she said. She asked if it would be okay if she called me ""daddy"", ""sir"" and ""master"". She loved to be spanked.  She said that she was bisexual, and suggested that she could easily organize a threesome with one her slutty friends if I was interested. She said that she if I wanted it, she would become my little cum-slut (her choice of words) and other things that let me know she identified as a submissive.  If I wanted, she would even wear her school uniform for me. She teased me by wondering out loud what my friends and family would think if they found out that I fucked a high-school girl. 

&amp;nbsp;

Before the call ended, she asked me to describe what I wanted to do to her. As a I told her in detail exactly what I would do, I heard her moaning loudly: she was masturbating. 

By the time the call was over I'd long abandoned any ethical dilemma I may have had previously. This was going to happen. I was going to fuck this horny, oversexed girl who was 17 years my junior. After a years long drought of sexual activity, my oasis was finally on the horizon.  

I booked a hotel room for the Saturday night. My wife and I had decided previously that we wouldn't bring other people home while we sorted out the details of the separation. Besides, she had always indicated that significant age differences in couples disgusted her (she's actually slightly older than I am, 2 yrs). There was no way that bringing an 18 year old home was going to happen.  

&amp;nbsp;

She kissed me as soon as we met. We made out the whole way up to the hotel room. She didn't seem concerned about onlookers at all, though I was very conscious of it. When we got into the room I ate her pussy for what must have been half an hour. It sounds cliched, but I swear to god she tasted like honey. Her pussy was breathtaking: so neat, small and unbelievably tight. As I slipped my index finger inside, I could barely believe how tightly her pussy was gripping my single finger. I wasn't sure I'd ever felt a pussy this tight before, even when I was younger and fucking young girls. 

As she changed position and got on all fours, my jaw dropped. Her ass was a miracle. It was disproportionately large compared to her body, but in a way that shook my primal, biological desire to reproduce to it's very core. A huge fucking ass that was as smooth as the rest of her skin and tight as a fucking drum. I told her to hold that position as I took a moment to regain my composure and inspect it from all angles. I mean, I considered myself a boob-man, but this ass converted me on the spot. The way that her massive, oversized-yet-perfectly-toned ass tapered off into a tiny waist could only be compared to a hentai or sexy comic book character. I asked her flat-out ""what the fuck is up with your ass? It's the most beautiful fucking thing I've ever laid eyes on"". She giggled as she told me that it was a partly due to genetics (her mother also had a freakishly large ass), and partly due to the fact that she'd been squatting for hours a week after being inspired by several of the big-booty girls on Instagram a year ago. 

&amp;nbsp;

I couldn't resist. I licked every inch of her ass several times over. I sucked on it, I bit it. And then, I spanked it as hard as I could, with each strike producing a loud ""crack"" and an excruciatingly sexy, high pitched moan. 

She wanted to suck my cock but I needed to fuck that pussy NOW. I slipped a condom onto my rock hard cock and told her to stay on all fours. I groaned loudly as I pushed myself into her with genuine difficulty. This pussy was so fucking tight that there was no way that my mind could allow another thought to enter it. I was suddenly locked in an intense struggle to not blow my load immediately. I closed my eyes as I allowed myself to be consumed by the sensation of this unbelievably tight, 18 year old pussy. ""It's so fucking tight"" I stammered, among other obscenities. As she gasped in pleasure, she said something about wanting her pussy to have a ""death-grip"" and that she'd been somehow exercising it. If I wasn't experiencing irrefutable proof of it, I may not have believed her. This was definitely a death-grip.  

I managed a couple of dozen pumps before I opened my eyes and looked down. The combination of the visual of her enormous ass in front of me, along with the sensation of the tightness of her pussy was almost too much. I knew that if I kept looking at her ass while I fucked her from behind I wouldn't last much longer. And I didn't want this to end. This was everything I'd fantasized about, and so much more. Somehow, I'd ended up balls deep in the most perfect 18 year old slut in the goddamn universe. I was about to close my eyes to concentrate on not cumming when she looked back over her shoulder to glance at me, her face revealing pure ecstacy. Her amazingly sexy grey eyes caught the light, and it was too much for me to take. I bellowed loudly as I thrust into her, emptying myself into the straining condom. I couldn't have lasted more than 3 or 4 minutes at most. 

&amp;nbsp;

I fucked her three more times. Thankfully, I lasted longer the subsequent times. The final time, I was pounding her harder than I'd ever fucked anyone before while she called me ""daddy"" over and over again. The whole time I felt intoxicated, not just by the raw sensations of sex but by the fact that this girl was so fucking perfect that it felt like I was fucking a figment of my imagination that had suddenly sprung to life. I'd never experienced anything like it before.  

&amp;nbsp; 

Anyway, on the Sunday we had another phone conversation, though this one a little shorter and less intense. We talked about the feasibility of making this a long-term thing. We agreed that the significant age gap would make things difficult for us. We talked some scenarios through and decided that we should start off with a ""secret friends with benefits"" arrangement for the time-being, and then seeing where it goes from there. For now, I'm looking forward to seeing her again this weekend.

She doesn't know about this post, and after thinking it over I've decided that it wouldn't be cool of me to post or share photos of her without her permission.

4q9wqf,1,2016-06-28,How do I [20/F] make friends at a new university while maintaining a job?,hellomyoldcountry,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4q9wqf/how_do_i_20f_make_friends_at_a_new_university/,"I'll try to keep this short, apologies if I don't. I am transferring to a new school in the fall that is about halfway across the country from where I currently live. Truly, this move is the most independent I've ever been, and I can't wait. I am moving out of my house and into my first apartment, and I have finally found the right university that matches my career goals and aspirations in a city I love. I can't wait.

I'm not that nervous to move, since I lived in this city last summer for an internship, but there is one aspect that is giving me some anxiety. Since I will not be near my parents or family at all, I have no choice but to have a part-time job while being a full-time student. I'm not worried about balancing it; when I lived at home and commuted to school for my first half of college, I had a part-time job and still managed to make Dean's List every semester. However, I had to sacrifice getting involved on campus for working, and found it really difficult to squeeze in a club or activity while having a class and work schedule. 

I really enjoy having a job, because it allows me to work towards my bigger goals in life, like buying a house and (eventually) being financially stable. There is a certain pride I feel when I am able to save up for a big purchase, like a vacation or some material item. I would feel a bit lost if I didn't have a part-time job. 

Where I'm starting to get concerned is I'm realizing that many of my friends and other undergraduate students I've met do not have jobs while they go to school, which allows them to have more socializing and club time in their schedule. I didn't make a lot of friends at my previous university, because I was commuting back and forth between two different towns to work and go to school, with studying in between. This was no big deal, since I was living with my parents and have a close relationship with them, but I'm starting to see this as a roadblock when I move, since loneliness came come a bit faster when you're completely on your own away from family. I'm certainly not knocking anyone who doesn't balance a job and full-time student-ing, but being unemployed is not an option for me. I have rent and bills to pay, as well as continuing to save up for my future. I would be out of the city and back home pretty quickly if I did not have a job.

Reddit, I'm really concerned about this. I would love to find a way to join at least one club while having a job, but I'm worried this is not possible. To make matters a bit more complicated, I am a theatre studies major (which is performing arts education), and while I miss doing shows/feel it necessary to be involved because of my major, it's very difficult to squeeze in rehearsal time while trying to make money and go to school. Participating in shows really only seems feasible for people who do not have to work, and I haven't been in one since high school when I was unemployed. If I have to sacrifice theatre for work, I will, but it's going to be difficult since I have made most of my friends in the performing arts world, and am a bit worried on how to make friends if I'm not involved in productions or activities on campus. On the flip side, since my focus is education, not performance, I would still have exposure to theatre, but am worried that this will hinder me from making friends in my school. Many theatre majors I know in any capacity don't work because they are doing shows. I'm worried I'll stick out like a sore thumb.
I have many other interests besides theatre, so my participation on campus wouldn't necessarily be just shows. I am willing to give anything a shot. 

Has anyone else been in a situation like this? I feel like such an odd duck; I truly don't know anyone around me who works and goes to school. My friends have told me to cut back on hours or stop working altogether, but like I said, this really is not an option at all. Even my academic adviser did not have much advice to offer when I said I would be working alongside my course schedule; he just gave me this weird look, as though he had never heard of anyone doing that before. Is this really such an odd situation to be in?

Any advice would be appreciated. 

**tl;dr**: I am transferring to a new university across the country (yay!), and will have to work part-time while being a full-time student in order to pay for rent, bills and life. I'm worried about making friends, since it doesn't appear I'll have a lot of time to be as involved on campus as I would like to be. Any tips or advice? Have you been in this situation too?"

4q9yjc,1,2016-06-28,Brand impossible?,ES_IDCA,graphic_design,https://www.reddit.com/r/graphic_design/comments/4q9yjc/brand_impossible/,"So, I already knew this local office marketing manager was going to be hard to please with the idea of getting paid but, have a fallback there.

So, now I've presented first drafts (of a new product announcement.) In which they want to celebrate the old product. Keep in mind, this is sophisticated medical machinery.

 ""congratulations! Your product is old.""

What the fuck? They are married to the idea of presenting the old machine but, upset with me that it looks too new. I'm suggesting just showing off the new product... I don't think I should be making the old medical machinery look like it's been rolled down a highway and lived under a bridge because getting a job after college just didn't work out...

Also, she is also telling me that branding guidelines (set by the International head office) are just guidelines and, she wants something THAT POPS AND SCREAMS DIFFERENT! She did praise the intern on doing the one thing that is expressly stated and, literally the only sentence in the entire branding guide, that is actually highlighted, ""NEVER FUCKING DO THAT!"" I agree... Because what was done was not only off course but, fucking hideous.

I want to do right by the company. This marketing manager is brand clueless. I'm just a contractor. I suggested she reach out to their head office to see what they think...

These are my favorites so far:

.Ep 394- Wisconsin Sugar Babies (Galifianakis, Lapkus, Baltz)- This is my favorite appearance of Todd this year (it's the episode where he dies). Plus Zach is always a good guest. I enjoy Baltz's character too, and apparently Scott was a fan too because they brought him back for the live tour.

Ep. 396- The Intern Challenge (Heubel, Gabrus, St. Clair)- This was a funny idea having the two interns (Gino and Marissa Wompler) compete against each other. The weird rivarly/sexual tension that developed between the two of them was funny. 

Ep. 399- Trump Vs. Bernie (Gottfied, Adomian, Atamaniuk)- Gilbert was a little all over the place in this episode with some of his stories/reminiscing/rambling, but the Trump Vs. Bernie parts were hilarious. Sadly Adomian's only appearance on the podcast so far this year :(

Ep. 423- Time Bobby 4 (Moynihan, Tompkins)- Any appearance of Fourvel and PFT as Dame Andrew Lloyd Webber is naturally going to appear on any best-of list.

Ep. 425- Sunday Afternoon Taped (Samberg, O'Doherty, Kroll)- This episode was like a perfect storm of comedy, between Andy being there to do the Hollywood Facts theme song, one of my favorite guests Claudia O'Doherty, and Nick Kroll doing almost all of his many characters. Plus they mentioned plane breaks! This will probably end up being my favorite episode of the year, it pushed all of my personal buttons for a CBB episode. 

Sometimes an episode would have one element I liked, but something else that kept it from being a perfect episode. Like I enjoyed the episode with Weird Al but I personally didn't find Kate Berlant that funny in that episode; she really took away from Al and Scott in my opinion. Or the episode where Todd was high, that was funny but Rogue Wave weren't that interesting as guests (their music is pleasant enough but not that exciting either). So those are my 5 picks so far for the year. What are yours?"

I've heard many people from my major telling me that little to none of what I learn from the upper level classes helped them when it came to their internships (student teaching) or when they actually became a teacher. Only the required social science classes helped them. Plus the stress of the student teaching and all that. I will be a fine teacher but I've heard from so many people that student teaching is even worse than your first year as a teacher. 

I was wondering if it would be a better choice to get a regular degree (social science, history, political science) and look into alternative certifications. My mom about had a stroke when I told her that's what I was considering, but in my state (FL) it's fairly common for teachers to not have a traditional education degree. I know teaching is what I want to do, but I don't know which path I should take. 

Is there anyone else who knew they wanted to be a teacher, but weren't sure if they wanted to go through with an education degree because of the BS and politics that goes along with it?"

4qbq0p,6,2016-06-28,"My [21M] girlfriend [22F] of 3 years, openly admitted feeling depressed, became distant, claims we've become too different.",Burningman12,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4qbq0p/my_21m_girlfriend_22f_of_3_years_openly_admitted/,"Hey guys. I've been in this relationship for a little over 3 years now, but as the title suggests, things are rocky now. So I'll just get into it.

For the first two years, my GF and I had, what I would describe, as the perfect relationship. We were each others best friends. We were happy as kids in a candy shop. We did a lot of things together, predominantly outdoor activities. Things like hiking, camping, running, biking. It's someone we were both very into and really contributed to building the relationship and memories. 

Unfortunately, she sustained an injury which prevents her from doing these things now. It's been very hard for her, and it's been over a year since she's been injury free. It's obviously a huge burden to her. This is where the problem stems. 

Our initial relationship budded off the mutual interest in outdoor activities, but now that's not possible. She's become depressed, and I feel terrible because she can't do the things she used to love to do. I've tried to be as compassionate and supportive as I can be, but it's not too often that the cloud hanging above her head doesn't influence her.

 I'm trying to be as accommodating as possible, suggesting we can do other things together, like video gaming, reading, walks, Netflix binging, doing lifts at the gym that don't bother her, etc. To me, experiencing things together is what made our outdoor adventures so fun. I don't really care what we do together as long as it's together. Sadly, she doesn't seems to be very receptive to any of my suggestions. She's mentioned that she's become depressed, so this would be it preventing her from enjoying anything. I really hate seeing her like this, but nothing ever seems to help...

Except alcohol. She finds some comfort from drinking, and brings up the point that it's the only thing that helps here and there. I feel like this isn't a reasonable coping for the situation, but it's hard for me to reason otherwise because it's not me in the situation. Another problem is that I'm uncomfortable drinking, and have never been drunk, for my own reasons. However, she is far from being an alcoholic or anything, she just states it's all she really enjoys as it numbs the pain.

So anyways, I'm a college athlete and I've noticed that whenever I mention anything about my involvement with it, it bums her out and she gets quiet and upset. I can understand that, so I have tried to limit any mention to it. It kind of hurts that she doesn't appear to care much on how im performing in the season, and has even hinted that I should quit. I almost want to because it would make her feel better and we'd have more time together, but at the same time I only have 1 year of eligibility left and I'm doing better than ever and would like to see things out.

Additionally, she has left for an internship out in Kentucky, so we're apart for the summer. Her field of focus places her with predominantly other male interns, but I try not to let that bother me. But she's become very spotty in texting me, pretty much only texting back if I initiate, and having very short messages. She also goes out often with these groups, for dinner and on the weekends. I totally want her to make friends and have a good time, because it'd be good for her head. But she claims she's too busy to text much, and too busy to have me visit for a weekend? She's too depressed to do things around me... Yet seems ready to go out with others. I want the best for her, but I'm not stupid. 

I've brought this up with her and she says she needs to fix herself before she can be happy in a relationship. She told me we're leading different lifestyles because she can't enjoy doing outdoorsy things anymore. Didn't break up, just left things with an odd air, saying that she's trying to fix things. I'm hurting a lot and want things to work out, but not really sure what to do. And with how things are now, I can help but feel suspicious of her actions currently. 

But I don't want to paint her in a poor image. She's great, makes me incredibly happy, and has done so much for me. She does have a very cruddy injury and depression, so her actions aren't entirely her own. And I do enjoy outdoorsy things, so I'm sure sometimes I can be 'too into' them. I'm not perfect and haven't reacted perfectly to things I'm sure. 

Tl;dr- 
Girlfriend became depressed, isn't into the things we used to do, became distant, says she's too busy for me to visit but goes out with groups on weekends. 

What do I do? Wait things out? It's becoming difficult for me to surpress my suspicious mind. I don't want things to end."

[25/F] Trying to get through a nightmare [26/M] How do I get away?,InPursuitOfTruth,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/4qcrdg/need_advice_desperate_for_help_25f_trying_to_get/,"Hello everyone. I'm totally at a wall. I'm very uncertain how to proceed in my current situation. It's overwhelming. I'm not perfect by any means.
But here's the situation:

I have been single for about a year when I met this guy I'm now living with. Which I wasn't interested in doing ( living together) until we were boyfriend and girlfriend for awhile. 
I feel as though the whole situation was not even of my free will. 

When we met I was living in my own place renting a room with a couple and their children in another town. I took a internship in a town where I knew no one really but the internship was great. I get paid a pathatic salary. Just enough to get by on. 

This guy was a sweetheart I really adored him. He was into everything I was including video games. I like video games.  Gamers get a bad rap because yes they spend allot of time banging away at their keyboard and controllers. So what I said I spend allot of time doing my own hobbies. 

His current roommate when we met was very promiscuous and often times told me that he wasn't holding his end if their arrangements.  I didn't think anything of it at first. But when i went over to his house all her things where with his. And he would let her completely destroy their house. She had animals using the bathroom everywhere. The place was filthy. Really really filthy. Mold garbage trash grime etc. I thought holy crap this girl is running a huge amount of game on him. 

And that's exactly what came out. She claimed they had a sexual agreement and she could do whatever she wanted. 

Why was he looking for a girlfriend ? He has one.. He would ditch me only a couple days later on Valentines day to hang out with her and his friend. 

I actually stopped the whole situation between him and I and straight told him if he's going to be doing this with his roommate I do not want to get involved whatsoever. He said he was interested in her and that she didn't like him. But still gets the perks and pretty much shits on me . 

We talked more and I thought maybe he doesn't understand what's going on and what he's doing. Girls can be very manipulative. He said clearly that he did not have any sort of arrangements with her over and over.

So I told him shit or get off the pot. He told me she needed to go. I said I would support that why we are dating. 

She basically started harassing me none stop with crazy amounts of drama and trapping me in there business. She convinced me that she wasn't going to leave and would start using legal support to stay. Not my problem. But he kept making my problem I couldn't believe the drama and amount of spiteful crap she would pull. Anytime I would see him 1-3 hour conversations from this girl would come flying down on me from her. Literally turning into 20 hours a week of her bullshit. Which weren't about me. I kept reminding her she has plenty of resources and family and guys she knows that want to help her. 

He finally tells her to move out. She runs a huge manipulation on my family to give her money to move saying she would be homeless. And that her car was going to be repoed any second. I gave her $1,250 on the down low and told her to use it as a deposit ( which she never had) then she left but went to my father and asked him to pay her car payment taking another $1089  plus a gas card to help her get to work. When I saw her again to move out her belongings she told me and this guy that her ex boyfriend paid off her car payments.  Then left. I didn't know at the time she had swindled my father for that as well. My father and I had plans to go on a trip and spend time together. My father said she came over for 3 days and refused to leave claiming that this guy I was dating was sexually  and financially inappropriate with her. I didn't know this until she was gone and I was in this trip with my family. I was shocked. I told my dad i already gave her money to move.  She kept telling my father she was homeless and had no one. On and on and I said I would help her. Which i did I gave her a deposit money for a new place. Holy Fuck. I was really in depth at that point. $2000 plus from this drama of his. 

I come home from my trip and walk in my apartment door to find a notice from my landlord saying i need to move immediately. I thought what the hell is going on. That same girl roommate of the guy I was dating called immigration on my landlords wife and family. Omgod. That's it I'm telling this guy what it's going on. 

Now I am really fucked. I do not know anyone here. Everyone i know is states away. Beyond my job that barely covers rent and food. 
Keep in mind this guy I'm dating works 40 hours ($19 hour) a week. His parents pay for everything including the Mortgage for condo he lives in and owns.  He was getting roommates to pay $800 of the $1,000 bills his parents wanted him to pay for a two bedroom apartment and making it seem like that was fair. He had no reason to ever take money from me to get rid of his prostitute ""roommate"". 
Surprise surprise he tells me to deal with it. I was left homeless . i ended up moving into a crack house literally. My whole life was spiraling. He's going home to a empty two bedroom apartment fully covered and I'm staying in a crack house. 

A week goes by this guy keeps wanting to check in on me and date. I'm confused in complete hell. He made himself the only thing that brought me happiness.  He kept telling me that he never asked me to help that girl leave when she wanted to. It's not his problem. I told him I need help. This is not a joke. If we keep seeing each other something needs to give. He kept saying he had no room in his 2 bedroom place. His friend was going to move in in a couple months or when ever he gets a job here. 

I couldn't believe this. Eventually after seeing me struggle and struggle he said "" you know my friend isn't moving in . If you want to live here that's okay. This is your home now"" I was speechless.  I was really done with the drama . But that saved it. 

I move in. two moves in one month. Wow. I'm exhausted.  I thought the nightmare was over. The fear was over. 

The guy I was dating told me about a girl he was dating accused him of sexually abusing her. We were sharing prior crazy ex stories. I felt bad that someone would lie about something like that. I have brothers i know some girls say mean things about guys they don't like after a brake up.

I was wrong. Everyday I go to work . Come home and he just complains . He's tierd he's exhausted . The  amount of disgusting filth that piled up from the roommate and him.  Digging out of a hole here just to use the bath bathroom kitchen . So everyday I come home and clean. Organize. He sits back playing video games . Complaining. I change more and more things to meet his forever demands. Ie. I don't want to spend money on going out. Now I'm making dinner 2 hours a night ontop of chores.  He dumps garbage and piles of dishes in the sink. Leaves them for weeks. I do them over and over and over. 64 days of slave work. He plain refused to go out. I exist to bring him food and drinks why he laughs and talks with all has friends via video games and private chat rooms. .he put out a nasty vibe if I said anything to him while he played video games every second I saw him. Making impossible to even speak to him. I tried to compromise I do everything in the house he spends two days with me a week. 
Never really happened. I kept explaining he's hurting my feelings. I have not even unpacked one of my own boxes. I'm sleeping on the couch. I'm giving him oral sex. He was not interested in having sex for two people.  Just himself. I thought all this would blow over if i was patient and continued to confront the issues we were having. But it just got worse. 
Like he agreed i wouldnt pay any rent until i could save money from his roommate situation i paid for.
Then my atm card number got stolen. For 40 days straight with out me noticing my saving account got drained for another $2,000 dollars out of my savings. My bank said they can't reimburse something that wasn't reported within 24 hours. Are you kidding me. I lost another $1,800 total that was not covered by my bank fraud. 
No one had access to my bank number in my home but the guy I'm dating and myself. 
My phone gets broken. Just weird things. 
I confront these things as they come up creating a distraction and chaos which never seemed to bother this guy I'm living with and dating. This is awful. Some of his friends put up swastika symbols On there chat when I walk in and start laughing. I didn't make a big deal about it. I just said I'm not comfortable and walked out. He hit me so hard in my sleep it on "" accidentally "" i had to go to the emergency room the next day . It hit a disk and cut off blood flow to my body. Again sleeping on the couch in terrible pain.
I had been putting out $120 bi weekly to by grocery that i didn't eat 80% of anything ontop of paying for outings and ridiculous broken items mold on my make up brushes one day? My broken phone? Ontop of utilities $159 on set up $150 to change internet. I couldn't use wifi because i t was really unsafe and glitching . Only him. 
Crazy.  Anyways I walk in the other night to his gaming cave... I say it's getting really late let's grab some fast food for dinner. Two hours go by he Walks out and says
"" I'm dumping  you and I want you to move out ""
""I given you plenty of time. I'm dumping you because your shaming me"" 
My response

"" we can't brake up because you never asked me to be your girlfriend. I don't know what your taking about. I'm not your slave ""

1 hour He is on the internet in dating section telling people he went through a horrible brake up and is looking for a serious relationship. OMG . 

What the Fuck is happenings?  I feel like I'm crazy? I feel exhausted?  
Please someone help me I'm seriously hurting"
4qd0oz,1,2016-06-28,Overarching sense of foreboding in my life and I don't know why,scholarandgent,MMFB,https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/4qd0oz/overarching_sense_of_foreboding_in_my_life_and_i/,"Alot has happened in my life in the last year and even more in the last month. 

So a bit of background. I am in my mid-twenties and I've been married 4 years. I got a masters in public admin in spring 2015, and my wife just finished her PHD and started a post-doc position. We were both born and raised in the Tampa Bay area, and while there are things to love about it we have both been desperate to leave for some time.

We recently moved to Lexington, ky for my wife's job. While it wasnt our first pick city, its been a drastic improvement in lifestyle for us both. We get real season, the summer isnt nearly as humid, we live in a walkable part of the city and can bike to most things we want to do on any given night. Being urban enthusiasts, this was a big step up from living in the suburbs of Tampa. 

I also got a new job here in Ky. I work for the state government. Prior to this, I hadn't had a paying job since August of 2014. I have been doing volunteer work or internships in the nonprofit/ government sector.  The new job I have, while not directly in what sparks my passion , is a good job and will definitely set me up for alot of different things in the future. Especially considering I spent nearly 8 months looking for work in Tampa, interviewed for 8 different positions, and each time I was always told that they hired someone with ""slightly more experience"".

So overall things are pretty damned good, but I can't help but feel this sense of foreboding in my life. 

First lets start with the move. The move was mildly dreadful. We were supposed to leave for KY on a friday and the movers were going to pick our stuff up on thursday morning. The movers did not show up until 7pm, and didn't leave until 1 am. They charged us 2k more than they quoted (while this sucked it didn't affect us too badly financially). Move in day at the new place was a huge pain in the ass,  mainly due the fact that a pipe burst under our sink and partially flooded the place. That issue was resolved relatively easily.

The new place we have is relatively fine, but there are just small things that annoy me about it. There is less useful storageb than at our place. Also there are no overhead lights in any room except the kitchen area....it really bugs me. (I know this is incredibly petty but I just need to vent it).

The new job has a few thigns wrong with it. First of the pay is extremely low for what I'm doing....they honestly didn't even mention the pay during the interview I accepted the job because I was desperate for something in my field. I make about 30k a year.....similar jobs back in Tampa were going for 42-48k. They didn't mention travel at all during the interview, but my position recently got assimilated into part of an old position and now I will be traveling like 20% of the time it seems. Its all in state travel, but sometimes this means traveling 2-3 hours for a single fucking meeting that last like 1 hour...which means I have to spend money on dinner or lunch...etc. Also this means getting home late. Without going into detials, the first job I had out of college required a lot of late nights and really strained my new marriage. Its left a bad taste in my mouth about regularly working late/being away.

Other than those things, I don't really have anything to bitch about. I'm glad for the change in my life. This move has been good for us in terms of chaning things up, getting something close to the ""urban lifestyle"" we wanted in tampa. I actually have a job in my field.

But I cant shake this feeing of dread and forboding. It feels like I made a giant mistake that I'm unware of at the moment. Like I've left the oven on  at home and I'm gonna come home to a house fire. I feel like I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop. I'm a fairly introspective person, so it is rather unusual for me to feel this way. i can usually pin point to some degree why I'm feeling a certain way.

I feel a little better just typing this out and posting it. Any words of kindness or advice are appreciated."
4qd274,7,2016-06-28,2 Days in: I thought MJ was my best friend,_Panda_Panda_Panda_,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/4qd274/2_days_in_i_thought_mj_was_my_best_friend/,"After reading and relating to many of the posts on this subreddit, I'd like to share what I've been going through and hope to achieve in the near future. 

I've been smoking daily for about 3 1/2 years now. I didn't began to smoke daily until the beginning of the 2nd semester of my freshman year of college (I am now a senior who intends to graduate after this summer). Initially, after listening to Joe Rogan's podcasts about his take on weed and other psychedelics, I thought weed was a harmless plant that would leave me with no repercussions, both physically and mentally. The longest I've gone sober was about 2 months - summer of 2014 - but only because I was doing study abroad and had no access to Mary. As soon as I returned home, I succumbed to my previous smoking habits. One of my very close friends is a pothead, who like many others, preaches that weed is ""actually good for you"" because it allows one to be introspective while discovering more about one-self. One of his biggest arguments was that weed can be ""dangerous"" only if you have an abusive relationship with it. Throughout my college years, I have maintained good grades, had multiple internships, and maintained relationships with amazing people (some are potheads while others are not) - while smoking weed on the daily. I was feeling great and motivated. I thought I had the world at my fingertips. Little did I know I was only fooling myself. 

2 months ago, a week before my finals, I suffered a trimalleolar ankle fracture while tearing a couple of my ligaments of my left ankle. I managed to take my finals and got surgery the following week. After my surgery (5/16), they prescribed me with Oxy and for a week straight, I had to take it every 4 hours because the pain was too much to handle. I would then smoke a bowl about every hour or so. This continued on until I started summer school (6/3). I would literally just lie helplessly on the bed - not like I had another choice - being stoned 24/7. This was a very dark time for me. I had plans to go to Vancouver and Vegas, but had to cancel everything because of my injury. Every summer, I hang out with my friends and go to the beach, (I'm from LA and we do have very nice beaches and weather) but I couldn't anymore. All i could do was lie in bed, keep my foot elevated at all times, piss in bottles, and smoke weed. During this dark stage of my life, MJ was my best friend. When I felt helpless and unmotivated, I would smoke a bowl to ease all my problems away. And while I did feel better, I knew deep inside that I was only being a COWARD. Smoking only masked my problems. 

After summer school started, I told myself that I wouldn't smoke anymore because I knew I could achieve so much more if I were sober. Instead of devising this reward system, I decided to quit cold turkey. However, after a day in, my mother called me and told me she had Thyroid cancer. I didn't know what to do or say. I was speechless. I wanted to drop out of school and go back home to take care of my mom. But, HOW? I was in crutches and could barely even take care of myself. I have never felt so helpless and disappointed in myself. My single mother had nobody to take care of her at home, while I was up here smoking it away. I knew I had to quit at this very moment, but the pain was overwhelming. A day in and I started smoking again to numb my pain. 

However, last Friday, I had my crutches removed and began walking in a boot. I am now going to physical therapy twice a week to regain mobility of my left leg and foot. Now that I am able to some what walk again and exercise, this urge to make a difference in my life struck me. After 3 1/2 years, I now know that You and I are better without weed, whether you have an abusive relationship with it or not. I know that I'm only 2 days in, but I've finally decided to tackle my problems by confronting these issues while being sober. I now realize that I've associated weed with many of my daily activities: watching tv-shows and movies, playing video games, and eating. Now, all these activities don't seem very appealing to me. BUT that's okay. After reading many of your guys' posts it's normal to feel this way. It will take time, but perseverance and will-power are essential to break away from our habits. Instead, I intend to exercise at least 5 times a week while pursuing my career interests in the sports and entertainment industry. After summer school ends, I plan to work near home so that I can emotionally and financially take care of my mother. I will keep you guys posted as the days go on. I just want to thank you guys for sharing your stories and instilling this new feeling of hope into me. We can get through this together.

On another note, I was wondering if it would be okay to mix 5 HTP with melatonin. I plan on taking this for only for about a couple of weeks to help me get through the initial stage of recovery. "

The process by which you pass a hair follicle test (aside from not doing drugs for three months) involves cycling between acidic and basic hair treatments in order to remove enough of your hair’s cuticle to clean out the incriminating toxins. I say incriminating because in the United States of America you can lose your job willy-nilly for having done drugs at any point in a three month time-span, even if that job is essentially a paid summer camp in which you frantically google microsoft excel tutorials so that you can put on the facade of being a highly accomplished desk monkey. When I complained about this to my friends they condescended that if I knew I’d have to take a drug test then I shouldn’t have done any drugs. In my defense, I know at most two people that would pass a hair follicle test if they had to take one within a week, but that’s a different story. They say you’re the product of the five people you spend the most time with and it looks like I botched my social life as far as sobriety goes.

There is of course an entire industry funded solely off of the ad revenue generated by concerned drug users looking to pass unexpected drug tests given a limited timeline. The data driven product placement will direct you to all sorts of cleansers, detoxes, home remedies, ointments, and shampoos that supposedly will help you pass your drug test and land the six figure job of your dreams. Assuming you pass, you can look forward to above average pay, petty office politics, tedium, and most importantly the existential dread that you’ve traded your agency and determinism for monetary units based off of nothing more than the world’s collective faith in the US government’s ability to pay its interest payments. But the world’s faith in our debt leveraged monetary system is also a different story.

That last paragraph was verbose but you get the point. My generation sits precariously on the knife’s edge of corporate hell and forced obsolescence. There are droves of business students frantically going through the motions, the politics, and the superficial grade point averages backed by no actual skills (at least, not the kind that won’t be automated by increasingly effective computer algorithms in the next 20 years), all in order to get a job they don’t really want to buy things they don’t need to impress people they don’t like, yada, yada, yada. It’s the same tired song and dance that we’ve had since at least Thoreau and the purpose of this piece isn’t to reiterate that, although it did warrant a brief discussion.

It would be trite to turn this into some grandiose diatribe on cynicism with modern society and its rampant materialism, especially when you consider that I’m the textbook definition of what I just described -- a middle class college student, going through the motions to land a prestigious-enough-internship so that I can at least have some leverage when society demands that I grow up and find a real job. It turns out that you need to have cultivated skills in order to be deterministic and to have agency, otherwise you fit neatly next to some other cog in the market-driven machine. This essay is an acknowledgement of defeat. It is me letting you, the reader, know that I have (at least for now) sold out. This essay is also, in part, a justification for giving up my agency and freedom by explaining my motivations for pursuing the high-paid corporate job route and not simply riding my bike through the German countryside, panhandling for bread.

It’s May 4th, 2016 so let’s rewind one year. I had no plan, no ambition, and no concept of my future after college aside from a vague notion that I’d like to teach English abroad and eventually become some sort of social studies teacher. I was also dating Tori (my long term girlfriend) for the third month of our reunion following a six month sabbatical in which we dated other people and failed completely to fix any of the problems that ended our relationship in the first place. Actually, we weren’t technically dating (she would later point this out pretty staunchly) -- she was dating some christian hipster on the side and I eventually found out about it so she ghosted me completely -- and I was feeling pretty bleak about the situation and life in general Without going into too much detail, there were a number of fucked up things that I did in our relationship, most of which revolved around me having episodic issues with binge-drinking and picking fights with strangers. My mother’s solution to my relationship issues was to, of course, plan on going to law school and effectively improve my mate value in an obviously transaction driven system of interpersonal relationships.

Whether or not this was the right decision is irrelevant -- it just planted the idea in my head that you may need status if you want to keep your girlfriend from cucking you with some virgin hipster neckbeard. 

Fast forward 10 days to May 14th and I’m driving back to Athens from my home town after visiting my family. By this point I’d basically accepted that I’d been beaten and wasn’t really trying to win Tori back to our toxic relationship, but I needed to go home to regather myself in a way that can only be done by returning to the nexus of your genetic origins and social ideologies. Which is really just a convoluted way of saying I missed my parents but my writing wouldn’t have much to offer if I wasn’t pedantic.

So there I am, pulling into our apartment complex, rounding the curve and accelerating up the hill towards our little duplex. It’s a hot day and you can see clearly the clearing between ours and the neighbors’ house where my dog’s piss and piles of pig shit (our neighbors were these racist farm boys from some backwoods Georgia county where the KKK was still relevant) had eroded the grass. As I get to the front of our house, I see a large number of cops parked outside, feeding in and out of our apartment. At first I assume it’s a drug raid since Jones (my roommate) frequently bought drugs on the deepweb, but as I get out of my car it becomes increasingly apparent that something even more random and unfair than a no-knock drug raid had happened in our own little corner of carefree student life.

As I slowly approach our apartment, this bald guy intercepts me and asks me if I live there. I tell him I do and tells me that he’s a detective and that I need to come sit in his car with him. He gets right to the point and tells me,
	
“I’m sorry to be the one to tell you this, but someone’s passed away. Now, I need you to identify this person I’m about to show you on this phone. Can you do that for me?” I’m pretty shocked by the whole thing and feel this hyper-surreal haze setting in alongside a weird hollow fluttery feeling in my gut, like I’d been up all night on adderall writing a term paper. So I tell him, yeah, sure, I’ll identify the body, Why not? 
	
So the guy whips out his standardized iphone 5 and flips through some pictures and eventually gets to a picture of Jones’ bloated, discolored face with traces of white bile coming out of his partially open mouth. He didn’t look like he was sleeping at all, not even remotely. He looked like a corpse. Like the deadest and saddest casualty that society had to offer. If I was already seeing the world in a fugue of shock and then this threw me in a couple of layers deeper. 
	“Do you know this person?”
	“Yes. That’s Jones. My roommate.” I don’t bother asking any questions since it’s pretty apparent what had happened. 
	“Okay, so this is Jones…” he writes something in a notebook and tells a nearby cop that he was in the wrong bedroom (for whatever reason he decided to die in Sam’s bedroom).

Long story short, Jones is dead and they suspect it was drug related. I don’t really know what to do with myself at this point. My neighbor, Taylor, who is a firefighter is out there and tells me that he heard the call on his radio that the apartment staff had found a body in apartment our apartment and was ready to kick the door in… but the coroner told him it wouldn’t have made a difference. I call Tori (who else was I going to call?) and she arrives pretty quickly and waits with me (for nothing in particular). Eventually we decided to take the dog on a walk and I try to get her to make out with me but she doesn’t want to given the circumstances. She eventually has to leave to go have dinner with her friend (not the dude she was two-timing me with) and I just sort of sat there outside the apartment, wondering what to do. Neither of my parents nor my surviving roommate answered their phone so I eventually just went inside and sat on our couch.

The police officers had completely rearranged our living room to get his body out of the apartment so I pushed the sectional back together and moved Jones’ unused bike back to its spot near the dog’s cage against the window. The apartment, like everything else that day, felt surreal, like I was seeing it through film or through several layers of a dream scape (like inception). I go upstairs and look in all of the bedrooms and find Jones’ cell phone between Sam’s bed and the wall. I plug it in and go downstairs to the kitchen. There, I find poppy seeds in a pan on the stove. Jones, who was a biochemistry major and one of the brightest kids I knew, had prior to his death cooked poppy seeds to extract trace amounts of morphine to get high. With nothing better to do, I sit on the couch with Heidi and watch the Office. At some point I let my summer exec board from my student org know what happened and that I wouldn’t be able to make it to our evening meeting but otherwise the next two days are a blur.

As soon as my dad found out, he kept telling me leave the apartment. In fact, that was the number one piece of advice I got from everyone, to get out of the apartment. Go stay with friends, stay with Tori, stay with anyone. For reasons that I can’t explain, I felt the need to remain there. Maybe I felt like Jones needed a wake, a proper send off to the next life. Maybe I felt guilty leaving his spirit there alone since he’d already died there alone. Maybe I was annoyed at what a pig sty we’d let the house become and felt like I needed to clean it before leaving. Whatever the case may be, I had a certain morbid fixation with the apartment and didn’t want to leave. Even after the funeral, I was the only one in the house (aside from Jones’ ghost and Dog) and made a habit of drinking, watching netflix, and occasionally wandering through the house calling out for “Jonesie” thinking I might just have a supernatural experience.

I didn’t of course. If anyone was going to encounter a restless spirit, it would have been me. Jones died tragically, a brilliant life taken from us far too soon, leaving a scorched swathe of grief and unanswered questions in his wake. But that’s the thing about this special brand of tragedy. Far too often it’s all in the heads of the people around the victim. Jones’ ghost didn’t exist as any lingering manifestation of his conscious mind. It existed as the romanticized memory of him, primarily on social media but also in the dialogues among his loved ones for the weeks and months following the funeral. So it might be accurate in a weird way to describe the house as “haunted” but I’m using this word even more abstractly than its meaning connotes. On the one hand, there was, of course, me; a drunken, comatose mess, essentially wallowing in the environment that led to his death. On the other, there was the environment itself. Our messy, poorly kept apartment, that was host to a very living and breathing Jones less than two weeks before. 

For me, the apartment represented everything that I thought was wrong with modern consumerism and its failure to provide fulfilling lives to students. Here we were, at what was arguably the peak of human civilization, packed comfortably into little boxes, seated atop the paved ruin of what was once forest and grassland, juxtaposed to a convenient little dog park with a polluted stream and post industrial waste -- a mass manufactured “lifestyle” community created for students to comfortably drink away their parents’ tax advantaged 529a bank accounts. Here we were, living what should have been on paper damn near perfect lives, wallowing in existentialism, depression, anxiety, and contempt-for-materialism, watching ranks of vapid, superficial, B-list frat stars impress equally superficial chicks at the pool. 

Our apartment was trashed, with holes in the walls, stained carpets, piles of garbage, and a film of dust, alcohol, and marijuana residue covering every surface. It was, in a weird way, a perversion of the mass-produced ideal “lifestyle” that marketers had worked so hard to promote to the parents of unsuspecting freshmen ready to sign their first lease. It was our own subconscious way of taking a big shit on the dreams of students escaping the dorms with the hope of living in some American Pie fantasy for the next three years -- For us, we individually watched this ideal die; specifically, it culminated in the death of my good friend and roommate due to his own arrogance and hubris. His father would tell me that he was too smart for his own good. I’d later tell my friends who were familiar with the classics that the guy had flown too close to the sun.

I have already written a lot about Jones in my journals and don’t really need to talk more about him here. Me wrapping my head around his death and its effects on my own toxic outlook on life are part of the original thesis: The justification of pursuing the corporate rat race, forgoing my dreams of becoming a writer or a teacher, and jumping through innumerable hoops (such as chemical burns on my scalp) to keep my internship. The point is, his death clearly affected me and one of these effects (aside from reaffirming my cliche’d disenchantment with the modern world) was this ridiculous survivor’s complex where I felt the overwhelming desire to be effective in a world that had killed off one of my closest friends. Clearly I’m projecting a lot of myself into Jones’ ghost. This aforementioned motivation was part of that. I needed to make it in my chosen path for Jones because he no longer had the choice to do so. It just so happened that my path was business.To make it as a businesser, you have to surrender at least a little bit of yourself to get a good job. I can’t think of a more iconic example of trait signaling in highly social primates than the rat race of American corporate culture. 

Unfortunately, to even compete, you sign away your agency to your HR representative and she determines if you can tick off the next credential on a reductive resume of disappointing and unfulfilling tasks. If I pass my drug test, I think I’ll add “doing cocaine two weeks before a hair follicle test and still getting the job” to the list. It’ll mean more than my BBA in economics, at least as far as problem solving and resiliency goes. Time will tell."

Actually, we weren’t technically dating (she would later point this out pretty staunchly) -- she was dating some christian hipster on the side and I eventually found out about it so she ghosted me completely -- and I was feeling pretty bleak about the situation and life in general Without going into too much detail, there were a number of fucked up things that I did in our relationship, most of which revolved around me having episodic issues with binge-drinking and picking fights with strangers. My mother’s solution to my relationship issues was to, of course, plan on going to law school and effectively improve my mate value in an obviously transaction driven system of interpersonal relationships.

 

Whether or not this was the right decision is irrelevant -- it just planted the idea in my head that you may need status if you want to keep your girlfriend from cucking you with some virgin hipster neckbeard.

 

Fast forward 10 days to May 14th and I’m driving back to Athens from my home town after visiting my family. By this point I’d basically accepted that I’d been beaten and wasn’t really trying to win Tori back to our toxic relationship, but I needed to go home to regather myself in a way that can only be done by returning to the nexus of your genetic origins and social ideologies. Which is really just a convoluted way of saying I missed my parents but my writing wouldn’t have much to offer if I wasn’t pedantic.

 

So there I am, pulling into our apartment complex, rounding the curve and accelerating up the hill towards our little duplex. It’s a hot day and you can see clearly the clearing between ours and the neighbors’ house where my dog’s piss and piles of pig shit (our neighbors were these racist farm boys from some backwoods Georgia county where the KKK was still relevant) had eroded the grass. As I get to the front of our house, I see a large number of cops parked outside, feeding in and out of our apartment. At first I assume it’s a drug raid since Jones (my roommate) frequently bought drugs on the Deepweb, but as I get out of my car it becomes increasingly apparent that something even more random and unfair than a no-knock drug raid had happened in our own little corner of carefree student life.

 

As I slowly approach our apartment, this bald guy intercepts me and asks me if I live there. I tell him I do and tells me that he’s a detective and that I need to come sit in his car with him. He gets right to the point and tells me,

    

“I’m sorry to be the one to tell you this, but someone’s passed away. Now, I need you to identify this person I’m about to show you on this phone. Can you do that for me?” I’m pretty shocked by the whole thing and feel this hyper-surreal haze setting in alongside a weird hollow fluttery feeling in my gut, like I’d been up all night on adderall writing a term paper. So I tell him, yeah, sure, I’ll identify the body, Why not?

    

So the guy whips out his standardized iPhone 5 and flips through some pictures and eventually gets to a picture of Jones’ bloated, discolored face with traces of white bile coming out of his partially open mouth. He didn’t look like he was sleeping at all, not even remotely. He looked like a corpse. Like the deadest and saddest casualty that society had to offer. If I was already seeing the world in a fugue of shock and then this threw me in a couple of layers deeper.

    “Do you know this person?”

    “Yes. That’s Jones. My roommate.” I don’t bother asking any questions since it’s pretty apparent what had happened.

    “Okay, so this is Harrison…” he writes something in a notebook and tells a nearby cop that he was in the wrong bedroom (for whatever reason he decided to die in Sam’s bedroom).

 

Long story short, Jones is dead and they suspect it was drug related. I don’t really know what to do with myself at this point. My neighbor, Taylor, who is a firefighter is out there and tells me that he heard the call on his radio that the apartment staff had found a body in apartment our apartment and was ready to kick the door in… but the coroner told him it wouldn’t have made a difference. I call Tori (who else was I going to call?) and she arrives pretty quickly and waits with me (for nothing in particular). Eventually we decided to take the dog on a walk and I try to get her to make out with me but she doesn’t want to given the circumstances. She eventually has to leave to go have dinner with her friend (not the dude she was two-timing me with) and I just sort of sat there outside the apartment, wondering what to do. Neither of my parents nor my surviving roommate answered their phone so I eventually just went inside and sat on our couch.

 

The police officers had completely rearranged our living room to get his body out of the apartment so I pushed the sectional back together and moved Jones’ unused bike back to its spot near the dog’s cage against the window. The apartment, like everything else that day, felt surreal, like I was seeing it through film or through several layers of a dream-scape (like inception). I go upstairs and look in all of the bedrooms and find Jones’ cell phone between Sam’s bed and the wall. I plug it in and go downstairs to the kitchen. There, I find poppy seeds in a pan on the stove. Jones, who was a biochemistry major and one of the brightest kids I knew, had prior to his death cooked poppy seeds to extract trace amounts of morphine to get high. With nothing better to do, I sit on the couch with Heidi and watch the Office. At some point I let my summer exec board from my student org know what happened and that I wouldn’t be able to make it to our evening meeting but otherwise the next two days are a blur.

 

As soon as my dad found out, he kept telling me leave the apartment. In fact, that was the number one piece of advice I got from everyone, to get out of the apartment. Go stay with friends, stay with Tori, stay with anyone. For reasons that I can’t explain, I felt the need to remain there. Maybe I felt like Jones needed a wake, a proper send off to the next life. Maybe I felt guilty leaving his spirit there alone since he’d already died there alone. Maybe I was annoyed at what a pig sty we’d let the house become and felt like I needed to clean it before leaving. Whatever the case may be, I had a certain morbid fixation with the apartment and didn’t want to leave. Even after the funeral, I was the only one in the house (aside from Jones’ ghost and Dog) and made a habit of drinking, watching Netflix, and occasionally wandering through the house calling out for “Jonesie” thinking I might just have a supernatural experience.

 

I didn’t of course. If anyone was going to encounter a restless spirit, it would have been me. Jones died tragically, a brilliant life taken from us far too soon, leaving a scorched swathe of grief and unanswered questions in his wake. But that’s the thing about this special brand of tragedy. Far too often it’s all in the heads of the people around the victim. Jones’ ghost didn’t exist as any lingering manifestation of his conscious mind. It existed as the romanticized memory of him, primarily on social media but also in the dialogues among his loved ones for the weeks and months following the funeral. So it might be accurate in a weird way to describe the house as “haunted” but I’m using this word even more abstractly than its meaning connotes. On the one hand, there was, of course, me; a drunken, comatose mess, essentially wallowing in the environment that led to his death. On the other, there was the environment itself. Our messy, poorly kept apartment, that was host to a very living and breathing Jones less than two weeks before.

 

For me, the apartment represented everything that I thought was wrong with modern consumerism and its failure to provide fulfilling lives to students. Here we were, at what was arguably the peak of human civilization, packed comfortably into little boxes, seated atop the paved ruin of what was once forest and grassland, juxtaposed to a convenient little dog park with a polluted stream and post industrial waste -- a mass manufactured “lifestyle” community created for students to comfortably drink away their parents’ tax advantaged 529a bank accounts. Here we were, living what should have been on paper damn near perfect lives, wallowing in existentialism, depression, anxiety, and contempt-for-materialism, watching ranks of vapid, superficial, B-list frat stars impress equally superficial chicks at the pool.

 

Our apartment was trashed, with holes in the walls, stained carpets, piles of garbage, and a film of dust, alcohol, and marijuana residue covering every surface. It was, in a weird way, a perversion of the mass-produced ideal “lifestyle” that marketers had worked so hard to promote to the parents of unsuspecting freshmen ready to sign their first lease. It was our own subconscious way of taking a big shit on the dreams of students escaping the dorms with the hope of living in some American Pie fantasy for the next three years -- For us, we individually watched this ideal die; specifically, it culminated in the death of my good friend and roommate due to his own arrogance and hubris. His father would tell me that he was too smart for his own good. I’d later tell my friends who were familiar with the classics that the guy had flown too close to the sun.

 

I have already written a lot about Jones in my journals and don’t really need to talk more about him here. Me wrapping my head around his death and its effects on my own toxic outlook on life are part of the original thesis: The justification of pursuing the corporate rat race, forgoing my dreams of becoming a writer or a teacher, and jumping through innumerable hoops (such as chemical burns on my scalp) to keep my internship. The point is, his death clearly affected me and one of these effects (aside from reaffirming my cliche’d disenchantment with the modern world) was this ridiculous survivor’s complex where I felt the overwhelming desire to be effective in a world that had killed off one of my closest friends. Clearly I’m projecting a lot of myself into Jones’ ghost. This aforementioned motivation was part of that. I needed to make it in my chosen path for Jones because he no longer had the choice to do so. It just so happened that my path was business.To make it as a businesser, you have to surrender at least a little bit of yourself to get a good job. I can’t think of a more iconic example of trait signalling in highly social primates than the rat race of American corporate culture.


Unfortunately, to even compete, you sign away your agency to your HR representative and she determines if you can tick off the next credential on a reductive resume of disappointing and unfulfilling tasks. If I pass my drug test, I think I’ll add “doing cocaine two weeks before a hair follicle test and still getting the job” to the list. It’ll mean more than my BBA in economics, at least as far as problem solving and resiliency goes. Time will tell."
4qdxc7,13,2016-06-29,"Girl I ""loved"" went to prom with the guy I supported throughout high school.",big_succes,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/4qdxc7/girl_i_loved_went_to_prom_with_the_guy_i/,"Title sums it up pretty well. Prepare for a good old wash of classic blue pill and the advent of a new, better beginning.

I didn't attach the flags for the purpose of letting people find them themselves. See the lessons learned for them.

Back in a couple years ago, I got a huge crush for a girl (we'll assume Rei) a few years below my grade. She was a 7/10 but had a 9/10 personality which sealed the deal for blue pill me. After asking her out and being rejected in my final year of high school, we became mutually acquainted with each other as we were mostly on the same clubs and had similar friend groups. Blue pill me had no issue with this, because he thought that he could change himself fast enough in the coming years before Rei graduated and turn it into something more than a friendship. 

Life went on as I went through first and second year university and began an overly-ambitious climb to the top. Unfortunately, I had extremely weak motivation despite how well positioned I was upon entering, and this turned into a rut throughout my next two years. I performed well by other's standards, but could not breach the top percentile which would secure the top positions in clubs and good internship positions. This rut continued till the end of this year, when I knew that if I was to make it into my top job choice, I would have to go all out. As summer rolled around, I had got most of my shit together - maintaining an adequate GPA and securing a decent internship position at a small business. 

Throughout those two years, I continued to talk to Rei, and my affections didn't waver. We texted daily at the least and at the most, hours on end. I became an emotional tampon that couldn't concentrate on my courses and the people around me. As both of those disappeared before my very eyes, I drew in deeper and became a complete wreck. I would wake up 4pm (effectively skipping all of my classes), eat, watch TV and game until the early hours of the morning. 

Around the same time, she introduced me to a guy in her grade (Jake) who was interested in my program. I was reluctant because I put in a shit ton of effort into getting into the program without the help of others; however, I was eventually convinced and helped the guy. On one occasion, she told him some of the private conversations we had about him, to which he revealed to me immediately. I immediately flipped on her and refused to talk to her, to which she apologized profusely. Old blue pill me forgave her the next day. Fast forward a couple of months, and I was helping the guy on a regular basis with his applications. Through exercised caution, we became good friends.

Last month, everything came crashing down, all in the span of a week. To begin, I failed to secure a summer job at a government position (a much better position for my desired occupation). I found out my grandmother had developed Parkinson's. My parents' marriage was falling apart, and I desperately fought to keep everyone together. A close friend and I split. 

Things didn't go well with her either. After asking her to hang out (we usually did this once or twice a summer), Rei agreed to a date. As we were both busy, I set it a week down the road; ""unfortunately"", she turned out to be busy with schoolwork, and we rescheduled. Surprisingly, she asked to reschedule just days after, citing that there was a end-of-the-year party for her grade. At this point, I knew that I had failed. I told her to pick her own date, and stopped talking to her. 

That week tested and rattled me, and amidst the pressure, I cracked. I felt a part of me slowly choke and die, and began vigorously researching and looking for help from my closest friends and the Internet. At the suggestion of a friend, I came upon this subreddit, which I devoured and used as a mantra for change. I began lifting, cut contact with everyone I deemed unworthy of my time and deleted all of my social media outlets (save Facebook, which I needed for work). The results were not immediate, but I had no where else to turn to, so I began a long lapse of monk mode. Eventually, my psyche and physical form improved; I gained some 10 lbs (with the help of creatine, that shit's great) in a month and slowly began improving my game by talking to random strangers. I haven't felt more confident and happy. I may still be blue-pill, but the only crime in this subreddit is to think that you don't need to change for the better. 

Last week was prom for the high schoolers. Amidst all the wild things during the after party, I found out that Rei and Jake went to prom together. The guy I guided into my program and genuinely cared for, because he reciprocated the attitude of a true bro. 

**I didn't feel a thing.**

So, what have we learned?

* Blue pilling yourself is literally the worst thing you can do. Blue pill isn't about blissful ignorance; it's about inflicting pain on yourself while staying blind.
* Don't EVER stay friends with a girl that rejects you. You will waste valuable time and resources that you can instead spend on yourself. My inaction cost me years. 
* Chasing girls is a sign of weakness and a tolerance for your inability to become a better self. When you become better and happier, that disappears because you know that you're the only one who can really affect your state of mind. People will chase you instead.
* Don't. Ever. Slack. In. School. Your lifetime rides on it.
* Scratch the back of others that will scratch yours, but never with girls. They see a mutual exchange as a sign of submission and weakness. 
* Forgiving people is an art. Make it too easy, and you're a pushover; make it too hard, and you'll push them away.
* Suffering and stress exist to test you and push you forward. If you seek it out, it will rarely, if ever, come to you.
* TRP is the best defense against failures, because it allows you to overcome your emotions and view situations objectively without bias. If you can remain stoic through the worst moments, you can only move up through your best moments.

Thanks TRP. I know a lot of people look down on this subreddit, that you've been through tough and trying times, but I appreciate everything that you've persevered through and have nothing but gratitude for putting me on the right path."

I'm a second year grad student getting my MBA at Oklahoma State University. I am currently doing a finance internship over the summer learning the basics on long term investing as well as trading. 

I have a couple of questions and if you guys could give any insight or share any experiences you have it would be helpful. 

1.) I haven't decided on a specific concentration yet and have set up my credits so that I have the option to pursue Marketing Analytics or Energy Finance. I could also get a general MBA if I decide not to choose a concentration. In terms of job security and market appeal, which one do you think is better?

2.) I realize this next question is highly dependent on the above question, but what kind of salary can I be expecting coming out of college with an MBA? I realize OSU isn't Harvard, but what value would you assume this degree ads?

Thanks for reading and any input would be appreciated. Go Pokes. "

My company is planning  to integrate a platform for intern communication and conferences (incl. external users). I'm currently evaluating the pro and cons between On Premise Skype4B and Cloud Skype4B (Skype4BOnline).

I already spoke to a consultant regarding pricing, licensing, etc., yet he just couldn't answer my question the way I needed them answered. Maybe you can help me out a bit. (And Microsoft's Page about Skype4B is pure horror in design y_y)

If I use Skype4B Online, all my conferences are getting hosted in the Office 365 Cloud which is accessible via Internet. Is it possible to use a localized call-number (for cost-save reasons) to enter the conference too? It's essentially the way WebEX and Go2Meeting handle this. If our american colleague hosts a meeting, I get a link and a localized number (I work in germany, so it's a +49), which I pay normal prizes for, instead of horrendous international connection-feas.

Thanks!

There's this girl I met in college about at the beginning of the fall semester who I thought was great and we clicked well, but nothing really happened since we couldn't really read each other. Then about a month ago when summer break started she began drunk texting me asking if I liked her and about how cute I was and how she couldn't read me, and etc. She was embarrassed about the whole thing and acted weird for a few days. After trying to clear things up with her, she said that she doesn't have the best track record with relationships and made a wide claim that all the guys she got involved with now hate her, and she likes me so much as a person she doesn't want me to hate her either. 

She was out of state for a month and now she's back so I hope I could successfully start something up with her. Communication was kind of slow between us the past month since she had no internet where she was in the country (nature internship). I told her that in my gut I still wanted to give us a shot and she said she'd be down for it. I'm just worried her mentality changed on the subject of us changed in the past month.

4qgus9,1,2016-06-29,My parents are separated but my father apparently still hangs around my narcissistic mother.,blastiaheart,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/4qgus9/my_parents_are_separated_but_my_father_apparently/,"Hello raised by narcissists. It's been a while.

I'm male, 27. And I have a question... but I don't come here often, so a quick little recap of my life.

My mother is munchausen by proxy kinda narcissist. Tried to pass me off as an asperger/autistic child. Got me into special classes. Got me into some shit ass places. Got me into a camp for mentally ill children to stay 3 days, amongst the severely mentally ill. 2 weeks per month, (1 week home, 1 week there) I was put into a center where I lived, amongst severly mentally ill children.

She took great pleasure in going to talks, support groups, cry crocodile tears, getting told she's so strong and it's so hard on her, etc... All I wanted was to live a normal life. I was groomed to be the fucked up, autistic child, so she could use me to get attention from doctors and support groups.

At some point I got the internet and found out that how I was treated was not normal. So as she was going to go talk to my teachers to whine some more, I said no, we're done with this shit. Seeing this was her occasion to realize something that made her drool so long, she took the chance: She could, like those mothers with real asperger, sick children, send me to the hospital and get all that sweet, sweet attention and pity from people.

Except no. You can't intern someone who isn't dangerous to himself or others... and especially someone with no real problems. Anyway she tried to bribe people into testifying against me in court they refused she lost. Went to live with a nice lady in a ressource for a while.

That was 9 years ago. I never had any problem with anyone I lived since then. I am now a Systems Administrator (IT stuff).
______

Anyway after these events she quickly left my father. She had nothing left there since I left, she never liked him, nor my sister. My sister was the golden child, but she is, like me, very intelligent, so we have no issues and can hang out. But, double cross me and I'll throw her out of my life no regrets.

Now I've made threads before (check my post history if interested) as how my sister still hangs out with my mom. That's understandable, but still a sweet sweet dream - my mother doesn't like her, she is a tool.

My father... I don't know the extent of their relationship, but they went to the circus together one time this month. They're keeping contact.

This woman might have loved him at some point, but they've been separated for at least 6 years, if not 8. Clearly she doesn't like him anymore.

We've had a talk long ago about her and how she is, and how she doesn't love anyone but herself. And yet, people keep going to her. They were not victims like I was, but they are tools to give her attention.

My sister said that my mother ""would apologize, but you (blastia) won't let her"". While I understand the logic would work in normal cases, here this is blaming the victim.

Why do they still... why don't they realize they're being used at best?

That woman did evil all her life. She used people. Got government grants that could have gone to other people who really needed it. By placing me into places for mentally ill kids, she took hold of ressources that could have gone to the real needy parents with real sick kids. Her actions had repercussions on society and negatively affected other people who could have used these ressources. She stole government money for mentally ill children, with lies.

There is nothing she has done to raise me. Nothing. I raised myself, 100% She taught me NOTHING, and everything she has done was meaningless. I rejected everything and built my own life.

This is clear. She is a liar, she is a thief, and yet, they do not realize it. They do not look back and realize that 1: what she has done to me was meaningless and has done nothing to help me, because I have no problem. The proof of that is how my life turned around immediatly when I was taken from her. 2: That was she has done was essentially holding up ressources that should have gone to other people who really needed them, since giving them to me wouldn't have changed anything.

Thank you."
4qh0e1,58,2016-06-29,On Finding A Mentor,M1ster_MeeSeeks,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/4qh0e1/on_finding_a_mentor/,"**Summary: Guide on Finding a Mentor. It is by no means comprehensive but can be helpful for moving in that direction.**

I'm an expert at what I do. In my small niche, there might be 1,000 people in the world who are at a similar level or better. I have found maybe 50 I know are definitely better and many people at my level are hard to find.

There are many things crucial to getting great at something. A lot of it is common sense, even if it isn't easy: work hard, stay focused, be relentless, the list could go on.

One thing often overlooked is the value of a mentor. I've served as one to over 50 people in my field, potentially over 100 across a few areas in aggregate

The nice thing about TRP is we all, more or less, exchange information and act as mentors and students of each other. Applying this to the rest of the world is important as well.

**History**

The Internet didn't exist when I was born, or at least what the modern Internet can be called today. Before this, information was not nearly as accessible and you had to find success through other channels.

One of my all time favorite stories was of John D. Rockefeller and his quest for his first job/mentor. At 16, he walked every day down from the woods and into the town, donning the only suit he owned and carrying a skillset that only consisted of reading and basic bookkeeping. He knocked on every door and requested a meeting with the owner/manager. This carried on for months, as he tried every single day to find someone who would hire him. His father was a traveling snake oil salesman and he was to support the family. Ultimately, he landed a job and the journey began. For his whole life, he celebrated his Job Day more than his birthday.

This type of mentality and societal structure can be found everywhere. Being a blacksmith apprentice, an understudy in theater, an intern, you name it. Warren Buffett found his mentor at by reading his book and later went to study under him at Columbia. This cannot be overstated for how important it is for your development. Just because everything is on the Internet today does not mean that these types of relationships aren't crucial to your development.

**You Are More Transparent Than You Think You Are**

How easy is it to fake an interest in lifting? You can't. You wear your physique on your sleeves, your attendance record is noted at the gym, and your knowledge of how to lift is going to be very apparent to anyone simply observing you for 5 seconds.

Let's get one thing straight. If someone is good enough to be considered your mentor in anything, they see right through you. They know the difference between hard work and bullshit. They can sense Taker mentalities better than a shark senses blood in the water (I'm referencing Atlas Shrugged here, the Takers). You cannot and will not be able to be clever enough to trick them into accessing their resources without substantial organic effort on your part. I might even go so far as to say con men can't even trick experts in their own fields. You can't con someone into losing a game of chess or performing medically unnecessary surgery that could cost them their license.

I'm perhaps more blunt than average, but I made people incredibly uncomfortable to the point of avoiding me if they tried to get something out of me. I will give and give and give all day long to someone who shares my enthusiasm for something. But try to take it from me? Not a chance. I can promise you the higher you go up the food chain in whatever field you choose, this will become even more polarized. I can be forgiving to beginners, but I also don't have time to teach them 10,000 hours of theory and applied practice.

And don't think we don't notice progress. Even a modicum of effort at the beginning will be rewarded, but zero effort is nothing more than an insult. Have some personal integrity and stop watching TV for an afternoon, pick up a book, and let's talk about it tomorrow.

**Benefits**

Short-term thinking will lead you to treat a mentor as a way to get resources. To get yourself in front of other people, to be invited to events, etc. You not only need to stop that mentality, you need to turn down the majority of the offers for these invites. There should never be a question why you're in touch with a mentor. It is to learn from them. If they sense Taker mentality then you are going to end up ostracized, and you may not even realize it at first.

If you treat the mentor relationship properly, you will find accelerated growth in what you love as an inevitability. They know the shortcuts, the books you need to read, the people you need to talk to, and the experiences that are formative in your development. You can find all of this on the Internet, for the most part, but it's going to take you a hell of a lot longer. And since we're not talking about weekend task, but a lifelong goal of mastery, this is crucial.

**How to Find One**

This is not discussed anywhere that I've found, at least not regularly. Sure, mentors are great, but how can you possibly find one? Or the right one?

It helps to know exactly what you want and need. ""I like business"" is not a very useful realization, but ""I'm passionate about starting a food truck"" is. You can look up food trucks in the area and call them all up - or better yet - call up the ones you think do it properly. Who has the best food? The hottest women making the food? Best marketing? You get the idea.

Another thing to realize is you won't be able to meet the best in the world. At least not for a long time. Don't call up Bill Gates and ask him whether you should code in Python or Javascript. There are probably 10 people you know personally who can answer that and you also can figure it out easily on the Internet. The mismatch of seeking out a 9/10 or 10/10 expert and asking things about 2/10 and 3/10 difficulty is really a display of laziness.

My sweet spot is to find people who are one level below the top in the world - call it the Chief Investment Officer at Blackrock, for example - and reach out based on a television interview you saw. I guarantee you hundreds if not thousands saw the same interview, but since he isn't Warren Buffett, he's not likely to get much fan mail from the outside world. Internally at their organizations they have people trying to kiss ass to move up within the company. Outsiders have a better chance of getting their attention.

**How to Reach Out**

Most of this is self explanatory. You should be sufficiently advanced in your field to know what your interests and opinions are about things. And you should be able to back them up.

One example I have is being in touch with a billionaire. I called him out on his work after he made the front page of the WSJ. By that I mean I criticized him and detailed why. I now have his personal email address and communicate with him when I have something to share. We aren't friends, he's not a mentor, but I do get responses. Some of the information I get from those communications provides new insights I wouldn't get elsewhere.

Just a with TRP, be firm in what you stand for and believe in. Don't just praise someone for who they are or what they've accomplished. You can let them know you admire their work, but don't go overboard.

**Lessons Learned**:

* Mentors are invaluable

* Don't bullshit someone you'd want as a mentor

* People notice progress and the lack thereof, don't make excuses

* Go for attainable mentors rather than the elite

* Know what you're after and supplement your own personal growth with help from an expert in your field

* Rockefeller became Rockefeller for a reason. One of his most formative experiences happened due to an effective mentor

I started working 45 hours a week as an IT intern two months ago and then part time sales associate on the weekends where I've worked for 7 months now. I was making good money and relatively well mentally. I used to have problems with depression and anxiety after a concussion in high school but they both were no more. 

Then thursday something snapped. I had a coffee (super sensitive to caffeine as it is) and then an energy drink and had a panic attack, worst one I've ever had. Sweating, mind racing, nausea, the works. Told my boss I had to leave then missed work friday as well. Was having panic attacks all weekend so I saw my doctor. He told me I have anxiety, my mom and quite a few others in my family do too. He prescribed 10mg of Celexa, refereed me to a psychologist, and told me to take time off the full time job. I left the internship because I wasn't enjoying it anyway but I still feel pretty bad. 

I'm still getting panic attacks here and there though not as bad. I don't really want to do anything. Don't have as much interest in my hobbies as before, I'm still nauseous like all the time, and all I can think about is working this weekend even though it's a super short shift and before this happened I loved that job. 

I'm thinking it was just the tipping point as since I started that job I had been eating out every single day, hadn't gone to the gym in weeks, and was in an office all day. However it just blows my mind that I literally went from pretty ok to an anxious mess within the course of 3 hours and I can't seem to shake it. "

. I'm a 21 year old student who just got a summer internship at home making $12.50 an hour paid bi-weekly. After looking at my first couple pay stubs, I realized I was getting taxed a ridiculous amount(Gross pay was $1131.25 and only took home $824.99). After researching /PF and getting hounded by my girlfriend I decided to correct my W-4, but wound up more confused with the IRS withholding calculator telling my to claim 7 exemptions and everyone else telling me to claim 1. 

From reading the other posts I understand now that by claiming 1 on my W-4 I will be withheld less and eventually get most of it back on my return, but my question now is how can I minimize my return/income withheld without claiming 7 on my W-4?

tl;dr How do I minimize the amount of income withheld/my tax return without lying to IRS if I claim 1 on my W-4?"

4qhvkf,2,2016-06-29,Relapsing after a year... moving forward,AmorbulousCras,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/4qhvkf/relapsing_after_a_year_moving_forward/,"After a [year streak](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/3r0qmw/a_one_year_streak_a_report_of_my_findings_and/) I relapsed. It's hard to write that, honestly, because I thought I had gotten rid of the addiction. As much as I want to blame something else, anything else, I can't. *This was all my fault.* Now I need to keep moving forward and inspect myself. How had I gotten myself back to this point? Looking at myself as I was at the relapse, it was very easy to see. 

Before I get started, I had told my NoFap Whatsapp group that I would post my post-relapse analysis here because it was becoming too long for a Whatsapp post. If you are interested in listening in, please continue reading the post, just in case there's something worthwhile to you. I'll try to keep this short.

I'll start the story with this: **BAH HUMBUG**. 

The short version of the story: The weather got rather hot, and I had convinced myself that I should sleep naked due to some vague recollection that improves your health or pore or something like that. The next day I had urges, big ones too, and I was totally thrown out of wack. I hadn't felt such a drive to PMO in such a long time. I suffered two full days like that, and on the third day I relapsed. Each day I got closer and closer to porn. One day I edged, another I looked at pictures, and the final one I took one little peak at a video and I was stuck in that loop. A little later, I had a relapse. The biggest shame: *I thought I could handle it.* What a classic, novice blunder!

This relapse wasn't entirely caused by sleeping naked however, and it was a long time coming. As I love to say to myself, PMO is a terrible solution to a much deeper problem. Slowly but surely I had been gradually bringing back the problems that had messed with me so much: **namely loneliness and laziness**. 

At the moment I am lonely. The girlfriend I got during my glorious streak lives across the country right now, along with the rest of my family. The friend I spent the most time with in Oregon had left my graduate program to live at home again. My roommate had moved out because he had a internship for the summer. I'm an introvert, so although I have many acquantainces, I keep very few close friends. So this hit me harder than it might have hit someone else.

At the moment I am lazy. I'm stuck in a period of uncertainty with my PhD program. It's not like I'm going to fail out, but I have no idea what to do for my dissertation topic. The rules I had established to keep myself from PMO had been eroded away by pride. Each good habit was stripped away from me sneakily due to various circumstances and I didn't pick them up again. I watched shows that pushed my sexualized limits. I had gotten back to thinking about sex occasionally... no it was definitely more than occasionally. More like all the time. Now that I recognize as a full regression back to my PMO days. It was also the summer, so I didn't want to do anything productive.

These two main reasons caused me to regress back to my PMO state. *You have to expend some effort to float, otherwise you will drown.* I was back to drowning.

A side note - this experience, most notably the gradual but almost complete loss of my anti-PMO habits, has proved to me that fighting an addiction like this cannot be fought alone. I should have had someone else watching out for me, so that when the wool of pride was placed over my eyes, I would have still had someone to cover my back. Furthermore, that means I should spend a lot more time on this subreddit.

Another tangent - I was constantly in flux with routine. I never stabilized my routine and so it never developed into a habit to replace my current mode of thinking. Find a rountine that works and stick with it. Don't change it much like I was doing (for experimentation and flexibility, I'd tell myself).

One might expect that a relapse at this certain point would be incredibly painful. It is, to my pride, which definitely deserves a lot more abuse for how its treated me. I have learned through my struggles that panic and despair only cause harm and should be avoided at all costs. I have not forgotten that, thank God.

Instead, this relapse caused me to bounce back. It feels almost like a *reawakening*. After my relapse, my mind and body jumped back into well practiced anti-PMO actions. I know the darkness that is PMO addiction and I refuse to be dragged back in. I now know the actual extent of things I had lost to PMO - true confidence, love, happiness, appreciation/gratefulness, to name some - and I refuse to lose them again. I didn't really lose much with this relapse, one relapse will barely do it, but it was a warning: *Shape up, or I'm coming back.*

Here's my plan: at the moment I will temporarily solve both issues by keeping myself intentionally busy and social. This will give me some breathing room to get to the bottom of my current issues and solve them. For instance, I have decided to start a garden in the tiny little plot of land I call the 'backyard' of my apartment. I have already weeded the plot (there were a ton of weeds) and I have added more topsoil. I am just finalizing the plants that I will put in there, some herbs for tea I think, and the next step is planting. Actually doing these things has already put me into a better mindset. Now that I don't have to worry about the urges as much, I can look internally and try to figure out a good daily routine for myself and **STICK TO IT**. **NEVER LET IT GO** How are you supposed to heal yourself when it takes all of your strength to fight the urges? The best way to win is to find a temporary solution to deal with them and then make yourself stronger so you can deal with them better, all the while looking for the magical permanent solution (which will require maintenance, its not like you'll never have to worry about PMO ever again, as my experience has shown).

 As a further countermeasure, I have turned off my internet in my apartment to give myself some breathing room to build a new rountine. I must say, I am rather productive with no internet! Instead of internet, I have been reading, writing this post for reddit, writing letters to my girlfriend, and working on my PhD work. While I engage in this gratifying work, I will work further to fix the true me so what has happened today won't happen again. To me it means turning further to the teachings of my Russian Orthodox faith to heal my soul.

So in review, I lost a streak of over a year because I didn't maintain my habits and anti-PMO state of mind. Gradually, all of the problems that I believe caused my addiction came back. Instead of despair, this relapse served to wake me up and set me straight. I am now working to do things right, so I can get past this addiction.

**LEARN FROM MY MISTAKE.**

I have been struggling with depression and anxiety for a while but it has gotten really bad since ive come back to school this summer (co-op rotation so just finished a 4 month internship then came back to school in may). I have gone to a therapist and I have sort of lied about how much I struggle with thoughts of suicide. Lately I have turned to a friend but talking with her helps sometimes in the moment but after words I feel really shitty because I feel like I am bringing her down and just having a negative impact on her life and I really don't want that. My other friends know that I am struggling but I am scared to tell them too much because I feel like I am just being selfish and needy by telling them my problems and bring them down. The thoughts have been super strong lately I have a meeting with my therapist on Friday and I am just trying to hold out until then. I am really sorry for just blabbing on but I just feel so helpless and like I am going to give in soon and that scares me because I don't think I want to die but my mind just keeps going back to that so sometimes it feels like that is just what I should do. Also I am 20 now and thought I was asexual up until this point but recently I developed some feelings for a girl that one of my best friends recently started dating. I also think of her as one of my best friends and I've told him that I like her and i've been trying to tell her for the last couple weeks but no time ever seems right because either I have too much school work, she has friends over, or she is just busy so I am starting to think I just shouldn't tell her. I am really sorry and thanks for reading if you made it this far I just really needed to write this down and hopefully get some feedback if not oh well."
4qihj8,100,2016-06-29,Turnip's girlfriend,RaptorsRevenge,neckbeardstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/neckbeardstories/comments/4qihj8/turnips_girlfriend/,"More about my weird ex roommate, Turnip.

Turnip's weird family situation and asshole father:  https://redd.it/4qbo32

About his relationship with food: https://redd.it/4oduh2

And, how I ended up in this hellhole apartment: https://redd.it/4nylqw

Some insight into Turnip's financial situation: https://redd.it/4ovm11

And Turnip is loud https://redd.it/4ow0o3

On Saturdays, I would be done with my internship by noon, and I had nothing on Sundays.  On warm and dry summer days, I'd plant myself in a park then and work on my degree or the data entry work I had.  When the weather didn't cooperate, I'd retreat to the apartment.  The communcal area was small, had the fridge and microwave to one side, and on the other a futon.  As the married couple left for the weekends (and the other roomate was rarely home) I normally would sit there and work off of a folding table.

I got used to the sight of Turnip leaving around 5 on Saturdays.  It was the one time he wasn't wearing his basketball shorts and tshirt combos.  Instead, he had one ""good"" outfit of khakhis and a button up shirt.  I theorized this was given to him specifically so he had one nice dress up outfit, confirmed when his parents sent him a gift of a similar outfit regularly.  This seemed to be growing in size to meet Turnip's increasing girth.  (the old one, of course, went in the trash)

These Saturday nights were dressed up because Turnip was going to dinner with his family.  His family being fairly well to do meant they took him to eat at rather nice restaurants around town.  

I would hear about these later, as Sunday was one of the two days his girlfriend would visit.  He would sit at his computer, not even looking at her, while she sat on her hands on his bed, looking downcast.  A major part of this visit was Turnip retelling his girlfriend everything about dinner the night before.  Who said what, what the gossip was, and most importantly, who ate what.  This was explained in great detail and a fair amount of condescending.  ""That was served au jus.  Do you know what au jus means?"" and then going into detail even if she said she knew the term.

(He also would know, to freakish detail, exactly how much eat dish ordered cost.  He seemed to gloat when he ordered a more expensive meal than his siblings.  This didn't surprise me too much, as I once made the mistake of asking if he wanted anything from a take out place, as I was buying myself dinner and could grab his food as well.  He agonized over the take out menu ""Market rates, do you know how much that is now?"" trying to find the most expensive meal.  Then, he was shocked when I asked him for payment—he had assumed I would foot the bill for his dinner.)

..

The weirder point of him relating all of this to his girlfriend was that she obviously wasn't invited along.  In fact, I later found out she had never even met his family, despite them dating for 4 years at this point.  So she would hear play by plays of how Uncle Joe only ordered the soup and the gossip was he had recently had a DUI but Aunt Susan covered up for it, without having a single face to put to names.

His girlfriend seemed to just stare off, making little nodding agreement noises as he talked.  She was a timid thing, rather round, no makeup, glasses, hair in a ponytail, constant worried expression. I'll call her Mouse.  She would come to visit him twice a week, the aforementioned Sunday visits, and Wednesday evenings.  Each visit would mean she cleaned his room while he played or browsed online, dusting everything, sweeping, and putting fresh sheets on his bed.  Her visits always ended with two trips down the stairs.  The first was to empty his garbage can.  The second was with a bulging bag of his laundry.  Mouse would return the next time with the laundry washed and folded, impressive considering she took the bus to and from the apartment.

All of this Turnip found reason to criticize.  She was attempting to dust his computer while he was using it.  He didn't like the scent of the detergent she used.  She was being too loud, or he didn't like some aspect of her appearance (usually her nose, which he ripped on constantly)

...

From where I usually sat on the futon, Turnip would be barely visible, just the back of his head through the open door and Mouse sitting staring off into the far distance. They even ate like this, always take out from downstairs that Mouse would fetch, him eating at his computer, back to her.  She sitting on the bed behind him. Turnip's voice would just pierce through normal earbuds as he berated Mouse.  Regularly, he would yell at her for seemingly no reason, or in response to something that was out of her control.  She often left near tears.

She would bring along a wedding book occasionally, and leave it open across Turnip's bed along with open wedding magazines.  It was incredibly obvious when I would walk through the room.  Still, I never saw her talk about it, it just sat there as though she was hoping it would interest Turnip.  When it didn't, she would take it along with the laundry at the end of the evening.  Still, she referred to Turnip as her ""fiancé"".  There was no ring, and Turnip would at best call her his girlfriend.

Early on, I informed Turnip that I could make myself scarce if Mouse wanted to spend the night.  He acted horrified and slightly taken aback.  Of course Mouse would NEVER spend the night.  That was apparently so far off the table as to be impossible.

...

I honestly had very little interaction with them as a couple except for those observations.  Occasionally, I would try to talk to Mouse.  She basically didn't make eye contact, and would be polite, but seemed rather worried during our discussions, shooting glances towards Turnip the whole time.  Eventually, I just started having super platonic two sentence conversations with her.  Lovely weather, isn't it?  The construction certainly is blocking everything off, traffic reroutes are really bad.  That sort of thing.

They broke up while I was there, and probably was the thing that encouraged it.  I feel no remorse for ending the abuse.  I'll write that episode up next time."
4qilat,1,2016-06-29,Does he want out?,ctinavang23,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/4qilat/does_he_want_out/,"I (21F) have been in a relationship for 7 years with my fiance (22M). Just got engaged 3 months ago. The first 6 years have been beautiful, healthy, and the best years he's given me. But lately we've been rocky. Every relationship comes with some rocks and boulders. Our 7th year we started seeing each other a lot more because he transferred to my school. He got to know the education program there and really thought it was a good solid program. So he decided to transfer knowing that I went there and bc it was close to work. 

The fall semester started off great and amazing, I loved my new job and my internship and most of the classes that I was taking. On top of that I was living on campus by myself and my bf attended the same university! Woo hoo life couldn't have gotten much better! So much freedom and everything was going great! But while seeing my bf every day you just start to see all their flaws and imperfections and you start to nag and bicker at each other ( happens with everyone you live with, you start to see each other for who they really are bc you see them everyday) normal right? Right. I start my internship at school and more people start to get to know me and my bf. I start feeling I was better than him bc I was becoming more successful and more confident about myself. So I felt like he couldnt be where I was and it was hard always trying to wait for him to keep up with everything. I knew it was my fault for making him feel so low as he was adjusting to the new environment. Surprisingly his favorite rap artist came to do a concert our school and we decided to go together. The day of the concert which was in the middle of the semester (midterms) there was a Q and A meet with the artist earlier that day. During the meet I had said something that really ticked him off by accident and afterwards we got into a fight. In my mind I was telling myself that I was so tired of him being immature and that I could do so much better than him. But knowing me I knew that was a lie I was telling myself bc he's a great man that I'd regret losing so I asked for space instead. For him, he took it as breaking up so he provoked me to just break up with him and as I'm just asking for space he tells me he won't leave unless I just break up with him. He believed that was what I really wanted and that I shouldn't try to pretend that I still wanted to be with him. I knew he was really hurt but he made me really angry when I was simply just asking for space to breathe. Eventually, I ended things with him so he could get out of my apartment. I needed to finish a paper so I could join him at the concert. But with things the way they were I was in the idk box.

So instead of doing my paper I was so bothered and not able to think clearly I cried and fell asleep instead. I wake up right before the concert only to find that he had told his family on facebokk that we broke up and asked if anyone wanted to join him fkr the concert. Me being furious that he told his family (the break up was not intended for the his family or the world to know) I originally wanted space just so he could leave me alone but ended things instead bc he wouldn't leave me alone. Advice to everyone, never tell your family about personal issues that can be easily resolved between you and ur SO. I called him and ended up going to the concert together bc cmon my favorite rap artist is out there too. After the concert didn't talk with him for days.

We communicated that we wouldn't stay together. My feelings for him were numbed after the incident. I couldn't find any love for him bc I despised him so much (my fault here). After a couple weeks feelings were stirred again but I told him that we shouldn't get back together until the semester ended. I was falling behind and had stop going to class after our break up. I needed to focus on school. Turns out I couldn't focus bc my life suddenly went hay wire after the break up. For 6years I functioned life with him and I just couldn't do it. The semester ended with failing grades. Thanksgiving and Christmas wasn't the same anymore with our families. We still saw each other but we weren't together. Only his family knew about us. I didn't share anything about him to my family bc that was my way of protecting his image and reputation while on his part his family was an army against me for the whole break up. :(

New year comes and we decide that we will get back together. I'm quite close with one of his sisters so I decided to share what actually happened between him and I during the fall and everything k had went through. I gained weight, I had depression, always late to work, suicidal, slept alot and failed my classes. she responded very well and we were able to bond. As I'm still recovering from last semester I decided to go through some counseling through the school which didn't help much. The spring semester was worst. I had several extra curricular activities going on in my life, my sister and my best friend were getting married (2 separate weddings), me bring a maid of honor putting together showers, and me falling behind in class again. He proposed literally five days before my best friends wedding (extremely bad timing) and in the middle of mid terms. The proposal was terrible (I was in my underwear, wtf?) and his sister chose the ring (a ring that was not my taste). I was devastated. He had one chance and he blew it. If anything I ateast wanted a ring that I'd like. We got it exchanged and his family got all pissrd about it. He went and shared the news about us to his sisters and his sisters gossiped and literally tore my image and my confidence apart. They took his side and his story without hearing mine. I felt like the whole world was against me. I ended up talking it out with his sister whom I was close with but ended up hearing hurtful things and words out in my mouth. I was betrayed, hurt, and devastated. I was suicidal, depressed, and smxfjksmzsls. 

After a while things settled down and I started seeing his family again since I wasn't a shady person. Then his dad is in the hospital and due to circumstances and obligations I wasnt able to come visit so his family sees it as I don't care and that I'm making my fiance choose me over them... 

So fuck yeah I feel unloved... when he chooses to listen to his family over me fuck yeah I feel alone and hurt bc his family did me dirty. I became a monster that I didn't even know about. After a few weeks things start to settle down and I'm still trying heal and get back up and then his family goes and hit me back down with their words and gossip and then pretend to be nice people in front of me. I feel like he didn't protect me and I feel unwelcomed into the family. 

So through out all of this the person I turned to the most was him the very person who hurt me the most by sharing things he shouldn't have shared to his family. Now that his family is on his side (most families tend to take their own family members side) hes okay that theyre saying all these things about me and he doesn't give a fuck about protecting me or comforting me. He tells me that if I really love him I'd go and make peace with his family. Da fuck!? I didn't do anything to his family and I have to go apologize and make peace!? ????? And me being me went and did it bc I valued our relationship and was willing to sacrifice my own pride. So things are a little better.

Currently, we still argue over the same silly things and I often bring back up things he did to hirt me bc I am struggling to heal and get over things. It seems like he's had enough of it and he avoids seeing me, spending time with me, and doesn't really respond to me anymore. I always feel like it's my fault. I know I should stop making him feel bad but I have a really hard time forgiving him. His dad is currently back in the hospital due to fevers after his surgery. I'm trying to be understanding that he needs space to focus on his dad and family but his family did me really dirty and so I have a hard time being okay when he leaves me and shuts me off over his family matters. 

So my question is, should I just give him space and stop making him feel bad or should i just leave the relationship and call off the engagement? Im at a point where I'm not even excited to get married anymore if it means being a part of that family. I love his family and I'm forgiving of them. But I'm still trying to heal and move on. It really hurts that I always have to break down my pride for him...we both apologized and asked for forgiveness so sometimes I feel like I'm always the one who always brings up his faults... yet at the same time he was really a jerk for continuously doing that to me for more than half a year with his family. So as he's ignoring me and not paying attention to my needs, does he want out? I'm telling myself that hes just focusing on his dad but he doesn't normally ignore me. :/ I don't want to make him feel like he has to choose me over his dad/family. But I also know that he wouldn't be ignoring me in the midst of all of this. Usually he'd seek me for comfort and support which I actually have given him this entire time. So why does he continue to ignore me? He wants out? Or should I step out bc I'm a human being too , relationships work both ways"
4qirdp,1,2016-06-29,I [28F] cannot get over my crush [27M] after he kind of rejected me five weeks ago.,wienerdogadmirer,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4qirdp/i_28f_cannot_get_over_my_crush_27m_after_he_kind/,"I met my crush in grad school in January, but we did not really start talking or hanging out until May. I just saw him as a nice person for a while because he helped me with some school related stuff, but after we started talking, it did not take much time for me to develop feelings for him.

One night we went out for drinks at a bar in my neighbourhood. I was still studying in school when he texted, but went to see him because he was leaving the city in a week or so. He has an internship in another state, and is spending the next semester abroad.

I just could not tell what was going on in his mind because we had hung out before and texted, he never flirted in an obvious way. So I asked, ""Have you been flirting with me"" and he said, ""I was wondering the same thing."" I also asked if he was attracted to me and he responded ""I think you are attractive."" It was awkward.

After we got home, we texted each other. I suggested that we stay friends and he responded, ""I am 100% ok with the idea, but is it me or your phrasing making it sound like a ultimatum?""

Next day, I wanted to hang out with him. So I called and asked if he wanted to come over later that night. He was about to leave for volunteer work, so he said he'd call or text after his shift. He texted later politely saying he was tired and wanted to stay home. I was disappointed, but understood. That night, I asked him for help with my paper since he distracted me from my schoolwork that week. He agreed and helped edit it online after I sent him the draft the next day. I appreciated his help and wrote in an email something like ""I know you are busy, but I would like to see you for coffee and sweets before you leave."" It was Monday. He did not reply and left the city the following Saturday.

I was very sad, and did not contact him for three weeks. When I texted him, he acted as if nothing had happened between us and we texted each other for an hour or so. It has been two weeks and since we talked last time and he has not initiated any contact. I feel like I got rejected and need to move on, but I cannot. What would you do if you were in my shoes?


**tl;dr**: I cannot get over my crush. Should I try to cut contact with him?"

Describe your first day at the firm.",hideouts,hideouts,https://www.reddit.com/r/hideouts/comments/4qjara/wp_you_are_an_entry_level_employee_at_permacorp_a/,"The kid who approached my car couldn't have been older than 15. His curly black hair was too long to satisfy company regulations, and that vest could've been picked up in any random thrift store. He stuck out his palm expectantly as I rolled down the window.

""Aren't you a little too young to be a valet parker?"" I asked, fishing for my keys.

He blew his bangs out of his eyes. ""True. But I ain't too young to be an intern!"" The kid drew a knife from underneath his vest and lunged at me. I slammed on the accelerator and shot into the parking garage, forcing him to let go of my car. Just to make sure the kid couldn't catch up, I sped all the way up to the rooftop parking area. My heart was still pounding when I stumbled through the glass doors, into the PermaCorp lobby.

""Welcome to PermaCorp!"" The receptionist gave me a polished smile. The nametag on her blouse read ""Molly.""

""Listen, you've got to help me."" Panting, I collapsed onto the marble counter. ""Some kid just tried to kill me out there.""

""Oh, you must be new here!"" Molly flipped through a notepad. ""Are you the intern Bollard hired?""

""Yes!"" What did that have to do with anything? ""But what about the kid? You need to lock this place down or something.""

""It must be nice to receive an internship for such a prestigious position straight out of college."" Her tone dripped with venom, and she began rummaging through her drawers. ""I wish I had been granted the same opportunity."" Molly rose to her feet, the malice in her eyes prompting me to back away. ""Better late than never.""

A gunshot rang out, and I dove to my left, slamming onto the ground. Bullets ricocheted off the floor, inches from my head, as I crawled to the door ahead of me. Any competent gunman would've filled my body with the entire round; as luck would have it, Molly did not fall into this category. The gunshots stopped as I swung the door open and fell forward into the hallway. From behind the glass pane, I heard her curse; apparently, she didn't know how to reload.

At this point, it would've been more prudent of me to run from this building and never look back, but I really needed employment, and two random murderers weren't enough to deter me from this job quite yet. According to the map posted on the wall, Bollard was a floor down. Thankfully, nobody else confronted me on my way there. 

""Bollard,"" I gasped, barging into his office, ""people have been trying to kill me since I've gotten here.""

""Ah, sorry about that."" Bollard swiveled around in his chair and stroked his chin. ""I neglected to inform you of the company policy: here at PermaCorp, you can take another person's job if you manage to kill them!""

""That's fucked up!"" I kicked the doorframe angrily. ""Sorry. I'm going to have to resign before that happens. Just tell me how to get out of here without getting murdered.""

""I'm afraid you can't quit."" Bollard jumped on top of his desk, sending papers flying. ""You see, I've become weary of the pressure that comes with high-level administration,"" he said, unsheathing a letter opener, ""and I've been looking for a lower-level opening. If you'll just hold still...""

Bollard's heavy footsteps thundered behind me as I took off down the hallway. There was no way I'd get out of this place on my own; I just needed to find somewhere safe to call the police and bide my time until they arrived. Ahead of me loomed my haven: a single-occupancy bathroom. 

""Could've knocked."" I jumped backwards, banging my head against the door. Before me stood a janitor, attacking the tiled wall with a scrub brush. To my relief, he was both fully-clothed and unarmed.

""You're not going to try and kill me, are you?"" His hair was gray, and he looked pretty scrawny. I could probably take him on, unless his mop turned into a sword, or he had some lethal chemical spray in his cart.

""Nah, I like my job."" He held out his hand. ""Name's Ted.""

It could have been a trap, so I didn't bother shaking it. ""If you're not gonna play the 'kill someone to advance' game, why would you bother working here?"" 

Ted shrugged. I shook my head. His nonchalance was suspicious. ""Aren't you scared that you'll be murdered?""

He turned back to his tiles and resumed scrubbing. ""Nope. Nobody's ever tried to kill me. Why would they want my job?""

Five minutes later, I admired my reflection in the small bathroom mirror. The blue uniform looked good on me. All I needed to do now was wash out the bloodstains.

4qjay7,6,2016-06-29,Does my enjoying the problems on the P exam indicate I would like being an actuary?,Uncleverrambler,actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/4qjay7/does_my_enjoying_the_problems_on_the_p_exam/,"Hi all,

I am currently an undergraduate student studying math and computer science. This year I took a couple of probability courses and talked to a few people on the path to being actuaries, which inspired me to look into it for myself. 

Specifically, I have been looking at exam P material and practice exams since I am fairly well prepared to pass that exam, so I am thinking of signing up for the September test in the hopes that it could help me get an actuarial internship next summer.

So far I have found that I love doing the problems on the P test and enjoy the kind of critical thinking the problems involve. Unfortunately though I've read in a few places that the exams are one of those ""take these and then once you pass you just forget about it"" kind of things. So, I was wondering, if I enjoy the material on the P exam, would that suggest I may enjoy being an actuary? Or does it mean jackshit? If not, what's the best way to predict if you would enjoy the job?"

I am diagnosed ADHD, but soon realized during course of first-year of law school that I may not have been ADHD and I was just using stimulants basically because law made me miserable and I needed security (come from broken struggling single mother home)

I had one of the best positions my first summer as a Summer Associate making good money with my own office, but I wasn't happy, I was miserable and when I found my current gf, it was the first time I ever felt I was worth anything. She genuinely cared for me and I did for her. She knew I was struggling, as I knew she was also struggling (recently home from rehab for opiate problem), but we fought passionately and loved passionately and fought for each other. 

The end of my second year of law school, I was so bad with Adderall I couldn't sit still in a classroom and she was the one who pointed it out and I knew I needed to do something about it. I went and got help for my insane anxiety (thinking it stemmed from law school and Adderall IR which probably combination of both unhealthy relationship and unhealthy career decision). I would spend any amount of money scholarship/loans just to take care of her and I going through process with no direction, unexpectedly I earned an opportunity to intern at the WH. I immediately knew I had to clean up my act and got Lexapro 10 MG for my anxiety/depression and suddenly everything turned around. I was handling my responsibilities and I was able to lead the way and show her the world even though she still struggled. She quit her job and move to DC with me for the summer, cooked cleaned and took care of me like a perfect woman (although my mother and I had to foot the entire expense of rent, food, etc. but I was going anyway so that wasn't her fault).

We came home the third year and it was the easiest year of law school that I was able to take a less potent ADHD medication (Vyvanse) and coast through an easy year, spending most of my time with her, working out enjoying each other, and having fun. I felt my resume was decent enough, I didn't have to push as hard, so we coasted the entire third year together. Right when finals  rolled around at the end of the year, my family started brawling with me as if me being happy and healthy was a problem, but they claimed I didn't realize how much ground I was losing but coasting a whole year or realizing I was possibly being taken advantage of? 

Got back on my Adderall for finals and it was like a lightbulb moment (confirms I have ADHD to some extend I guess). I wasn't able to take things seriously that I should have and didn't know what or were the problem was in my routine, forgetting that I been on Lexapro for so long and forgot even why. Over the course of time, I became more and more lethargic and was losing ground almost everywhere, I walked into interviews and didn't even get phone  calls back.. I started suspecting that maybe things weren't as great as I thought they were (she comes from a broken home as well and her step father is a prick who tries to push them all out of the house and charges them for almost everything, no secret she found comfort with me here for so long).

So when it was time to lock down for the bar exam, he was pushing for me to move out with her and I wasnt stabilized yet to do so so I said no and we had a war, words were said that broke any bond I had with that family because I lost it and felt like I worked too hard to answer to anyone or be pressured when I gotta pass the exam. 

She got worse as if I had to make a move as soon as possible pleading with me and saying I ruined her life and I still couldn't figure out what she was talking about. All I remember in the beginning was we both struggled and I wanted to try to be her white knight and show her a good life, my school gave me a bar check to study with and I spent that money going out with her every weekend and not worrying about the exam, ultimately I failed the Feb bar. Here I am now, barely any money, sitting a second time in 28 days, and she acts different, looks different, almost like she's finally sober. When I try to even hint that I tried to save her, she lashes out and says she never had a problem.. I sacrificed my entire career almost for this girl and now she can care less about what I do and claims I abandoned her by taking my Adderall medication prescribed to me and just focusing on this test and not going out, yet how do you expect me to go out without money, I freelance for bills but that's not much. I have job interviews with campaigns, NFL teams, and other firms and she doesn't even seem excited anymore. 

If I'm indeed not ADHD and missing something that everyone else sees (hinted that I was gay and didn't realize it etc. yet I've always been attracted to women so I don't know where that came from), but I'm just trying to survive at this point. She hates who I am on the meds, but takes advantage of me when I'm off of them (even tho happier). 

Just venting, thanks for reading."

I've been researching universities for CE/CS that also have solid stuff with graphics, I haven't been able to find out too much in detail, but in-state I've narrowed it down UCSD, UCLA, UCSB, and UCB. Rather clueless about out-of-state (would consider going out of state if it's really good). With this said, I have a few questions that I'd greatly appreciate anyone answering:

2. If not undergrad, what would be good graduate programs for graphics? 
3. What are some general tips for me to dip my toes into a graphics career? (what to build onto my coding repertoire, what internship or research opportunities to be on the look out for, etc)

Updates on my current situation
 
Thank you all for your help and advice. I've had so many kind people both on and offline helping me and trying to make sure I'm okay. 

Still trying to find homes for the kitties. My mom threatened SPECIFICALLY that they would drain my account of money, and verbalized that even the money I placed in there myself via work was theirs because I *owe* them (keeping in mind I never had asked to borrow money, and any they lended me as a dependent child was given of their own volition with the understanding that it was for my use). I went to the bank yesterday and took out the money I have so far from my summer internship. I haven't taken out the rest yet, leaving about $300 in the account so as to not tip the boat any further than it already will prior to my getting my pets and things out of the house. The bank lady was really nice and wonderful and helped me change over my direct deposit from work to the new account &lt;3

Meanwhile, I got my mother to agree to send a text specifying that they would not drop financial support of me within the next two weeks at the least. She obviously kicked up a fuss at my insistence and got very angry, and when finally sending it tried to be as vague as possible. ""we won't withdraw your support"" until I requested that she specify financial support, insurances, etc. 

As for financial aid I called my school's office. I was told that while under 24 I am considered a dependent and that's kinda fixed but I haven't found much on that online and think it might either be misinformation or easily circumvented by other means. 

TAXES/FAFSA! 
Filled out part of the FAFSA on my phone and plan to fill out the rest when I get in to work tomorrow morning. Since I am at risk of being homeless or of transient living situation, it sounds like I will be able to bypass including my parents financials based on the form so far, BUT as they never taught me about taxes and tax returns I never filed and have no idea how that works... I think they were claiming me on their taxes. Are there ways to find out the tax return info about me independently or should I just put that I didn't file since I'm pretty sure they claimed me anyways? Since I wasn't allowed by them to get a job until this summer will that affect my likelihood of obtaining financial aid? 
Do I include my merit scholarship (which is an award from the school, and never has to be paid back) as income? 
Due to the homeless question, evidently I won't be able to officially submit FAFSA until an agent reviews it and determines that I have special circumstances. Anyone go through this? What are your experiences? Do I have to contact one or once I try to submit the FAFSA do they contact me instead? Is it... like... someone in my financial aid office or someone government-y? 

I think there's some sort of deadline coming up tomorrow/today for FAFSA based on the website but the agent at my FA office said I could file it any time... Which is right? do I have time to go by my school on Friday and talk to an agent in person and have them walk me through it or no? 

Finally, I talked to my boss and got Friday off to head home early and take care of things. Everyone at work has been very very understanding, and my boss has told me that if I need more time to just let him know. 

Update 2:

Filled out FAFSA the rest of the way this morning and called the financial aid office at my school. They won't be able to continue on their end until they process the application next week. Looks like I'll be needing at the very minimum written witness describing and verifying my situation in order for them to take the ""in risk of being homeless"" thing seriously. Asked oldest brother (who has also been recently threatened by parents but lives with his girlfriend and is independent from them) to do this and he's not sure he wants to risk himself that way. "

**Background:**

""Can we rebuild him?""

""Not only that, but we can *improve* him.""

[Alec Tuttle](https://www.reddit.com/r/WhoWouldWinVerse/comments/3j5sql/respect_king/) was as good as dead. He had taken the initiative and attempted to steal a journalists interviews with countless metahumans. Unfortunately for him the journalist was secretly a member of [Lupus-Armstrong](https://www.reddit.com/r/WhoWouldWinVerse/comments/3jpt8c/respect_lupusarmstrong/) and soon after giving the tape recorder containing the interviews to King, he pressed a hidden detonator and [blew the entire city block off the map.](https://www.reddit.com/r/WhoWouldWinVerse/comments/3mp60h/a_journalist_looking_for_metahumans_to_interview/cvh1ltd) Unknown to the rest of the world, though, LA agents recovered what was left of King, and in keeping with their research on metahuman abilities, experimented on what was left of him, keeping him alive with their sinister science. They believed that by enhancing his abilities with cybernetics, they could create a loyal cyborg assassin which could be used to increase their world influence.

The man heading this research was one Fredric Keller, a brilliant metahuman and cybernetics expert and one of LA's top scientists. He was a cruel man, and did anything to progress his research, no matter the damage to Alec's mind. As a result, after almost five years, Alec was reduced to a rage-filled ghost of his former self with no memory of his past life. Afraid that he would damage himself and realizing how close to completion the project was, Keller placed an experimental device in Alec. This device allowed anyone who wore a special bracelet total control over Alec's actions through the use of mental commands. His transformation into mindless cyborg assassin complete, Alec was dubbed ""Tyrant"", and LA was ready to begin their reign of terror.

Then disaster struck, and Clive Cole caused the destruction of Lupus Armstrong, damaging Tyrant in the process. Keller escaped the destruction of the base and, with a small cadre of followers, set up a secret lab in a ruined district of Chicago. Now with less resources, it took some time to repair the damaged Tyrant, but eventually Keller was ready once again to take back what was his. His first target was Clive Cole, but once again something would go wrong before his plans came to fruition. One of Keller's best proteges, a young scientist named Norman, went into the lab late at night and stole Tyrant's control bracelet. Norman resented Keller's position as leader and believed he could do much more with Tyrant's abilities than right old wrongs. That night, he blew up the base and fled into the night with Tyrant. Unbeknownst to him however, he wouldn't make it far...

**Description/Artwork:**

[Tyrant is a cyborg](http://imgur.com/IqbUWYQ), and has had almost his entire body replaced by machine. Underneath his helmet is what remains of his charred face, a wisp of golden hair and a single blind eye all that is left of the once attractive boy's visage. His cybernetic body is sleek and streamlined, designed for maximum stealth and efficiency. His voice with his helmet on is modulated, sounding deep and robotic. Without, his voice is raspy and deathly quiet, a testament to how little of his actual body remains.

His robot body stands 5' 11'' tall and weighs 200 lbs.

**Alignment/Attitude:**

Tyrant is a chaotic evil *villain*. Unable to remember even his real name, all Tyrant has left are fleeting remnants of his past self. For reasons unknown he attempts to maintain an air of calm during conversation, though it may seem robotic in nature due to his voice. Despite this, he suffers from bouts of extreme rage, and underneath it all is his ever present compulsion to steal.

**Intentions and Tier Listing:**

Tyrant will be used both for RP and stories.

Tyrant sits in *Delta Tier*.

****

#**Powers:**

**Cybernetic Body:**

Tyrant's body has been almost entirely replaced with cybernetics, leaving only parts of his head intact.

*Enhanced Survivability:*

Tyrant is capable of surviving massive damage to his frame. So long as most of his head is intact and he hastily retreats to make repairs, he is capable of survival.

*Enhanced Computation, HUD, and Combat Prediction:*

Complex computer algorithms, prediction technology, improved optics, and a combination of Alec's enhanced brain confer a massive increase in reaction times. As a result, he has 1 ms reaction times. However, once he perceives a threat his psychic powers massively overload his body's speed, increasing his reactions to 800 microseconds.

This also includes his enhanced senses, which include 10x human hearing, the ability to magnify his vision up to 15x, and special vision modes like thermal and night vision. Unfortunately, Tyrant is unable to smell.

*Cybernetic Immunity:*

As most of his body is robotic, Alec is immune to biological hazards and does not need to eat or drink, instead being powered by a special reactor, designed by Keller, inside his chest. The schematics for this reactor are programmed into his brain, and he can replace them.

Tyrant's body is immune to electromagnetic pulses and resistant to electricity attacks. In addition, he cannot be hacked, because his brain is still mostly human.

Tyrant is resistant to temperatures between -10 C and 2000C

**Psychic Powers:**

Alec was granted psychic abilities by the white event, and much of LA's research went into taking Alec's psychic powers and focusing them internally and amplifying them. As a result, Alec's powers have been increased massively at the cost of some of their functionality.

*Teleportation &amp; Spacial Awareness:*

Tyrant's signature ability, it allows him to teleport anywhere he can see or has been to before within 1 mile of his current location. He can choose whether to maintain momentum or not, and cannot teleport inside solid objects or people. Tyrant can teleport as fast as he can think, or approximately 1200 times every second. He cannot bring others with him when teleporting, but can bring objects up to 250 tons.

In addition, Tyrant has spacial awareness out to 200 meters of himself, able to detect projectiles as small as grains of sand. Within this field he can tell if someone is a White Event metahuman or not, but is unable to tell what their powers are. 

*Psychic Defense Matrix:*

Tyrant's psychic internalization has caused a sort of 'psychic energy field' to surround him and protect him from mind reading.

Tyrant is immune to in tier mind reading and telepathy, seemingly invisible to people using these powers.

*Psy-Sabers:*

Added to the agenda by a plucky intern who wanted Tyrant to have ""cool weapons"", the Psy-Sabers are blades manifested of Psychic energy. They can be [created](http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/powerlisting/images/f/fe/Galvatron_Energon_Sword.gif/revision/latest?cb=20151031170814) in Tyrant's hands (a process which takes 2 ms).

The blades in conjunction with his speed hit with 35 GPa of cutting power and are near indestructible.

The blades glow purple, can be made anywhere from 5 to 48 inches long.

**Enhanced Physicals:**

For simplicity, Tyrant's physicals will be listed here since they are derived from both of his powers:

*Strength:*

1 ton overhead.

Due to his speed his striking strength is 50 tons.

*Speed:*

Travel:~100 mph

Combat: Due to his psychic powers sending his body into an accelerated state during combat, Tyrant has mach 5.5 combat speed, and it takes him 2 ft to reach that speed.

*Durability:*

It takes ~1 MJ, .5 MN, or 100 MPa to seriously damage Tyrant's frame. Anything less is not significant and can be mostly ignored.

****

**Weakness:**

* Unable to smell.

* Has lost most of his memory and is partially insane, and could therefore be manipulated.

* There is an implant in his brain which, by the use of a specific remote, can be used to control him.

* Has very low durability for his tier.

* Is unable to bring people with him when teleporting.

4qke0z,15,2016-06-30,"Me [22 F] with my boyfriend [25 M] 1.5 years, can't seem to forgive him for past bad behavior. Am I in the wrong here?",nestheart,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4qke0z/me_22_f_with_my_boyfriend_25_m_15_years_cant_seem/,"I met my boyfriend in the summer of 2014 during a study abroad in Asia, he had a long-time girlfriend at the time. After we developed feelings for each other, he broke it off with her. I went back to my home country with no real plan for our relationship but we kept in touch every single day, and I came back for another 3 months internship that winter and we started dating. During those months before I came the first time he seemed to ""shop around"" and met with his ex, previous ex, and a girl he used to like, but we were not dating or exclusive and he didn't even know if I was going to be able to come back to his country so I guess I can't be angry about that. 

After that trip (we got along great, so in love) I went home for a few months, spent another summer with him again, went home for another few months, and then finally ended up taking a job in his country and moving here in December to be with him.

The second time we were apart (after we started dating), I found out later he met a girl (a ""new friend"" from his school club) without telling me about it, and during that summer while I was in his country, he ditched me one Saturday night to buy her an expensive dinner and take her for coffee. He claimed this was all platonic, and that it's his country's culture to take good care of and buy meals for juniors, and that she was nothing more than a friend. I know him and I really felt that this relationship and the way he responded to it was suspicious, but after bringing it up lots of times and him denying that he had any feelings for her, there really wasn't anything else to talk about. 

He also acted kind of shady that summer in that he wouldn't list my name on his facebook profile as his girlfriend, wouldn't want me to be in any social situations around his friends, etc. His initial excuse was that in his country dating a white girl is really rare and he didn't want his guy friends asking him what our sex life was like and stuff like that. He admitted this year that he actually didn't want his ex girlfriend and her friends to see my page, the page of the girl that he dumped her for, which made me feel pretty bad and like a dirty secret.

Anyway, after moving here last December he's been absolutely perfect. He's completely devoted to me, he takes great care of me, introduced me to his friends, and every other great thing you can imagine.

The problem is, I can't seem to let go of those insensitive indiscretions from last year. I constantly worry that he likes someone else, and feel bitter about what happened last year.

I snooped in his facebook (I know I know, it was wrong, clearly there is something wrong with our relationship and my trust if I felt the need to do that), and I confirmed exactly what I thought. He was the one pursuing this girl, inviting her out for lunches and talking in a flirty way, and searching for her name an obscene number of times. He lied to my face and told me that it was a platonic friendship and that he never invited her out, she always did, and clearly this wasn't true. But this was a year ago and things have changed since then, am I wrong to feel bitter about it?

I can't stop feeling angry and worrying about this. I feel that he betrayed me once and is capable of doing it again. I also keep feeling jealous about his past dating history (this may stem from the fact that this is my first relationship and he has had several LTRs) and wishing there was no one else but me and I could be his only love.

Am a ruining a currently good thing by being hung up on bad things that happened in the past?
   
**tl;dr**: Boyfriend flirted with another girl last year while we were long distance, can't seem to forget it and keep feeling angry about it. Was is a small deal that I should forgive and move on, am I being crazy for hanging on to this in order to protect myself?"

Hi everyone,

This is actually interesting. All true. Have a read.

Please let me share some more information about my life. It will help me and at the same time you can give me consolation and advice.

Ever since I was young I had a strong sense that God was with me and he wanted something of my life.

I came from a poor background with an illiterate parent. My mum had a vision from St Anthony and then I got a full scholarship to an elite private school. I didn't do that we'll but got into university. Then I applied to study on exchange in America and was rejected. Then I ended up going on exchange for free and getting into Harvard. Graduate school as an undergrad on exchange. Thus was unbelievable as my marks were bad. God did this, guess how I found out about the opportunity? I clicked on a subject about John Paul II.

One day it was raining in Boston and I ran I to a building. It was the career centre. I randomly asked about an internship in banking in London. The lady said a random person had offered to help the next person who came get an internship in her investment bank. I was offered the job. In the meantime it was bought by Goldman Sachs. I had the best internship in my Australian university.

I got a Job at Goldman Sachs in NYC as a trader. I was an arrogant so and so so I was fired after a year. Then life ended. I worked in back office roles and I think had a nervous breakdown. After 10 years I moved back to Australia.

Then he'll happened. My mother had a mental illness (I was living with her) and she was very violent. I was bashed in the head multiple times. When I called the ambulance to help I was arrested. This lasted for four years. I was bashed, had concussion every month and even nearly made homeless and lost my house.

God helped though:

One day I was in the train and prayed to God. I was very upset with him. Then suddenly there was an email to go to a Harvard event. There I met someone who works with NASA and started a company with him. We were going to provide medical products to astronauts and private space travellers. I worked really really hard. Hired employees, got an investor on board and some huge customers including airlines and sports teams. Then after three years - 2 weeks before taking on the investment. He abandoned me.

Why? Not my fault at all. It took a while to negociate a contract because his lawyer made a lot of mistakes. His lawyer was really dumb and misinterpreted things I had said. Like really dumb things and made me look obstructive. This was all false. It finally got agreed and we just had to set up the company to get the investment. The company was valued at $4million.

There was another person from Nasa in the company who called me straight away. He told me that the company was worth $4million and I had done nothing wrong. He even put $200,000 of his own money into the company. But the other guy just angrily said he was going.

summary

So there it is. It's hard.

I know that I can do really great things in this world.

There is no excuse. If I can get into Harvard, get a world class job at Goldman Sachs as a trader and create a private space travel company for billionaires - I have to use these talents.

I had visions and things that showed God's acts in what happened.

So what to do now?

Whenever I take a normal job I get depressed and literally have a nervous breakdown. I've tried it. There is no point as I fail.

I'm best when I am setting up businesses and doing great things. I have access to investors and can get in front of big people to negociate deals.

It is as if God won't let me settle and forces me to push for big things. Everything is either really bad (getting bashed every night by mum) or really good (securing a Billionaire private space client).

what I will do

Ok. The last thing I am doing that hasn't fallen apart is we are setting up a Chinese investment fund with some friends. This is not a long term career. It doesn't give me the credibility to influence the world like private space travel does.

What does God want me to do? I want to change the world for the better. I really really do. I also am intellectually capable. Every time I give up God does something to showe I can do it.

All I need is a solid thing that I am doing that gives me the credibility to do real things in the world, like run for politics."

Fairfax County, Va., Police said Kathleen Capitano of Shallotte, N.C., was charged with four felony counts of using communication systems to facilitate an offense against a child.
Capitano was arrested Saturday afternoon at a Herndon, Va., hotel, where she planned to meet the boy, police said. Capitano first met him in 2015, while working as a student teacher at a Herndon elementary school, according to police and school officials.
Fairfax County Public Schools spokesman John Torre told The Associated Press that Capitano was an intern teacher  in 2014-15.
The Washington Post reported that investigators had met with the 13-year-old and his parents before Capitano arrived for the planned meeting.
Brunswick County, N.C., schools spokeswoman Jessica Swencki said Capitano had been placed on paid leave from her job as a middle school math teacher.

I've been home brewing for a number of years, and have had friends in bigger breweries come let me ""intern"" for a few days here and there so I have a good grasp of what I'm doing.  I'm worried that breweries might be at ""peak beer"", so that has me interested in the distilling scene.

I know Minnesota has a lot of distilleries already, but do you think there's room for more?  I've been to 2 of their taprooms and thought they were pretty nice, does /r/minnesota have any thoughts on the better ones, and what they like and dislike?  What about ones without taprooms?

Sure, maybe I'll get jokes or comments about my voice or hearing but I've got a thick-skin and I wouldn't call it ""discrimination"" because I guess I've just been lucky enough to only interact with decent human beings.

Quick backstory, I'm fully deaf in one ear and partially deaf in the other and I've got a hearing dog who I consider basically necessary for me to function safely. I moved to a new city and subleased an apartment for an internship. I specifically looked for a ""dog-friendly"" apartment to keep things less complicated, and the person I leased from mistakenly thought her building was dog friendly because it is packed full of them, but it technically wasn't. It was too late to find a different one so I just handed over my service animal prescription and signed the lease. Everything was working out fine, until I met one of my housemates.  

I have three roommates, two of them live at home and one stays every Sunday once a week. Let's call her ""April"". Literally my first interaction with her was her trying to trick me into telling the office I had a pet dog (because she assumed it was a pet), getting fined a couple hundred dollars and kicked out with nowhere to live. Even after I told her it was a service animal, she still told me with no politeness how inconvenient it was for her and how I shouldn't be allowed to sublease there. She's tried to trick me into paying bills that aren't mine and even kicked my dog too! What really made me make a reddit and get on here was an incident that happened today.

One of my roommates came in for a surprise visit yesterday and found dog hair on her bed. The dog hair floated up there because it's so short and I had already planned on washing her sheets for her when I was told she was moving back in. I actually don't even let the dog into the bedroom for just this reason. She didn't say anything to me and was quite nice. Then today I got a text from April, I don't know why SHE sent anything considering she isn't even the person I'm subleasing from or the person who's stuff got hairy, and it said this:
""I coming back on the XXX expect all of XXX's clothes, bedding and all of her stuff to be washed and cleaned of hair. It was very disrespectful of you to let that happen in the first place, and it cannot happen again. This goes for the rest of the apartment as well. It is more our apartment than yours, even though we are basically letting you have it all to yourself. It is very sad that we even have to ask you to respect our space by keeping it clean. If this is not done by then I will have you removed""

I had actually already gotten a nice text from the first girl telling me to please wash her sheets, which is totally fine, but I don't know what April's problem is! I already checked and she can't ""have me removed"" even if my service animal actually breaks something. On top of that I pay exactly as much rent as everybody else so it is all equally our space! In fact, I'm the only one paying the utilities that April uses one day a week! I don't know what she expects me to do, telekinetically prevent dog hair from falling off of my dog? preemptively wash the sheets and sweep the whole house every six hours in case someone drops by unannounced? I clean every Friday and I have no problem doing it earlier if I am asked to, but I'm no psychic. 

I just want to block her number and pretend she doesn't exist. What am I supposed to do?

too long didn't read: crappy roommate keeps trying to get me kicked out of the apartment for having a service animal. Advice?"

For the last couple years I’ve been slowly dying in mind, body and soul. Sure, I could still function, but something that happened because of a misunderstanding between The Musician and me has nearly destroyed me.


It all happened so slowly. I didn’t even notice it. In July 2000 I went off Zoloft, thinking I didn’t need it anymore. That decision nearly killed me.


From July 2000 to December 2001 I coasted downward so slowly I didn’t even realize what was happening. I started working a lot and I constantly kept busy so I wouldn’t have to think. Needless to say it caught up with me.


I got to a point where I just didn’t care what happened to me anymore. I started sleeping more and longer. Sometimes getting out of bed was difficult.


I was working at (my college newspaper) the whole time when I saw my writing get worse. Sometimes I blew off assignments. My heart just wasn’t in it anymore. I had become that 7-year-old girl again who was convinced nobody loved her. I’ve always had problems with depression, but no one ever knew it, not even me.


I sometimes longed to die, or at least be badly injured. I got angry and irritable, while pushing everyone I knew and loved away before they had a chance to leave me. I started skipping class so I could sleep, and I noticed I was having trouble concentrating. Mom worried but knew she could do nothing. When I came home from a night class in early January, I couldn’t stop sobbing. I knew I needed someone to help me, so I decided to help myself.


The painful scars from those years of self-neglect still remain but are slowly healing. I’m writing again and am nearly done with my internship. Pretty soon I’ll start job-hunting and finish my last year of college...


*This is from an old journal entry. I'm posting it because I want people to know my story and understand you are not alone. I was here once too. Things changed in my life, and I don't deal with depression, anxiety or panic attacks anymore. But I used to, and I understand what that hell is like. This entry is about my relapse going off meds the wrong way. I'm off meds now and have been for 12 years, but that's another story.*"

4qni93,0,2016-06-30,Brexit: 5 Steps for Young People to Remain in the EU,sjbeale,brexit,https://www.reddit.com/r/brexit/comments/4qni93/brexit_5_steps_for_young_people_to_remain_in_the/,"After Brexit, steps for young people to remain in the EU are most definitely at the top of many people's minds. Given the UK EU referendum results, many young people have been left with the question mark of what to do next to remain part of the European Union.

Below are 5 steps young people can take today to remain part of the European Union in various different ways.

#1. Sign the petition for a second referendum.

Hopefully, about this and what it is asking for, namely to hold a second EU referendum in the UK given the turnout was below 75% and the result was less than a 60% majority. 


The petitioners recently hit four million signatures and it is by far the biggest petition in history of online government petitions in the UK.


Despite mixed parliamentary responses to it , it is still the most direct form of action you can take in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result.


Remember that you need to confirm your email address before your signature is validated on the petition so make sure you check it clicked the link and it will all be done.

You can also share this via social media with all your friends and email even people who you think voted to leave because they might have changed their minds, a feeling now known as ‘bregret’.


#2. Ask your MP to block the Brexit in the House of Commons through Breentry.

Referendums are not legally binding in the UK and a vote to agree to the UK leaving the European Union is likely to go through the House of Commons. Sign the petition to ask your MP to do all that they can to democratically block any votes or motions on Brexit. 

Concentrated targeting of MPs can have a huge impact on the outcome of a vote as all MPs should be representing their constituents before all else. One website that has come into being in the last few days is Breentry, which allows people to email a pre-written message to the local MP in seconds.


This is a very easy and direct solution and is strongly recommended if you feel passionately about the remain vote or potentially trying to stop the UK leaving the European Union. This can help to target enough MPs to show them that their constituents do not want Brexit to happen.

If you are not sure who your MP is, it will tell you this by simply clicking on the area you live in from the drop down list on the web page.  Make sure you share on social media with the most popular hashtags at the moment, such as #Brexit, #breentry, #eurefresults, #farage and any others that you see fit.


#3. Investigate heritage or naturalised citizenship options either for the EU or other friendly countries.

If you feel that the Brexit it is very likely to happen and that you are planning to live abroad anyway you may want to start looking into visas for other potential countries.

The Irish Embassy has already received a massive upsurge in British citizens looking to become Irish citizen through the visa process. With the Scottish looking to go independent of the United Kingdom in a likely referendum result in the future , there may also be the option of going for a Scottish citizenship or passport even in the near future.


If you plan to live in an EU country, Germany appears to be a safe bet given the strength of its economy, development of its industries and infrastructure and also its democratic ways and lesser corruption than many other countries in Europe. Germany is also appealing for students of engineering given its reputation in the field.

Although countries such as Spain, Portugal and Italy are appealing for both their weather and culture, massive amounts of bureaucracy and corruption are definite elements that may disrupt anyone planning to become a citizen in those countries.

That is not to say that you should not do it, simply that it is a part of life in those countries, coming from someone who has lived in both Spain (2 years) and Italy (1 year).


#4. Start learning the language of your chosen country if you want to leave.

This is a natural continuation from the above point about moving to another country in Europe (excluding Ireland). But be aware that most countries will require a minimum language level and will likely ask you to . This is something that is also required for People moving to the UK. 

You will probably want to familiarise yourself with the CEFR, Common European Framework of Reference.  This has all language levels across the board from almost zero to native-speaker like fluency.


If you find out online the level that you need you can start to learn that language today in preparation for your move. Obviously, this may seem like a bold step but in many ways it should not be as big a deal as it appears that you will still have the movement to travel around 27 EU countries.

It is also likely that favourable terms with the UK will be agreed for EU citizens given its continuing role in Europe regardless of any political events in the near future.

Websites like Quizlet and Linguistadores are 2 very useful resources to start you learning a language from scratch.  You may also be interested in the book Fluent in 3 Months what details and intensive language learning method for any language.  


Another thing you can do is to find language meet ups in your area to start having three and informal conversations and chat on a regular basis to improve your spoken level in that language.

If you have no experience of language learning, do not be afraid!  If you have learnt English as a baby, you can learn a language as an adult. In fact, it is a common misconception that children learn languages with more ease than adults. 

More accurate is that children are used to trying and failing and simply learning from this without judging it to be a negative, where as adults are afraid to try and therefore do not fail quickly and do not learn in the same way. 

Motivation to get started is also key, so if you can master up that motivation to learn a language you are well on your way to making it happen.


#5. Apply for an internship or Erasmus programme in your chosen EU country.

Internships not only give you practical experience in a professional field, but they also allow you the opportunity to live and work abroad in the country that you may feel suits you. There are many, many or internship opportunities available and although they do not pay, if anything at all. 

However, the cost of living in most European countries is cheaper than the UK, despite the drop in the pound to Euro exchange rate since the Brexit.


These internships may not be available in two years time and they may also be no longer offered do British citizens prior to the Brexit happening. Therefore, it is key that if this is something that appeals to you, start making enquiries about it today as time will move fast and you will need to organise your life in order to be able to make that move.

There are many websites which cater specifically to finding internships in other EU countries and helping people to do this. If you are at university, Erasmus is a fully funded exchange program that can also allow you to travel and study  in the European Union while also progressing with your degree. 

Again, this will serve to give you not only the experience in Europe but also boost in your language level and it will allow you to have a build up contacts and referees for your chosen country.  

Regardless whether you do an internship or take part in the Erasmus programme, if you decide to work in that country in the future, having a professional referee from that area will provide you with a reference. This will give you a major boost in your job applications in future and provide confidence for you to look to getting a job there.

#Summary 

If you have any questions about any of the points above, follow me on Twitter @stephenbeale and ask directly and hopefully I will be able to help. I have lived as mentioned above, in Italy, Spain and Indonesia and so have a combined experience of six years of living abroad.


Although the Brexit result means a massive change in the way we view our UK citizenship, it does not mean that all doors are closed. There are many things you can do to positively respond to the situation and worrying is definitely not one of them.

Taking immediate and direct action is the only way for you to feel better. With the possibility of Brexit, steps for young people to remain in the EU are needed and you can do this! You simply need to get out and start getting proactive about it and keep smiling , after all, things will work out!

4qnrs7,117,2016-06-30,Flirting on the DV Docket,princessofsalt,talesfromthelaw,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthelaw/comments/4qnrs7/flirting_on_the_dv_docket/,"I just found this subreddit and I am so excited! I have been reading stories here for a few hours now and I want to give my own.


So I am an unpaid intern for a public defenders office in a pretty big county. I work under an Assistant Public Defender in misdemeanor court.  The interns' jobs there are basically to check people in who arrive for cases, give them the paper work to get assigned to the PD office if they aren't already, fill out client interview forms and go over police reports with clients. Pretty basic stuff but it is cool because we get one on one interaction with clients.

So on a particular day of the week we have Domestic Violence Docket day. So I check this guy in who is there for a pretrial on a DV and a malicious destruction of property charge. I take him into one of the conference rooms with his file to go over the police report.


I introduce myself and explain I'm an intern. He immediately calls me sweetheart and goes in for a strong handshake. I remind him of my name (this doesn't stop him from calling me sweetheart the entire time) and explain the charges against him and ask if he understands what that means. He says he understands and talks my ear off for 5 minutes about how he would never put his hands on a woman, the allegations are ridiculous, she is a lying bitch, and she's a whore. This is the typical speech we get from guys accused of DV. I explain to him not to worry, that he doesn't have to convince me he didn't anything wrong, and that I'm just here to help him out. But he continues to talk about how if, for example, I were his girl he would treat me so well. This made me uncomfortable.


I hand him the police report to read, which essentially accuses him of bleaching all the complaining witness' clothes and grabbing her by the hair and pushing her into a wall during the subsequent argument.  He reads the police report and tells me that everything in the report is false and tells me how much his girlfriend hurt his feelings by accusing him of such a thing. Then he asks me if I could put her in hail for filing a false police report, to which I said that 1. We are the public defenders office so we don't put people in jail and 2. He would need to go talk to the police about that. 


So it sounds to me like this guy wants to plead not guilty. But, just to clarify I decide to ask him what happened in his words. He then admits to me that he did, in fact, bleach her clothes because ""his boys"" said she was sleeping with another guy. Then he admits he ""might have pulled her hair a little"" but says that ""I don't even get why I got in trouble for that! I didn't leave a mark on her or anything!"" I explain that you don't need to leave a mark to get charged with domestic violence and that her cheating on him doesn't really affect the charges.


He then says ""well its not like she's going to testify against me. We are gonna get back together!"" Considering he has a no contact order with her in place, I advised the client to cease contact with her and not say this on the stand. But since she won't testify, the case will be dismissed if it goes to trial. I tell him his options are to plead not guilty and it will be dismissed if she doesn't show up or see if the prosecution will offer offer a plea deal. He says he will absolutely not admit guilty to a crime he didn't commit (even though he just said he did commit it). I ask him if he wants a bench trial or a jury trial and he decides bench trial and continues to vent to me about how much of about cunt she is. 


After he finished with his sexist slurs, I told him to go wait for his name to be called and we will set a bench trial. 


Before I left the room, he told me I have beautiful eyes and looked nice in my skirt. Then he winked at me. 


As he was leaving the court room later that day, he handed me what he referred to as ""his card"" if I wanted to ever meet up with him again. He gave me and business card with just his name and phone number with no actual business on it. 



Needless to say, I didn't call him."
4qnxuj,10,2016-06-30,[Story] Life is a series of problems and examinations – But don’t give up!,Helenavonvalsa,GetMotivated,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/4qnxuj/story_life_is_a_series_of_problems_and/,"I wrote an essay because my thoughts needed to get on paper. And I want to motivate others not to give up despite all the hardships.

Tomorrow is my first day as consultant. It still feels unreal to me and until yesterday I couldn’t really enjoy the fact that the times of meagre wages are over. In a couple of weeks my SO and I will be moving into our dream apartment and we hope that our cat will love it too. I count the days when I can finally bid my neighbours from hell goodbye because we will be living in a rooftop apartment far, far away from those sort of people, and in a building with meters thick walls that are nearly 300 years old. It’s an oasis, a nest with a fucking Scandinavian wood stove against the cold winters in Switzerland. I think it might be the first time I’m looking forward to winter.

You might ask yourself why I’m such an arse, rubbing my luck into your face but this is the ting: It took me 10 years to get where I am now. And during those ten years I sort of became a survivalist in the creative industry, housing rental expert, and social butterfly, despite my lack of self-confidence. 

My life so far can be described as a series of problems I had to solve - and entry exams. After my apprenticeship (I had to take six entry exams to get to this point) I thought I was done with entry exams. But of course I was interested in the Bachelor studies that required one. I got in but had to spend my most of my savings on a language school in Ireland to improve my English because the course was one of those prestigious international ones (like the one in which you feel poor like a church mouse, being Middle Class) that required a certain level. Yeah, choosing Ireland over Cambridge was almost rebellious.

After my Bachelor’s degree I did the beginner’s mistake and chose the job with the highest salary instead of the one that is more beneficial in the long-term. I was deeply unhappy about my situation but I learned a lot about company politics and the advertising industry - In fact so much that I chose to stay away from it from the rest of my life.

My father said that I should regard this experience as a very well paid internship because the things I’d learned from such a place is invaluable. He was right. I can spot corporate red flags from 50 miles away and know my rights as employee a bit better than most.

I’ve thrown myself in the cold water by funding an own company and do the stuff I’ve always wanted to while doing my Master’s Degree (because that’s what you do if you don’t know what you want to do). Okay, I had a plan because when I was 19 I told myself I wanted to become a consultant in the area of design and I have a real passion for stuff I’ve studied. I didn’t get rich despite becoming somewhat successful but the things you learn as an entrepreneur puts you miles ahead from your peers. There were times I thought I’d be dying of a fucking heart attack because I was completely overwhelmed by the shit (no-one’s going to do the work but yourself). But nowhere else did I learn more about the reality of business than running an own fashion label. 

After my Master’s degree I gave myself a year to wrap things up and find a new job. But I procrastinated (I even did my written thesis on this topic but it didn’t help). I was depressed and exhausted. I didn’t believe in a nice future for my partner and myself. My SO and my father were the ones kicking my ass and telling me to believe in myself. It’s worth mentioning that I never had much self-confidence. Maybe because with every year I got older I kept reminding myself that I still wasn’t there where I wanted to be. My only asset it my brain and at times I think that it’s just full of shit. I see my acquaintances on Facebook having holidays in nice places, their cars, their glossy life. I deleted my Linked-in account years ago because it always made me feel bad about myself. I couldn’t stand looking at the CVs of some of my fellow students. I was intimidated by the ‘success’ of others and felt like crap afterwards. It took me years and a lot of advice from the two most important men in my life to realise that most people use social media to create an idealistic image of themselves and that it does not often correlate with reality. Instagram and a game of bullshit bingo make anyone look great.

My father, whom I also regard as my mentor, shared with me the following insight (original saying is in German): ‘Everyone just cooks with water.’ People bullshit all the time and behind the glossy façade and bespoken suits they aren’t perfect at all.  Also, one should never think to not be good enough to apply for a job only because the job ad says you have to speak ten languages, be 25 and have at least 15 years of work experience, never want any kids and work for free. He also told be not to do the mistake to apply for an internship with such a degree. Go for the real thing. The worst thing you might get is a no. He was right (as always).

I had to take another hurdle and ask my trusted friends for brutally honest feedback for my creative portfolio and motivational letter. I can’t stress how important it is to show people your stuff for feedback. Don’t show it to the nice people, show it to the honest people. But the fear was there again; that I wasn’t good enough and that I suffer from cognitive diarrhoea. However, the feedback I got was really good and I was happy about it that I actually got really motivated to finally apply for the real thing. 

After my father went over the papers and didn’t see a single error I’ve sent it to the company. I’ve got a reply the next day. I did a first round interview the following week. I was so scared and intimidated by the guy’s title. I thought I messed up some parts but the following day they invited me to a face-to-face interview and assessment. My fear grew worse but my partner helped me to calm me down. I went there, did my presentation, talked with them, and they offered me a job and the possibility to build up my own division if I want to. At this point I was even more intimidated than before. But I said yes and did the salary negotiation. All the financial sorrows were gone after I went out that building but the fear stayed. I felt like a con woman, thinking that I wasn’t good enough for the job. My partner laughed and told me to fucking start believing in myself. My bosses are psychologists; they smell bullshit 50 miles away. 

But the fear remained even after I signed the contract because there were other issues to solve. Like the living situation. Our horrible neighbours make so much noise that the only thing that keeps us insane is BBC 1 Xtra and our subwoofer (I’m a Grime expert by now). The past weeks we went on looking for apartments. We just applied for one we really fell in love with but we didn’t really believe that we would get it. The owner of the building is the city’s municipality for the old aristocracy and patricians and usually they let the apartments to fellow peers. I had to formally present myself to the property manager after applying for the building (another exam…). Questions were asked, my character assessed (don’t think I didn’t notice…) but I got the apartment right away!

I walked out of that little palace in which the interview was held and felt like Alexander the Great cutting the Gordian knot. I finally allowed myself to feel happy. I allowed myself to look at the big picture of my life and acknowledged what I have achieved so far. I was once an introverted person but became a social butterfly and learned how not to be so fucking awkward all the time. My long-term strategy of specialising in a certain field starts to pay off. My partner and I are together for 10 years now, my cat doesn’t ignore me, and in a couple of weeks I can enjoy the sound of silence in the new apartment. I just hope that the trains are on time tomorrow and that our subwoofer still works until we move out.

4qnza3,0,2016-06-30,"Tips for cheap weight loss diet, and how to find the time for exercise.",raycho_bird,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/4qnza3/tips_for_cheap_weight_loss_diet_and_how_to_find/,"Hi Reddit!

I'm a student in my last year of school, and I'm looking to lose weight. Overall, I'd like to drop 60 pounds, if possible, but I'm struggling with a few things.

Firstly, I currently have an internship that I go to from about 8:30 to 5:45, which is cut into by my Calc 2 course. By the end of the day, I'm exhausted, so I go home and veg out. So, no exercising.

On top of that, I am Very Poor College Student, and I need to figure out a cheap but yummy way to eat healthier. I normally eat very healthy - I've (almost) cut out sodas by switching to La Croix sparkling waters, and my boyfriend and I normally cook frozen chicken and whatever frozen vegetable for dinner. However, baked chicken doesn't have much glamour after a while. I purchased a spiralizer, but don't quite know what to do with it, and tried going the salad route, but I'm not enthused with eating salads every day for lunch either, despite the chopped up almonds and fruit I throw in it.

I need to make a lifestyle change. In the month of working at my internship, I have gained five pounds, and my business casual shirts are beginning to ride up my gut. At the very least, I need to lose weight so I don't have to buy more business casual clothes - at the most basic level, I'd like to look nicer for a wedding in August where I am a bridesmaid.

tl;dr - What are cheap, healthy foods that I can use on my budget (less than $100 every two weeks), and how can I find the motivation to pursue exercise? I would like to lose ~2 pounds a week."
4qo2rf,3,2016-06-30,Rejected (32F) by my husband (30M) basically as soon as we were married.,uxc123,DeadBedrooms,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/4qo2rf/rejected_32f_by_my_husband_30m_basically_as_soon/,"My husband and I had been dating for 2 years when I left the state to attend grad school.  Before grad school, we had a good sex life - about twice a week.  He had been a virgin prior to our relationship and we had worked on his becoming comfortable in the sexual relationship. We were both receptive to each other's preferences.  He had a difficulty reliably coming during sex, but I was happy to give him other stimulation to get off.  We were working on it, and while I did feel crappy that he wasn't able to get off from having sex with me alone, I was confident we would have the ability to navigate a satisfying sexual relationship. 

During grad school, he continued to be a wonderful partner.  He supported me through some really difficult days, since I was far from home and didn't know a soul at the school.  He came to visit or I went to visit him at least twice a month, which is excellent considering the distance involved. We'd usually have sex at least one of those two visits (he was working long hours, and if he wasn't into it each time he / I visited, I understood - even though I pretty much always wanted to have sex). At the end of my second year of grad school, he popped the question.  I will admit I was a bit concerned about saying yes since we had been long distance for such a while, but the way he handled the distance made me feel confident we could do this. We started planning the wedding 6 months following my graduation.

Here's the really really stupid thing I did.  A month before the wedding, I was accepted for a really prestigious year long clinical internship (a requirement in my field) - but it would require that I live long distance away from him again.  He could not move closer to me because he had just been accepted into grad school himself.  After speaking with him extensively about it, and him supporting me, I (STUPIDLY) decided to go ahead with the internship. 
This meant we would have to go from our month long honeymoon straight back to long distance.  The honeymoon sounds fantastic, right?  It was.  But, we had sex on our wedding night, and after that we only had sex once during the entire trip. He denied that anything was bothering him, he just wasn't feeling it.  I was upset, but didn't say anything.

During my internship, we carried on at first much as we had when we were in grad school - visiting two or three times a month, sex at least once during the visit with the odd sexless visit here or there. But then, about 6 months in, he started to say he was tired more frequently.  We started to go months without having sex.  At that time, I didn't see this as such a problem because I figured his  tiredness made sense. I became pretty depressed during my internship as well.  I was alone (new city, again) and the only intern hired. I purposely didn't go out to bars because I didn't want to be hit on and frankly didn't want to be tempted. The job was (and continues to be) very emotionally taxing, dealing with critically ill people for on a daily basis, getting to know them over a period of 2 - 4 weeks. I get to really like some of these people, and sometimes I am totally unable to help them, or they pass away. I didn't think about how much my job was affecting my mental health because, well, it's my job.  But at some point during the internship I realized I would start crying at nothing at all and was super isolated and depressed.  I tried to go to therapy, but the only therapist I could get an appointment with (without waiting 6 months) at the school was pretty bad - he was an addiction specialist and basically tried to get me to work a 12 step program (I am not, and have never been, an addict of anything). 

Anyhow, I survived, and moved back in with my husband, who now was in the first year of his two year degree.  I was SO looking forward to being with him again, I (naively) thought being together would solve all of our problems. But when I got back, he had no time for me.  He was totally wrapped up in school, and even though he had more free time than he had ever had while working, we could not find time to have sex.  I was looking for a job for the first 2 months when I arrived, so I had a wide open schedule as well.  His rejection hit me like a ton of bricks. When he did agree to have sex, it felt like he thought he was doing me a favor, and on top of that, he still had difficulties coming, which made me feel like absolute shit. I basically went into overdrive trying to figure out the problem (do you not find me attractive anymore? am I not doing things right?) while still deeply depressed.  I had, again, no emotional support other than him, and I know that is a mistake, knew it at the time - but I had been away from home for 3 years and didn't feel I could effectively rekindle relationships with friends while depressed. Things have gotten steadily worse for our sex life ever since then.  He seemed to view my desperate need to fix the situation as distasteful or something - he just wouldn't engage. If I brought the lack of sex up, he would basically just stare at me, utter single syllable responses to questions, and often climb into bed and go to sleep. This in turn drove me up the wall.  I became so angry and resentful towards him.  I'm not proud to admit it, but there has been significantly more than one screaming match about this topic.

Zoom forwards to now.  We just had our 3 year anniversary. He continues to be kind and sweet and considerate, but never really communicates about real topics.  It's all ""what do you want to do tonight?""  and ""what does our schedule look like?"" We haven't had sex in 6 months. I barely bring it up anymore because the topic is so toxic.  He claims it is because he is tired, doesn't have time, has too many responsibilities to juggle.  We split everything 50/50, but he often feels he has to know my schedule for me because he is type A to the max about that kind of thing (whereas if I forget something every once in a while, I don't mind too much - I always manage to remember vital stuff, and can figure everything else out). I think this may make him feel that he is doing more than he actually is  / needs to, but he doesn't stop when I tell him I can handle my own schedule.  

I had a panic attack on my birthday in April.  I turned 32 and I am now facing the real possibility I will never have children with a loving partner, even if I leave him... it takes a long time to develop a solid relationship.  He continues to basically refuse to address the topic at all except when I break down crying, resentful, anxious, angry. Then, he tells me he understands why I am upset, he finds me attractive (he has claimed to find me attractive this whole time), he loves me, he doesn't want me to leave, he will try.  He has tried a few times recently, I think my anxiety over not having kids has motivated him (and he has always stated he wants kids).  But I just can't even see his attempts at remotely enticing now.  He doesn't talk to me beforehand, he just sits down on the couch next to me with no forewarning and grabs at my boob or crotch with this weird neutral look on his face. I tried to have sex like this with him a few times, but it was awkward and horrible.  

I am sure that my depression and anger plays a role in this, but I think it can't all be me.  Honestly, I view my depression as situational - I have no history of it, and it is directly related to be isolated. I have always been a very sex positive person, I try to be GGG (not that I've had the ability to do so). I am realizing more and more that he grew up in an incredibly repressed family, where his parents would literally go a week or so not talking over an argument.  They were also not very communicative.  I remembering thinking it was weird how little they spoke to him / each other in general, but at the time I met them, I chalked it up to cultural differences (our relationship is IR). My family is the opposite - my parents had their tempers (were never abusive) and would fight, but then it would be done and everyone would move on.  I definitely think these dynamics are playing a role in our relationship.  

I love him, but I don't know if I am in love with him. I am on the verge of leaving him.  I want children, and while we may be able to do a ""one and done"", I don't want to then be locked into this misery for the rest of my life because I am raising a kid with him.
I'm sorry, I just realized I'm not really sure what my question is after all of this. I think I just needed to get this out.  I guess: can you fall back in love with someone after something like this? Has anyone done this?

4qoobw,1,2016-06-30,The Day Phil Jackson Shut The MSG Doors,NYKInformation,NYKnicks,https://www.reddit.com/r/NYKnicks/comments/4qoobw/the_day_phil_jackson_shut_the_msg_doors/,"So here I am sitting near the cabanas by the pool at the Four Seasons Hotel in Miami, Florida with our friend Mike Woodson (at the time Head Coach of my team, the New York Knicks) sitting to my immediate left and Steve Mills to my immediate right, and each of us with a Grey Goose mixed drink in front of us and a Prensado cigar in hand. We were talking money, investments, careers and basketball in general. Players were coming and going back and forth to the pools. Some remembered me and walked by for a quick hello, while others looked at me with a puzzled “I know I’ve seen this guy somewhere” look. Mills asks me for dinner plans. “We’re going to Prime 112 if you’re interested, say 9 PM?”. “Yeah, we’ll be there!” was my immediate response. The “we” was my good friend Bill, who was Mike Woodson’s neighbor and friend for over 20 years in both Houston &amp; Atlanta, and it was through him how I met Woody and the reason I was there this warm afternoon. It was at this moment that reality hit me…This is living the dream. How long could this last?


You see, the team that I dreamed about and loved every single day of my life had just gone through a recent change, which was the hiring of Phil Jackson, and I was already forewarned by a scout I met in NY the previous year that I was an outsider who somehow infiltrated the team and became part of the “circle”, but things are going to change when Phil puts his foot down. The issue was I had no basketball ties to Phil Jackson himself therefore I would soon be banished for good. You see, I was part of Phil Jackson’s nightmare when he took over. “Who knows who and who knows what, with the potential to cause internal damage or rumors, are the people Phil will get rid of first” is what one assistant Coach said to me when I texted him regarding Phil’s hire. My ties to the Knicks was like a failing marriage. I knew it was only a matter of time that I would be separated from my team for the greater good of the franchise. I just wasn’t ready to let it go yet. I’ve met a lot of people in the three short years that I was a part of the team. I’ve met players, staff, personnel, scouts, etc. We’ve built a great relationship over that short span, but my loyalty was always going to be with Coach Woodson. Woody, as everyone calls him, had invited me to this game and had rooms already set up for us on the same floor as him, but he also warned that Mills and staff were in town due to the importance of the game and the recent hiring of Phil Jackson, so he told us to prepare for anything. 


I took the dinner invite from Mills, and we went about the rest of the afternoon just talking and “shooting the breeze”, but I noticed something different with Mills that from the previous time I met him.
Mills and I had ties. He knew I was Woody’s “guy”, but we also had things in common that allowed him to befriend me and trust me. He worked under my uncle as an intern when he graduated Princeton. I found that out when I first met him, and it allowed him to let his guard down with me in conversation. This would only be my second time with Mills in person, but I immediately noticed that he was a little sterner and serious in demeanor as opposed to the first time I met him. The players and staff were coming over to him asking him for permission to go out that evening. He gave the film guys curfews. He asked a couple of guys if they remembered their per-diem and finished every sentence to his employees with “…and don’t let me get a late night phone call about you”. Make no mistake about it, Steve Mills was now THE MAN. The HMFIC. More importantly, it also became obvious that he was now Phil Jackson’s eyes and ears for the team. We sat and relaxed for a few hours, laughing and sharing jokes with the coaches and players as they walked by us. Then Mills received a phone call (my guess is that it was Phil) and excused himself, to which Woody also used an excuse to go up to his room. I stopped them both and asked for a picture, which was something I never did before to Woody or any team personnel (True story, the first time I met Woody, he said as long as I don’t act like a fan and act like I belong, I could stick around…so I always applied those rules). Today felt different than others, so I jumped at the opportunity and both obliged. I took my only picture with Woody and Mills, which I have shared on Twitter a few times, and then Woody, Bill and myself went to the rooms while Mills and his guys went another direction.


Awaiting the elevator, Woody starts talking to us. “Bill…George…have fun tonight but be careful. I’m staying in”. As the doors opened, out steps Allan Houston. He greets Woody, says hello to us, and walks towards Mills. We get in the elevator and Woody immediately tells us “I’m gonna tell you this. Be careful what you say at dinner.” We go to his room, sit on the sofa, and Bill and him start reminiscing about their “old and crazy days”. I’m getting bored so I ask the question that I’ve held in since I arrived in Miami. “Woody, what’s the story on Phil Jackson?”. There was a silence in the room. Bill was just as interested in the reply as I was. As great as friends as he and Woody were, even Bill never asked him that particular question because he knew that Woody’s tenure as coach might be coming into question due to the Knicks’ struggle. That’s when Woody got serious. “George, all I know is we gotta win tomorrow and we gotta make the playoffs”. I pried and pried to get more out of him, but he wouldn’t budge. I asked if he spoke with Phil directly and he said “Yeah”. I said “And….!!!???” And his most revealing answer to me was “I was told 30 days”. I asked “Until you’re gone?” and he said “No, I was told in 30 days he’ll be cleaning house from top to bottom”. “From Phil?!?” I asked. “Yup”. “What about Mills?” was my first question. “He’s got a gig lined up with the Players Association” is what Woody said to me. Then I asked about Herb Williams. I mean everyone wanted to know what would happen to Herb Williams. That’s when Woody replied “Steve, Allan, Herb…those are Dolan’s guys…but Phil has the power now…so I guess we’ll see who’s really calling the shots”. Then came my most compelling question…”If Phil has told you all that to your face, does that mean you’re staying?”. “I just don’t know George. I’ve been doing this long enough to know that you take nothing for granted.”. That was that. We then went to our room next door to get ready for dinner. I remember asking Bill as I was ironing my shirt “Do you think Phil is cold-blooded enough to tell Woody that he will be firing him 30 days later. That’s some sick shit.” Bill said “Well, I spoke to Woody on the phone last week and he doesn’t seem to be too worried because he and Phil DID talk for a while”. I just left it at that.


As we got ready for dinner and called our cab, Iman Shumpert was waiting in the lobby. “What up G, Bill” he said. “Whatup Shump?” we said. “Just waiting for my cab”. “Want to share ours?” we offered. “Yeah, sure”. Then a guy from the cabanas walks by and says “Hey can I get a pic with you?”. “Sure” says Shump, to which he invites us all in the picture. This was officially my second picture while with the team, and my last. The taxi drops us off first, right at a packed Prime 112 Steakhouse. We walk in and the hostess asks if we had reservations. I say “We’re with the Knicks” and she goes in the room and taps Mills on the shoulder. He looks over and nods his head. She escorts us to the table and the eyes in the room grow on us. In reality, this here was the best feeling I ever had as an outside member of the Knicks. I was seated right next to Allan Houston, across from Herb Williams. Mills and two others were seated on the other end of the table, where Bill was also squeezed in. 6 of us in total, in a happening place, lots of bacon all around, and everyone is looking at us like we’re superstars. They know in Miami first-hand who Allan Houston was (LOL), and knew that this was Knicks brass at the table. We all had some of the best steaks mankind could ever ask for. Every few minutes, however, I would see Mills lean over and say something to Bill. At one point, it was a long conversation in Bill’s ear, and I could see Bill getting somewhat upset. In between these conversations, Steve would look up at me and smile and ask “How’s Peter?” (my uncle), or “How’s business” just to get me conversing with Houston and Herb about my connections with him and my business ventures while taking my mind off of his conversation with Bill. We finished our dinner and headed back to the hotel. It was a great dinner with great people. While we were leaving, Mills said “See you at the game tomorrow”. It was my last time ever speaking to him.


On the way to the hotel, I immediately asked Bill, “What were you and Mills talking about?”. That’s when Bill hit me with news that ruined my whole night. “He said that we’re too close with the team. He understands that Woody and I have a deep friendship, but you being here is uneasy on the team &amp; staff. He said he likes you and knows that you don’t mean harm to anyone, but he also said that YOU are exactly the type of person Phil wants to get rid of…people that have entered this organization through knowing someone and started rumors, leaks and false info. It’s nothing against us personally…but he said it’s Phil’s rules”. Just like that we were on the outside looking in. We went to the game…the team lost. JR was great, Melo did well, but we were officially eliminated from the playoffs. We went down to the floor after the game. Woody was dejected. He said “This one was tough”. I thanked him for inviting me and for everything he did for us. He then tells me “George, you’re always welcome when I’m around”. He said that as if he knew what Mills said to us. We then departed back home. It was my last time seeing Woody as a member of the Knicks. My next time seeing him was with the Clippers in Orlando the following year, and a few times afterwards. As for the Knicks, we all know the story. Phil cleaned house. Only Steve Mills and Allan Houston are still there from the “dinner crew”. Those guys, after all, are former “Dolan’s guys” who were adopted into the family by Phil Jackson.


So, here are my innermost feelings about all of this. As a person, I am ecstatic that I was able to spend time with my favorite team. It was truly a once in a lifetime opportunity. As a fan, however, I am thankful that Phil and Mills have tightened the pathways into the Knicks. I can see how things can go very bad very quickly if the information that I was privy to was ever to get leaked out or twisted in a purposely hate-filled rumor. Bad for me is good for the team, and simply put, I am now back to being just a fan. Go Knicks!

4qopez,11,2016-06-30,PwC Winter Intern - Commuting Questions,blahboobeep,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/4qopez/pwc_winter_intern_commuting_questions/,"Hi /r/accounting, I just accepted my offer for a Winter assurance position with PwC, and I had a few questions regarding commuting.

After speaking with one of the associates who was in attendance at the Elevate event I attended, he mentioned that winter interns may or may not be working with a client not in the city of the office, and would possibly be in a smaller city/town.  

After looking at the distance, the commute from my house would be roughly 70 miles to the 'rough location' of the client.  I would be willing to do the drive if need be, but I'd imagine it would be pretty exhausting after a short period of time.  Of course this doesn't really matter if I end up on a team in the city of the home office which is only a 30 minute drive.

My question is (more relevant to PwC people I guess), in your office, would it be in the realm of possibility for an intern to be reimbursed for living in a hotel for the duration of the audit?

I guess another question regards weather...we are very prone to very large snowstorms in my area, and in the event of poor/dangerous driving conditions (but the office not closing its operations for that day), what would be the procedure for that, since I don't live in the city?

I realize most of these questions would have to be directed specifically towards people in my office, but figured I could get some early thoughts/opinions anyways.

Thanks!"
4qosqx,2,2016-06-30,F4A - The Dark Journey To Fame,Undisclosed_Desires7,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/4qosqx/f4a_the_dark_journey_to_fame/,"Katheyn or what she preferred to be called Katy was the new intern at the company. A big industry in downtown Los Angeles that dealt with many movie, tv and rock stars. Basically, offering rich and famous people services to handle their careers while also giving fresh faced wannabes the opportunities.

Katy was one of them, a young girl that wasn't even 21 yet dreams of making it in music, becoming a world known star. She had tried numerous times and had many meetings with companies to try and get her talent across to no avail. Eventually the money she saved up from her part time job while she was in school dried up and she had to pick up a job in L.A she she thought why not a business in a similar field to her dreams.

Katy remembered when she walked into the office for the first time, people couldn't believe what she looked like and you think they would be accustomed to seeing gorgeous people all the time. She had worn a pair of red 6 inch stilettos and a tiny pencil skirt that would of been the shortest a woman could wear. Thigh high stockings that hugged tight to her legs that were held up by clasps attached to a garter belt. The tight blouse she wore strained her rather biggest assets, her double DD breasts that were pushed up in her black bra. They bounced around as she worked around the office, attracting the attention of many guys. The man Katy worked for was always delighted to see her, his eyes filling up with lust as he looked her body over before leading her into his office and shutting the door.

Katy regularly wore clothes that brung her attention, it was always another pair of 6 inch heels, short skirts and stockings accompanied by a tight low cut blouse. Guys around the office started to talk about Katy, about how they would love to ram her as she bent over their desk. Many guys often tried to get with her but she always refused.

Soon Katy developed a reputation for being a strong feminist supporter. She thought that all men were pigs for treating women as nothing more than a pair of tits and ass with a pretty face. That's how Katy felt in meetings, guys would get sidetracked around her and just stare at her boobs or ass. They wouldn't take her seriously and thought that she was just a slut. She thought that guys only chatted to her because they wanted to fuck her and weren't even calling her by name around the office, she overheard them calling her by her big tits.

Though what Katy did, didn't always match up with what she said. She would scold men for staring at her body when she wore revealing clothing everyday. She would also find every excuse to bend over to give everyone a good look at her, regularly dropping things on the ground. She would get angry at guys all the time for flirting with her as they obviously wanted to fuck her but she would flirt with guys all the time brushing her hand near their groin and giving them a sexy, sultry look as she walked away.

One day the CEO came to the office and went to a meeting room with about 30 other businessmen. They were all aged between 50-80 years old. After about an hour, Katy was called into the meeting room. Jason, a fellow coworker had a desk right in front of the room, he watched her strut in their, clad in her tight clothes. She closed the door behind her. It must of been 4 hours until the doors opened again, with the old guys walking out with satisfied looks on their faces. They talked about how great that was and how they must do it again soon. Out Katy stepped as they finally all left. Her hair was disheveled while she was fixing her rumpled blouse and rolling down her skirt while carrying her stilettos. As she walked she pulled out a curly hair from her mouth and wiped away a bit of stickiness from her lips. Going to her desk and continuing work like nothing happened.

--------------

I want this role play to involve scenarios following the womens career such as trying to break into the industry (a lot of time spent as the secretary), dealing with the sudden fame, hook ups with celebrities, sex tapes, paparazzi, fans, relationships, becoming addicted to drugs and alcohol and turning into a nymphomaniac.

The prompt above doesn't have to be the start or involved in it... just an example of some writing.

Can be different and have a male celebrity and their journey.

I want to play the males the celeb will encounter. I want someone to play the main lead which will be the young female starlet. I would love for the young starlet to be Katy Perry or Kylie Jenner but I like a lot of other celebs as well such as Taylor Swift, Iggy Azalea, Ariana Grande, Scarlett Johansson and Jessica Alba.

I prefer to roleplay on Google Docs and use messengers to chat and set things up such as K , skype, yahoo msger and google chat/hangouts. Want this to be a long term rp

If you are interested and wish to talk about this further send me a message. Please make your message to me detailed and include any character/ scenario ideas, which celebrities you like and what platforms you use.
