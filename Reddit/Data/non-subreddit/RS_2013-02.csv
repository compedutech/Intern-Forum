I switched to CS major last year so while I have some background with programming, I just started really digging in a little while ago, but have been picking up fast.
I know a handful of languages well (Python, Java, Javascript, Ruby, various web design) and have a good GPA, but have had no professional experience programming and want to get started asap so I can possibly get a better internship next summer when I have more experience.

Anyone know any good ones locally that I can get my foot in the door with? Maybe even within GMU if that exists. Also I'd love to at least get paid but I'm not sure if that's pushing my luck. "
17ophe,1,2013-02-01,I still love her and only time will tell.,AsWeWalk,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/17ophe/i_still_love_her_and_only_time_will_tell/,"I am a guy and I met her freshman year in college and for a year it was amazing. Then we got to that point where neither of us had ever gotten to in a relationship before. The time after the initial ""honeymoon"" stage. We struggled and I thought she wanted to end it. So after a couples weeks of struggling, her attitude toward me made me feel like she wanted it to be over and I felt like it would be best to give her that. So I decided to confront her and tell her that it feels like she just wants this to end, so I said I would do it for her.

After a week, we both had ended up making out with friends that we both had been attracted to during our relationship. We both had different reactions to this. When we had our experiences, neither of us knew of the others. After my experience, I missed her way too much and decided to tell her that. After hers and me telling her how I felt, she was conflicted. She hated what she had done but she couldn't decide if she wanted to be with him or me. Eventually, we both severed ties with our friends and got back together.

This new relationship lasted 3 weeks and she broke it off. She said she loved being single and missed it. Needless to say I was devastated but I saw the signs leading up to it, so I had braced myself for it. Over the next month we tried to be friends and I tried to adjust but it still haunted me. I wanted to be with her. So I told her and she blew me off for a week by not responding to anything I messaged to her. She just thought in order for us to get over each other, we had to just not talk or see each other. At the end of that week, I begged her to just let me talk to her once. She agreed. After talking, we rekindled our friendship (which was more like best friends). This lead into summer break after sophomore year.

About 2 weeks into summer break we met up, since we live a good distance away from each other, to see a movie and hang out. After this we realized how much we loved being with each other and got back together. We talked everyday over break, hung out a couple weekends, and couldn't wait to be back at school together.

Everything starts out great back at school. We have fun and it just couldn't be better. Then she just switches to this different person. She stops wanting to hang out as much and keeps giving excuses as to why she can't. Well this goes by for 1.5 weeks and I see her once in that time. It's the night before my 21st and I ask her to talk. She agrees. We talk and I ask her the important question. ""Do you want to be with me?"" She just answers, ""No."" I tell her it's okay, give her a hug, tell her that I understand, and say that I wish she would have just talked to me about it. We both smile and leave her room. She then out of nowhere asks, ""I can't believe you are taking this so well. Wait, is there someone else?"" I was floored, but I calmly say. There is no way that there is anyone else.

We become good friends after this and even become friends with benefits for a while. After the semester we talk about getting back together, but we both agreed it was a bad idea since she was going abroad the next semester. She visited my family for Christmas, but we said we were just friends. We end up talking a lot more than expected while she was abroad and when she gets back we got back together. I told her that I really missed her and we talked about potentially where our future could take us. We both figured at this point our relationship won't end anymore. We couldn't stand being apart for those months without seeing each other.

We were great again, but only up until my birthday...again. The same thing happened where she ignored me, so I talked to her and this break up was just as smooth. (I hated this...) We then became friends with benefits and had fun. It seemed like she loved it more when we weren't attached, but she loved being with me. 

By the end of the semester, I gave her an ultimatum type question. Either I want to be with her or I wanted to stop this and get on with my life. She just responded to the question with I don't know. This really bothered me, so I kind of just quit. I tried to not hang out with her much over the next 3 days until I went to talk to her and told her that I felt that it would be best for us to stop seeing each other because we both had issues we needed to deal with in our own lives.
(I was dealing with anxiety induced by school which led to depression and she did not know this. I felt she couldn't handle a relationship and the stress of her load with an internship, classes, and extracurriculars.)

After that night she just asked one thing of me. That I do not date anyone for the rest of college because it would be too hard to see it. I agreed and asked the same of her. She also agreed.

We still did friends with benefits stuff over the course of the rest of the semester. I then told her that I loved her the day I left for break while we cuddled in my bed. The very next day, she goes on a date with someone. I was devastated.

It has been 2 months since. I am taking this semester off to deal with things and she is now in a relationship with this new guy and completely ignores any attempt I make at trying to be in a friendship.

Throughout this entire experience I have loved her and still do. I wanted to propose at graduation. I still think about her everyday and wish that there was something I could do to make myself forget about her or get her to at least talk to me again. The only thing that makes sense to me is that time heals all."
17opgg,3,2013-02-01,So I am a little confused about the levels of surgeons depicted in Grey's.. Can someone help explain?,blazeofglory94,greysanatomy,https://www.reddit.com/r/greysanatomy/comments/17opgg/so_i_am_a_little_confused_about_the_levels_of/,"Ok so I have been re-watching all seasons and I am a little confused. Grey, Yang, Stevens, Karev and O'Malley started as Bailey's interns. Bailey was a third year resident. That took a year and then they were all second year residents. Little Grey and co were then the second year residents interns.

Burke, Shepard, Montgomery, Sloane are all attendings. They are the bosses of Torres, Bailey and co.

Now.. A few seasons later, we get Robbins (attending). Bailey is promoted and so is Torres. Still no interns for these two.

Last season, our first lot of interns, apply for fellowships, and take them at SGMW. They aren't attendings, but Torres, Robbins, Bailey, Shepard, Montgomery, Sloane are. Torres and Bailey skipped a fellowship? And the others never spoke of anything other than being attendings.

Now that Grey, Yang, Karev, Avery and Kepner are fellows, they have interns.. Again.. Why does little Grey's class not have interns when they begin their second year? Why are big Grey and co the only non-residents with interns?

Also, let's assume when big Grey and Derek met, Derek was a first year attending. They are interns for one year, then residents for 4 more (fifth year res gets chief res) plus a year of fellow? That makes Derek at least 7 years older.. And then Mark and little Grey would be at least 8 but I feel like Mark is older than Derek..

Anyway.. My question is.. If Yang, Grey and co got interns immediately after they completed theirs, where are little Grey's interns? And in this season, Yang, Grey and co are the only 'dark blue scrub' wearing people to have interns..

Can anyone explain why there is this inconsistency in new interns? "

I hate that I can't afford to live on my own and living with my parents is killing me. I hate that stupid little mistakes from the past keep getting in the way of starting the frigging unpaid internship that would help me get out of here,  eventually. I hate having no money to just up and leave. In hate being in so much debt because of school that in the end isn't really helping be find a job. I hate my brother and I hate my mother and I hate everyone. Most of all I hate myself. I hate that I know this is all my fault and that I am the problem.  I wish I could just hate everyone else and not know that deep down its just me who is good for nothing. I wish I could just stop surviving. 

I wish I didn't have an anger problem. I wish I didn't care about anything. I wish I'd stop feeling so worthless. I wish all my hard work and 8 years of schooling would be be so useless. 

I wish I was pretty so that my bf wouldn't stare at my hot friend instead of me. I wish in was pretty so he would want to show me off to his friends. I wish I didn't feel so jealous of all my friends who are either pretty, or doing well,  or both. I wish I had SOMETHING. I wish I wasn't so bad at everything. I know they're talking about me. I can hear them. My mom and my brother. Taking about the outburst I just had right now. They're probably saying how crazy I am. They're probably right. 


I wish I was weak enough to just break already. This barely hanging on is horrible. I wish I wasn't sick so I could just backpack across the country and live on scraps. I wish I wasn't such a goddamn disappointment. 

It's living with them. I need to get out of this house. That's what I need. I'm just a burden - i dont contribute, all I do is create problems and fight. I'm just useless. I'm just stuck. And I can't take it anymore."
17oge2,0,2013-02-01,Stock/Company Analysis tools question,[deleted],investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17oge2/stockcompany_analysis_tools_question/,"Oops! This came out longer than I expected so here you go:

TLDR: If you had access to a web app which coherently presented visualized financial data, would you use it? What features/analyses/things would you like to see in an app like this?




Hi all, I'm currently a finance student [~~insert usual stuff about being super motivated, or knowing a lot for my age, or despite being from a non-target with a less-than-stellar GPA I'm a super active networker, or- my favorite- my amazing 999% returns in my paper portfolio~~]
I've came to realize that programming will play an important part in my career, since it's a great way to distinguish yourself and help automate monotonous shit in the office, which is pretty much what you have to deal with as an intern anyway. So the reasoning was - work smarter, not harder. I figure the best way to learn is by doing. I'm working side by side with a programmer who can show me the ropes; meanwhile I'll be educating him on some fundamental finance. 

We're working on a program which would essentially provide visual interpretations of company and stock data. The users will be able to see a variety of charts and other graphics which should be helpful in decision making. Eventually, we expect to also integrate new stories. There will likely be a way to enter your portfolio, and if this really kicks off we would gladly incorporate APIs. 

So, the reason I'm posting this is to see if there would be an interest for a web app like this? I understand there's a plethora of tools available, but from my research I've noticed very few of them take advantage of pre-attentive processing (which makes it almost intuitive) so I hope we can fill that gap.

What are some features you would like to see in this? (Besides insider information haha) We hope to hear back from both long and short term investors

17odth,0,2013-01-31,"Building a Math-related programming ""portfolio"" (Mathematic/Octave/Matlab)",[deleted],math,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/17odth/building_a_mathrelated_programming_portfolio/,"Hello!

This is a bit of an odd request but I'm wondering what you guys thought would be good small(ish) projects to have in a Matlab ""portfolio"" (or Mathematica). I'm a first year math major and in order to get some experience I offered my help to a professor of the applied math department for this summer. The university offers some funding to students who wish to apply for it but it's amazingly competitive (4.1+ GPA while I'm probably closer to 3.5) and 2nd/3rd year students are usually a more obvious choice for the department. What I did though is offered to do it for free. I have enough money aside so I don't really have to work this summer and getting this experience would be worth a lot more than 3 months worth of minimum-wage work. 

While I'm still a first year student and my mathematical knowledge can't bring much to the table, I'm pretty confident my CS knowledge is above the average undergrad student in the department (I did do a few years of a CS undergrad before moving to math on top of doing a lot of programming, especially in C since I was in early high school) which I think gives me a bit of an edge. This semester I'm taking a class based around Mathematica and I've been able to pick it up pretty quickly (we're 2 weeks in but I've been able to do last semester's midterm, thanks to the built-in help!) and I used it for a few fun projects at well. My Matlab experience is mostly doing assignments for a friend of mine taking engineering who hates programming as well as messing around with GNU/Octave.

What I'm working on now is a bit of a CV for myself to present to this professor. He wants to know what kind of experience I have as well as see a bit of what I'm capable of (I'm assuming). Unfortunately I don't have a lot of math-related projects on hand (my biggest projects are mostly interpreters/compilers in C) so I thought I'd work on a few diverse projects to have something to show. What do you guys think would be interesting to show? It obviously have to be something complicated enough that it doesn't look like I just Google'd pieces of code and glued them together but small enough that I don't spend the next 3 months on it. Any ideas?

**tl;dr** Basically trying to impress a professor who could consider me for an unpaid internship this summer. I unfortunately don't have much to show him so I'm looking for a few projects I could work on.

Thanks!"

A haunting in Taylor’s Falls
By: Josh Stanway 

If you don’t believe in ghosts, don’t worry, I didn’t either. That view may have changed after I spent 5 hours with the Minnesota Paranormal Investigation Group in the Old Jail Bed and Breakfast, a famously haunted building located right in TF. I entered the building to be greeted by  Don Lawrence, the owner of the Old jail, and two of our investigation group, Rocky and Diana. Rocky is a tech expert, while Diana is a medium who deals with the more spiritual side of ghost hunting. 
	
After I had been in the building for a few minutes, don started to tell the stories of his granddaughter always seeing the spirit of a little boy. What was even creepier was that several guests had also documented this same spirit of a young boy, one stating that their child had seen the boy, and that the spirit was upset that the family would be staying in their room. Other potential spirits included: an old steamship captain who would walk from room to room smoking a cigar, an old lady that would sometimes accompany the young boy, and the spirit of a prostitute that would wear chokingly strong perfume and tear down the curtains. 
A few minutes after this, two more members of the group entered, John and his wife Anita. Anita is British, and did tours through some famously haunted castles, including the castle that Henry the eight used as his hunting lodge. We took a tour of the upstairs, including a room that a man had been dead for three days in before he was found. I felt a bit uncomfortable in that room, like I was being watched. After that we toured the other building before the group unpacked all their gear. 	
	
They first set up their investigation gear in the basement room of the B &amp; B, where a cave full of broken glass, bones, and pottery had been discovered. John and rocky set up microphones and night vision cameras, along with an electro magnetic field sensor, which can detect any entity’s presence, visible or not. 
	

John started the session attempting to communicate with the spirits using an EVP sensor, which can detect the voice of a spirit that others around it cannot detect. He started by asking the spirit simple questions.. to hear a spirits voice with an EVP, you need to listen to the playback, but none of those questions had elicited a response. He explained to me that if I were a ghost and a bunch of strangers waltzed up to me and started questioning me, what incentive would I have to communicate with them? I answered none, which is most often true. This is why it can be hard to communicate with an entity that is present.
 
After this, the rest of the group entered the suite, and Diana suggested we use a spirit box to attempt to open communication with them.  Diana explained it to me. “a spirit box is a machine that cycles through radio stations at a hundred stations per second. It allows a spirit to openly communicate with humans in real time” which is more than an EVP can do. We all sat in the corner with the spirit box running, and John and Diana questioned the spirits about all things that could relate to themselves or the building. 

After a few minutes of only static as a response, we moved into a different part of the suite. This time, john also recorded the session of the spirit box with is EVP sensor.  Right away when we started the spirit box, a mans voice said “Talk” with surprising clarity, and I immediately felt uncomfortable. I didn’t say anything and the session continued. We heard several more things, including a prolonged squeal I interpreted as Childs laughter, and “in the other room” which sufficiently frightened me. 

After this we went into the main floor where we were given pizza and the group further discussed the presence of spirits. Then myself, Rocky and Diana ventured upstairs to attempt to “scrye” out the spirits. Scrying is a method of communication with spirits that involves staring at another persons face across a candle. It is supposed to create positive energy between both parties involved, and give their faces appearence of the others past life, and potentially, entities around them. I had believed this to be silly, and I was of the impression that it would not work for me. However, after Diana had scryed with rocky several time, she had me switch places with him. 

I stared at her. She stared at me. In my mind, I knew this was all that was going to happen. But then, her face took the shape of a skull. Yes, a human skull. I was mortified, to say the least. I was shaken and terrified. The skull had appeared so realistic. I didn’t want to attempt it again, but Diana urged me on, and I accepted. This time she turned into a young Japanese girl and then a very old, angry woman. She informed me I had become two different Native American warriors, with similar facial paintings. This made her assume that both the warriors were from the same tribe. No spirits appeared to either of us, unfortunately, and at this point it was almost eleven o’clock, and I had to head for home.
	
I said goodbye to the group and left, but they stayed there for several more hours. I was positive I didn’t believe in ghosts. But now, I’m not so sure.

Being a teenager is tough.  Sometimes you just need to ask some questions, and I know a lot of you will have nobody you feel comfortable asking.  So from the comfortable anonymity of the net, ask away!  

I'm 22 - old enough that I've been through college and gotten a job, young enough that I'm not too far removed from the problems you'll all be experiencing now and in the near future.

I've been having breast pain for about a month on my left side. It wasn't so bad at first and I just moved across the country to start a new internship 3 weeks ago. Just little twinges here and there and a bit of tenderness. Last weekend it got terrible. Wearing a bra hurts so badly, it's more tender than it's ever been. And it just didn't feel right. So I made myself an appointment at Planned Parenthood. I'd never been there before and the doctor there was such a godsend. She was so nice to me, and the visit barely cost me anything since I only just started working... I swear I'll donate to them every year until I die.

But she felt that my breast tissue had hardened, and recommended seeing a breast specialist. Which all of them around here are in cancer centers. My mom died from cancer when I was two, a very close guy friend of mine just barely beat testicular cancer 6 months ago. I'm so scared. I'm only 21. I called the best looking place I could find on the list she gave me and got an appointment for Monday morning... I don't know what to expect. I don't know what's going to happen. All I know is I'm a ball of nerves and tears and I don't know what to do with myself. Trying to think positive, but it's hard...

If anybody has any advice to give me, I'd appreciate it more than I can really express right now. "
17tcwr,2,2013-02-03,[QUESTION] Looking for a tablet. Please help out a fellow redditor... :),ICanHandleTheTruths,tablets,https://www.reddit.com/r/tablets/comments/17tcwr/question_looking_for_a_tablet_please_help_out_a/,"Hey guys.

I am sick and tired of laptops as they keep crashing and failing -- not to mention their inherent immobility.

My 800-900 dollar laptop has been bugging out for the last year, and now it is too bad for me to handle. I was thinking about getting a tablet so that I cannot play high-end games so that I can get more work done. I am studying at the university and make a significant amount of projects. Additionally, I am going to China for my internship in autumn, so I would like to use my future tab for work as well.

As such, I am looking for a tab that is sturdy, while being able to play movies, play music, read PDF files, good to okay'ish for note-taking, and good for writing projects.

Now, my projects don't have a ton of visual stuff that would be problematic for a tablet. All that is needed for the project work is the ability to use a keyboard for writing. 

The tab and keyboard should be fairly cheap as I am a student, and money going to this tab will take money from my trip to China. I'm counting on spending about the same amount of cash as the Ipad 2 costs -- not including the accessories, ofc, in case the keyboard isn't part of the product. 
I would love for the capability to have GPS so that I can find my way around Beijing or Shanghai.

Any suggestions? Is it dumb of me to get a tab? I've read about bloggers using their tabs heavily for writing stuff, so it appears to be decent if used with a keyboard. Should I get a notebook instead? even though that won't allow me to be mobile and read on the bus and such. It would really be easier if I had a tab with a keyboard case -- but maybe it is naive or me to think that it will work?

Thoughts?

P.S: If you say that a tab can't be used for writing, please state why. =)"

I was accepted a year ago in education at the university, entered with my job experience in a youth center. 

-Prior to that, I was a multiple school drop-out in college, wasn’t able to attend to classes because I was late, or had nada motivation to get to school.-

Went to the local health center last week to get tricks to develop my organisation skills and through that, my motivation, I will have consultations in three month.

From 4 courses, I canceled 3 of them, one was my internship, which is gonna delay my diplomation to 1 year later, more debts, more motivation to build and not drop another time. Much more free time to waste on computer games. I’m a compulsive gamer, I lack that electric impulse in my muscle and brain to make my body stand up from in front of that computer and make something of my life, projects, achieve something once in a while. I’m in the prime of youth, or… well it is getting behind more and more and I am still not… proud of myself. Feeling incomplete, deliberately not using my capacities. But I don’t know how, and don’t know how to snap out of that debilating routine in front of that computer screen. 

Got myself thinking about an incident about 3 years ago when I got backstabbed in the middle of the night for no apparent reason and I got wondering what if that dude succeeded. I guess the response is obvious but still, it lingers from time to time.


UGH, 4 in the morning, we meet again.

17vvq1,7,2013-02-04,My [23/f] travels with a guy friend worries bf [25/m].  ,impetuous_gf,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/17vvq1/my_23f_travels_with_a_guy_friend_worries_bf_25m/,"Just looking for some input on if my behavior is normal.  I hate wall of texts so I'm going to break it down into bullet points.

* Boyfriend and I have known each other since March 2012.  He moved out to New York for the summer and we saw other people.  Have been officially dating since the end of October.

* Recently got cleared to start hiking again (broken ankle) and wanted to go on an extended trip so I went on a 3 day road trip (Friday afternoon-2:30a Monday) with my best friend from college, who happens to be a guy. My friend and I had been talking about going on a road trip for awhile but plans were not finalized until the Monday until before we left. I wanted to invite my boyfriend with but he is in law school, has multiple internships, as well as Arabic classes on Sunday, and I didn't want to pressure him into feeling obligated to go. 

* My friend and I at one point were unsure of our feelings for on another so we went on one date.  It was terribly awkward and we both decided we were better off friends.  This took place 3 years ago.  I had told my boyfriend this, but forgot to include the part that it happened so long ago.  

* While on our road trip we went to visit one of my female friends from high school and stayed at her house.  At no point did my friend and I share a bedroom and my high school friend joined us on all of our excursions.  Boyfriend knew we were staying my high school friend but wasn't aware of the sleeping situation as I can have a tendency to forget to include all the details.

* I texted the boyfriend during periods of cell service, saying things like ""I love you.""  Also called a few times, which were very strained.  Asked boyfriend if everything was ok and he stated he was stressed from school and work.

* On way back home I dropped my friend off at his apartment and then drove over to my boyfriends place to spend the rest of the night.  As we lay down to sleep the boyfriend says he felt very disrespected by my vacation.  He doesn't trust my friend and feels that if we weren't in a relationship that my friend would be trying to sleep with me, obviously finds me attractive, it's not normal for girlfriends to go on trips with guy friends, etc.  We talk, until 5a in the morning, with me filling in the information I forgot to initially include.  He says he feels better but is still wary of my friend, stating that it was disrespectful of my friend to propose a trip to me without running it by him.

So basically, is my behavior out of the norm?  While I do have female friends I have a tendency to be closer to my guy friends.  My guy friends climb, hike, camp, shoot, etc while my female friends like to gossip and watch girly television shows.  

Also, it seems double standard-y since the following weekend he had his female roommate drive him to an important doctors appointment and then spend the rest of the day meeting with her parents (a 14 hour trip overall, that he neglected to tell me about until a few days before hand).

tl;dr-traveling with opposite sex, communication failure, ugh.

PS- boyfriend has been linked post in case I have been overly biased.

**Edit:** Forgot to include that I had asked boyfriend if he was ok with the trip and boyfriend agreed to it and then later said he had reservations but didn't expound upon them.  Partially because I never probed and he didn't want to feel like an overbearing boyfriend.

**Edit2:** Boyfriend says it's not so much he didn't trust him but that he doesn't know him well enough and was operating on limited info and that limited info wasn't very good. Also, he didn't want to say anything while I was on the trip because he didn't want me to worry."
17vfpa,3,2013-02-04,"A really long, rambling writing about my current relationship. Just need to get everything out.",ConflictedDragon,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/17vfpa/a_really_long_rambling_writing_about_my_current/,"I honestly don’t really know what I am hoping to gain from writing this. I know that I am doing it at the request of my significant other, and that this is mostly done to appease him. I suppose aside from that, I am mainly doing this as a way to let everything inside my head out. Giving voice to the feelings that I always have to keep a tight rein on might help lessen their influence. 

It’s hard to even think of where to begin. Four years seems like such a short time, looking back at everything, but at the same time, trying to summarize all of the important events that have led to where I am now, especially in reference to a relationship, makes four years seem impossibly long.

Our relationship was really never supposed to happen. We met at a party, and I had every intention of it to be a one-night stand. I had recently moved and started attending college. The relationship I had been in crumbled when my boyfriend said I wasn’t worth moving for. It was too risky for him to quit his job to move with me, and he didn’t want to do a long distance relationship. At the time my 20-year-old self was crushed. I felt so unwanted. I spent the first two months after my move alone, trying to cope with the depression I was feeling. 

It was only after classes started that I began socializing with a few people that I seemed to click pretty well with. One night I was invited to a party, which I agreed to go to completely at random. I had no intentions of finding another boyfriend, I wasn’t even looking for anything sexual. When I started getting hit on by my current partner my first instinct was to leave. Part of me wanted the attention, though. It felt nice to know that I was still wanted and viewed as attractive. That part of me wanted to feel sexy. It was very out of character for me since I am mostly reserved and withdrawn from people, but he ended up coming home with me, and we had an awesome night. That part of me that wanted the attention also wanted to prove that I didn’t need a relationship to survive. I could have sex, and have it just be sex. 

I’m not really sure if all of that back story really matters in the grand scheme of things, but for me it does. My first relationship lasted for 5 years. I was very close to my first boyfriend, and truly viewed him as one of my best and closest friends. We actually still talk to each other, and I have been invited to attend his wedding. In comparison, the interaction that I was having with my current significant other was hallow and empty. There were not emotions invested in what we were doing.

I do not have that closeness with my current partner that I had with my first, and I feel part of that a large part of that has to do with how we met. We never had a foundation of friendship. After the first night it was supposed to be over, and I think it would have been except that he moved in with one of my classmates who lived in the same apartment complex as me, so I saw him fairly often. He would stay over more and more often until he pretty much stopped going ‘home’, and stayed with me as a way to not pay rent to my classmate. It was more out of convenience for him. I never asked for rent money, or help with paying for groceries since he didn’t have a job at the time.  I never nagged about job hunting. I never asked for help taking care of the apartment, or chores, or anything. He pretty much stayed at my apartment all day playing computer games. Looking back on it I feel I put up with that more because of my insecurities. I felt that if I said or did anything that would make him unhappy that I would become unwanted again, and I didn’t want to feel that way. 

There was never love or real affection involved in any of it in the beginning, and while I was ok with that for a while, eventually I started becoming depressed again. I missed cuddling after sex, or having someone who wanted me to cum. Sex was not about pleasure anymore with him. It was about him getting off and that was it.  I missed having someone that I felt I could talk to. Any time he asked for my opinion on something, and if my view differed from his he would run it over with his own view on things and tell me how what I felt or thought was wrong. It made me feel unvalued since I am of the mind set that a different opinion isn’t wrong, it’s just different. 

While for the most part we lined up sexually, I am a submissive as well as a masochist, and there are certain things that I enjoy sexually that most people would find extreme. My current partner, at the time, thought that my sexual wants were signs that I was mentally unstable, and that I needed medication.  I tried to explain my point of view, but he was never interested in exploring a BDSM style relationship, and so I felt a very important part of my personality was withering and dying. 

I had been comfortable with myself, my submission, and my sexual need for pain in my previous relationships. This was the first time that I was being told that I was bad, or ‘fucked up’ because of it. So along with feeling starved of affection, I was also being denied something that I felt I needed. I tried going without the pain and submission because I wanted him to be happy, and because I did not want to be alone, but eventually I could not keep going with it and I kicked him out of my apartment. It was hard for me. It was the first time I had broken up with someone, and I felt like a terrible person. I didn’t do it because I didn’t care for him. I did, but I was unhappy, and he was stagnating in life because I was allowing it. Breaking up would force him to do something for himself, and allow me the space I needed to heal. 

Things went well for about a month. I got over feeling lonely pretty fast, and I started feeling better about myself. A huge part of that had to do with going home for the holiday break. Being around family and old friends really helped me.

When I came back I realized I still had a few pieces of his clothing still mixed in with my stuff. Long drawn out story shortened… We ended up back together.  Not living together, but trying for an actual relationship this time. All of that was pretty much the first year of our relationship.

Our communication got slightly better and I confided in my fears about being incompatible with him. My need for submission and pain had not gone away. They were still part of me, and they were not something that I felt bad about because they were things that he did not approve of. 

When we reached what would have been our one year mark he wanted to do something special to celebrate, which sort of surprised me. With my first boyfriend we celebrated every month we were together. Part of that might have been the silliness of being in high school, but we always remembered to at least say happy anniversary to each other. My current partner never made a big deal about it, so when one year came around I didn’t feel that we had reached anything special. It was never a big deal before, why should it be now? For him, it marked the longest he had ever been with someone. For me, we still had several years to go before it became a recorded. That situation left sore feelings on both sides. 

In all honesty after that things sort of merge together as far as the time line goes. There are a handful of events that resonate very deeply with me, though.

Once we started dating he tried putting in more effort to be accepting of my submissive tendencies as well as my sexual preferences. There were a few times that we went to a BDSM establishment together as a way to ‘play’. However, all of these times ended in emotional disaster for me. One time, after we got home, he told me that part of why he did not enjoy going out to play publicly was because he was embarrassed to be associated with me while I did not have clothing on.  This was shortly after I had started regularly going to the gym.  I was starting to feel extremely good about myself and the progress I was seeing in my body. After that conversation I became extremely depressed, and it was the first time that I was legitimately suicidal. 

There was another time where I asked him what my submission meant to him, to which he replied, ‘It means nothing to me.’

During this time, my lease was getting ready to end. I would spend hours fighting with him about how I did not want to move into his apartment. We had already tried living together, where I was the only one to clean, cook, and maintain the apartment while still maintaining my grades in my classes. And while this time he did have a job, I did not want to go back to that type of situation. I also would not have had my own room, which is something that I desperately need. I am extremely introverted, and having my own room or a ‘safe space’ that I can go to as a way to get away from people is something that I can not go without for very long.

He ended up saying during one of our fights that he posted on 4chan about our situation, and that they replied with how I obviously didn’t care about him since I wanted to pay to stay away from him. I was furious. I cared deeply for him, and still do, and to be told that he was getting ‘advice’ from people that he constantly told me were trolls, and ‘the scum of the internet’ made me absolutely rage inside. 

I ended up moving in with mutual friends. I cannot recall anything else major happening during that time. I gave up on trying to have my BDSM needs fulfilled again. It didn’t seem worth it any more. I knew that it would only lead to me being disappointed or hurt and that it was better to just leave it alone. 

I ended up graduating, but my lease ended before them. As a result I moved into his apartment and took over the room that his old roommate and left. I was very hesitant to do this, but I had lived with him before, so I knew what I was getting into. I started an internship with one of my instructors, which kept me in the area, and since things were still rocky / bad between us I looked for a way out of the apartment, and found one. 

We broke up again, and he moved out of state to live with his family for a while. There is a bit more to it then than, but nothing that I feel pertains to the over all relationship. 

For a while we didn’t talk at all, but eventually we started messaging back and forth online. He moved back to the area, and since we both needed a roommate we moved in together under the strict, mutually agreed to terms that it would be a two-bedroom apartment, that we wouldn’t date each other, and that we wouldn’t date other people while we were roommates; the former because our relationship had not worked before, and the latter to avoid any awkwardness while we were living together. We knew we would end up having sex, since we had always been extremely sexual with each other, but we both felt that we could handle things.

We have been living together for about six months now. 

Now he says that he wants to have a relationship with me, but all I can think about when we talk are the emotional scars that I have now. I do not feel that I am attractive to him because he has stated that I’m not. He does not want to be in the type of relationship that I want to be in, so any relationship we have I feel will be unfulfilling for me. I still do not have the sense of closeness or safeness that I desire with a significant other. For me there are all of these signs that it would be a terrible, horrible thing to try, again. 

We are still having sex, and while that has been good I do not think it is enough. He has been making an effort to be more affectionate to me recently, since admitting to wanting a relationship again, but I feel I am too jaded for it to work. I feel that there is too much history between us for us to ever be able to function properly. 

There is so much more to it than that. And ultimately it comes down to me feeling too hurt and broken to try. There has been so much emotional pain and hurt over the past four years. Pain and hurt that I feel I did not deserved. I never felt listened to, or that my opinions were respected by him in the past, so now that he is trying to make an effort it is hard for me to change my own habits. I have been conditioned to expect my views to be used against me, so I have learned to not share them. 

We communicate in such different ways that even if we did have a relationship I think it would end up failing again. He is of the mindset that yelling and fighting are normal for relationships, where I do not function well in environments like that. 

But at the same time I still have these irrational emotions for him, and part of me does want to try for a relationship again. A part of me wants it to work and to be sunshine and rainbows. I want to believe that I can have the sort of happiness that I had in my first relationship again, but it has been so long that another side of me thinks that I just made those feelings up. That they only ever existed in dreams that were never real. 

I don’t know what to do at the moment. I am not really looking for advice, or help. There are too many things left out of this post to give anyone a clear take on the situation, and even if I had been able to cram four years into a single writing, it is only one side of the story, and as much as I tried to remain detached while writing, it is still a biased take on the situation. I’m sure his side would be much different than mine.  And I don’t mean to make it seem like everything is terrible. We do have really good times, too. When things are good, they are awesome. I wish the good times happened more often, or at least out weighed the bad times, so it felt worth the struggle to achieve them. 

I want it to feel like it is ok to be myself, and to feel accepted and valued for being who I am. I do not feel that I am a terrible person. I feel that I’m actually pretty awesome. I love doing things and helping people out, and making them happy; especially my significant others. I feel I do a lot to make life easier for those around me, and I get satisfaction out of doing it. That satisfaction dies when I feel like my efforts are fruitless and trivial though. And that’s how I feel right now. Cleaning the apartment doesn’t mean anything to him. Packing his lunches doesn’t show that I care. Doing outstanding work at my job doesn’t make me an attractive mate. Even dressing in nicer cloths than my normal baggy, black t-shirts and shorts doesn’t earn me compliments or praise. It just seems like no matter what I do, nothing matters, and it’s hard to want to try when it feels pointless. It’s hard to want to be pretty or attractive on the outside when on the inside I feel like I am slowly dying.

As I said in the beginning, I don’t think I’m really hoping to gain anything by writing this aside from voicing my thoughts. Writing everything out has help to untangle a few knots in all of the confusing emotional threads. I still don’t know where to go from here, but reflecting back on things has helped. 

For anyone that actually read this all the way through; thank you.  Feeling like I have shared these thoughts has made me feel a little more solid and balanced. Huzzah for the Internet.  I also apologize for the typos, if I had gone back to fix them I think I would have lost my nerve to post this.

The chef here is a painfully pretentious CIA grad who worked at Blackbird's in New York and thinks he's God's gift to the kitchen. Sure, it happens, I'm used to it.

The worst kicker, though? At the tail end of a 14 hour day (I intern in the mornings as well), everyone is leaving, and he stops and tells me that tonight I'll be deep cleaning/scrubbing the entire line (which hasn't seen a deep clean in *decades*) So here I am, dead, haven't had a day off in a month, won't have a day off in 3 more months, at the end of the longest day, scrubbing every inch of a decrepit line by myself.

I've probably also got around 15 D's, F's, W's (more D's and F's), no real relationships with any professors (although I am working on this as well) and I am approaching the end of my education with no prospects for jobs, internships, or any real rewarding life experience ahead of me.


I feel shitty and crappy and wondering why I'm still around. It seems almost selfish this insistence that suicide is bad when people like me could use it to weed ourselves out. I feel like a parasite to my parents even though most of my rage and self-esteem issues come from the years of physical abuse (my dad would use me as a punching bag when my mom wasn't around, slamming me against the elevator walls and I'd have bruises and contusions all around my shoulders and back), the emotional abuse (of being told by my dad that I was a ""good for nothing drug using slut that parties all night ""with my other ""whore friends"" when I was a band track honor student, my mom telling me that I was fat, a slob, my dad telling me that I was ""aggressive"" and no guy would ever want me because I wanted to play the violin when he wanted me to play the trumpet), the sexual abuse (being groped by my dad and told that he ""owned 50%"" of my body and he could do what he wanted with it, having my face slammed into the tile of the kitchen floor and knowing there was no way out). Being told that I'm responsible for the marriage break down and that I contribute to their lives being worse.


But no employer wants to hear any of that. No one (besides my partner) wants to deal with the baggage. They don't want to hear that by the time I got to college I was so angry, tired, pissed off that I had to re-learn what it meant to interact with normal people. That you could constructively criticize an idea without laying in to the person and being called an ""incestuous freak"" they way my dad would call me, because he and my my mom were separated but they had to share the 1 bedroom apartment so that he got the bedroom whereas my mom and I had to share a bed in the tiny living room because he refused to let us get a small cot and out it where he kept his huge drafting board from college that he never used and didn't want to sell because he wanted $25,000 (because that's how much he paid for it 30 years ago) when the going price on craigslist was for $6000.
No one really cares that most of college was spent picking up the pieces especially when I began getting the symptoms for interstitial cystitis and that I had to skip classes because I was in so much agony that I couldn't get out of bed but of course there was no way to prove I was in pain and OSD said ""good luck!"" and professors said ""Too bad"". That eventually I stood up for myself (with the help of my partner) and told them that I was not going to be their Doctor child and that I refused to apply to med school because it was not what I wanted to do.


Because to an employer or a grad program or even the peace corp, I have no relevant experience, no skills, not even grades...nothing to show. I have nothing to contribute. Even though I am back at school and studying as hard as I can, doing great at managing my flare ups, attempting to gain fluency in another language, going to therapy to deal with my mental health, and further trying to improve my interpersonal communication by assisting with the administration of a local book club.....it all seems to mean nothing. And it hurts. I just want it to stop hurting and I want to feel like I can be someone better than this, a happy, confident, sexy example that things can always get better."

http://www.reddit.com/r/usability/comments/16xgzw/majors_in_uni_for_ux/

Hi all,
I love UX and I love design, but I'm at a crossroads in what to major in at uni. I was rejected from the Informatics major, so I'm looking towards other ways to get into the UX field.
I have a couple development internships, currently doing a program management internship (kind of UX.. right?) and having a blast.
So the bottom line is what major would be a good one for UX?
I think the obvious ones are Computer Science, Informatics, Psychology, but what are some alternatives to that? Sociology?
Just trying to pick myself up after being rejected :).

17xqxp,607,2013-02-05,Don't start rumors about me.,banana-stand45,pettyrevenge,https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/17xqxp/dont_start_rumors_about_me/,"This is the story of possibly my greatest revenge on an enemy. During my sophomore year in college, I dated a guy who introduced me to probably the greatest apartment I have lived in to date. Great location, awesome parties, and lovable roommates. Four people lived in the apartment (boyfriend included) and two significant others would stay over frequently (myself included).

For most of the school year, everyone got along fabulously. Unfortunately, drama slowly built up between the other significant other and her partner. This significant other (let’s call her Tina) was overly dramatic, self-absorbed, and extremely two-faced. Around March, her partner figured out Tina was cheating on her and promptly dumped her ass. This became a problem because both had signed on to continue the lease for the next year. Tina kicks her ex-girlfriend off the lease for the following year and throws a hissy fit when we all aren’t moved out a week before our lease ended.

We begged her to let us keep a few pieces of furniture in the house before our next lease began, as we had nowhere to go, but she had no sympathy. She logged into another friend’s Facebook account to tell us off, so it looked like she did nothing wrong. Frustrated, we packed up our shit and got out.

By now, I was beyond frustrated with her, but I decided the best course of action would be to just ignore her and move on with my life.

My junior year rolls around, and I start my second year at an internship on campus in our LGBTA Office. There are about 7 or 8 interns every year working in the same space but with different assignments. Who walks in the first day? Tina. Fuck.

From day one, she started a crusade to ruin my life. Being passive aggressive, she would often leave notes blaming me for things or broadly stating how she hated drama and anyone who starts it needs to find a hobby. Everyone in the office fell in love with her after the first week, which completely got under my skin. What everyone didn’t see was her setting people up to fail so she could come in and save the day, her leading other girls on only to break their hearts intentionally, and her saying incredibly hurtful things to anyone who dared cross her path.

At first, I tried to tell everyone what she was doing and how she hurt people. This led to a meeting between the head of our department, Tina, and myself. I was scolded for spreading hurtful rumors as Tina cried crocodile tears. Later that day, she “accidentally” deleted a rather large Photoshop file I spent weeks on. She must have “accidentally” emptied the recycling bin too, my work was long gone.

I felt defeated. Since the LGBTA community was so tight knit, you couldn’t risk rejection. Otherwise you lose all your friends. By this point, a good portion of my friends weren’t returning calls or texts.

Eventually, she dated a close friend of mine then publicly dumped/humiliated her. My friend comes to me crying, telling me everything that happened. Apparently, Tina started spreading rumors about me throughout our community. She told them I lied because I was still bitter about losing the apartment to her. Finally, I figured out the perfect revenge. 

The Revenge:

The rumors were already out about me, so my credibility was shot. I did the only thing I could think of.

I was nice. Nice as FUCK.

Suddenly, I was friendly with her in the office. I laughed at her jokes, admired her work, and complimented her fashion. When we were out with friends (especially when Tina wasn’t there), I laughed about the good times we shared and how much fun she brings.

Tina had no idea what to do with my sudden kindness, so she started getting nastier in return. While I did not see it, current friends filled me in on what happened when I wasn’t there. Whenever I came up in conversation, Tina would start spewing hate about me and how I’m trying to get back at her. But when they talked to me, I would only sing her praises. During this time, she was also continuing to lead girls on and break their hearts.

Slowly but surely, I regained every one of my friends. After a year, every one of them apologized to me and told me everything she had them believing. The ENTIRE community turned on Tina afterwards. The administration asked her to leave her internship after discovering the mess she caused for me and other interns, all of her previous friends now unfriended her on Facebook, and she ended up leaving the community in a huff.

Best part? She could have prevented all of this if she didn’t try to spread rumors.

TL;DR: Bitchy ex-roommate spreads lies to make people hate me, I’m kind in return, everyone ends up hating her and she loses all of her friends."
17xe2v,2,2013-02-05,Basic Streaming Specs,Invisisniper,leagueoflegends,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/17xe2v/basic_streaming_specs/,"So, I've been considering taking up streaming as an additional hobby to playing LoL; it seems like something that I would enjoy being able to talk to any viewers while I play the game, and I feel like forcing myself to analyse the game as I play could make me a better player.

The main barrier at the moment is that I simply don't have a setup that could handle even the most basic streams. I play on a 2 year old laptop with reasonable specs; it may be able to handle the stream, but it's been slowing down recently so I couldn't guarantee it. What's more of a problem is that although I run a steady 6 Mb/s download allowing me to view streams, my measly upload speed of 0.6 Mb/s could definitely not handle running my own. Also, whenever I upload anything decent sized, even small youtube videos, my ping spikes to about 1.5k.

Fortunately, I am coming to the end of a summer internship, which should earn me enough to replace my current setup. So I ask you, reddit, what kind of streaming setup options are there, and what kind of specs would I need (both PC and internet speed) to run such a stream? Also, an estimation of cost would be very helpful (note that I live in Sydney, and IT related stuff tends to cost notably more here than it does elsewhere in the world, so cost estimations from fellow Aussies would be more helpful). Any general streaming advice for a new streamer would also be greatly appreciated."
17xe20,3,2013-02-05,Recounts of last night and a reminder to myself that I think I have a problem. ,zerothrowaway1,stopdrinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/17xe20/recounts_of_last_night_and_a_reminder_to_myself/,"I think this post is just to help myself actually recount why I need to stop drinking, or attempt to do more moderate drinking. 

I just could not sleep anymore, recounting yesterday's events just kept pouring into my mind. I just had to get up and try to make sense of things and now writing them down here. 

I am 23, in my senior year of college and the first time I had more than just a sip of alcohol was around 12/13 years old. The first month of the new year alone I have been blackout drunk about 5 times. I have always thought, ""well I am in college, I am just living up my life and having some fun right now until I need to grow-up"". A lot of my closest friends drink with me, while they are far more responsible and do not drink as much, they understand that my tolerance level is higher so they do not question my drinking habits as much. My mother has always been on my case about drinking, more recently my father as well, so I just try to not drink around them as much, or more controlled than usual. My sister and brother-in-law never really had a problem with my drinking, they went to a fairly big party school (OSU) and while they do not live that lifestyle anymore with having a child, they seemed to defend me with the same thing I though ""just living up my life right now"". 

My education while stressful for some (electrical engineering), I have just breezed most of my way and had a very laid back approach to it all. Last semester especially I would just drink and skip class most of the time, basically showing up for exams and such and doing a pretty good job of it. I figured, well I do not drink at or before work (an intern position I held at a prestigious company for over a year) and my schooling is still fine so alcohol can stay in the picture. On the weekends it was especially bad, I could go through a 5L mini keg a night while doing shots and still be ""fine"". While if I had to drive I would generally not touch any alcohol because I knew if I started, I would not stop... I feel this is my biggest issue and the reason I am writing this now. 

Recounting what I remember last night, I had class from 4-8pm but was at school earlier to work on my senior design project. Around 3pm, I send a text message to a good friend of mine for a drink with her and she agrees. The hours go by, I do not even remember how many I had, but I do remember she only had two (she can put back much more but is actually responsible). I do remember having one Narwhal (10%+), and roughly 5-6+? of Wild Black/Blue/Red (8%). This was from 3-~7pm, skipping both of my classes I was supposed to attend that day. We talked a lot, I really like this girl, both as a friend and somewhat of an emotional attachment more than that although she has a good boyfriend. I think this makes me drink more as well, thinking about how I am not with her, just being emotional, so I just drink more to not think about that and stay in a happy mood (another problem I think). I remember bringing up something to her after I have had quite a few and I think this was when she basically said it was time to leave the bar. I do not remember the exact words verbatim, but I basically questioned her fertility... I will not go into details but it was especially hurtful to her because I know how much she wants kids and here I am basically saying how she's getting closer to 30 and with all the unprotected sex she's had how come she has not gotten pregnant yet. I do not remember closing my tab but I have my card back so I must have. I do not remember the walk back to the lounge where I left my stuff. I vaguely remember her leaving me with some of my other friends basically saying for them to watch me and not let me drive yet. I vaguely remember leaving right after she left with my other friends trying to hold me back and reason with me to stay but it is hard for two guys at maybe 5' 5"" each 140/160lbs to hold me back at 6' 230 lbs fairly built. I do not remember the walk to my car, I do not remember most of the drive home. Here is where I scared myself this morning, I remember losing control of my car on the highway. I think I hit a patch of ice/snow on the far left hand lane doing roughly 80-90 (my usual speed so I am assuming I was going this). I crossed all 4 lanes of the highway and hit the other side wall with my car barely (I have not checked my car to confirm any damage). I immediately backup and continue driving and I am damn lucky no one was near me when it happened and no one got hurt. I get home and my parents question why I am home earlier than usual (roughly 7:40 at this time when I have class til 8). I do not remember the conversation after that, and I suspect they knew I was drunk. I immediately go to my room to sleep it off and wake up around 10 that night to eat some food before falling back to sleep. I wake up at 3, craving water, and then can't get back to sleep as I recount what happened yesterday. I finally get out of bed and think that I really need to change my habits, I need to do something, and being an avid redditor I assumed there would be a subreddit for this sort of thing. I look it up and took the AA quiz that was linked and answered yes to all 12 questions truthfully. I never thought of myself as truly and alcoholic, I just played it off, but now looking back at previous experiences... I wonder how I never stopped and did this before...

If you read this or not, it was more for myself but I thank you either way. I do not think I will stop drinking, I feel I need some way of telling myself to stop after 1-2. I look now at my desk where I have easily 100+ bottle caps of various beers littering my desk, and most were not there ~2 months ago. I look at the mini kegs laying around my drum set and recount how I would chug race myself because no one else was fast enough. I am a very competitive person so perhaps it trickles into my drinking habits. 

I want to change, I actually have plenty of people that care about me, they deserve to not see me kill myself on a highway from drunk driving, or even worse killing someone else. "
17wty7,19,2013-02-04,Relatively good life position but totally unsatisfied and just really confused about what to do,theresacatinmyroom,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/17wty7/relatively_good_life_position_but_totally/,"I graduated from college in May with a degree in sports business, interned with a professional sports team for almost a year, had a leadership position with the sports business club on campus, and was a student supervisor of the computer labs on campus. I was unable to get a job in professional sports right away and sort of panicked, so I ended up accidentally landing a job in the IT field. On the first day (orientation notwithstanding) I realized that I made a huge mistake and it's not what I want to do with my career. However, it's a job with health benefits, something way too many people I graduated with can't say (even just the job/career part).  

My plan was this: if I still felt it was the wrong choice in March, I would seriously ramp up my quest to get back into sports or at least marketing or PR. Why March? Because I would earn enough vacation time beforehand to go on a cruise with my family in February.  

Then hurricane Sandy came and changed all of that -- my family lost our house in the storm and we had to cancel our cruise. I lost my car in the process, and I used the insurance money to buy a used car so I could cut a monthly expense out of my life while also drastically lessening my insurance payments. I did this in preparation of taking a lower-paying job (or even a low-paying internship or something) and being able to, you know, live. I also had to move into an apartment because of the living situation and to lessen my commute (save gas/didn't have a car for two months after the hurricane).  

So here I am, almost 100 days removed from the hurricane and about 130 since I started at my job. I still don't like it after almost 4 and a half months. It's not what I want to do for a career. I don't have the charisma or personality to succeed as a salesperson in sports. I understand that if I want to get into sports, I'm going to have to either A. get more experience, whether it's an internship or what or B. become a salesperson. And I don't mean just get a sales job, I mean *become* a salesperson. And I don't think I can.  

I've started to look into the idea of Graduate Assistant position so I can get a monthly stipend and free tuition for a graduate program. I've started to apply for (and interview for) entry level marketing or public relations positions. I've applied for (and had a scheduled interview that got canceled for) sports sales positions.   

1. Grad school / graduate assistant - what happens when I do a 1- or 2-year program? How do I know I can find a full time job once that is over? What if I can't? 
2. Internship - how can I actually realistically afford this, especially when I don't have my parents' house to live at rent-free anymore? How do I know an internship is actually going to help me get hired?
3. Marketing/PR job - A lot of these are temps; what happens if they don't retain me after the 3- or 6-month temp period? What happens if I can't afford to do it?  

I don't know why I'm posting this or what advice I'm even looking for. I'm just really lost and really confused and it's a bad thing. I'm finding myself depressed, and my parents are really pushing me to just get used to my current job because it's a pretty good health benefits situation and there's a pension. But I can't see myself lasting here another year let alone the rest of my life.   

I feel like I was on the verge of great things back in April and May -- I had multiple leadership positions, a year's worth of internship experience, an awesome job interview out in California -- things were generally looking great. Now I'm in a job that I'm miserable at with no other leads, a lot of bills without enough money (paycheck to paycheck, barely surviving right now) and I have no direction or any idea how to get on the right path, or what the right path even is, or am I already on the right path and I just don't recognize it?  

I've started to go to sports networking events and career fairs throughout the area over the last month, just to try and get my bearings set, but even then, I'm doing it without aim. What am I doing? Where am I going?"

What is your personal motivation to apply for the HACU National Internship Program?

What are your academic and/or career goals?

What skills can you bring to an employer and what skills would you like to focus on throughout the internship?

My personal motivations to apply for this internship program include:

• Get professional experience in the fields that I am majoring in (accounting and finance). In this world’s competitive market having experience in my field of study with a very good company before I graduate would make me more appealing to potential employers and put me one step ahead of the competition, therefore increasing the changes that I get to choose which company to work for rather than being pressured on me by lack of opportunities.

• Test how I would cope with being away from my family. Being from a Mexican family where family is pretty much the most important thing, I want to try out for the first time what my mom calls “volar del nido” (to fly away from the nest), and be able to experience firsthand what it is like to live by myself with all the challenges that brings.

• I set a goal for myself to get an internship in 2013 with HACU so that I can get unique insights in my field of study and network with people from other parts of the world, so that I can expand my horizon and get to know how my country works a little better while doing so.

My career goal is to get my CPA and then work as an auditor or financial analyst in the FBI and be able to provide this agency the tools it needs to make its’ job easier and faster. I want to be able to catch people laundering money to contribute my grain of sand to this country which has given me so much. My academic goal is to graduate with a double major in accounting and finance with a concentration in financial analysis with a GPA &gt;3.00 and after that get my CPA certification.

I bring employers a different perspective into problems, which has been shaped by living in a house with a dual culture and being able to see the differences between one another. Other skill I bring to employers is good customer service, that I learned during the two years that I worked in the restaurant industry, where I also learned that being bilingual (like myself) is particularly important and useful specially living in a border town like I do.

During my internship I would like to focus on leadership skills, so that I can easily motivate other people as well as myself. I want to develop critical thinking, or as some people call it the “entrepreneur mind” which is the ability to see one step ahead than other people normally would and make decisions about it earlier and that way stay ahead of the competition. I want to learn how the software my company uses works so that I can troubleshoot problems and provide the clients my company has a superior customer service and support. I want to be able to acquire the skills needed to leave the company that I’m doing my internship with, better than when I first arrived there.

I'm just curious, how's the CS program over here? Is it challenging? Have you learned a lot? Most importantly, how are the internship and job opportunities?

The biggest appeal of going to SFSU is knowing that SF is such a powerhouse of hot start-up companies. I figured that with all these tech companies, SFSU's CS department would try to provide students with a solid preparation for the workforce.

Unless I get accepted to some UC, I will most likely be transferring here.

I'm almost shaking as I type this, so please bear with me.

After I graduated with my degree in journalism (minored in new-media), I won an internship at a professional blog in New York.  Well, after this, I don't know how professional they really are.

I've been working as assistant to the chief editor for three months, and I really love the edgy dynamics of our office staff.  It's a paid internship I won during my last quarter, and even though it's a paid internship, I barely make enough to pay for groceries and medicine.  Besides this, I've put up with the money situation because I love the idea of being a journalist and giving the underprivileged a voice on the internet.  Though there are a few assholes at my office, the people here have generally been pretty OK.  Until earlier today.

For the past two weeks, our PR department has been putting together a video package to be released on YouTube. The promotion involves all of the women in the editorial staff walking around in high heels posing posing in front of the camera, sometimes making horrible duck faces to be extra ""cute.""  The video is recorded at double speed with wind blasting on them for this slow motion effect when it's done in editing.  Our marketing guy says this will be dubbed over with a baratone voice talking about making the news ""sexy"" again.

There are so many things wrong with this that I feel like I can't keep it together.  Before I decided to write this post, I spent nearly half an hour sitting on my fire escape staring up in the sky, trying not to tear up. (Life pro tip: it's really hard to cry in freezing temperatures, so if you need to get it together, sitting out in in the cold after dark in New York city during February is a REALLY good way to keep yourself from breaking down.)

Here's what I take issue with:

1) These are not models, they are journalists.  More importantly, these are enlightened women who should be taking themselves more seriously as professional writers.

2) The PR and marketing department should be promoting our site as a NEWS site, showing how intelligent and insightful our writing staff are, both the men and the women.  As a woman who spent four years and a LOT of money studying to be a professional writer, I'd like to think of myself as an intellectual and not some piece of eyebacon for guys on YouTube to gawk at.

3) And this is the part that makes me tremble.  I know what guys on YouTube do, and you know as well.  Hell, look at most of the guys on reddit and what they talk about on /r/videos or /r/pics.  The women in this promotional video were fully clothed and not doing anything OVERTLY sexual, but come on.  Guys will look at this video, see attractive women being somewhat suggestive, and they will be sexually aroused.  As a woman, this makes my skin crawl.  If there's anything the /r/creepshots fiasco taught me (I've been lurking for about a year) it's that guys on the internet will masturbate to ANYTHING, porn or not, as long as the female form is displayed.  I don't want the women I work with and usually respect deeply being gawked at by some greasy redditor or YouTuber while he reclines in his computer chair back just far enough to unzip his pants and touch himself while MY COLLEAGUES make fools of themselves.

I went to the editor chief about this, and he laughed.  He said it's all in good fun, and that I shouldn't worry about it anyway.  All of the women volunteered to be in the video, but he doesn't understand.  He can't.  Until he's stood in front of a video camera in a red flowing dress and high heels, he can't defend this.  He has no idea and never will.

OK, I'll admit it.  I did cry.  I tried not to.  When I came home, my boyfriend Brad tried to make me feel better, but I won't talk to him.  I know he's done it, too.  The only two that can make me feel better right now are my two kitties Doctor and Zoidberg:

http://i.imgur.com/RAbu5Dy.jpg

PS: I know my boss reads reddit, so I am literally freaking out right now.

EDIT: Wow, I really feel so much better after talking to some of you!  You guys are great.  Some of the comments, however, have really made me wonder if someone from /r/mensrights linked to this page to exploit this story and make nasty comments about.

EDIT2:  I was turned away when I showed up to the office this morning.  My editor in chief informed me that my last paycheck will come in the mail next Thursday.  I don't know how to handle this.  Have I just been fired for voicing my concerns about sexism in the office?  I'm literally shaking right now."

I'm in college, male, about to turn 24 this month, studying game design, asset creation, environment design. I'm currently working on an animated short for one of my classes, which holds a lot of expectations from the 12 of us in it, and I've taken on a fairly large role coming up (If you know what animation rigging is..I have to learn it from scratch because no one knew how to)

It's almost my senior year, I have 3 semesters left after this one, and I know I should probably get working on my capstone this semester because people who don't start early get swallowed up by it...and this is our DEFINING moment of college. It's how we get jobs, and succeed post-academic life. 

Currently looking forward to internships, to help with the big job search after I graduate. Game design internships are not around here, so I have to look out towards Texas and California mostly, and that strings along its own issues (How would I pay rent for my single bedroom here if I'm there for 12 weeks?) but I know I want one..but I don't think I could take one....

My job in the IT call center on campus is soul sucking, and all I want to do is relax and not worry about things when I get home, but I can't afford to get a lower paying job really, and changing jobs is hard to do while in college (I work part time) at my pay level.

I like what I do..I enjoy it when I'm not feeling like this. I just feel like there is too much work, too many expectations, and I feel like I'm falling behind. I'm feeling unmotivated..but when I'm unproductive I just beat myself up and get depressed and I feel worse...I'm terrified of seeing a counselor of any sort...though I know I probably should.

Not sure why I posted this..just..looking to vent because I know most of the people I know don't care to hear this. I just feel constantly sad and like I'm drowning in everything around me, and I can't get out. I'm unhappy."

",[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/17zpea/my_father_is_a_vietnam_vet_with_well_ptsd_pretty/,"As I am growing older, am out of the house, and have gained a little perspective on my life and family situation, I only wish to come out of this in the end having established a healthier and happier relationship with my dad than what has existed the last 21 years. I am a junior in college, and have been having more and more problems with drugs and my mental health since freshman year. My dad has been physically and mentally abusive towards myself, my two sisters, and my mother for as long as I can remember. I have never been able to sit down and discuss this elephant in the room with anyone but my sisters and mom, and that first discussion did not take place until this past December. My mom finally sacked up and threw divorce papers his way while I was home over christmas break. The night after christmas that led to this decision was the worst state I have seen my father in in my entire life. He went from 0-60 in a matter of seconds, next thing I knew he was strangling me while I was fighting him off of my sister and mom, which resulted in the police removing him from our home. This is obviously not an isolated event, and the long term abuse has taken a toll on everyone in my family. 

While I am still not convinced he is a horrible person, two of the three of my half siblings who are all in their 30's and 40's and from his previous marriage, barely keep in touch with him. My half brother maintains virtually no contact with him, or even his younger half siblings, unless begged to come over for holidays by one of my sisters or myself. I have not spoken to my dad since that wonderful night, despite his pathetic attempts to be suddenly interested in helping me find an internship, etc. While I am not ready to speak with him yet, I am seeking out advice from anyone who is from a similar background, a professional (aka doctor, therapist, head shrinker, etc, etc, etc.), or anyone who has managed to fix a seemingly destroyed relationship. At the end of the day, he is still my dad. While I will never forgive him for many of his actions, I am still open to any way to try and mend what he has been broken the best I can. I know that he cannot help his upbringing, what he experience in war, and what it has done to his mental health. What I don't know, is if there is a possibility for me to improve my relationship with him before it's too late. He is turning 70 this year, his health is questionable, and his mental health could take a turn for the better or worse depending on how he deals with his second divorce. Any advice on how to better my relationship with him after this pivotal point as well as how to seek out help for him (although I don't really see him opening up in therapy) would be greatly appreciated. 

This is my first ever reddit post, I hope this subject is not too dreary. I am simply seeking any friendly advice or similar story that can help me improve my mental health as well as my relationship with that man, in hopes that there is some sort of happy ending to all of this."

It's taking me a lot of courage to post here right now. I don't know what to do, and I've stopped looking for relationship advice from my friends and family. I just need you right now.
i've been in a relationship for 4 plus years. It started the end of my junior year in high school and now i am a junior in college. 
He goes to a university 2 hours away, so I get to see him maybe three times a month. I started doing internships and would stay at his place, but now I am taking a full course load and finally able to stay by myself in an apartment...
When he does come over, he stays for around 3-4 days. He doesn't seem to understand that I have a copious amount of homework and papers to write. He constantly bugs me when I am studying, even though he promised to not. He is a slacker, doesn't know where he is going in his life, and very messy when he comes over. He expects me to clean up after him and only buys fast food to eat. He won't eat anything healthy and only eats out. I can't even make food for him, he is picky. He is also on depression medication and dropped two classes because of it. Let's just say, he's turned into someone I don't really find amazing or going somewhere with their life but, reddit, I am terrified. I'm scared. He has been my best friend for four years and really stuck by me. However, he wasn't emotionally there for me when my dad almost died earlier this year and completely ignored the situation. I would learn not to cry in front of him because it seemed like he didn't care....
I feel so insecure. Too insecure to leave him. I look at myself and think, ""who would want this?"" I don't know what to do. All my friends tell me if I'm unhappy I should leave. but I am super feminist (a woman's studies major, and an english major) and it's hard for me to date.
I have had an occurrence recently that really hurt me, too. I went out to dinner with an ex and he basically rejected me, telling me that I was just another girl and that I wasn't special.
I'm just really lost right now. Do I keep my loser bf that understands me in all my quirks and constantly says he loves me? Just give me advice and put me out of my college misery. Another concern I have is that I'm almost done with school and once i graduate (hopefully trying to go to grad school) that i won't have anyone.. 
Thanks for reading.

And i was fine at first due to all the adrenaline going through me at the time. But then i realized that it's going to be weird between us and the best part is we are both part of this internship so we have to be together all the time. And so now i'm feeling crumby due to that realization and i was paying the bills and it turns out that i am broke! Sweet deal for me.

It's hard to believe how quickly time passes. My birthday was actually better than previous years since I actually did something (sushi with a few friends) instead of sitting around at home not doing anything. I'm in a much better place now than I was last year when I turned 27: I dropped out of my PhD program, felt like shit all the time, and was horribly depressed. I'm now in school for something different, have an internship, and also work 25-30 hours a week. 

Despite making these changes, I still don't feel great a lot of the time. Being busy distracts me only so much. My mind tends to wander and I still remind myself that I'm now 28, live with my mom and have never had any sort of relationship. 

I feel that I *should* be happy: I have food to eat, a roof over my head, some disposable income, and I do have friends even if I don't see them all that often. But when I get up in the morning, the first thing I think of is that I'm still me, and that all this change is for nothing and I'm just going to end up worse than before. I'm worried that since I'm so far behind everyone else that it's not worth it to even start. Is it bad to find yourself being jealous of others because they're more successful than you? "

I'm currently a transfer student at a some-what reputable school for accounting (SUNY Binghamton). As I've been attending presentations by the big 4, I could not help but be attracted by all they have to offer. 

However, my issue is my grades. Since I've only been here for one semester (16 credits) I can still recover from my abysmal gpa (2.4). My question is what should I do now to pave the road to working for or landing a internship at any of the Big 4 or midsized firms? 

The only firm I am able to apply to intern at would be KPMG as they do not have a minimum grade requirement, although I doubt they would select me as, unfortunately, my resume is not strong either. 

Currently I'm trying to focus on building my resume by joining clubs, leadership positions on campus, and I'm also the treasurer for my fraternity (would that solidify my resume?). 

This summer I will intern at a small local firm with few clients... 

So reddit, I ask you. What should I do now to solidify my resume and pave the road to working for a midsized - big 4 firm?

I have a question regarding CompTIA A+ Certs. I know there are a ton of them in this sub (I did search) but figured I'd through in my own just to be clear/personalized.

I'm a current IT student (junior year) who has not gotten a cert. yet. I am looking for internships, and figured a cert would help improve my resume (as it's nowhere near jaw-dropping).

While other certs would be more ideal, (Network+ Security+, Linux+) I don't feel prepared for those yet, and figured A+ would be the quickest way to enhance my resume.

I took a PC Hardware class last semester that was supposed to lead up to/prepare for the A+ exams, so i feel with a little brushing up i'll be fine.

My question is this: Since the 700 series is being phased out by the 800 series, any vouchers I purchase will be good for either up until Aug (I plan on taking Feb or early Mar).

The 700 series does seem a bit easier (not as current) while the 800s have some simulations or hands-on from what it sounds like. I thought that while the 800 would be better content wise, the 700s would require less preparation.

Will employers see or care which version you took? As i am a full time student, should i take the 700s just for sake of ease/quickness as either will be valid?

**TL;DR: I can take A+ 700 or 800. Will employers know or care which one? Is one better?**

P.S. - Might as well throw this in here: for those of you in the tech field, any ideas on how to improve resumes for chances of scoring an internship and/or job?

I don't hope to do support/repair as a career, but figure it'd be a good launching point, as it's ""Industry recognized cert."" (yeah, whatever.) Looking to focus in networking and/or security. But in general, how would one go about improving resume for an IT field?

I recently got a part time engineering internship at a place that produces a radioactive compound for medical purposes. Because of its short half life, it has to be made in the very early morning.

Fortunately, I don't have to be there until 6AM on the days that I work. However, I have to wake up at 4 in order to get ready and drive there. This means that I go to bed early the night before, around 9PM.

In my apartment, there are two doors between my bed and the common area. If someone is watching TV or talking, both doors have to be closed for my bedroom to be quiet enough for me to sleep. (I've tried earplugs; I hate them). The first door is my bedroom door: no problem keeping that closed. However, one roommate has to go through the second door in order to get to his room or the bathroom from the common area.

And he left that door open four times last night, and I kept closing it. They were chatting, and the TV was playing the abomination known as ""Family Guy.""

So this morning, when I woke up at 4, I made no effort to be quiet.

TL;DR: Doors aren't for closing to keep sound out, right?



**#2**

On my way back from work this morning, there was a lady in an SUV behind me who kept swerving lanes to try to get past me. At the next intersection, we both turned onto the highway entrance ramp at the same time (there are two turning lanes). Where the ramp narrowed to one lane, she tried to cut me off instead of alternating cars. I sped up, blocked her cut, and forced her to merge the way she should have.

But now it was on. I kept ahead of her, and she got into the left lane to pass. I was in the next lane over and half a car length ahead. And that is where I stayed. Traffic thickened, and we kept pace with each other.

And then the left lane abruptly turned into a Left Exit Only lane. I had to resist the temptation to wave goodbye as she was forced off the highway.

TL;DR: Lady tries to save a few seconds by cutting me off. I cost her a whole lot more than a few seconds by tricking her into getting stuck in an exit only lane."

I'm scared of having to find a place to live next semester/next summer after I graduate. I'm scared of having to find an internship when I go to LA next spring because I'm not good enough for anything. I'm scared I won't be able to find a summer internship/job at all, let alone one that won't make me completely miserable. I'm afraid of not getting a career in the future. I'm afraid of not making enough to support myself/a family, if I'm lucky enough to start one someday.

I'm scared of opening up to other people because I'm afraid they'll make fun of me, and I've been bullied hard in the past. I'm afraid of making friends. I'm afraid of relationships for several reasons; they'll probably regret going out with me so why bother asking in the first place, I can't imagine how anyone would find me worthwhile, let alone attractive, and based on my track record if it's taken me until I'm 21 to even make out with someone then what hope do I have in the long run?

To sum up, I'm afraid of the future and everything that could possibly go wrong, because with my luck it probably will. I'm afraid of life, I'm afraid of death, I'm afraid of losing my hair, I'm afraid of bugs (ants I can deal with, but anything larger is a NOPE), and I'm afraid of hot things, which would again explain my luck with girls.

181q3k,1,2013-02-06,Should I take the CFA level 1?,[deleted],finance,https://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/181q3k/should_i_take_the_cfa_level_1/,"I recently started considering taking the exam.  I'm not too familiar with it though.  A little background:  I am a senior at college, planning on graduating in May with a Business degree, specialization in Finance.  The only ""job"" I've ever had in the finance field was an internship I had over the summer at a firm that buys/sells bonds.  I am taking a light course-load (12 credits) and was originally planning on finding a part-time job (hopefully in the finance field).  

I recently learned however, that seniors in college are eligible to take the exam.  As I've said before, I'm not too familiar with the exam.  So I have a few questions regarding it.  What are the benefits of taking the exam?  What are the benefits of taking it so early in my career?  If I should take the exam in June, should I focus solely on studying for it and taking my classes or will there sill be time for a part-time job?  Lastly, with the little experience I have in the Finance field, would it look better to have an internship/part-time job or passing the CFA level 1 on my resume?"
181kaq,2,2013-02-06,I fairly recently graduated with a BFA in graphic design and I really want to work at a design studio. Any tips?,three_picas,graphic_design,https://www.reddit.com/r/graphic_design/comments/181kaq/i_fairly_recently_graduated_with_a_bfa_in_graphic/,"I graduated last summer and due to some unfortunate circumstances, lack of available design jobs in my area, and poor planning, I have ended up at a job that is not ideal for me. 

So, I've decided to relocate to a bigger city once I can secure a job. For the past couple months, I have been applying to anything that I think I might be close to qualifying for. It's been really tough because I do have some professional experience, but not quite 2 years yet.

I have had two internships and I have done some freelance work. I also have done some design-type stuff for the small company that I currently work for, but that's not my main job there.

I think I need to rework some of my projects so that I can add them to my existing portfolio, and tailor it for the purpose of attaining employment at a branding studio. What do you think a portfolio for that kind of job should include? I love identity design, but I don't have a lot of that type of stuff on my site. How many identity projects do you think it should include?

I know that a good identity designer needs to show that they can be flexible with their style. I am afraid that my portfolio does not reflect that either, but I know I am capable of working in different styles. My better work tends to have similar qualities, though, so I feel the result is a portfolio that isn't diverse enough.

I know I could be a really great addition to someone's design/marketing team.. I am feeling a bit discouraged about it all, and I would love to know if you guys have any advice. I think I know what I need to do, but I feel like I could benefit from some outside perspective.
Thanks!"
185m43,1,2013-02-08,Disassociated and lost,Letmeleave,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/185m43/disassociated_and_lost/,"I don't really know where I'm going with this but I guess I have to start somewhere. 

I am 21 years old, a fresh college graduate. I graduated top of my class with a degree in concentrated advertising. I have two top 10 agency internships on my résumé, one of which was in California where things started escalating.

I went to one of the top stoner schools in the nation, Ithaca college. I went here despite knowing that my parents would never be able to pay off my loans at a private school but i just kept saying to myself ""im going to a good school to get a good education so i can get a high paying salary"". The mayor of the city is now known for verbally decriminalizing marijuana for the sense of wasting tax dollars. My whole college career was a joke. I moved into a suite of all sophomores my freshmen year. Living in a building of only suites led me to not make as many friends. Doors were always closed, people already had their groups of friends. I was alone. My roommate was not a pothead but enjoyed smoking on the reg at that period of time. I ended up joining the rowing team to make friends. All was well. My friend group began to get very competitive as you do on sports teams. I was always into working out and was on a minimum of two varsity teams in high school. After a while competing for spots on team got very intense, even after practice my fellow athletes would disassociate themselves from others. With my spot on the team very secure I found myself the subject of hate most of time... It wasn't the best team you could hope for that's for sure. Slowly I started hanging out with my, for lack of a better term, bizarre roommate. I had smoked in high school but nothing more than on weekends. But soon it was everyday. I would be rowing on the lake at 430am staring out of the boat, still coming down from the night before, loving life. Coach would yell at me to look forward when my mind would drift but all I could see is sun peaking over the far mountains. My times still held and he couldn't be mad though.

I found a friend group sophomore year that genuinely cared about each other. I quit crew when my gpa dropped below a 3.0 first semester sophomore and had taken up bodybuilding. I loved weed. It helped me eat, it helped me sleep, it helped me not care as much. I always wanted to make everyone I met happy and this made me realize I could not and just to accept it. But now it has gone the other way. I finally was able to quit weed when I decided to take an internship in California for the semester. I worked on campaigns for high name brand products that you use everyday. Soon work stress started to get too high and I got diagnosed with depression and anxiety to get my medical card. We were ranked top 3 in the world across the board and somehow someone saw something in this disassociated stoner to let me into this world. I guess it's that thought that kept me going. 

Before I left there I was offered an entry level position for 35K a year. I declined. I left the agency of my dreams because I knew I had to pay off 120K in loans plus interest.

Now I am still smoking everyday, I graduated a couple months ago and haven't done a thing to start my job search. I feel more alone than ever before and can't remember who I was before. I have about an eighth of weed left from the mass I bought before I left school. Once that is done I need to try to quit. My loans set in December and need a high paying job immediately. My ""friends"" only consist on codependent relationships. I have many connections but no relationships even with my family. My girlfriend of two and a half year, thank you to her, is the only one who knows me anymore. 

Thanks for listening, it was about time I did this. Having this down I hope will help me realize where I came from and where I'm going. I am disgraced about my four years at college and hope to just bridge the gap from the person I was in high school to the person I am now.

Love and respect to you all and good luck in your journeys."
185dle,2,2013-02-08,I[M21] am unsure if I should leave my GF[F21] of four years because of my identity crisis.,tornbtwheartandbrain,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/185dle/im21_am_unsure_if_i_should_leave_my_gff21_of_four/,"Warning: this will be a lot of text. **A lot**. TL;DR at bottom but it doesn't really do it justice.


Background: My girlfriend and I are both 21, she is in her senior year of college and I am in my junior year. We have been dating for 4 years starting senior year of high school. She is my best friend since preteens. This is my first relationship ever and she considers this the first serious relationship. She has no doubts in the relationship and have spoken of marriage and kids. I thought I had no doubts too but recently my thoughts have changed. We are in a long distance relationship and we see each other on every break and at least once a month. It used to be whether she was away or with me, I was happy. However over the past year, I felt more like the more she was away, the less happy I got. We talk every night and communicate often. We had our ups and downs but for the most part have gotten over most of it.


However, recently I have been depressed. There are a lot of reasons for this. First, I went to a junior college before transferring to a university. I am an introvert so making friends is really difficult for me. Since the transition, I have been more stressed and have no close friends. There are a few but I do not hang out with them often. I also commute to school a long ways (due to financial reasons), so I can't really meet new people per say. This is important because I basically depend on her for social interaction. So recently, I decided I need friends when I realized I don't know who I am. I have no vested interest at all. I like a few things but are not into them. As she describes, the only hobby I have is running, which I consider a chore to stay fit. I feel like I gave up every I was for her. I have no idea who I am anymore.


What do I mean when I say I gave up everything for her? When I was in high school, I was pretty much a nerd. I loved math and physics. I loved watching tv shows and every episode often. I loved watching every movie that came out. I loved playing video games. I was interested in cars so much that I wanted to work on my own. I had a pretty close circle of friends. Then, when we became an item that all slowly went away. First were the friends. This was entirely my fault. I paid so much attention to her because she wanted it and my friends and I drifted. Soon, we graduated and we didn't hear from each other again. I even rarely saw my cousin who I grew up with and is a brother to me. Interestingly he warned me that she was changing me and I needed to be myself and get to know myself better.


My girlfriend and I talk a lot on the phone when we were young since I didn't have texting. I loved playing video games and was somewhat addicted. I would talk to her while playing on the phone. Of course attention shifted from her to video games so she got angry. She wanted me to stop playing while on the phone. So I did. But sometimes I told her I wanted to play instead of hanging out with her all the time. She was visibly upset a lot by it. So, I quit. Not completely her fault as by this time college was starting so I was like, fuck it need to study anyways.


So I spent most of my time watching tv shows and movies and caught up on everything. This became basically my new and only hobby. However, when I was with her, she didn't want to watch certain shows that I loved (stuff like burn notice, community, and others). So slowly I would watch these on my own time, which was very little. Near the beginning of our relationship, since she moved to another state for college, she was lonely and leaned on me to support her so I did. We spent a lot of time on the phone, sometimes not really talking but just on the phone. I thought, okay, she needs me, I'll just watch it later. Later never came, now I watch only a few certain shows that we both enjoy only. We must watch at the same time too or else she'd be upset. Same with movies. But within the last year, when she made a lot of close friends, she would go see movies I would want to watch it without me and told me about later the night when we talk on the phone. She suddenly didn't make a big deal out of it anymore. I decided it wasn't a big deal, she could do that and I didn't care too much. When I have time I'd watch it later or so I thought.


On to friends. When I went to my first college, I eventually made friends. However, she was always mad if they were girls. She trusted me and knew I value loyalty a lot but she does have a jealous side. So she would visibly show she was upset on the phone when the subject came up. Even if I was hanging around them alone at school or gave them a ride. I would never cheat and she knew that. That's fine I thought, I can deal without having girls as friends or put them at a distance, no big deal. However, at the beginning she had a problem with me spending too much time with my guy friends too. Granted she didn't have much friends at the time, she wanted to talk and hang out with me even though it was only on the phone. Eventually she accepted it was healthy and I should be more social. But the damage was done. I decided I rather make her happy and spend more time with her than too much at school or with friends. This sadly included my cousin and sometimes family. When she was home on the weekends, she basically expected I'd be there early to nap with her and leave to go home at my curfew (I live at home and yes I still have a curfew). Basically couldnt leave her side. This meant that every time my best friend cousin or my family asked me to go out with them, I would turn them down cause I knew it would make her happy if I stayed with her. She liked this better because she would rather spend alone time with me instead of with family unless one or both our parents complained. Then we would hangout with them together. However, I always noticed it was always more times with her family then mine. That is part my fault too since I didn't fight it. I was also actively involved in school at that time. I volunteered a lot and got into internships over the summer. I eventually quit my volunteering because she wanted me to stay with her all the time (it was only once a week for 4 hours). I couldn't quit my internship though so I brought her along. She was still alittle upset by this even though she understood this was for my career. 


Then, there's sex. Sex is great and we are both givers for the most part. There was a lot of rough patches as she didn't want to try the things I wanted (no details cause she is very insecure about this). For some reason I cared a lot about this, I really wanted to push this even though I knew she was uncomfortable with it. Eventually, I got my sanity back and stopped pushing. I was more depressed as I felt I had nothing. I didn't feel appreciated. I told her how I felt like she didn't love me since I would do anything for her (which is true) until she eventually gave in. (Yeah I was an asshole at that moment, not proud). Even when she did, I didn't push it any further. I realized I was being a jerk and stopped asking her altogether for any of it. I was fine with the sex anyways. But ever since she ridiculed me about my preferences I was no longer comfortable with telling her any of my desires anymore. Also, I thought, doesn't matter as I'm never doing any of it again. I felt too guilty after allowing her to go through with giving me what I wanted.


Other misc. stuff: She always hinted at changing my wardrobe but my old one didn't really bother her either. It was only when my cousin changed his wardrobe did I change mine. I asked her advice and soon she was picking out my wardrobe. I let her basically go wild and I didn't object. I like my wardrobe now but it has a lot to do with my cousin and her influence. Also, my weight was getting out of control. I was always self conscious about my weight. She told me one day I was chubby and that she loved it but would be nice if I was healthier. Being me, I wanted to look good for her. Set a goal and went from size 33-34 to a 31 now. Huge change. If she wanted to change me I thought it was fine. It was all to make her happy anyways. Anything about my appearance she wanted to change or suggested, I would act on it immediately. Any attitude change she wanted, I acted on it immediately. However, if I ever criticized how she dressed or what to do with her appearance she got offended at first. Now she's okay with it but she drags it out and I believe makes excuses. For example, I was always attracted to blondes, asked if she would ever dye her hair blonde. She said no at first since she has a stigma attached to it (her dad also always believed she should be herself anyways). Then she said she would but only when she was out of her parents house since they would be super upset by it. I told that's fine I didn't mind. I also realized she was right, I shouldn't have asked her to change herself. So I dropped the issue altogether. I used to make a lot of money before I transferred to a university (relatively for a college student). Pretty much all of my money spent on her. I can honestly not remember the last object I bought for myself in the last year or even two. I think the last time I bought something for myself was Starcraft 2 besides food. Every penny I have earned went to buying her gifts (bags, iPad, clothes, etc), going on dates, or big trips like Disneyland, basically everything she ever wanted. Material objects never mattered to me (grew up poor, learned to cherish whatever I had) so she usually gave me sentimental gifts which I loved. However, some of the things I have hinted at wanting, she never did (things mentioned above).


The future seems blurry as well. As of now, it seems like I will have to go out of my state to attend medical school. However, she wants to come back home. She says she will go wherever I go but I feel bad of I have to take her away from home. Although she will be home my senior year and have time to spend with my family and hers, I don't know if she'll want to leave after that.


She is in no way a bad person. She is the most caring, considerate, cute person I have ever met although she can be bratty and selfish sometimes. She saved me from depression before and suicide (I know it's wrong now but I was an awkward high schooler and thought the world was over because nobody loved me, plus some issues with step-parent). As she got more mature, she was has gotten a lot better and tries to urge me to get back my social and personal life. She suggested I meet new people and get a different hobby. She even learns to cook, clean, do laundry, and bake because she feels like she needs to make up for it and since she believes we will be married one day. But honestly don't feel like I can do any of it. I am still in the mindset of making her happy regardless of cost. That all I need is to make her happy. To be honest, I think I would be perfectly fine living the rest of my life with her and making her happy even if it hurts and depresses me and I have nothing. It does make me very happy that she is happy, it is only when I am alone with my thoughts I get this depressed.


On top of this, I'm in college still. Hormones are raging. I see girls I feel much more attractive too (physically as I don't know them, but I do reserve that my girlfriend is beautiful in my eyes). I am essentially very lonely and have no one to confide in. My best friend (cousin) is a reservist and is currently deployed. Stress is high and time is running out. I'm not afraid to be alone but I am afraid I'll never be able to be with her if I leave. Afraid I won't meet someone else, let alone someone as fantastic as her.


I feel like I have lost my identity and don't know if I can get it back if I am with her. My brain says, in order to love someone, you have to be confident, love yourself, and be yourself. You have to have an identity that is not based on her and her influence. You have been sheltered and comfortable too long, haven't experienced life in any extent and need to do some self discovery. If it is meant to be, you guys will make it work after you have found yourself. At the same time, my heart says she is the one. No one else gets you like her, she is your best friend, you have a great relationship with no current problems, why so negative and want to leave? You'll never be as happy as you are when you are with her. Why break two hearts when you are happy? This will destroy both your families. You made a commitment and shouldn't go back on it (parents divorced), you're a man of your word. Love and loyalty are of the upmost importance. You love and care for her, what's more important than that? I am so torn. I have had little to no sleep for the last week being heartbroken.


So wise people of reddit, what should I do? What are your perspectives?


Side Note: sorry for long wall of text but I think it will give the full and better picture. Thanks for staying if you made it this far. If there is anything else you need, feel free to ask as I just spent the last 2 hours writing this and bound to have left something out. Also, sorry for the rant.


**TL;DR I am having an identity crisis as the last four years have been revolved around my girlfriend, which I love, but am very unhappy and can't shake being depressed. Should I break up with her to find myself?**

* Code that goes on rockets and spacecraft.
* Code that supports the design and manufacturing process of rockets and spacecraft.

We work on everything from large-scale web applications to tiny embedded computing platforms.  We build tech stacks on C#/MVC4/EF/MSSQL via REST to Javascript/Knockout/Handlebars/LESS, C++/Embedded Linux, Python, LabVIEW… which all together enables us to build, launch, and monitor stuff that goes to space.


**Some videos of our recent work:**

**Proof:**

http://imgur.com/bl8dlZ2

Edit: Poor Dan, everyone knows he was photo-shopped. Don't close your eyes next time! 

Edit 2 : We've been getting a lot of questions about how C#/MVC/etc have to do with rockets. They don't. At SpaceX we have 4 separate software teams:

1.  The Flight Software team is about 35 people.  We write all the code for Falcon 9, Grasshopper, and Dragon applications; and do the core platform work, also on those vehicles; we also write simulation software; test the flight code; write the communications and analysis software, deployed in our ground stations.  We also work in Mission Control to support active missions.

2. The Enterprise Information Systems team builds the internal software systems that makes spacex run. We wear many hats, but the flagship product we develop and release is an internal web application that nearly every person in the company uses. This includes the people that are creating purchase orders and filling our part inventory, engineers creating designs and work orders with those parts, technicians on the floor clocking in and seeing what today's work will be per those designs...and literally everything in between. There are commercially available products that do this but ours kicks major ass! SpaceX is transforming from a research and engineering company into a manufacturing one - which is critical to our success - and our team is on the forefront of making that happen. We leverage C#/MVC4/EF/SQL; Javascript/Knockout/Handlebars/LESS/etc and a super sexy REST API.

3. The Ground Software team is about 9 people. We primarily code in LabVIEW.  We develop the GUIs used in Mission and Launch control, for engineers and operators to monitor vehicle telemetry and command the rocket, spacecraft, and pad support equipment.  We are pushing high bandwidth data around a highly distributed system and implementing complex user interfaces with strict requirements to ensure operators can control and evaluate spacecraft in a timely manner.

4. The Avionics Test team works with the avionics hardware designers to write software for testing.  We catch problems with the hardware early; when it's time for integration and testing with flight software it better be a working unit.  The main objective is to write very comprehensive and robust software to be able to automate finding issues with the hardware at high volume.  The software usually runs during mechanical environmental tests.

Edit 3: Yes, we are doing a ton of hiring for these software positions that we have been talking about today. Interns and New Grads too! 

Edit 4: Thank you so much everyone! This is ending but most of the group will be back at 2:00pmPST to answer more questions. 

Edit 5: ...and we're back! Engineers from each of our engineering teams are present. Let us catch up a bit and start swering again (probably be about 5 minutes).

For all open software related positions, please go to http://www.spacex.com/software.php

**Edit 6: Thank you so much Reddit! This was a ton of fun. To all those asking about internships and employment, our suggestion is to apply online. Your resume will definitely get read. To all the students out there, GL with your midterms coming up and stick at it. Try and work on some side projects and get as much practical experience coding as possible before graduating. Happy Friday everyone!**

I didn't know you 1 year ago. When I dropped out from high school half a year before graduation. I had no future to look forwards to. I couldn't get a job. I couldn't go back to school.

I spent my days home alone looking for someone to take me in. Someone to give me an unpayed internship.

I got one job. One job for one day. It was awesome. I did my best. You were pleased. You told everyone at the office you were impressed. I got to come in 3 more times during 2 weeks. You said you loved how I acted. You hired me when no one else would.

You gave me a future, you took me in and gave me a purpose. You're only 10 years older than me, but you have been more than my boss. You have been my role model. I have cut down on my weed smoking just to make you proud of me, to show the world that you were correct. I'm good for something.

I have worked for you for 1 year now. I have made misstakes but you always shrugged it of and told me to learn from it.

Right before you left the office for the last time today you came to me. You told me that you're proud of me and that you knew you did the right thing when you hired me and that when I'm ready to face the world I will take it by storm.

You took me in when no one else wanted to. I will probably never tell you this but you have probably saved my life. In more ways than one.

I'm sitting at the office place you have given me when everyone else has left for the weekend and I am silently crying. I will miss you."

How I survived this long I don’t know. I saw that poor intern girl get cut to pieces right before my very eyes! I didn’t know what to do than either. I just stood there in shock, every cell in me frozen. My mind seemed to be twisting in on its self from exposure to such an instant upheaval of reality. It was searching for an explanation, a foot hold, anything that would work as a jumping point to process this new world. But there was nothing. At one point I managed to look away from her, only to see more of the beasts clumsily charging towards me, taking down whoever was unlucky enough to be within reach of their dreadful blades of bone and flesh. 

I looked down again at the girl, but upon seeing nothing but a mass of red pulp where she had laid I thought she managed to get away. However, the surge of optimism I felt could not have left me any quicker. Upon closer inspection I realized the red pulp I was staring at was her. With that my mind gained its foothold. I was out of that office building and headed for my home, the only place my feet seemed willing to take me.

Running down the blood drenched corridors of that city was surreal. It was as if someone had taken a planetary-sized shipment of paint and started spraying it with a hose on every surface. In the consumer district the doorways and windows of restaurants and shops where piled with bodies. As I ran past these places I’d occasionally slip in pools of blood which had made the metallic ground slick. 

I had almost reached the elevator that would take me from the consumer district to my apartment complex when I noticed something that even now perturbs me. The area was deserted. I was the only living being, man or beast. I stopped running and my eyes started darting around, from shop to shop, window to window, all drenched in red and filled with bodies. In the distance I could hear more people fall to the beasts, and yet here I was, in the most heavily populated area in this sector of the station, absolutely alone. I just stood there; my mind slowly began to twist again. It felt as though I was back at the office, staring at the intern girl being ripped apart by the beasts. I could see her clearly before me, an angelic face staring right at me with a comforting smile. Even the beast that was attacking her seemed to be at peace, each lunge of its blades piercing her side only to have the wound healed the moment the blade left her body; every appendage torn off her fragile figure instantly reattaching only to be torn off again. The beast seemed joyful for having found a companion to perpetually slaughter.

Then I heard a bird. Than another, and yet another until it sounded as if behind me an entire flock of crows had descended upon the consumer district to pick at the corpses. I remained still, afraid that my movement might scare them off, such beautiful creatures crows are. I was brought back to text books I had read as child about the forests of Earth, though I had never actually seen one myself. I had been breed and raised for the city, business was my game, even at a young age, and I never had time for such distractions; though I had always been curious. Eventually I turned, and expecting to see trees my mind completely twisted in on its self upon the sight I beheld instead. I could not understand why the crows looked and behaved so strangely. It was as if they were made of flesh and shaped like two wings without a body. They flew from corpse to corpse, holding them with hand-like talons and a beak that devoured them whole. They would engulf a corpse, and drop it again; moving on to the next corpse, and so on and so on. And after a moment, the dropped corpses would begin to move.
 
These were no crows, they were doves. They were bringing life back to this dead district. 

One approached me, and I let down my defenses. I saw in the wings of flesh the angelic face of the intern girl, however, this time the beast that was over her had a much more human face. The bird crept closer to me, and closer yet, until I could make out the image of the beasts on its wings. It was me. My hands knew nothing but the feeling of warm blood washing down the blades that had replaced my arms. My mind knew nothing but the sweet serenity of oneness with those whose bodies had been perfected along with mine. 

The dove was upon me, engulfing me, and for an instant I let it do its will. And I would have allowed it to change me into one of them had I not remembered the red pulp the beast had turned the intern girl into after its slaughter. My mind once again found its foot hold. Now before me there was no angelic face promising me an eternity, but only the fleshy monster wrapping its self around my head, blood drenched tentacles attempting to force me to submit. 

My hands clawed at the fleshy creature; however, I could get no hold on it. I could feel my body beginning to change, but I could not give up. Even as I sit here in fear, after having thought over the event many times, I do not know what strength of mind possessed me to continue to fight the creature's grasp. There was no hope and I knew it just as much as I know it now. But everything in me fought, almost to the death. 

A bright blast of energy exploded through my fleshy mask, and through the bits of matter and blood dripping from my face I could make out a man in a standard engineering suit, wielding a plasma cutter. He ran up to me, picked me up by the arm and yelled at me to run for it. He took off for the elevator, leaving me shell shocked. I looked down the streets of the district and saw just how many of these beasts had been created, and how many more were still to come. I turned toward the elevator and saw him beckoning for me to join him. I ran the few blocks I had left and gazed backwards, only half-aware, at the hundreds of beasts coming our way.

The doors closed and I pushed the button that would take me to my floor. I looked at the engineer; he was having a frantic conversation with someone, perhaps another engineer. Maybe they were trying to keep life support systems going. It seemed like a noble quest, one fitting of a man of such intelligence who chooses to serve the rest of society rather than rule it. There’s likely not much point in keeping this city alive, but a noble quest none the less.

 I did not speak for fear of interrupting his conversation and train of thought. Once the elevator reached my floor I got off. The engineer stayed behind, hit another button and nodded towards me before the doors closed.

I made my way to my apartment, but before the door opened I sat down. I’ve been staring at my door ever since. I’m tired, and even though the other side of that door has a bed; I’m too afraid to sleep. I’m hungry, and even though the other side of the door has food; I’m too sick to eat. I’m lonely, and even though the other side of that door has pictures of me and an intern girl, who I raised from birth, who I watched grow up; I’m too heartbroken to remember any of it.

1) Full-time entry-level operations at an insurance asset management firm (Chicago)

2) 3-month internship with a small investment management firm (New York City)

I think the NY opportunity would be a good way to get my foot in the door, and I also think I would have more choices in regard to career options. But again, this might end up only being a 3-month contract in which case I would be out of work if I couldn't find a FT position.

There are also cost of living and tax considerations, as well as the differences between cities in general.

Any and all advice is very much appreciated.

1879lh,26,2013-02-09,What experiences do you have where people have been uncomfortable with your minimalism?,[deleted],minimalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/minimalism/comments/1879lh/what_experiences_do_you_have_where_people_have/,"For me, I keep a very minimal desk at work. A single pen for my notepad, and my computer. I don't have anything on my walls, although I've thought about it. I had to move desks and it took me less than a minute to grab my bag, pen, notepad and walk over to my new desk and log in.

However, this new desk is used by interns and some part time staff occasionally. I don't mind sharing at all, because although I'm full time, I mostly need to just check email between fabricating things in the shop.

One day, a part-time staffer came in and she was surprised I had moved. I told her I didn't need to use my computer all day, so no worries if she needed it. I come back a couple hours later and she put up drawing and papers all along the walls, changed my computer screen setup, and threw a bunch of pens and pencils and markers into my pen holder. She had all her things spread out, multiple jackets hanging on my chairs, papers everywhere, and so on.

I don't know if she was simply uncomfortable with how plain it looked, or if she was being passive-aggressive, but I thought it was quite odd. Now I'm not sure really what to do. She's only in a couple mornings a week. I can't imagine altering someone else's space, especially if I was temporarily using their space. Ultimately I don't care, but looking at the clutter is bothersome at times. A coworker said ""Why don't you just put some of your things up on the walls as well to make it your own?"" 

**It seems like most people believe the only way to personalize a space is to add to it, whereas I feel most comfortable and expressed through a clean, efficient, open space. That's most reflective of who I am and what I value and enjoy.**

What are some of your odd experiences or encounters?"
186hjx,2,2013-02-09,"[MF] ""The Tease/Intern""",eroticwritingac,eroticliterature,https://www.reddit.com/r/eroticliterature/comments/186hjx/mf_the_teaseintern/,"The alarm rings as the clock strikes five a.m. and I slowly rise to my feet to stumble towards the kitchen to start my day as I have for the past year. I've really splurged on today's meal, with eggs and bacon as my main course and a shot of my favorite Orange Juice Vodka to finish it off. Alert as all hell I slip my shoes on, grab my coat and briefcase and lock my door behind me as I start my day. The walk to the train seems to be getting worse, always seems as if some sort of construction blocks the shortest route, turning my once one hour commute into a two hour ordeal to get to work on time. After zig-zagging side streets to find the station I board the train and take a seat. Sure most view the young businessman as a person of enthusiasm and energy, but this is not always so. I feel the touch of alcohol hit my body as I become more relaxed. My senses become dull for the moment and a new euphoria is found. My work is a few stops from my home and plenty of people seem to enter and exit each stop without my notice. Half asleep, I walk off the train and walk two blocks to the building I work at to start my workday and my ""paid time"" as I like to call it. I find my desk and begin to make my calls as I have done for my entire tenure here. 

Suddenly I'm broken from my cycle of mundane tasks by this seemingly angel like female, asking if I need assistance with anything. Surely this is a product of my sleep deprivation right? A few awkward seconds pass and I come to my senses that this female is real and is patiently awaiting my response. I tell this girl to sort my papers between my two active accounts, and she gets straight to work. Its hard not to notice her young body through the sexual clothing the others find as ""suitable business attire"". I strike up some quick conversation to find out a little bit about this angel, asking her what her official position is. Her response wasn't a surprise, ""Intern"" she said. As a recent graduate I knew right where she was, the ready-to graduate student finishing up their intern hours to get their degree. We make plans to meet up for dinner after work, and we split ways til then. 7:30 rolls around and we both arrive at a local place to grab some dinner. Shortly into our evening she asks me to act as her boyfriend, as her ex enters the restaurant. I quickly seize the opportunity by sliding into the bench next to her, and getting a quick feel for what she has got. The man sits down and asks the girl if they could talk privately. She continues by grabbing my hand and leading me to the door. She pulls my arm around her side and we leave the restaurant. Noticing the location of her college I offer to go home with her, as the area is known for crime and this hot body is likely to draw attention. After an hour of walking we arrive at her apartment when things take a turn, for the best. She unlocks her door, guides me inside where we proceed to make out, throwing all belongings to the side and sitting her up on the counter. After ten minutes of provocative kissing we part ways, and I head home. The next day at work we strike eye contact and I know that she's urging for more. That tight ass can't wait and I know it with my gut. An hour passes, and she drops a note on my desk reading ""Let's meet on the corner of fifth and X at 12:30"". 

I don't hesitate by nodding my horny little head and walking there by the specified time. A light hands grasps mine from behind and she leads me down the bustling street. We walk up some marble stairs to a lavish building in the center of the city. We enter the elevator as I question her as to where we are. No response from her, only a guiding hand down a wide hallway. She pulls a mysteriosu key fro mher pocket and opens a large wooden set of doors to a luxurious complex of a downtown loft. I close the door as she reaches into my pant pockets and pulls my phone onto the table. She places both of our devices in the center of the table and removes the batteries from both. She takes me to the main living room where she sits me down on a chair fit for a king. She turns facing the opposite way and slowly removes her winter jacket. Getting anxious I watch as she removes her tight skirt to leave her black lingerie top and bottom to stare at. 


She unwraps her hair, and lets her beautiful long brown hair out as she kisses my crotch. Quickly gaining an erection she slides my work pants off to find an erect cock pressing my underwear skyward. She uses her warm little hands to remove my underwear and stares deeply into my eyes the entire time. She faces the opposite way and presses my hot cock into her perfect ass, with her panties being the only thing to prevent me from going in. She stands only to remove the remaining clothing and proceeds by dropping to her knees, to place her mouth around my pulsing cock. Pushing her face deeper and deeper into my crotch she quickly turns around and presses her tight ass onto my cock. Screaming for mercy she slides my throbbing cock into her anus and continues by making extremely small moves. It's obvious that this is her first time and she blushes only seconds after penetration. We make our way to the shower and turn it to the hottest we can. Her amazing ass rubs against my body as we kiss in the steam. Her medium size chest gives my hands something to play with as my senses explode into a new sort of euphoria I've yet to experience. 

I lay her perfect body onto the floor of the massive shower and cycle between her perfect pussy and asshole. 



She screams in excitement and most likely orgasm. Getting close to orgasm myself, I remove my pulsing cock from her ass and explode all over her long hair. We quickly clean up and head out, promising to keep this our little secret.

This is my first story, I'm not sure whether to be very detailed or not, if you could add insight that would be fantastic. Thanks for reading!"

I'm back again a few months later to say that we're still hiring! 

The company is Fullscreen. We are the #1 independent YouTube Network, with ~1.8b monthly views. In addition to YouTube content, we also work directly with many large brands (NBC, Lexus, Google, Pepsi, American Express, Nintendo, and others) to help them manage and improve their YouTube presence.  

We're hiring both front-end and back-end application developers (JavaScript, Rails).  This time, we're looking for people with experience and/or demonstrable skills.  Rails devs are a bit more self-explanatory, but I do want to point out that we are looking specifically for JavaScript devs who are comfortable developing JS-based web apps and who are at least familiar with using jQuery, underscore.js, and/or CoffeeScript.   

We're also looking to line up an intern or two for the summer.  We want people who are in CS, CompE, HCI, or similar fields and who are capable of cutting code of some sort.  Exact responsibilities would depend a bit on the person and their abilities/experience.  The positions will be, of course, in Atlanta.

Our primary wants:

* You're smart and/or good at problem solving
* You're interested in learning new things
* You can get stuff done without micromanagement.
* You have an appropriate background and experience (Ruby/Rails, JavaScript app dev).  Degree not required.
* You're a good cultural fit.

What you'll get out of this:

* You'll be working on a small team in a startup environment.
* Product ownership. We build out a lot of things. You'll build something, too, and see it through the full product life cycle.
* Learning. We're building products for a market in its infancy. We're constantly doing something new and learning as we go.
* A fast-growing company. We're currently undergoing explosive growth.
* A tech budget. Get some $ to buy the setup you prefer.
* The flexibility that comes with results-oriented development.  We don't have set hours and if you need to work from home sometimes, that's fine with us.  
* Standard company benefits -- competitive salary, health/dental/vision, free snacks and drinks, etc..

For more info, check out our super awesome webpage http://fullscreen.net or email me directly at mitchell at fullscreen.net.  We've had problems in the past with people's emails going to my spam folder, so pinging me here might also be a good idea.

P.S.: If you're interesting in moving to Los Angeles, we have some openings in our main office as well."

189vda,0,2013-02-10,Le Debate,[deleted],hcfactions,https://www.reddit.com/r/hcfactions/comments/189vda/le_debate/,"I honestly do not understand why everyone acts like we are such **god awful** *terrible* people, can someone explain it to me? I'll try to address some points where I think you get it from. 

* **Kick and Kill of ChubbyMoose**

He was [planning](http://i.imgur.com/97Zobrk.png) on betraying us, and we just happened to get rid of everybody we deemed untrustworthy shortly before hand. So don't believe him when he acts all innocent, he didn't smart his way out, he actually got temp-banned for combat logging against us and we got his inventory. He is the only one who got killed.

* **Inviting ""noobs"" over to join us and then killing them**

As many of you know, Reid and I are not the best fighters on the server. If somebody goes and says ""Hey, I have full diamond can I join you?"", we jump on that. We only had four active men most of the time, so we couldn't contest King of the Hill or Palace, and mining is unnecessary. The only way for us to increase coffers is shady tactics like so. I never once said one of these people could join us, I only said that they could trade, or intern with us to have a **chance** to join us. Either way it teaches the valuable rule #1, to trust **NOBODY**.

 * **Killing people who come to trade**

This ties to my last point. We have done this once or twice this map, and its a rather effective tactic. I mean, its a **Hardcore** server, so if someone comes into my base with things I want, should I pay them or just kill them? And onto attacking Zigman, we're on rather shitty terms with Platypus right now. It's hard to want them alive when Smiggyballs tried to get me killed last map, and with them setting us up in a trap this map.

 * **Noobkilling**

We had (1) member on that list. We don't invite noobs over to kill, if we find them in the wilderness we will kill them. Like I said above, we need all the resources we can get. Sometimes we get sticks, sometimes we get four or five diamonds, its a risk. If they aren't in a safe place by the time their protection is out, they need some more practice. Plus, there are **many** other players that are highly regarded on that same list, even higher above. Pikaoku told me I was a horrible noob killer, although Punkrocker, Boweee, and Russian_Roulette are all on the list/in his faction. In the next five minutes, he killed the same unarmed player twice.

 * **Trolling in chat**

This one actually makes me laugh. We play on a server were ""le"", ""x2013"", and ""fite me irl"" is said maybe hundreds of times daily. So what if we say ""u mad"" after a fight, who actually cares? It is a **joke**. Earlier this map I was joking around with the server and y'all freaked out calling me a troll and evil. Seriously, look in a mirror. Some of the people here are actually **bad** people, and everyones okay with them. 


 * **Conclusion**
  
I'd just like to remind everybody that this is a game, which is played to have fun. Albeit more hardcore than most, its purpose is still recreation. This is how we have fun. If we were in a large faction, these wouldn't be our actions, but we aren't and this has been the most fun i've ever had on HCF. I've experienced a mob mentality against my faction for reasons I do not comprehend, and some really mean shit has been said to me. CaptainPaanda said that ""You are worse than Hitler because he eventually killed himself"", that was actually really funny though. Everybody just needs to calm down, and start worrying about themselves.

189fcb,3,2013-02-10,Just venting,DeusExMachina09,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/189fcb/just_venting/,"I've been lurking on Reddit for awhile now and I just need to vent on how the past two months has been for me. Just for background I am a recent college grad with an I.T degree. I am also going to a S.A.T. therapist to work out some compulsive issues that i have.

So to say that I had a shitty past two months would be an understatement. As explained above I am a recent college grad and for the past six months I've been doing a really good internship that had a good chance to be turning into full time position. Last month I learned that I was not going to be hire nor was my internship going to be extended due to ""budget cuts"". I write ""budget cuts"" because I feel like I did not meet their expectations and that they do not want to come out and say that. Needless to say I've been trying ever since to find another job/internship with no luck and I am getting nervous because I moved into the area where the internship was located and now stuck in a year lease.

As I also stated above I've been seeing a S.A.T. therapist for about four months now to work out some issues. The main reason that go me going was my girlfriend( of over four years) wanted to see me get better. Now though my girlfriend is telling me I've been too depressed lately and haven't been talking much lately for her to be happy with us anymore. So two weeks ago we started a ""break"" to try to work through things which I prefer not to but accepted to keep her happy. And now a couple of days ago she ended things with me after coming out and saying that she formed an emotional relationship with a guy friend and is now confused on what she want. We I would been more ok with if we just ended things there. But she is stringing me along to try and see if we can fix things while still talking to the other guy. I  know I am not the boyfriend of the year material but all of these event are happening at the same time and is bring my already low self-esteem even lower. I just needed to vent for a minute so just enjoy your day..

1898di,3,2013-02-10,"Year long relationship ended after she [21F] broke up with me [21M], Here's my story.",Nemesis3137,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1898di/year_long_relationship_ended_after_she_21f_broke/,"/r/breakups, this has been the hardest week of my life. Here is a little background to my story. I met this girl over a year ago at an event with some friends. As soon as I saw her I thought she was amazingly beautiful. I shortly find out that shes good friends with one of my friends so I start hanging out with him more to create a way to see and talk to this girl. (I'm incredibly shy and didn't want to approach her alone). I hung out more and more with this girl and decided to ask her to be my date to a formal student group event. She told me that she'd love to go with me and that's where my memories with her started. I cannot get that out of my head. A couple of days after that date night I ask her to be my girlfriend and she says yes. She also surprises me by saying shes never had a boyfriend before but just did a lot of hooking up in the past. Anyways we create an incredible amount of memories together and after about 6 months i tell her that I love her and she tells me that she loves me too. 

Fast forward to last summer, things start getting more difficult with us. I remained on campus to take summer classes while she went home to work for the summer. The separation bothered me and I did talk to her about it but she seemed like it didn't bother her and that she could handle it well. I remained confident that we could get through it and I got to see her at least every other weekend. 

Fall comes around and she comes back to school but I get a co-op (internship thing). Luckily it is in the same city so I could continue to see her. However, her major starts to get really difficult and she stresses out very easy. She says to me that she cant see me as much as we used to because of how much work she has to do in her design program. This spawned a couple of arguments but I got her to agree spending the night with me at least once during the week and once during the weekend. On top of being stressed out from her school work, she also had to find a co-op job for the spring semester which was very intimidating for her. There were something like 40 jobs and 90 kids in her program competing for them. At the end of fall semester she gets a job but its in a city 4 hours away. I start to stress out as I know as everyday moves by shes getting closer to leaving. I talked to her about my worries and asked her why shes not stressed like I am. She told me shes had an exhausting semester and at this point it doesn't feel real to her. 

Anyways, winter break rolls around but I never got to see her during it because she went away for the entire break. After break I briefly saw her for 2 hours on one day and when i first saw here and went in for a kiss she kinda turned her head like she didn't want to. I found that odd. I thought this was going to be the last time id see her for a while so i wanted her to come over to my place so we could spend more time together but she said shed be back the next day to say her goodbyes to everyone else. I stick with her that next day as she says her goodbyes and I couldn't help but wonder why her goodbyes to other people seemed so much more genuine then ours. Anyways I talk to her before she leaves and she seems optimistic about doing long distance for the semester. I tell her I want to talk every night and she said okay but I have to call her, not always rely on her to call me. She leaves and I begin to miss her an incredible amount. I did call her most nights and whenever I told her I loved her, sometimes she would say she loves me too, some times she would just say you too or me too and that kinda bothered me but i never brought it up. 

Fast forward again to last Saturday, she texts me, ""Hey I decided to come into town this weekend, I want to see you I feel like I need to talk."" I immediately get worried as I don't take that texts last part to mean good things. I ask all my friends and they advise me to stay optimistic but prepare for the worst. Anyways, she finally comes by and i decided to act normal just to see if i was wrong and I knew i wasn't she walked up to me with teared eyes and I hugged and and just said hey..she then asked to go inside and talk. Now for the breakup part, She tells me i'm a great person and i didn't do anything wrong, but her feelings for me have changed and shes not able to say why but this is how it is. She says she loves me and cares about me but she is not In love with me. She then tells me it was since last summer shes been having these thoughts and she wanted to try sticking it out and seeing if they changed but they didn't. She didn't want to break up with me last fall because i was going through a hard time with co-op but she has to now because she realizes there is no good time. Learning that shes been thinking this way for a while struck me hard because I knew i felt her love during the summer and fall and I only felt things getting different when she came back from winter break. Anyways, I did what anyone would tell you not to do and I begged her, told her how much I loved her and how she was perfect for me and I couldn't do being alone now. She was my guidance through my tough times in college and i needed her. She then tells me that I can still call her and talk to her about things bothering me and she wants to be a friend for me but she cant be with me because shes not happy and she cant say the same things i feel about her to me. I beg and I beg and she says she needs to go but mentions something about maybe agreeing to call her in 3 weeks and talk about it again after its sunk in better for me and Ive accepted it. She couldn't look me in the eyes very well during the breakup and I couldnt stop crying on her and I asked her if we could ever be together again and she just shook her head but when i asked more she just said she doesnt know where her feelings will be but right now they are not there so that seems impossible. I also just tried to say that maybe she just needs a break from us and she said no this is a break up and we will not be in a relationship after this. I wonder if theres someone else and i ask her but she said she doesnt have her eye on anyone this is just how she feels and it feels not right being with me. I Finally I just give up. I let her go but made her promise to me that she will think more about it more and come see me again when she comes back into town at the end of march. She says she will but I will have to respect her if her thoughts about me haven't changed. She leaves and I know that's the last time I will see her for a while. 

That was over a week ago and now Ive been going through a terrible week full of what ifs and how can i get back with her. Ive talked with so many people and everyone just says the same thing about having to move on and accept things but I just cant think about that right now. Its different because I think about how my life will be without her. Shes friends and hangs out with a bunch of guys I live with. She also goes to the same events I go to off campus. I know I will see her a lot when she comes back from co-op. I start taking peoples advice and going to the gym to try to feel better that way, of course it doesn't work because my mind has her constantly in my thoughts. I start coming up with my own reasons as to why shes done this and I think about how I can get her to find why she used to love me. I haven't spoke to her since she left and i decided to go NC with her for 3 weeks total (because she said this # during our breakup) to see if that would do anything. I feel like it will help both me and her by giving us both space and maybe space is what she wants. I cant stop thinking about questions that I have like what is she doing? who is she talking to? How does she feel at this point? Does she miss me? Does she ever think for a second that maybe she made a mistake? Is it inevitable for her to miss me? she couldn't possibly break up with me and not miss me..Anyways I have 2 weeks left before I am going to call her and trust me Ive heard from everyone Ive talked to its a bad idea to get my hopes up like this but It just feels like what i have to do. I don't know what im going to do when i talk to her, ill want to say how much i miss her and ask her questions but I don't want to freak her out and ruin everything. So im stuck between wondering if I should make small talk or bring up the relationship. It's very hard for me to be strong and move on because i get attached to people. I would say I have less friends then most people but the people who I call my friends I would do anything for. I'm not the best sociable person but that's an aspect about her that she is incredible in. That's why it felt like we were good together I think, because we complimented each other in so many ways. I see her on Facebook and I just want to talk to her but I cant because I don't want to ruin things..I have my 3 week NC plan and its the only thing that I feel gets me through these days and this stressful difficult semester of classes. 

So I guess Im writing because I want more advice. Especially from this subreddit. Ive been reading stories the past couple of days and just trying to relate. All my friends don't seem to understand but it seems like a lot of you are going through the same depressing thoughts. If you managed to read through this whole thing I thank you so much for giving me time. I just don't know how I should progress if I want this girl back and would do anything for her. There are too many memories for me to simply get over this. Any thoughts or comments or questions are appreciated..thanks. "

I was wondering if anybody knows where I can rent a nice/safe 1 bedroom apartment or if anyone knows or anyone that needs a roommate. Here is a bit about myself. 

I am looking for a roommate beginning Late February / Early March of 2013. I am currently living in West Palm Beach but will be moving to Norfolk before February 18th to start my new job (will be there by the 16th). Have good credit, pay on time, very clean, I cook, and like going out. 

I am 23 year old male. Love playing and watching sports. Keep the common areas very clean. Graduated from UNC with a Business Administration and Mathematics degree.

Don't know anyone in the area but my girlfriend will occasionally visit for a weekend once a month and I’ll be going to Chapel Hill once or twice a month to visit her. She may have an internship during the summer so there is a possibility she might need a place (she would cover utilities and any compensation necessary). 

Message me or reply if you do know of anything.

**Untitled**

By the time I hear the screaming in Arabic, I have a pretty good idea what's going on. 

We'd be on the tarmac at LGA for three hours at that point, with repeated assurances from the pilot that the ""mechanical concern"" keeping us from taxing up to the gate would be resolved quickly. At least this is what has been explained to me by the marketing executive who stole my window seat. Truth be told, I've barely listened to a word of Don Draper's life story, nodding with feigned interest between Xanax and cocktails. I'd tuned his frequency out almost completely when the words ""security situation"", fully dressed in Texan drawl, pierce their way through my drug-fueled haze.


This is the same haze that keeps me from remembering I am claustrophobic. The same haze that keeps me from remembering the exact materials composing the sardines can in which I am rocketing through the atmosphere. Today, it is also the same haze that helps me forget I will likely be unemployed by this time tomorrow.


I fix satellites for a living. The by-product of a half-decent electrical engineering degree and a summer spent playing office sports at a telecom company in Queens. That latter part is called an internship, so I'm told. My employer, the NRO, is one of Uncle Sam's many little helpers. They tell me I am incredibly gifted in my field, so much so that my reliance on anxiety medication is worth overlooking in the security clearance process. More recently, they tell me I am doing so well that they are adding the words ""Chief Engineer""  to my title. I'm told this is important as well. At the time, I briefly laugh at the idea that this will be added to my birth certificate as part of my legal name. The laughter stops when I remember my employer does things like this before breakfast.


I travel extensively for this line of work. Tinkering on items that don't exist, in places that don't show up on maps, and filing reports to people without real names. We then occasionally send these items into space.


My last tinkering expedition, the one I'm returning from now, was something new. Usually I go to a military base or somewhere with an abundance of gates and incredibly well-painted logos involving eagles. This trip takes me to a warehouse in Sydney. Inside, bureaucrats watch as I re-assemble the surveillance payload provided to me by the liaison team and transmit a written report on-site back to Washington before being whisked back to my hotel, where I will remain under supervision for the duration of the week. I ask no questions of what I am working on or what it will be used for, and the bureaucrats ask none of me.


Several days later, my guard informs me I am being driven back to the warehouse. Another first, as the rule book states I am never to return to the site of an operation once I have finished working, and Uncle Sam loves his rule book.  The bureaucrats are prowling around a hastily assembled conference table like jungle predators when I get there, speaking a language so riddled with profanity I am not quite sure its English. My arrival causes the room's occupants to freeze, and it becomes painfully clear I am the raw meat.


It turns out my surveillance payload was quietly sent into space, and the information it gathered was used to make the decision to send men with guns into a place where Uncle Sam has been explicitly told both men and guns are not supposed to be. It then turns out that this information was wrong because of the faulty work that I did. As a result, several men, and their guns, did not successfully return to the United States. 


""Security situation"". The words pull the Xanax blanket off from over my head again, bringing me back to the plane and keeping me away from memory. Don Draper motions to me to look at his phone, waving it frantically until it is an iPhone-shaped blur in my peripheral. I cave and skim the headline, ""An evolving security situation has been reported on Flight 802 at LGA, the aircraft is being quarantined. More updates to come."" 


I look around for the first time since take-off and see the sharp glow of cell phones against the unlit cabin, hearing the concerned murmuring of one-hundred and six passengers and six crew members. I'm squinting through the liquor when the first wave of panic hits me, as I understand I am now smack in the middle of something alarming instead of watching it happen from a satellite feed. The noises spreading throughout the cabin make it pretty clear I am not the only one coming to this realization.


The drugs are fading now too. Years of operating in a culture of secrecy and paranoia have caused my adrenaline to start flowing early, my stomach churning into battery acid. 


Then, the screaming starts.

188e5c,1,2013-02-09,This is a long summary of my life and why I feel depressed...,grapesarentforyou,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/188e5c/this_is_a_long_summary_of_my_life_and_why_i_feel/,"I'm posting to get a lot off my chest and hopefully get some sort of help. This will probably be long but I just want to tell anyone who'll read why I'm depressed.

I've felt depressed for as long as I can remember. Back in middle school I wasn't popular at all and got made fun of a lot. By the time I was in high school I learned to laugh with the people making fun of me and act like I didn't care about all the jokes even though it hurt badly. After that, I started making some more friends and by the time I graduated ended up ""fitting in"" with the popular kids.

After I graduated high school I decided to go to a tech school for IT, the only thing I've ever been interested in doing for a living. After awhile, I found out the school was shit and dropped out to look for a better school. Around this time I started to get into Christianity (I grew up a Christian) and started going to church again. I made some friends who went to a Bible college and I decided to go to the same college they went to even though they offered no degree that I wanted to study.

I thought ""getting close to God"" would help my depression and make me feel better. One summer break I got the chance to go to Brazil to help build a church and then the next summer I went to China to learn Chinese. I met a girl that I became obsessed with in China and we became best friends. I went back the next summer to do an internship (I had decided to study ESL for my degree) at her school and got to see her again. I decided that I was in love with her and that we were meant to be. She didn't share the same feeling at the time but I made it my mission for her to fall in love with me. A year before I graduated college, I decided that I'd move to China to teach English and start a relationship with this girl. I joined a Christian organization to make getting there easier but their recruitment process is pretty strict. Since I was trying to ""be close to God"" on my application under ""is there anything we should know about you"" I wrote that I was struggling with pornography addiction. That turned into me being turned down by the organization after months of going through the recruitment process and the organization sending me to a therapist for a semester to get help and then try to join again. I went to therapy for a semester and it went great but in the end, they said I wasn't ready... So, after all that, I ended up joining another more relaxed organization and then moving to China.

It took about a half a year but I finally accomplished my goal of getting the girl to start to fall for me. We hung out a lot she stayed over a few times in my room in my friends' apartment. My friends were also Christians but the girl I was in love with wasn't. They got pissed that she stayed over a few times and then another one of my friends found out. Since they didn't like it (or her for that matter; they were never nice to her) I found my own apartment after about a month and she moved in with me. The third friend who found out about is was part of the same organization that helped me go to China and he told them that I was dating a non-Christian girl. That all blew up and became a huge deal. The summer after I went to China I had to go back home for a one-year checkup with the organization and in the meeting they told me I either have to break up with the girl or leave the organization. I chose the girl and said fuck the organization... This whole deal lead to me losing my faith. I've got a lot to say about that but now's not the time. Anyways, a few months after that happened the girl broke up with me. This devastated me. I left an organization for her and then she broke my heart. I went into deep depression and thought about killing myself a lot. I started drinking a lot, smoking, and even had sex with prostitutes. I told myself I'd never love another girl so why not do those things? Well, eventually we got back together but after that it was always on for awhile, off for awhile, and the same thing all over again. Even before we broke up the first time she treated me like shit but I was obsessed with her and made her my life. She found out that I suffered from depression and basically told me that I was crazy and she couldn't be with someone that doesn't have the mind of a ""normal"" person so I had to convince her it was just culture shock.

After awhile, I got a job teaching English. I hated it so much and hated myself for not sticking with an IT degree in the first place but I kept on doing it because it was the only chance I had to be with the girl. After a year of teaching English I told her that I wanted to go back to the states. This was when we were together so she said she supported me. We were doing alright together and we decided if we were really meant to be, being apart would could be a test. If things went well, she'd move to the states and we'd have a life together here. She had to go back to her hometown before I left for America and we constantly had problems. Finally, we just made the decision to just be friends. We knew we loved each other but we just didn't understand each other. (not a language issue; she speaks English and I speak Chinese)

So, now I'm back in the states. I've only been home for almost two weeks but I already feel like shit. The first few days were amazing. I bought a car the day after I got back and got a nice phone as well. I missed home so much. But now, reality is starting to sink in and it's killing me. For the past week, I've thought about suicide everyday. I miss my ex even though I don't want to be with her at all. I always think ""what if this, what if that""... That hurts but the thing that hurts the most is that I'm realizing I've given up a lot to come home. I gave up everything to go to China and now I've given up everything I had there to come back home. Before I came home, I had my own apartment and a high-paying university job. I was respected as a teacher and was actually somebody people looked up to. Now that I'm home, I'm just a loser. I don't have a lot of money saved up. I live with my parents. I don't have a job. I don't have a girlfriend. I've only got one friend. I've been trying to call someone who said could help me get started in the IT field for a week but he won't return my calls even though I've left four messages. I just feel like I've lost everything.

I hated living in China. The culture was interesting to begin with but the interesting stuff got annoying quick. The differences were just too big sometimes. I had a lot of anger issues in China just because I would get so frustrated sometimes. I hated my job too even though it paid well and people respected me. Now that I'm hope, I'm starting to think that living in a place that I hate doing a job that I hate is better than the life I've got here. Everyday I think about dying and feel nothing but sadness. Sometimes the sadness goes away but it makes me feel even worse because when I'm not sad I feel absolutely nothing.

I've left out a lot of details that I think actually matter but since this is already long enough, I'll spare you. Thank you for reading if you did.

tl;dr went to bible college and took a trip to china, fell in love with a girl and sacrificed a career I'd enjoy and two and a half years to be with her, it didn't work, moved home and now have nothing "

I'm sick to death of everything being about you. 

You didn't even cross a line today. Today wasn't even the worst you've been to me. I don't know why today is my breaking point, but it is. 

So yeah. I guess in the long run, thanks for telling me that I look unprofessional today. That my outfit (a fucking grey graphic tee, black blazer, and blue pants - OH HORRORS!) is ""awful"" and ""a big mistake"" - that my t-shirt has ""obviously been washed too many times."" You look like a circus clown from the 60s. Head to toe purple, orange, and red corduroy that you sewed together yourself is also not a good look, you frizzy-headed bitch.

I've put myself out there for you so many fucking times, I can't even count them. I had the best relationship with my boss that a person can fucking have, and I used up my time and energy going to bat for you with her - calming her down when she was pissed at you, planting seads in her head against your enemies, telling her how hard you were trying. When all along, you've just been a selfish, controlling, manipulative bitch. You're almost 60 - when are you ever going to act like an adult!? Why are you so over the top dependent on everyone else, but you go out of your way to make enemies?! None of your shit makes any sense. Thanks a lot for having me in complete tears, by the way, the other week. It was nice of you to tell me off in front of the public and to tell me that everyone hates me. 

When you didn't get this job, because you're too STUPID to fill out a resume and an application properly, and when you stormed out of your internship because of it, I wish to god we had let you go. I wish to god we had let you go on your way. But we're nice. We felt bad for you. We felt sorry for you for spending so much time interning here to not get the job. So we went to bat for you. HUGE MISTAKE. You are just an evil, bad, bad, bad person. I hope that you get alzheimers like your psychzo father. Do you know what it takes for me to wish that on someone after my grandfather had it?!  But you're just the kind of shithead who can make me cross that line, finally, after 3 years of love and patience and training wheels with THIS BULLSHIT IN RETURN. And you want to whine to me about having depression and you CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER THE NAMES OF THE DRUGS THAT YOU'RE SUPPOSEDLY ON?! Yeah, I don't really even believe a word you say anymore. There's just no possible way that you've been picking up a prescription for decades and you don't know what you're taking. It makes me doubt everything you say. About your father, about your life, about your work. 

And speaking of work - since we all went to bat for you those years ago, and since we continue to go to bat for you and forgive you for your NUMEROUS PUBLIC TANTRUMS, could you maybe try to get some work done? I shouldn't have to take time out of my day to double-check and then fix everything you do. I'm not your supervisor! I should LET YOU FAIL! You can't handle the simplest of fucking things. There are so many people out there trying to get good jobs, and you're just ditzing around like a flightly little hell-beast on a drama-fueled rampage. God, just fucking die already. Please. Just go. Fuck you.

Steve Carrell (Michael Scott) left a while ago, Ed Helms (Andy Bernard) was away from the show for many weeks, the writers brought in 3 new characters (the 2 interns and the sound guy).
Personally Im not sold on it. Having worked in multiple office situations over the last few years I have a fondness for the show and how in/accurately they portray the experiences in these situations. However, this latest season has been hit or miss for me. Other shows this year that are ending have been 30 Rock and How I met Your Mother, both of those are finding rather inventive and engaging ways to wrap up their respective series. I feel the writers and actors in the Office are not making this Farewell season do any justice to the previous (in my opinion) fantastic season. If i could ask Steve Carrell his thoughts... i can only imagine what he would say.
How do you feel about the changes and the fact that the show is ending?"

My natural color is a dirty mousey blonde, a bit lighter than my eyebrows, but the same sort of tint. I hated it so I don't know if I want to go back to completely natural, bu I want a color that *looks* natural.

I'm wondering what color would suit me, I really have no idea if I want to go blonde, red, brown, etc. I'm very pale with freckles and pink undertones [as you can see](http://i.imgur.com/jviiXgK.png). What do you think??

18eo6g,3,2013-02-12,potential solution to Atma's,mnkymn22,leagueoflegends,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/18eo6g/potential_solution_to_atmas/,"hi guys! I'm new to this subreddit, so please be nice =) I'm currently a college student applying to the internship at Riot, as a game designer. For part of my application, I'm working on an analysis on Atma's Impaler. Here's a possible solution I thought of and wanted the communities input on it. Any constructive criticism would be awesome!

So currently, Atma's is one of the least used items in the game, seeing a producation value of .66% in all of LoL. Many say that it's unviable because the stats on it can easily be bought off other, more viable options (such as completing another armor item or buying a bf sword). 

My idea was to make Atma's build from Madred's and be turned into a jungler specific item. the stats would look something like

* **+70 armor** (combining madred's and chain vest)

* **+unique : 2.0% maximum health to attack damage**

* **+madred's unique effects**

**Pros**:  

* rise in carry junglers/decline in support-like carry junglers

* in turn promote more aggressive play

* more build options for junglers

* viable late game option for Madred’s

* junglers would actually upgrade their Madred’s

* bring back Atmogs/Fratma’s Meta

* rise in production of Atma’s


**Cons**:

* if bruisers other than junglers start rushing this, potential Meta shift to fast map objectives
 	e.g. really fast barons, dragons and buff steals

* would need play testing for configuration to keep away from bruisers

 	i.e. increase cost, unique attribute related to smite, etc.	

 		such as making the Unique increase AD percentage by amount  of smites used

* potentially too much armor (might need a different formula instead of chain vest)

I've had so much pain in the past 5 years. I'm 19 and I don't even have a family anymore. I kept telling myself that I just needed to get through one more situation, and that everything will be back to normal and manageable after. That I'll be able to focus on happiness and stability for once. 

Just when things started to get better, I was just informed this morning that my hours have been cut in half and that the job position that I was guaranteed after my paid internship ended is no longer available because the company is broke at this time. I was promised stability, again -- and had it ripped away from me. 

I just pulled myself back together this weekend after hell. Now this? RIGHT NOW? Why not a few months down the line when I have a little bit more life in me? Why now? Why me? Why does this keep happening to me? I do everything right, and all this keeps happening to me out of left field. It's all out of my control, what the fuck? 

Fuck. I don't want to live like this. I'm not suicidal, I couldn't leave the people that I love -- but honestly, I'm losing myself. I can't breathe and I can't feel anything besides pain anymore. 

I'm sorry, maybe I should've posted this to /r/offmychest. I suffer from anxiety and chronic depression though, so I feel at home here in a way. "

(x-post from r/startups),[deleted],design_critiques,https://www.reddit.com/r/design_critiques/comments/18edj6/id_love_some_feedback_on_a_redesign_be_ruthless/,"Hey, so I worked on this potential Klout pivot/redesign for an internship application I was working on recently. I've already submitted it, but was curious about how feasible/viable y'all thought the idea was.

Concept: Not many people use Klout on a regular basis. I wanted to make a Klout-oriented product that did provoke more constant usage. This is a business card application that allows you to receive/store virtual business cards, and share your own preset cards with others. Your Klout score could be influenced by who you network with in-person

Notes:
* Handshake shows you people around you with the app, who you can send cards to (after in-person networking). Otherwise, you can search if you want to send your card to someone not near you, or text/email if they don't have the app
* Tilting your device horizontally while on the pile shows you the business card you were highlighting full-screen. The drop down arrow shows you the bottom half.

I can answer any questions about my design decisions but really want some feedback from all of you. Thanks guys :)

I've used Dreamweaver to get these from our local folder and put them into our sites. I'm having difficulty grasping some of the concepts though; my questions are these:

- We are creating PHP pages from our ""dated"" ASP pages. What is the difference between these two and what are some other types of pages? Also, do these relate to other website endings (.com, .net, etc.). 

- I've made a few pages to add to the company's website (not from scratch, I've used other PHP pages as templates and just edited the text and image content). However, I still don't understand entirely what CSS is vs HTML and what alternatives there may be.

(WARNING long but hopefully enjoyable read)",[deleted],BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/18e5fc/ladies_imagine_a_somewhat_nasty_breakup_9_months/,"Happy Squeaky Day!!!!
I have a plethora of words. It's never been a problem for me to think of things to say. Whether or not what comes out of my mouth or goes onto the paper should have been uttered at all, is another matter entirely. I'm learning to shutup. I'm sitting in Starbucks to write this. I hate Starbucks. I hate these people. They all go about their daily lives and they have no idea what's going on around them, nor do they care. ""Lemme get a Tall Vagina Latte for Karen!"" Comes the call that shakes me from my moment of self indulgent piteous reflection. I just want to get this over with. I want it to be over. I want this to be the last time your face flashes in my brain and sends butterflies of regret and loss scattering throughout my belly. I want today to be the last day I wake up thinking of you, and last night to be the final time I go to sleep trying to figure out what I could have done differently. I want to relegate you to my past on go on living for my future. I want what you so clearly have. But right now, at this moment, I want nothing more than for Karen to come get her goddamn Vagina Latte, cause I'm sitting right next to the pickup counter and this particular Barista is overly attached to the idea of fast service.

Even with my plethora of words, there is no combination I could string together which would turn back the hands of time. There is no sentence or turn of phrase that will make you forget just how neglectful I was of you. ""Sorry"" is a lovely word, and when paired with true intent, it can be a wonderous thing, but it does not make up for how I acted and it lacks the ability to swallow words that have already gone out to the ether. I think you know I am, so there's no use in saying it here. Tomorrow Laura will come and pick up your painting and some other shit I've been holding on to with the intention of forcing you to see me down the line, after that you will have absolutely no reason to contact me, I guess I'm scared that's what will happen. I have no idea why, as it's what I deserve and for a long time wanted.

I've been in a dark place that has nothing to do with you, and I'm finally coming out of it. When you left I had to take stock in my life, and when taken, what I saw scared me. Here I am at 32 going on 33, just having broken up with a girl who at the time I was glad to see go, but who I always knew deep down was singular in all aspects. A real diamond in the rough. That being said, to not let you go was not an option. How could I? When you were so close to something you always wanted, a chance to travel and to live abroad, a chance to pursue a dream and possibly end up in the exact career you've always wanted. What kind of person would I be, how could I even pretend to love you while at the same time refusing to let you go? This speaks nothing of my inward and outward neglect of you and our relationship, which I'm finally coming to realize was a result of more than one factor, but all of my own doing. The obviousness in hindsight that I had wasted the past year and a half of my life, if not the previous 33 years, on my own, and now had no one to point the finger at. All along the finger should have always been pointed squarely at me, but I was too weak and too scared to acknowledge it. You didn't make me stay in LA, you made me want to, but the choice was mine and I chose it and I would again a thousand times over. You didn't make me keep doing Locations (in fact, on more than one occasion you begged me to quit), but it was a convenient out to say I had to keep doing it to support ""Us"" and infinitely shitty of me to silently resent you for following the dreams I insisted you pursue and fully expected to pay for. You didn't make me smoke weed and play video games nonstop, those were all escapes I invented to avoid looking at the cold hard truth. ""I am unhappy, and nothing I've done to this point in my life suggests that I have the will or the means to change that fact. This is my life now and this is my life forever, I have no one but myself to blame. I am worthless,"" echoed in my head over and over again, every minute of every day, week after week, month after month. With the constant cacophony of negative thoughts and the reality of my situation fully revealed, I'm not too proud to admit, I lost something over those months. I wrongly thought it was you. I now know it was the part of me holding me back.

So I begged and I pleaded, I told you I would change, I told you things would be different. It was a lie. Oh I believed things would be different. I believed if I could only get you to show concern, if I could only get you to care about my plight, that would prove you still loved me, you still cared, but you weren't the problem, I was. If you had done what I so desparately wished, nothing would have changed, cause I would have been the same. Scared of failure, scared of going out on a limb and because of that fear doomed to live in the very situation I never wanted. Besides, and this is the best part, where the fuck do I get off asking you (now my ex) to give me the exact same considerations which I so miserably failed to provide you when you needed them most? Then, to top it all off, I began insisting you return the one thing I provided infallibly (as meager as it may have been) just because I was going through a hard time? Indian givers are the worst with a special place in Hell reserved just for them, and I'm embarrassed to have even gone down that road. I'm shaking my head now, and Karen finally having gotten her Vagina Latte is giving me a strange look as I do so. I can only imagine she's bewildered by the expression on my face. It's a mixture of regret and shame, and it's making my coffee just a tad more bitter. Keep all that I gave you Squeaky, it was given with love and respect, which I also gave and give to you ad infinitum. Should you return it, I hope you will do so in the same spirit, but I will not accept anything but the gesture.
Just a couple more paragraphs, then you will be done reading this and hopefully aware of why I did what I did when I did it. I don't expect you to respond or frankly to care, nor do I necessarily need or want you to. This letter is an attempt to give you and therefore me, some solace about the situation. It is the last and least of all my selfish gestures. To relieve you of culpability. To make me less of an enemy and repaint memories of me in a kinder light if only in my own head, so that I can forgive myself for failing me and by association you. I don't know if it will work, only time will tell, but just getting these things on paper and knowing they'll reach you someday, will hopefully allow me to move on and forgive myself for mistakes I've made but no longer have the right to correct. 

When Joey was little, I'd say about 9-10, he somehow got a copy of The Amazing Spiderman #1. This comic book is worth nearly $25k, but obviously it wasn't worth that back then (sometime in the 70's). To 9 year old Joey, this was just another comic book, to enjoy, to read, to leave on the side of his bed where it dropped from his hands the moment he fell asleep. Essentially, though a great comic book, and in retrospect the first edition of one of the most famous characters in Nerd History, this was just as normal as any Archie or Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles trash that he got on any other day, and 9 year old Joey treated it as such. Talk to him about it now and you can see him mentally beating the ever loving shit out of his 9 year old self for his lack of foresight, cause 9 year old Joey traded that comic book away once he was done reading it. To him, it was just another comic, because he didn't know what he had till it was gone. If through some trick of Science Fiction present Joey could go back and talk to 9 year old Joey, he would relate to his younger self an appreciation of what he had, to cherish the unique gifts life sometimes presents, and to adore them for what they are. I'm also sure that 9 year old Joey, even armed with that information, would probably treat the comic just as cavalierly. You see 9 year olds lack perspective and describing to them the concept of rarity and accrued value is probably no easy task. To say nothing of the implications to the space time continuum (imagine my nerdy voice here) when one goes back to change even the most insignificant moments in human history. But should he somehow be returned to his specific issue of that comic in the now, he would definitely treat it with the ador and intimacy it deserves, if for no other reason than second chances are rare and he would feel happily obligated to make up for his past neglect. I think the metaphor here is pretty clear, but I do want to put in the disclaimer that I don't expect to get a second chance with you no more than Joey can expect to be walking through a comic shop and happen upon that very same issue of Spiderman. I will get another chance at something special, but our moment has passed. Also just as Joey lost his comic book for a reason, what happened with us was inevitable as our lives were going in different directions and these trajectories were impossible to stop without even more heartache. You needed to find your feet as well as your place in the world, and being with me wasn't allowing you to do that. The joy I felt in having you was masking my dissatisfaction with how my life had turned out to that point and you unknowingly provided the exact kick in the pants necessary to motivate me for change.

The comic book analogy is one of perspective. I want to illustrate to you that I know I was wrong, I know that there were problems and those problems were caused mainly by my dissatisfaction with my own life, but never with you. You were a convenient scapegoat, as others had been before you, but because of you will be avoided in the future. A part of me always realized how special you are, and the weaker part of me allowed the rest of me to be blind to that fact. As illustration of me knowing my mistakes as well as a display of just how much I've thought and been tortured by them, I will list them for you here:

1) I should have gotten you more than a discounted phone for that first Christmas. You never wanted my money, you only wanted tangible displays of my affection and love for you. You would have been more happy with a rock, if it had the right sentiment behind it.

2) I should have made every birthday special. It's your day and you are special. It wasn't and isn't too much to ask that I take one day out of a year to really show you through action and deed that I recognize I am very lucky to have you in my life.

3) I should have taken you places and shown you things. You so desparately wanted that. I was afraid. In the moments of my past where I have been the sole bread winner, I had been taken advantage of. You never did that, but that doesn't mean I was stupidly afraid you would. Not an excuse just a lame, weak reason.

4) I should have quit smoking pot. I have no other excuse other than I am weak, at the very least weaker than you and I was afraid without the weed, life would be boring. Fear should never be a motivation for anything aside from escape from imminent danger. 

5) I should have brought you to NOLA to intern at Tulane at the very least to be close to you. I didn't want that at the time though and I sincerely think it's because I was distancing myself from you because I knew you'd get into Bristol and if you did you would go there. I didn't think you or I could handle that unless I could maintain detachment. Man was I stupid. But now you're happy, so I guess in the end my reasoning was sound.

6) I should have shown you how much I love you every chance I got, but I didn't want to and it was because I was stupid, scared and stupid. I have no other reason.

7) Valentine's Day. Simple. What was important to you, should have become important to me no matter my personal feelings on the stupidity of the holiday.

8) I shouldn't have begged to get you back when I was the one who pushed you so far away. Stupid. Along with that I should have stood by my position that anything I said was yours was yours, and I should never have tried to get it back, no matter what my situation. In reality though it would be of huge help to me, I was doing it only to get a sign that you cared, and it was clear that wasn't going to happen, because I had done nothing to earn your concern.

9) I should have supported you, period. For no other reason than I said I would, and I love you. I instead resented you for what I thought was taking advantage of me because I felt somewhere inside I didn't deserve you.

10) I should have listened .... more .... constantly .... with all that I had. I should have listened.
There's more, and I could and would spend all day going over them in my mind and trying to put them down on paper, but I doubt you'd want to read them (I think I could go up to about 30, I was a pretty neglectful douchebag), so I will spare you all of it. I mention these cause they are the ones that are on my mind currently, but a whole slew of them are constantly swirling around in there. Mistakes, I should mention, that I've learned from and would never make again with whomever would give me the honor of putting me in a position to make them. Lessons that I never would have learned if I never met you, if we'd never been together.

Getting close to the end here. This must seem like an epic letter, it may bring up some emotions, but I doubt many on your end (maybe I'm wrong). I don't mean for the letter to be epic. I'm better now. I'm coming out of a pretty deep and dark depression caused by the many realizations I've had since you left. I have a girlfriend who is awesome, kind, caring, and lovely. I'm volunteering at a Neuroscience Lab at UCLA. I'm working Locations but able to still concentrate on aspects of my life I want to change. I'm applying to Journalism Grad Programs for the Fall of 2014, to pursue my perfect career (Science Journalism, I'm sooooo psyched), the working is so that I'm able to pay for it without taking too many loans. I'm taking sailing and/or flying lessons (starting next week) and I'm finally cognizant of why, for most of my 33 years, I've had a constant undertone of sadness I tried to mask with pot induced distractions and reliance on others. Even with, or in spite of, all these changes, there is something missing, and I guess this letter and returning your stuff is my final attempt to fill in that void, or at the very least do right by you in the end. I want, not need, not demand, just plain want you in my life. In whatever capacity you are able to muster or feel motivated to pursue. I've let go of so many things only to regret the loss later, I'm not ready to let go of you entirely just yet, and I'm hoping you can find it in your heart to accept my ammends and honestly try to stay in touch. That being said, in the end, all I really want is for you to be happy with or without my involvement, and more importantly for me to find that happiness myself. The shortcut to some happiness would be for you to write back and tell me how things are going with you, in whatever depth and fashion you feel is appropriate. Doing so will allow me to forgive myself finally for the mistakes I made, and would be a clear indication that at the very least you value my presence in your life and I haven't ruined whatever value you may have perceived in maintaining a relationship with me. You have my address, you know my email and you will always have my number. I know I've done very little to deserve even this, and am already ok with the idea that I'll never hear from you again, but I'm hoping that won't be the case and wanted to display clearly and openly that I'm here Squeaky now and always without condition. That I will live the rest of my days (ugh so lame and drama filled, but the truth) thinking fondly of you and silently wishing you get all the things your little heart desires. And hoping, every once in a while that I'll get to hear of your successes, and that in spite of it all, you'd like to hear about mine.

 Today is Valentine's Day, which you know I don't care about. Thankfully, Lauren (my new special lady) doesn't care about it either. I was lucky enough to find a girl who shares my particular alternate views on the subject. So with reverence to you and respect to your constanstly ignored wish for me to make it important, I am rebranding Valentine's Day in my own head. For me, from this point forward, it will no longer be a day where I'm forced to buy candy and flowers for whichever girl, present or future, is lucky enough to call me theirs. It is Squeaky's Day, and on this day for the remainder of your days here on Earth keep your eye out, I've missed two already and I don't plan on missing another. Squeaky's Day is so much better than Vantine's cause it's dedicated to you, the truest love I've known and lost to date and I'm determined to never forget that.

I hope this was well received and please take every word for Gospel. I don't expect or demand you respond in any way. I don't expect anything from you except that you live your life and be happy. Like I said I would love to hear from you, when and if you are ready and I would be immeasurably happy just to hear your voice or read your words no matter what they said.

Love in whatever capacity you can accept, now and always,
EDIT: Removed my name

PS Behind the ghoulish cyclists find the red string, pull the string and you will find the first Squeaky's Day tithe. It's nothing huge, and I only ask that you retrieve it on your own, if and when you get back. Just a small surprise to show I'm here. No drama, no expectations just a trinket and a trifle for my one and only Squeaky on the day I have now made for her."
18dz0y,1,2013-02-12,"Struggling to engage with or get any enjoyment out of life, failing university, feel like I need a break",gourangamanga,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/18dz0y/struggling_to_engage_with_or_get_any_enjoyment/,"So despite not having anything particularly substantial to feel bad about, I pretty much feel horrible all the time right now, and think about suicide daily (though I think I'm a long way from actually doing it). I haven't attended university in nearly four months, I've missed all my deadlines and exams and I'm in my final year where everything really matters. 
 
I'm seeing a doctor on Thursday and expect to be diagnosed with depression. I've also started seeing a councillor, though I'm not sure if it's really helping at all. I hope that I will be able to get extenuating circumstances, which will allow me to either sit my missed exams and assignments in August, or else repeat them next year.
 
If I repeat the year, I'll have to spend another year at university, which will cost me - but I'm fairly sure I can actually afford it. Given a full year, provided I can get and stay healthy, I can hopefully get a good degree and be an employable graduate. Alternatively, I could repeat the year, make all the same mistakes again, be in this exact same situation this time next year, but a few grand down. 
 
If I don't repeat the year, I'll have to start studying again, and work hard to catch up. I haven't really done any work in a long time and right now I don't feel remotely capable of doing it. Just thinking about it fills me with an overwhelming sense of dread, despair, regret and self-loathing. Having said that, probably the best outcome would be to do this. I think that if I started working hard tomorrow and kept it up, finishing the work I missed over summer, I could probably graduate with a half-decent degree. But right now that feels impossible, I wish it were as simple as flicking a switch.
 
This makes me more inclined to accept that I'm not well right now, and focus on getting myself better and also figuring out how to stay well (depression's been a recurring theme in my life), before trying to take on anything difficult like getting a degree. 
 
However, a part of me thinks that this idea of taking a break is just a way of putting off work because I'd rather not have to do it right now, and the only thing that will change if I take a year out is that I'll be that much older and poorer. Furthermore, I already have a job lined up with a company I did an internship with, so I'd have to explain to them why I'm not graduating this year and possibly lose the job opportunity, but that's hardly the end of the world.

So yeah, I guess my plan at the moment is to see what my doctor suggests, talk to my university tutor about possibly postponing my studies, and then find something to do to get myself into a good frame of mind again.

Well, thanks for reading, I guess. Any advice?"
18dnto,4,2013-02-12,Need advice as a current doctoral student in ChE,needsChEadvice,ChemicalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChemicalEngineering/comments/18dnto/need_advice_as_a_current_doctoral_student_in_che/,"I hate to make a small question so long, but I have to give some background about my situation, and I'm looking for advice regarding a long-standing question that I've been asking myself and others.

I'm a current PhD candidate at a top 20 school [in the US] in Chemical Engineering and I'll graduate in n years, where n&lt;=3 yr.

My issue is the following: my research is entirely computational. I do molecular dynamics simulations.  I don't and will not be able to obtain any graduate experimental experience (I've tried).  I do however have undergrad experimental experience and internships.

I'm curious about the employment options I'll have when I graduate. Many companies do not do molecular dynamics simulations, and I don't even think I want to do that for my entire life.  Ideally I'd like some balance between simulations and experiments.

I've been asking the question of employment possibilities for some time now, and I seem to be getting two types of answers.  The first answer says that it doesn't matter that I don't have any experience on SEM, TEM, AFM, [insert-abbreviation-here] --- that companies are looking for PhDs because of their thought process and problem solving abilities, and that they will train you on whatever you end up doing.  In addition, this answers says that most PhDs in companies do not actually work in the lab themselves but rather run a small group of scientists (and this I totally agree with, I've experienced this in my undergrad days during internships).

The second answer advises me to get my hands on any experimental projects that I can get (although I am unable to get any).  It warns me that I'll have a very difficult time obtaining a job in the future with a purely computational background. 

I just don't want to end up in a situation where I graduate and can't find a job because what I did in my PhD is not very often used in industry.

I've also played around with the idea of doing an experimental post-doc, but here again, I ask myself, what professor would pay to hire me as their post-doc when I don't have any graduate experimental experience?  In addition, if I do end up miraculously finding an experimental post-doc position, would that put me in the academic track, and close the door to industry?

What has your experience been with the hiring process for PhDs?  Are companies looking for specific skills (such as expert on [abbreviation-here]), or do they hire PhDs for the thought process?  Is there anything I should absolutely do now before graduating?

I look forward to any advice you can give, and I apologize this is so long! Thanks!"

We're both in graduate school at the same university and met on our first day.  We quickly became close friends and then began dating.  We moved in together after around 3 months of dating.  
I never thought someone like him would or could have existed in this world.  He made me laugh and think more than anyone I had met.  He was my best friend.  Lately, since we've begun working on our theses, things have gotten a bit tense between us.  We are both extremely stressed out with internships, classes, and our own research.  We made it a point to spend quality time together at least once a week with an extra special date once a month.  Those ideas haven't worked...

A few nights ago I got home after hanging out with some friends.  I told him I was upset that he decided to stay home and play video games instead of spending time with me.  He flipped out on me.  Things escalated and he grabbed me by both of my arms and shoved me across the room.  He left the house and I followed - wanting to get some insight into his mindset.  This was a terrible idea.  The fight escalated even more and he grabbed me by the arms again.  I have bruises now.  

This afternoon, he tells me that he's going to have drinks with a female friend of his on Thursday.  I've never met this girl and she was open about wanting to start something romantic with my SO a while back.  It didn't bother me until I remembered that Thursday was Valentine's Day.  I don't expect anything special for Valentine's Day, but I also didn't expect him to make plans to have drinks with this girl... So, I got a bit upset.  Things escalated again and he left the house.  I followed after, told him I was upset, then went to the gym.  
He texted me to let me know that he thought we were over - that he thought that my emotions were too much for him.  I'm currently sleeping at a friend's house.  

This feels awful, Reddit.  Tell me what to do/think/feel.  

TL;DR
Live-in boyfriend and I fought, been escalating lately.  I'm not doing so well with the idea of breaking up.  "

Neither one of us have ever really traveled and do not really know where to go. I would prefer to take off work up to three days max, i am thinking of flying out early on a Wednesday and coming back on a Saturday. Some places that come to my mind include; Banff Natural Park, San Francisco, San Diego, The Keys, Colorado, East coast somewhere... i am open to suggestions and/or tips for any of these places or other destinations. Any help on picking a place, hotel, flight, etc. is greatly appreciated!"
18cvw9,1,2013-02-11,"I [19M] want to get closer to the girl I like [20F], but I'm afraid that at this I might've burned every bridge for anything to happen... in purpose",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/18cvw9/i_19m_want_to_get_closer_to_the_girl_i_like_20f/,"What's up /r/Relationships? I'd like to keep this short, but as many things, this requires some context.

The girl I like used to be my best friend's girlfriend, about say 4 or 5 years ago. At that moment I totally despised her; there was some bad reputation around her because she used to date lots of guys at school, and when things went wrong she was always the ""bad guy"". You know how kids are. So after those two broke up (two times), the contact was basically lost. She was still there in the clasroom, but she was a ghost for me. She was the one who had hurted my best friends feelings.

Time passed by, and 2 years ago I started a internship on some IT enterprise. Fun thing was that she worked there too, on the same conditions as I did. So, eventually, we had to get along. At first there were next to none words, but some months later something inside of me forgave her; maybe she wasn't evil after all. My friend told me it was nobody's fault, relationships are just like that, but back then I saw him so hurted that I just couldn't accept that, she must've been some kind of devil; but we all mature, and started to jag the pieces.

Surprisingly then, around May of 2012, my friend said *""hey, what do you say we invite her to the movies?""*. I was sceptic at first, but after going out some more times I started to accept her. And fall for her as well. My first mistake must've been not telling her my feelings, my first and most important. You could say I was kind of obsessed, waiting for the weekend to go out with her and my friends, stealing hugs from time to time, thinking that she'd catch my stupidly weak signals. I've never been good at socializing, so the ways I had to express my feelings weren't the best, of course she'd never catch what I meant. Of course she'd still think that I hated her.

Anyway, this kept going on, and by that time (August 2012) she was going out with some other guy. I knew it wouldn't work, things weren't going good. My friend told me the same, and that day he told me ""she's more like a woman to you now, huh?"". Welp, he knew. ""I just think something between you two might work, you know? You both are autonomous in several ways..."" and other stuff. You know, everything seems perfect from some perspectives. I guess that was the excuse I needed to actually begin expressing my feelings.

Until one day, when she and my friend came home for dinner and some movies, she fell asleep with me, on some kind of embrace. So when my friend went to sleep, on another room, lots of things started to run through my mind. For whatever reason, damn me, I kissed her on her sleep. From there, say November 2012, things started to move.

I still don't know how she did to forgive me for what I did. She told me she was mad, but I at the same time I wasn't the kind of person that would do that; so she wanted to understand. I told her I liked her, and that if I hadn't told her before it was because she was on a relationship with someone else, and it wouldn't have felt right. As I expected, the same explanation was good for her to reject me, it was true that it wouldn't feel right to accept me while she was going out with someone else, so it didn't happen. Hanging out, though, was a weird experience from then and on, I was waiting for she to break up with him. I couldn't wait to start something with her.

The day finally came, and via my friend I found out had broken up. She wouldn't tell it to me, so everytime we went out was weird, awkward. I knew she was single, but at the same time she didn't want me to know it. Or she knew that I knew, but was afraid of what could happen. I started to become more jealous than before. Whatever, at that time she wasn't the happiest person in the world, breaking up ain't fun for nobody. That and her family problems? Nah, my feelings could wait. So I waited 'til new year to tell her... that I couldn't be her friend anymore, that I wanted something else, something more.

Then we started going out. I felt really happy, she was finally mine. It was a shame that she didn't feel the same, but I wouldn't find out until later. One week later she told me that even though I could've felt happy, she didn't feel the same, not even comfortable next to me. All those years of hate and indifference came up, and it was true that she knew little about me. She recited once and once again, how little we had in common, that she couldn't find something to call this a relationship. Then I took a break. I told her that if I couldn't be that, then I wouldn't be nothing, because I'd end up hurting me, and of course, her.

Idiot as I am, my distance lasted one week. I send her a message so we could meet up and do some chit chat. I told her how even though all that she said might be true, I still thought that it could work, and that I'd do anything for it to work. I said ""well, okay, you don't know me, then let's know each other!"". The idea sounded good, but there was a problem. During that time I wouldn't be more than a friend, or even less than that, because every action that I'd make, it would of course mean something else. I cannot play the friend.

So we started hanging out the two of us, with no one else. It'd be the only way for me to have her for myself. I kept pushing myself, trying to find the line between love and friendship... that didn't end up good. It didn't matter if I pushed further or not, she felt uncomfortable in any way. I couldn't even hold her, knowing that my intentions weren't those of a friend. Last two nights I went to her home. The first one we went to the chinese festival, it was supposed to be the last time we'd go out, since I couldn't go on like that. I tried being a friend, playing her game, not even touching her; we talked a lot. But in the end, I still felt empty. I said goodbye in the morning without saying much, so my mind led me to ask her out once again, promising that this time it really would be the last time.

I did not try to convince her to get away with me or anything, but if it was gonna be the last time, I moved a little further... it was midnight and I wouldn't go home that late, so I ended up at her home again. I knew it was all in vain, but still. I took it easy, with some hugs and stuff, sleeping next to her. She couldn't handle it and went to the couch. It was obvious that she wasn't going to feel uncomfotable. I slept alone. The morning after, she gave me a speech of how dissapointed she was for me, for taking advantage of the situation, for making her let me stay home.

Of course she was right. But I told her how selfish I was, and how if it was gonna be the last time, I would do it without remorse. She said she didn't want to be angry with me, because she respected me, and just didn't want things to end up like that. I asked for forgiveness, not sure of what had happened, and was about to leave, when she said ""one last hug?"". I accepted, and then walked down the road back home.

Hours later I sent her a message telling her why I had done what I did, all the last-time implications and such. That don't want her to be, but I don't have any excuse for her not to, after all I had done all wrong. One last time I told her that it doesn't matter how hard I try, I just cannot be her friend, and even if I could, then it wouldn't be a role I'd want to occupy; so I said I'd, once again, generate a distance.

*And I don't want to go, but I feel like I should...*

My best friend told me how love wasn't always logical, how she is a complicated person. That he thinks that things maybe ain't working out because not of me, but in the way I show who I am. I had already given up. I told him how every way I could have reached her, I threw it all away. Dissapearing would be for the best of me, him, and our group of friends. I don't wanna spend half of my time trying to be what I don't want to be, while hurting myself, but I do wanna be with her.

I'm looking for solutions, for other ways to reach her. I think I won't find much, but I lose nothing by asking.

TL;DR: There's this girl I've known for a while. I used to hate her, but now I realized there's no reason for that; therefore I fell for her and now I love her. Making her understand that I didn't hate her anymore was quite a process, but it finally worked and we tried going out. I thought everything was good, but in the end, she doesn't feel the same and said she wants to know me to actually feel comfortable with me. Thing is that while she learns who I am she wants me to stay as a friend, which of course is painful for me in everyway; so I've decided to take distance. Do you think there's any other solution for us to be without hurting each other like this?"
18ctrh,5,2013-02-11,"My Type 1 girlfriend attempted suicide in the Fall semester, started cutting again tonight",MarshRT,bipolar,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/18ctrh/my_type_1_girlfriend_attempted_suicide_in_the/,"Hi reddit, I've been lurking for a while and I've seen that people really get results when they ask for help. I'm sorry if this isn't the right subreddit for this, but I'll explain for a sec. I've been dating my girlfriend for just over four months - in that time, I've bandaged her wounds from increasingly severe attempts at cutting and stopped her from overdosing on the day after Halloween. She was checked into the emergency room then moved to the Behavioral Health Center at the local hospital, and released after just under 5 days. Since then she's gone to regular psychologist and psychiatrist appointments on campus at our university, been put on 300mg of Seroquel, and has explained bipolar disorder to her parents and gotten their full support with medication and counseling. Her mom was just up visiting last weekend and they really made a lot of progress talking about medication and my girlfriend's disorder, and she was really scared her mom wouldn't accept her for it or be supportive My girlfriend's maternal-side grandmother was also severely Type 1 Bipolar.

I have late classes this semester but I always go say goodnight to her at her dorm on campus, and when I called her to say I was on my way she sounded really distant. She gets very quiet when she's depressed, and I could tell something was wrong when I got there. We sat together and talked about our days and then she said, ""I think it's weird that other people don't cut."" I asked her what she meant and she said it was so normal for her that it was hard imagining what it was like not to. Before I go on, I want to say her room was a mess with her books and clothes all over the desk and floor, and there were open bandage wrappers on her desk that I noticed when I walked in.

I asked if she'd been cutting and she said yes. She had two small cuts on her palm and her wrist, and said she had a much worse one on her leg. I lifted her pants leg at one point and it was caked with dried blood, and she said it'd stopped bleeding and looked much worse than it actually was.

She'd started with little cuts last semester before her attempt and it got progressively worse, and I'm terrified she's going to commit suicide again. She tried by taking handfuls of Advil last time besides the cuts, but with 300mg doses of anti-psychotics in her dorm I'm scared shitless she'll do it when I'm gone, because my schedule is MUCH heavier this semester and I just barely got to her in time to stop her and get the campus EMS last fall. She told me it was okay because the cuts didn't hurt when she did them, and progressively became more distant and groggy as we sat and talked. I wrote a letter summarizing what happened and what I'd said to give her tomorrow if she's more alert, since she has a long history of memory issues that only get worse when she has an episode. She didn't remember walking back to her dorm tonight from dinner or even how long her roommate was gone before she started cutting. There was a stretch of two months she didn't remember Junior year of high school that her best friend helped her through, but her best friend goes to a rival college and has becoming significantly more distant since December. She was also abused for two years by her ex-boyfriend but hasn't gone to victim's advocate yet, and she actually helped me realize and accept that I'd been abused in a previous relationship and helped me more than I can ever credit or thank her for.

She has a psychologist appointment tomorrow at 2 PM - I asked her if she'd talk about this but she kept saying it wasn't a big deal and that she didn't want to. I'm really hoping she'll change her mind tomorrow when she's not feeling slow (her words) and groggy... She has her first internship tomorrow morning observing in a high school and she's looking forward to it but she also gets really anxious about unknown situations.

I love her completely. She explained bipolar disorder to me the night I told her I liked her, and I've read all of the books and articles she's sent me about her disorder. I visited her every day in the Behavioral Health Center and brought her lunch, clothes, and whatever belongings they'd let her keep in her room. She means everything to me and I want to help her through this.

Her parents are supportive but they said they'd immediately pull her out of college if a situation like last semester happened again. I want to help her, she just got back on track and changed her major and she's going to be a math and science teacher (and a damn good one, too). I know she needs help and I'm terrified, I don't want to derail her from school again but I don't know if she can handle being by herself. She told me that whatever bad things she did weren't meant to hurt me, that she was sorry and she loved me, and that we'd talk about all this in the morning. I'm just hoping we can get her help before this spirals into another attempt and she's pulled out of school permanently.

I don't know what I'm asking for, maybe just for any helpful advice or any approaches I can try taking with her that genuinely help and won't alert her parents... She's medicated and going to counseling and if this is something we can work through together and with her counselor and psychiatrist instead of hospitalizing her I'd love to hear whatever you all have to say."

I came in late, only heard the last 5 minutes of their presentation, and talked with one of the presenters asking her questions about the company/product. She was very attractive, seemed very intelligent and kind of nerdy from my meeting her. After reading a brochure on the company, when I got home, I realized the company's product could be used for an idea for a website I have, the biggest problem is data collection/analysis. Anyways, I emailed her to see who I could talk to, she said she'd be glad to answer any questions. The next day, one of the interns (female) who also attended, asked me if I was trying to get a date, told her I wasn't, I was trying to find out more about the company. But the intern then tells me that the woman mentioned I was cute. So here's my question.

How would you feel about a man asking you out for coffee, but if he also had legitimate reasons for talking to you about your company? I don't want to come off sleezy/like I'm bullshitting her to get her out, the company really does have a product I'd be interested in using, but I'd like to get to know more about her. Is this a one or the other scenario? Or can I find out about the company, then ask her if she'd like to meet up for coffee? Any input is appreciated.

18gorr,141,2013-02-13,I saw something on FB today that hurt me so badly it actually made me cry and I don't know who to rant about it to because I can't tell anyone who knows me why it hurts so much.,evasive_owl,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18gorr/i_saw_something_on_fb_today_that_hurt_me_so_badly/,"**DISCLAIMER**: I have to get something off my chest and I think this would be a good place to put it. My heart has been aching today and I have a lot to say. If you don't want to read a wall of text, venture no further. 

This is my throwaway because a lot of people, including immediate family members know my username, and I am about to divulge personal information I have never told anyone. The only other person that knows this information is my SO. 

I'm 21, and I'm a junior in college. I've been dating my boyfriend for exactly 2 years and 6 months Friday. We have great, awesome sex, and a lot of it. In the early fall of 2010, when we first started dating, I lost my birth control pill pack and I ended up getting a new pack after skipping 4 pills. I got pregnant. We had been dating for two weeks when this happened, so naturally, I got an abortion. I love kids and I have wanted to be a mother since I was 5 years old. I have the names of my children all picked up and lined out. I browse /r/BabyBumps all the time because I love seeing women become mothers. Am I weird? Maybe. 

Long story short, it broke my heart to get an abortion. Not only because I love kids, but that I was so careless about sexual protection that it got to the point where I needed to have one. I don't regret the abortion at all, but I do regret my choices concerning protection that led up to. I think about the ""what ifs"" if I hadn't had the abortion. I think about the adorable child my boyfriend and I would have made. 

I was a freshman in college when I got pregnant and he was a junior. We decided to have the abortion immediately after I discovered I was pregnant. We knew that our hopes, dreams, and aspirations would go down the drain if we had not. And two years later, we are closer than ever to achieving those dreams, and still together. I couldn't be happier.
He now has a wonderful, wonderful job in engineering, and I am graduating early next year with a 3.8 gpa from one of the highest ranked public universities in the United States. I have a solid internship, and a job offer for when I graduate. I'm applying to grad schools in Europe, because my SO and I both have dreamed of moving to Europe since we were young. He's taking me to the Bahamas in March for my Spring break. We love life, and we are making the most of it. I am in the best shape I ever have been: I work as a spinning instructor, and I'm running a marathon in March. We share a cute apartment in city my school and his job are located in. If I had not had the abortion two years ago, *none* of this would be happening. I am so thankful I live in a country where no one can deny me access to abortion. 

Of course, there are some of you who would indeed carry the child full term, and either put them up for adoption, or raise them on your own. To you, I say, you are brave. I give you props for going through 9 months of judgement, stares, and ridicule, and putting your own life aside for a baby. (I am sure that not all of you did in fact get ridiculed, but that seems to be the common trend with the girls I know who are young mothers)

For me, I knew that neither of these possibilities would work. I was (and still am) not ready to be a mother. I'm still a kid! I spend my nights partying, drinking, and getting high with friends when I don't have to study, and during the summers, I work and travel as much as I can. I am an athlete, and I did not want to sacrifice my body with pregnancy, because it is impossible to bring yourself back to the point you were at before. Maybe I'm selfish, but this is my life. I couldn't bear the thought of bringing a child into this world, and giving them up for adoption as soon as they were born. I tear up just thinking of how painful that would be. I can't even imagine what it would be like to go through that, and to those of you who have, you are so brave to have gone through with that. 

I was browsing my facebook newsfeed, when I stumbled upon a link to [a facebook page](http://imgur.com/a/93cvc) (I've taken screen shots and uploaded them to imgur, so the link won't bring you directly to the page) one of my facebook friends shared. I was immediately confused when I saw it bore the title ""I am for women, I am for children, I am for life."" When I read the description, my confusion turned to rage. The description is written by a male. I am not at all saying men shouldn't be allowed to have an opinion on abortion, but the campaign claims to be ""For Women"".

How can this campaign be for women if the person running it isn't even a woman? He never had to experience an abortion procedure with his own body. He never had to experience the terror and sickness one feels when sitting in a stall in dorm building's communal bathroom and staring at the little pink plus sign of the 7th stick they've pissed on to confirm their pregnancy. Maybe he has impregnated a woman who then got an abortion, but from how he worded his essay, he hasn't been. Regardless, the fact remains, until you've been impregnated at 18 years old by a 20 year old college kid you've only been with for two weeks, or until you've been any woman who has ever experienced an unwanted pregnancy for *any* reason, you can't claim your pro-life campaign is ""For Women"".

Campaign away for pro-life causes, I don't care! But don't mask a freaking campaign for pro-life under women's rights and ""liberation from the choice to end a life"", because that is where I begin to have a problem with you.

&gt;I guess I'm talking about this for a couple reasons. For one, the only people we hear from on this issue are women and priests. Well here is an average guy saying something now, and hoping other average guys will come out of the woodwork despite the fear of being ""that person on Facebook trying to push an agenda."" This is not politics. My father has told me my entire life that a true man is one who takes responsibility. Men: step up and show your girlfriend, wife, family and friends that you will say something, too. A society like ours is proud to be founded upon accountability in the vain of justice. This is justice. Simply saying ""I wouldn't, but its not my place to tell others not to"" like I once did is a cop-out. There is surely a place for tolerance in our world--we all come from different backgrounds, different religions, different upbringings--but as human beings, isn't it a given that we should all take a stand for humanity? As Americans, if we see injustice, especially pertaining to life or death, we do something. Let's be courageous men and women and stand up for real and true lives being ended. If we ALL wouldn't do it ourselves, then isn't something wrong?""

Maybe the reason you *only* hear it from women is because it's an issue about the biological female's body. And guess what, I have news for you. I have never said ""I wouldn't do it, but it's not m place to tell others not to"", because I HAVE done it, and I WOULD do it again if I got pregnant at an inopportune time. This is not justice. This is an ill-informed campaign run by men to stop women from making a very personal, private, and difficult choice that the majority of human beings are lucky enough not to have to make. The only thing WRONG here is your campaign and your bold claims, sir. 

Love,
An actual post-abortion female who doesn't regret it. 
(Yeah. We exist.)

I just wanted to know if anyone gets really anxious/guilty when they don't work out. I'm pretty fit and healthy, but there's still some lingering trouble areas that I'd like to get rid of. I try to work out four times a week, usually something kickboxing/martial arts style, and I eat pretty healthy foods (except I snack often).

 This week, I've been feeling kind of burned out. My schedule is really packed since I intern all week, take classes and am part of student organizations, so I've started working out early in the morning before my day starts. I've been keeping up with it, but I think this week I'm starting to feel the pressure(since I had a big test on Monday), and I haven't been working out since Sunday. 

My problem is, when I skip workouts, I get really anxious about it. I'll stand in front of the mirror and examine myself more than usual; I'll check muscle tone, grab at fat. If I don't work out, I get scared that I'm becoming flabby. I think it's all in my mind, but I still can't help the feeling. "

**How do I record my microphone/guitar/preamp with my computer?**

If you're here you most likely want to record yourself or others onto some storage medium.  Computers provide a convienent, flexible, low-cost medium (compared to tape, et al) for recording audio.  For analog audio signals to be converted into digital signals that can stored and manipulated on a computer it must undergo the process of analog-to-digital conversion and for you to be able to listen it again, it must be converted back to the analog domain through a digital-to-analog converter.  Any computer soundcard contains these converters (known as ADCs and DACs), though for recording purposes a profesional device is typically used.  The professional converters we are interested in here are called 'audio interfaces', which is what we call converters that have some method of interfacing with a computer.  They can come in two forms: internal cards (PCI, PCIe) or external interfaces (USB, Firewire, Thunderbolt).

These interfaces vary wildly in their features and cost, typically in number of channels, how many of those channels have microphone preamps, if any have hi-z inputs for direct recording of guitar/bass, additional digital inputs, and internal hardware routing and effects.  Some will even operate independently of a computer in a 'standalone mode.'  External interfaces are increasingly common, with them being included in many low-cost mixers as well (though frequently only a 2-channel stereo interface on cheaper models), and performance of reasonable quality can be had rather cheaply.

**What kind of computer do I need for recording?**

This is not a computer-focused sub, posts regarding building a pc will be removed.  Post questions about building computers in [/r/buildapc](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc).  That said, a recording PC is not very different from a gaming PC, minus the need for a fast graphics card.  A quality motherboard, power supply, and fast CPU are pretty much essential.  8-16GB of RAM is a good idea, more if you're going to be running large multisampled software instruments like orchestra packs.  Two hard drives, one for your OS/applications and one for recording/sample libraries is also a good idea (required for PT) to avoid underruns due to hard disk paging.  The internal graphics in the newer Intel and AMD CPUs are fine, a graphics card isn't going to make your DAW run better.  In fact, high performance graphics cards can be a source of interference and noise.  I also have a sneaking suspicion that PWM fans may be a source of interference as well, but I don't use them myself so I can't test that theory.

**How do I soundproof my dorm/bedroom/apartment?**

The first thing you should know is that sound proofing is not acoustic treatment.  Soundproofing is a method of reducing sound transmission between the studio and outside the studio.  Acoustic treatment aims to treat the studio so that the acoustics are better for recording.

Unfortunately it is very difficult and expensive to effectively soundproof an existing structure. Another factor to consider is that if you are renting or otherwise do not own the property it may be against the terms of your lease to modify the space in any meaningful way. As well, soundproofing is effective only in certain frequency ranges, with cost and difficulty inversely correlated with frequency; that is, it is more difficult and costly to soundproof against low frequencies versus high frequencies. The following links describe soundproofing and acoustic treatment in the context of small spaces in more detail.

**What DAW (Digital Audio Workstation, ie recording software) should I use?**

*This is not an exhaustive list of DAWs or their capabilities.*

The answer to this question is highly dependent on your situation. You don't 'need' Pro Tools to do professional-sounding work; in fact many pros use DAWs such as [MOTU Digital Performer](http://www.motu.com/products/software/dp/) or [Steinberg Cubase](http://www.steinberg.net/en/products/cubase/start.html).  Pro Tools has become something of a de-facto standard in commercial studios due to a variety of historical factors (not the least of which is [vendor lock-in] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_lock-in)) and familiarity for outside engineers, however many have moved away from Pro Tools for some of those same reasons.  Other popular DAWs are [Cockos Reaper](http://www.reaper.fm/)(very affordable, lots of functionality), [Ableton Live](http://www.ableton.com)(focused on live performance of electronic music), [Apple Logic Pro](http://www.apple.com/logicpro/)(popular in audio post circles).  [Cakewalk Sonar](http://www.cakewalk.com/products/sonar/), [Presonus StudioOne](http://studioone.presonus.com/), [Image-Line FL Studio](http://flstudio.com), [Steinberg Nuendo](http://www.steinberg.net/en/products/nuendo.html), and [Propellerheads Reason](http://www.propellerheads.se/products/reason/) all have their devotees as well.  Nearly all of these products have free trials available, so feel free to try them out and see what works for you.

###Some advice to follow before posting a thread about noise or other problems

*******

**Basic Troubleshooting**


Before posting questions about problems, please follow these steps for basic troubleshooting.

Many of these may seem illogical, but many implementations of technology are more involved than they may seem.  Basic troubleshooting typically involves replacing components with 'known good' equivalents and seeing if it makes a difference.  For example, noise in a vocal recording:  replace the microphone cable.  If that fixes it, the microphone cable is bad.  If it doesn't fix it, try another mic, different preamp, etc.  

http://www.reddit.com/r/audioengineering/wiki/index#wiki_basic_troubleshooting




**I'm getting noise in my recordings, help?**


Before posting about a noise problem, please make a recording of the noise. It is impossible to properly diagnose the source of the noise through colorful language. Words like ""static"", ""buzzing"", ""clicking"" can all mean different things to different people. Buffer underrun sounds different from cellphone interference, however both could be described as clicking, buzzing, or stuttering.  Also provide a complete description of the signal chain from beginning to end, type/model of computer if there's a computer involved, and pictures of everything (including where cables are going) if possible. What may seem unrelated or insignificant to you may in fact be the source of the problem. Help us help you.  [It's also worth noting you may be experiencing *mechanical noise* rather than *electrical noise*.](http://recordinghacks.com/2013/02/18/fixing-microphone-hum/)

It is also FAR more preferable to re-record the source than trying to remove noise after the fact.  Audio never comes out the other end unscathed. 

*****
Some examples of common noises:

[Cellphone/GSM noise](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1mlponX_jw)

[Buffer Underruns](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6Ysh7Y9_bI)

[Ground Loop](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSA2F1AwboU)

There isn't much you can do about Cellphone/GSM noise other than banning cellphones from the studio.  In my experience the noise doesn't travel all that far, though, so if you get them several feet away, you may be OK.  YMMV.  Even if your entire signal chain is balanced, the voice coils and/or internal wiring of your monitors can still pick it up.  If anyone has a better solution, let me know.

Buffer underruns can be fixed by increasing the size of the hardware buffer on your interface.  How to do this varies with different software and hardware, check your manual on how to do this.  Note: Increasing your buffer size will increase the latency in the audio path, not generally a problem during mixdown but it can cause major issues for artists/talent during recording.  In general, it is best to keep latency low during tracking and try to minimize the use of plugins during tracking to reduce load on the system.

Ground loops can be some of the most difficult problems to fix in the studio.  The recommended method of fixing a ground loop is through an isolation transformer or using a 'ground lift' IN THE AUDIO PATH.  FOR YOU OWN SAFETY, DO NOT LIFT THE POWER GROUND.  IF AN INTERNAL FAULT OCCURS WHILE THE POWER GROUND IS LIFTED THE CHASSIS MAY BECOME LIVE AND POTENTIALLY LETHAL VOLTAGES CAN BECOME PRESENT ON THE CHASSIS OF THE GEAR.

18fkq0,6,2013-02-13,Academic Suspension to Dean's List to Job at a Fortune 500 company,frenchybrown,GetMotivated,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/18fkq0/academic_suspension_to_deans_list_to_job_at_a/,"I had a previous post this summer about my trip from academic suspension to dean's list [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/togf6/my_story_of_academic_suspension_to_deans_list/). 

But now I have an update:

I had committed to and signed a lease for this year, but had no plan to pay for it. I had unsuccessfully searched for internships during the year but failed on every single one, so this left me starting the summer with $500/month for rent and utilities and no way to pay for it. I went job searching like crazy, got a shitty job working for a paper mill making $8/hr and working 10+ hour days. I quickly decided this sucked and applied to and got a job at a Car Rental Company at the nearby airport. I had applied to a basic position but was promoted during the interview and I cannot stress enough how much of a blessing this job has been. I can't think of many college kids who have made just shy of $20,000 in about 8 months of my senior year, this allowed me to stay debt free for school and housing!

Once the fall semester opened I finally had basically had it with the drinking and not caring scene to the fullest and decided that I would not fail in getting a job before graduation, no exceptions. I immediately starting applying to jobs and going to information sessions, writing cover letters, sending follow up e-mails. I wasn't perfect and definitely missed many application deadlines and had to work during some info sessions, which was a downer, but by October I had 4 interviews lined up!

Now I was understandably nervous that my GPA would hurt me in these, but again, it didn't matter because I told myself I wouldn't fail. Meanwhile none of my friends were really even looking, they commented on but weren't really interested in me heading out suited up with portfolio in hand, I think they just thought I would fail and jobs weren't worth trying for.

Well first interview went awful, she asked a lot of questions I wasn't ready for, she had me scrambling to answer and honestly we both came to the conclusion that I was neither right for the job nor did I really want it, regardless it was a crushing blow. Next interview I knocked out of the park! I had the good fortune of interviewing with someone I had previously met at an info session and had talked to her and her boss for about 10 mins at the info session. Interview went great, I had excellent answers for everything they threw at me, but the dreaded question of GPA came up and while I feel I handled it well, no doubt that hurt me. Finally, my last two both went excellent. 

Over the next 2 weeks I got several e-mails about how it was so nice to meet me but there were other more qualified candidates and I was freaking out, but I got one second round at the company's corporate campus. Although I knew I couldn't fail, only having one option...especially after I thought I had done so well really scared me. The interview was an all day affair with several panels and even a test. But three weeks later in mid november, I got the best call in the world, $50k a year and now while everyone else is scrambling I can rest easy and count down the days.

Even right now, my friends who have no idea, lead or anything towards a job are out celebrating fat Tuesday while I do homework. So long story short, nothing beats perseverance, not your past or others thoughts, nothing.

I'm an economics major, so i like to put everything in those terms, so remember, everything you've ever failed at in your entire life is a ""sunk cost"" nothing you can do, will change or remove the time, effort and opportunities you've lost, so stop thinking about how they're holding you back and just don't take no for an answer.

Hope this hits home to some of you who were/are in my shoes. There was a point when I thought I blew it, but now I can sit back and relax, knowing that I turned things around. Nothing would make my day more than to help anyone out with any questions or advice on righting the ship or looking for jobs, I left out a lot of details on what I did. It was about 2 months of non-stop class, homework, work, applying for jobs, sleep and repeat it's not easy but it is possible."

18fegs,1,2013-02-12,Last Tuesday,[deleted],shortstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/18fegs/last_tuesday/,"	Harry woke up last Tuesday morning. This wasn't a particularly unusual event, as he had woken up every morning in a similar manner for thirty-five years. He had developed the habit of turning the alarm off several times before crawling out of bed, and Tuesday was no different. He stumbled to the bathroom, scratched his stubble and emptied his bladder. All typical morning activities. He made his coffee, smoked a cigarette, and thumbed through the paper. Nothing atypical.
	He took a shower and pondered his existence. While this may have been an ordinary action at other times, Harry had come to a new conclusion: his life was no longer worth living. 
	Harry was a thinker, and knew to take each thought with care. He kept this thought and studied it. There was validity to the thought. Harry's life was never really worth living; but, it wasn't really worth dieing for, either. He was typically caught in a penumbra of apathy.
	He finished his shower, and returned to his newspaper. Another school shooting. At a preschool, this time. The culprit was a war veteran. He unloaded his fully automatic assault rifle into the kids while they napped. The teachers were unharmed; they were fucking a few blocks away in a rented car.
	The shooter then walked down the street to a retirement home where he murdered three elderly women who were sitting on their porch. On Mondays, they liked to drink tea and knit. They found it quaint. The veteran found killing innocent people quaint. It takes all kinds.
	In his final act, the armed man walked into the main office and pulled the pin on a grenade. Twenty-five people died that day. Twelve children, ten adults, and three old ladies. But who's keeping a tally?
	Harry didn't finish the article. There had been another shooting a week ago. And another not too far beyond that. Harry had become numb to the slaughter. He grabbed his coat and drove to work, at a minor chemical manufacturer. He was a bench-chemist. He mostly cleaned glassware for people who stayed in school longer than him. But it was a job, thankless and hopeless.
	As Harry swirled a dilute sulfuric acid and potassium dichromate solution in an erlenmeyer flask, his earlier idea bubbled back into his brain. His life really wasn't worth living. The other people in the lab weren't particularly friendly. They all had families and friends and things to do. Harry often wished he had things to do.
	He wasn't an unattractive individual, but he wasn't attractive either. This enabled to go through life practically invisible. Most people never knew he was ever around. Even as a child, his family barely acknowledged his existence. He'd often have to walk home from practice or work or school simply because his parents had forgotten they had had three children.
	Once, Santa forgot about him on Christmas. He never forgave Santa. Another time, his family celebrated his birthday three weeks early. No one could remember when he was born.
	While he was studying chemistry, his parents divorced and remarried. His cousin had over-dosed on benzos. Three friends committed group suicide. His mother suffered a mental collapse and was beaten to death by her abusive meth-addicted second husband. His older brother got married, had children, and got a divorce. Harry didn't learn any of this until five years ago. It took his extended family over ten years to realize they hadn't told him.
	Harry didn't care much about his family. He was disowned by his father when he was sixteen because he smoked pot. 
	Harry knew he had a gun at home. He'd stick the barrel to the side of his head and throw in the towel.
	As Harry finished his work and walked to his car, a stranger followed him into the parking lot. When Harry unlocked his car, the individual stuck the barrel of his gun to his ribcage and demanded all of Harry's possessions. Clothes, car and all.
	Harry laughed. ""I'm going home to kill myself. Shoot me if you have to. You'll only hasten the process and preserve a shred of my dignity."" The man shot him in the abdomen and fled. A woman heard the blast and came over to investigate.
	She saw Harry slumped on the ground, next to his car. She called an ambulance. She walked  next to Harry as he groaned. He was bleeding, as one could expect. She sat down and held his head. She stroked his hair. She said everything was going to be okay. She told him her name was Maggie. Well, Margaret, actually, but that's the name her mother used to call her when she was in trouble. Maggie didn't like that name.
	The ambulance arrived and Maggie rode with him. She lied and said she was his wife. Harry had never even been in a relationship longer than a week. Easy come, easy go.
	Maggie waited with Harry until someone close to him showed up. She was sure he had someone who would care if he got shot. Doesn't everybody?
	Nobody came asking for Harry.
	She stayed overnight, and read out loud from the book she had on her. She loved reading books out loud. Still no one arrived looking for Harry.
	Luckily, the bullet had missed the vital parts of Harry, and he was in no mortal danger. He was wounded and sore, certainly, but a far cry from dead. He woke disoriented and vaguely coherent. 
	Harry wasn't a religious man, but he thought he had reached the equivalent of an after-life. He saw Maggie. An angel, certainly. The rising sun silhouetted her frizzed hair giving the illusion of a halo. Harry was glad to have seen her. Harry liked seeing beautiful things.
	""Where am I?"" He asked towards Maggie.
	""The hospital.""
	""Oh.""
	Harry relaxed into his bedding and closed his eyes. 
	""Is there anyone I should contact for you? I'm sure someone's worried sick about you.""
	""Nope. What you see is what you get.""
	Maggie moved next to Harry and held his hand. ""I'm Maggie. It's going to be okay.""
	Harry smiled. Maybe things were finally turning for the better. ""I've got to go to work. I'll be back this evening."" She left, and passed a medical school student on her way in.
	The medical school intern stared at a chart, then looked at the name on Harry's chart. 
        ""Harry is like Barry. It must just be a typo."" The intern thought to herself. She attached the I.V. line into Harry's arm.
	Harry died later that afternoon. He had a major allergic reaction to the penicillin that the intern had pumped into his arm. Easy come, easy go."
18ewz9,38,2013-02-12,"Well 2X, she's pregnant.  We probably won't keep it.  How can I support her through this? [long]",[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18ewz9/well_2x_shes_pregnant_we_probably_wont_keep_it/,"My wife and I eloped last Friday. Her period was supposed to happen right around our wedding day. It didn't come. She kept thinking it would come any day now, since she'd had some spotting. She picked up a pregnancy test just to ease her mind.

She walked out of the bathroom white as a sheet. I immediately knew I couldn't freak out.

""We're pregnant?"" I asked her, seriously.

""I... I didn't think it was really possible.""

She walked over to the counter in our kitchen and sat there. She started to cry and tremble. She was totally unprepared for this. I tried to comfort her as best I could. I told her that I loved her no matter what, that we would get through this together, and that no matter what, it would be okay.

She wanted to use the other test in the pack (came with 2), so I got her a glass of water. Her hands were shaking so badly she could barely hold the glass. I made her something to eat since we'd just gotten home and we sat down and ate for about 10 minutes.

I came over to where she was sitting on the couch and rubbed her feet while we talked to try to keep her calm. She told me that she felt like this was the worst possible time. She's in her last semester of graduate school, and there's no way she'd ever get a job if she was pregnant. My income can't support 3. We struggle with just 2 people. She told me she wanted a family, she wanted to have children, but this didn't seem like the right time. She wanted a career too.

I told her that I agreed. She has a fantastic job, a fantastic internship, and her degree is really valuable. I told her that I wanted a family too, but maybe this was the wrong time.

My family has always disliked her, and she started crying again when she thought of when we'd tell them about the pregnancy. My father has made *horrible* comments about her (she's trying to trap you with a baby, she just wants to get married and take all your money, she's low-class trash). I can't even imagine the smug satisfaction they'd put on us if they found out we eloped and she was pregnant. It was just one more thing that upset her.

I want to stand by her, but I don't know what she's going through. She wants us to make this decision together, and she's conflicted about what she wants. She had a miscarriage a few years into our relationship. We had broken up at the time, and she never told me she was pregnant until it happened. She's scared that she's getting older (28) and won't be able to have children. Maybe it will never be a good time start a family and we should just do it?

I would deal with it if she wanted to keep it, but I think this is the worst possible timing for us. I'd get another job, find a better job, something. I'd make it okay. I don't want to tell her what to do with her body. She wants to make the decision together, and since she's of mixed mind and I think we should get an abortion, she's said that she'll probably get the abortion. She doesn't want to ""force you into that situation.""

I feel horrible. I feel like I've bullied her into giving up her control over her body. I don't want to make the decision for her, and I feel like that's what I'm doing.

She took the second test and it was positive as well. She's going to get an appointment with a doctor ASAP to get a blood test and confirm, then look into appointments with the local women's clinic for an abortion.

I simultaneously want to cry, punch the wall, and hug her. I love her so much, and I want to support her every step of the way. I feel like I don't understand what she's going through. What can I do to help her? What can I do to make her feel supported in this decision?

**tl;dr: Oh shit, she's pregnant. Probably going to get an abortion. How can I support her while we deal with this?**

**Edit:** Thank you everyone for the comments. I really don't think I have the strength right now to respond to everyone, but waking up to this helped a lot. We're going to get through this. I'm just freaking out in my own way.

**Edit 2:** Dropped her off at work. She cried in the car and apparently didn't sleep a wink last night. I spent ten minutes sobbing in my car outside of work once it all caught up to me. Today is off to a stellar start. I feel unimaginably terrible."

I need to find a place and was hoping if any fellow redditors could offer any advice. I'm currently using Craigslist, but was looking into other alternatives as well. I have friends in the area, but none who are looking for housing. So I am looking for randoms or a one bedroom place.

I'm a pretty active guy, like to go out to bars and such on Weekends. Love going to sporting events and anything of that nature.

Does anyone have any areas and websites they could recommend to help me on my search? I have a budget of $1,200 a month at most. I'd also like to be within a reasonable commute from Manhattan (If I can't find anything there) as that is where I hope to be working.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!"

The first time was when I was 20 and was living in a new city. I didn't have any friends yet and tended to self-isolate, which led to pretty severe depression. I came out of it for a while once I moved back home, but then underwent some major stress (working 3 jobs, finishing my degree) about a year later, and experienced major anxiety/depression again. 

After barely finishing school (I was a straight A student until the final semester, where I missed classes/assignments and bullshitted my way into good grades, I decided to take some time off at the advice of a counsellor, live off my savings for a while (Canadian here, apologies to student loan sufferers). I made lifestyle changes. I have always been healthy, but I cut out sugar from my diet, taking supplements, forcing myself outside every day and started exercising A LOT (I found 1 hour a day minimum basically eliminated my anxiety). 

I got a great internship, which led to a 1 year contract in an extremely competitive career. I felt like everything was okay, but recently I've been unemployed and I've realized that I may have just been masking my depression with being busy. 

I'm now more depressed than ever and have decided to completely cut out all alcohol (was never a heavy drinker), start taking medication (Cipralex), and seeing a psychiatrist.

Does anyone else feel frustrated with having to tightly control many aspects of their lives just to prevent relapse?"

Trying to keep kids from smoking that crack. ,[deleted],Assistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/18i0oc/pdap_youthyoung_adult_drug_free_camping_trip_any/,"I know Reddit can do miracles so I'm giving this a shot!

I'm a college student doing my internship at Palmer Drug Abuse Program (PDAP) in South Texas. It's a non-profit organization that gives free substance abuse counseling (group and individual) to people ages 12 and up, and their families. But we don't do just that, we also give our clients a drug-free environment where they can come and hang out without worrying about getting pressured to use from friends and family or having the temptation. On Friday and Saturday nights we have activities like bowling, volleyball, or BBQ. We try to promote a positive environment and keep our clients clean from drugs/alcohol. I've learned so much from being there and interacting with different people. You'd be surprised at how addicts come in all shapes and sizes. I'm proud to be working with this organization and I hope Reddit can help donate to this cause. There is a camping trip PDAP takes every Spring Break to get the youth and young adults away from the partying that goes on in our area. We're 15 minutes away from Mexico and an hour from South Padre Island. It's crazy how much drinking and using happens during this one week. So this camping trip is a life-saver for some of our clients. During the four days we're out there, we do different activities like hiking, swimming, canoeing, football, or just sitting around the fire at night talking. Most of these kids come from single-parent homes that are low-income and can only bring themselves on this trip. So we try to provide the food, van, accommodations, activities, and gas that it takes. And it takes a good amount of money. We have some, but since it's non-profit (which means little money for trips), we don't have enough. We need at least $2,000 to make this trip possible. Please help us out Reddit! I know you guys love good causes and this is something I hope you can get behind. Even if you don't have any money to donate, thanks for reading my long post. Maybe when you do have extra funds one day, you'll remember this and donate to future PDAP causes.

18hmdt,28,2013-02-13,"Skeptic geek's corner: ""Tell Me Pink or Blue"" early fetal gender test",babytummyMD,BabyBumps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/18hmdt/skeptic_geeks_corner_tell_me_pink_or_blue_early/,"If you've considered doing one of those mail-in blood tests to detect fetal gender, you may be interested in what I found out about the ""Tell Me Pink or Blue"" test by Consumer Genetics Inc. (tellmepinkorblue.com). Warning, wall of text! I'll stick the **TL;DR up here: buyer beware!**


Quick facts about the test if you're not familiar:

* TMPOB purports to detect fetal gender by looking for the Y-chromosome from fetal blood within a small, pinprick sample of maternal blood.
* It's been known since 1997 that ""cell free"" fetal DNA is present in the mother's blood and can be analyzed for chromosomal defects - this is the basis of the Maternit21 test.
* With TMPOB, you order a kit with some lancets and band-aids, perform the test at home and mail it in to the lab in California. It costs between $170 - $330 for the test depending on the shipping/processing speed you select. The marketing materials claim 95% accuracy and detection as early as 7 weeks.

I was curious about TMPOB because 1) I'm impatient for my anatomy scan, and 2) it's a scammy-looking website, yet their story kind of checks out. Cell-free fetal DNA analysis is a real thing. They also provide a lot of info about their laboratory and offer a money-back guarantee.

Sooo ... I just spent a crap-ton of time researching this company, the people it claims are its management, their location, their accuracy claims, etc.

Here's what I found out. Add up all these facts and see what you get:

* The most damning evidence: Consumer Genetics Inc. has an ""F"" rating with the BBB and is not accredited by the BBB, after failing to respond to 21 of 22 consumer complaints. The home kit isn't sold on Amazon anymore, but old customer reviews claim they had to make multiple refund requests and were given false information about the whereabouts of their refund check. All of the positive customer reviews come from Amazon accounts which have no other reviews.
* Consumer Genetics Inc. recruiting materials found online (such as http://www.consumergenetics.com/pdfs/FTInternshipGuidelines051607.pdf), plus some LinkedIn profiles of former employees, seem to indicate there is actually lab work being done that involves purifying samples and PCR reactions, which fits with their explanation of the lab process (http://www.consumergenetics.com/pdfs/CG-POB-Publication-Oct-2008.pdf). So, maybe they aren't just throwing your blood sample into the trash. The fact that 3-month interns are the ones conducting the tests may not exactly set you at ease.
* Mail-in genetic tests like these are unregulated by the FDA or FTC. Additionally, the consent form you file which is supposedly in place to prevent gender selection abortions also relieves Consumer Genetics of any liability for damages to ""yourself or anyone else"" as a result of the test.
* From geneticsandsociety.org: ""Italian researchers published a study in 2005 demonstrating that they could correctly identify 98.7% of boys and 100% of girls by looking for male DNA in maternal blood drawn during the first trimester. But their method required a relatively large blood sample -- 10 milliliters -- that was processed within a few hours. The [direct to consumer] companies, in contrast, require just three to 10 drops of dried blood, which can take days to arrive through the mail."" By requesting a dried blood sample on a flat card, TMPOB avoids the challenge and expense of meeting mailing requirements for biohazardous material. 
* Consumer Genetics has been selling this service since about 2006. The study and article it cites on using cell-free fetal DNA to detect gender came out in 2011.
* The Consumer Genetics personnel listed on their site may not actually work there. For example, Terry Carmichael is variously listed as the Executive Vice President, Vice President of Marketing &amp; Sales, member of the Board of Directors ... and on his own LinkedIn profile, as having no connection with Consumer Genetics at all. Could be just various versions of the truth, but the stockpile of PhDs and MSs named by the company in contrast to the reported business size *kinda* points to some tenuous connections.

I'd be curious to know what any of you science-y types deduce, but just as a consumer and online researcher, I'd say TMPOB smells rotten.

**Edit/update:** I contacted Fair Oaks Women's Health, the clinic that helped TMPOB run their accuracy trial. A physician there confirmed they tested 20 specimens and TMPOB accurately predicted gender for 19 of them. The TMPOB literature cites a survey where they tested 31 samples -- 4 (13%) were inconclusive, 26 were accurate, 1 was inaccurate. Neither study confirms that they used dried blood samples taken more than 24 hours prior, like they do for customers. My own Scooby sense feels that they could easily turn an inconclusive into a fake result just to avoid sending out and performing a re-test.

**UPDATE 2:** I ordered a kit for myself before I did all this research. Frowny face. My experience so far? Did not send me an email with credit charge receipt, as they stated they would. Did not send email saying my test results were available. Did not respond to on-site customer service request. Customer service number is busy and has no voicemail/phone tree. I'm now emailing an address I found on the site (probably a slush pile) plus the CEO's email address. We'll see if anyone responds."
18hjwj,4,2013-02-13,I had a really rough day and I was not able to handle it as well as I would have liked and I feel horrible about it. ,[deleted],ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/18hjwj/i_had_a_really_rough_day_and_i_was_not_able_to/,"First of all I want to apologize because I'm not very active in this community. I find it very emotional and overwhelming to read all of your posts. It sucks me in, it makes me angry and depressed and its all very hard to handle.

I do want to say that you are all very brave souls, getting through the day as best you can and dealing with PTSD, as hard as it getts. When I see your posts I feel so much for you guys and I send you all hugs and support and I care.

I hope I'm not viewed as selfish for posting and not actively supporting you all. But I had a really rough day and I just needed to share it with people who might understand.

I've been struggling with PTSD since 2008. I was on antidepressants and xanax and ambien for a really long time until I got fed up with my antidepressants and decided to at least try to get off them. Anyway, long story short, it took me 2 years but after a lot of therapy, diet changes and exercise I've pretty much been the antidepressants, only have to take xanax and ambien very little. Not to say that I still don't have panic attacks, or nightmares or sleepless nights, I've just learned to deal with them differently and I feel so much better without the medication.

Anyway, today I had to stay home from my internship because someone was going to come and shut our gas on and if I didn't we'd be without gas for a week. I had all these plans to be productive and clean and finish some internship work and read and make the best of my day at home. A couple of hours into the morning I wasn't feeling all that great. I was anxious about doing my work, because I struggle with being an absolute failure (does anybody else experience this?). I've had HUGE confidence issues since the accidents. I doubt myself at every turn. After they finally got here to activate the gas, it started getting windy and that is one of my triggers and I was overwhelmed with a horrible panic attack that essentially rendered me useless. I was a mess and I was beating myself up for not being able to deal with it like I have in the past and I finally decided to take some xanax and crawl into bed. Within 20 minutes I was asleep and that was over 4 hours ago. 

I just woke up and though I physically feel a lot better, I kinda feel like a failure for a day wasted and not being able to handle my shit.

That's all. Sorry about the wall of text of a rant.

TL;DR: Had a massive panic attack. Took xanax for the first time in months. Passed out for several hours. Feel like a failure for a wasted day and not doing what I needed/wanted to to keep working on my career and life. "
18lovx,5,2013-02-15,I (20M) feel like my girlfriend (20F) is totally apathetic.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/18lovx/i_20m_feel_like_my_girlfriend_20f_is_totally/,"Yesterday was Valentines Day, obviously. Let me take you through the day. Me(20M), her(20F)

We live in separate college towns but were both coming home for VD. I posted a cute picture of us on her wall with a cheesy ""happy valentines day see you soon etc etc"" post on her FB wall. She gets on facebook, messages me, comments on a few things, and doesn't even like it, although 10-20 other people had. We were messaging back and forth and eventually I just said ""Chu don't like my post I worked so hard on???"" (trying to be cute, haha whatever), which then she liked it without responding to me. I know this is small, but the fact that she saw it and was totally apathetic kind of bugged me.

We get home a few hours later, both happy, and I give her ~$100 necklace and ~$50 flowers, as I had just gotten an internship so I wanted to do something a little extra special. After making everything look cute, I went over to her house to give it to her. When I got there, she said thank you and her mom had made me cookies and snacks to take back with me. She said she got me a card but hadn't written in it yet. I think ""this is fine, it was a busy week for her, whatever."" Then she offers to pay for a concert for someone I've never heard of that she wants to see. I say ""OK"" but I'll just end up paying for it anyways.

Then the worst part happens. We're laying in bed just watching youtube videos or something because it was late and we were tired, and I try to kiss her but she kept making silly faces or backing away. She then says ""All you ever want is kisses."" Although it's obvious she means sex. Now, we haven't had sex in months although we spent all winter break forever. Needless to say, I'm a little peeved because I already feel like if I was only here for sex, I wouldn't be here. And we've had this conversation before, I could have sex every day and she could go her whole life without it. So I say ""Because we never do anything anymore"" To which she replies ""I can make it never.""

I didn't say anything, but this has really been bugging me. I feel like she knows she has all the power and really doesn't care what happens to us. She seems totally apathetic to our relationship, unless I get on her nerves. Then she yells at me and ignores me. And she knows that she can 'reward' me with sex if I do something good.

Am I exaggerating? Making something up that isn't there? Thanks all.


**tldr**; I say ""We never have sex."" She says ""I can make it never."" and generally acts uninterested in our relationship."

How can my wife improve her university application essay?,[deleted],writing,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/18lfda/critique_hi_reddit_how_can_my_wife_improve_her/,"So my wife would love some feedback on this but I'm not a great writer. If any of you would like to lend a hand I'd love to buy the most helpful of you a cup of coffee (paypal) as a thank you for your invaluable generosity. We needed to cover a wide list of topics within 700-1000 words and decided to take a story approach instead of the awful My family history is... My challenges are... I hope to one day... 

So with that in mind, here it is.


	When I was 10, I remember opening my eyes at three one morning to sounds of my mother cleaning the house for her first day in business. As I matured I understood the depth of her immigrant success story. Sacrificing for what all parents want to give their children -a life with opportunities she didn’t grow up with. Today, I’m the first in my family attending college and I owe her so much gratitude. This alone is enough to remind me to smile as I write. She, however, is not the only person that made a major impact in my first years in college. 
 
	In elementary school I met the wonderful boy named Chris I’d marry one day: it just took us a decade to find out. During our first year together we could barely make ends meet, so I decided to work in a restaurant to help. Night after night I came home, often frustrated and unfulfilled. I felt I let my myself down. To my surprise though, this didn’t turn out to be a complete waste of my time. The real world helped me mature as I learned about myself and the value of a tertiary education. I also became aware of my avoidance of embarrassments through self limitations. One day as I vented about work with Chris he said something that I wish never to forget. “I would rather see you fail reaching what you love than watch you succeed somewhere where you will never meet your potential.” These words still echo in my head today.

	That’s when I let go of the fear and doubt that held me back for years. I understood then that courage and resiliency is what separates the doers from the dreamers. In 2010 I enrolled into the University of Central Arkansas while still working part time. Once I did, I finally understood where I belonged. Some nights were unimaginably stressful and I’ve pulled through some long night shifts followed by studying marathons for exams the morning after. I suppose it’s that same determination I saw in my mother, when I was a child, that kept me strong through the times I thought “I can’t possibly absorb another ounce of knowledge today.” I’ve worked restlessly to earn my 3.8 GPA and I’m proud of it because I can say I’ve given it my every bit of effort in me. Luckily this didn’t last long, Chris was soon promoted and I left my job to dedicate all my focus to school. Then, came another surprise. The military gave us orders to move to Washington in 2011.

	The move was a welcomed gift; full of exciting new opportunities including the search for a new school, however, the switch from UCA to TCC gave me a different list of available majors though so I was back to the drawing board. First I felt a medical field was the answer since it seems like an purposeful aspiration but I felt no emotional connection there. I wasn't thrilled about working in a medical field, but the more I grew and learned, I noticed my affinity for numbers, their rules, and systems. I was intrigued by the constant truth in the world of math where nothing is left to subjectivity. I had found my third love in life, and that's when I had an epiphany that connected it all. If my mother became a successful entrepreneur, alone and without a single day of business school; what couldn’t I achieve with an amazing education? That’s when I knew exactly what I wanted to major in and in life; a business degree with a focus in finance to open a commercial photography studio within a year of graduating. The perfect way to combine my talents with my husband’s.

	I want to attend UWT’s Milgard School of Business because I want to know I did everything I possibly could to reach my full potential. At TCC I’ve built my foundation very seriously to prepare for what I’ve heard is a challenging transition. I’m ready to embrace the test of pursuing a finance major with open arms with what can only be described as an unusual enjoyment for math. That however is not the sole reason for choosing UWT. I want to make a positive meaningful change in the lives of young adults who understand poverty first hand. One thing I love about this school are its ties to the community. Within ten years, I want to develop a scholarship for young creative entrepreneurs as well as an internship program. I wish is to one day help others find their dreams because I don’t believe there’re are already too many kind when it comes to helping students reach their potential. As my mother became a first-generation, immigrant, business woman, and as my husband bravely serves in the military, I will prepare for the day when I too can pay it forward.

	Life full of uncertainties, but I’ve come to be sure of a few things in mine. Two of those certainties are my wish to building a successful business with a strong financial structure and developing a community benefiting foundation to encourage new generations of entrepreneurs. It’s beautiful to remember that all this started from an idea of becoming more. Some see decisions as the end of choices but I prefer to see this a the beginning of perfecting. The masters of art earned that title through countless hours of commitment to their craft. Giving your daily effort to work you find meaningful is one of the most rewarding acts we can be a part of and if you travel through life with an unwavering purpose nothing can stop you. Thanks to my loved ones and those who have believed in me, I’ve found my purpose and with it I plan to fuel my success through my years in UWT and beyond.

**Prompt**: In an essay of 300 words or fewer (approximately 1950 characters with spaces), write about your goals for your time at Queen's University and beyond. Your answer will be evaluated for content and writing style.

**Essay**

Pursuing new knowledge and experience in my area of interest has always been an important goal of my life. I feel that the opportunities and resources offered by Queen’s University will allow me to develop new skills and fulfill my lifelong goals. The diverse student body, outstanding professors and the exceptional campus and facilities all contribute to the great appeal of the University to many students, myself included. I believe that Queen’s would be a great fit for my aspirations.

My desire to pursue a career in the computing industry stems from my great interest of the increasingly prevalent technology sector. My interest has lead me to do much independant learning and I would like to continue that learning at a world class institution such as Queen’s. In the next four years of my life I would like to receive the best education possible. The Queen’s computing program would help me achieve that. My goal is to not only achieve high academic grades but also gain valuable experience that will benefit me in the future. The Queen’s Undergraduate Internship Program, a program unique to Queen’s,  is a opportunity I am looking forward to. This program will allow me to gain the practical experience and skills that I will apply in my future career.

I consider post-secondary education to be one of the most important steps of my life and I hope that I can have the privilege of furthering my education at Queen’s."

Last summer I applied for a job as a waitress at a resturant. I was going to try out for the job and I was nervous but not scared. I thought it was gonna go okay, maybe I would even get the job. 
I got there before they opened and was told to do little tasks such as cut bread, dry off wineglasses, set the tables and such. Everything went fine up til when the guests arrived.   
  
 
For example I was told to try and learn the numbers of the tables. There was a picture on the computer over the resturant and which number the tables were. I have a really hard time remebering and even getting stuff like this to stay in my head so it didn't go so well.  

Then I was told to put the knifes and forks on a table with 2 persons. I was told to put them in order, like salad, meat and so on. As I said, I have a hard time remembering things so I did it wrong. I was told to go do it again, and it took 3 times of me running back and forth to the couple and the table to rearrange their silwerface before I got it right.
  
   
Later I went around the tables refilling everyones water. I spilled a bit at one table and didn't even think to go get napkins to dry it up. Wtf brain? It wasn't before the guy at the table waved at me and pointed at the wet spot on the table that I went to dry it up. I apologized and felt so stupid and embarressed.  
  

Then, I was going to put some silverware at a table. Everything went fine until I knocked over the lady at the tables wineglass, over her blouse. I freaked out and said I was sorry a million times and went to go get napkins. The manager was talking to her and I proceeded to tell her how sorry I was. She was a sweetheart about it and said it was okay.
I had to go into the back and just stand there for a minute. I felt so fucking ashamed and was considering going home. I felt like I was gonna start crying but I held it together. I wasn't going to give up. The manager just told me it wasn't a big deal, this things happen. And I guess they do, but on my first day? I didn't even dare look him or the lady in the eyes for the rest of the evening.  
  

The rest of the evening I just walked around clearing tables. I was told to serve a table but the plates were to hot so I just couldn't do it. I would have dropped them. For everyone else it seemed to go like clockwork.  
   

At 22 at night I was told I could go home. Didn't hear from the resturant again. Felt like a failure. I cringe whenever I think about it and it's even hard writing about it.  
 

Another example is when I was an intern at a store some years ago. I was going to be the cashier while the guy working there was in the back, and he explained how it worked. I have always been bad at math, but he told me it didn't matter and that I just had to let the machine to the work. First customer arrived and I had completly forgot how it worked. I had to go get him and ask for help.  
  

It's not that I go in to jobs thinking I will fail, I am always feeling positive and thinking I can do it. But then it ends up like this.
  

But then, in august I got a job trough a company that provides people to different workplaces when they need extra staff (manpower) It's not that often, they text when they need people and there's a schedule for when there's free shift. It's in a store and my job is just 4 hours spent putting stuff on their shelves. Really really easy and I like it there.

Last time I worked there I was going home when I ran into the stores manager. She asked me ""how is everything going? you seem a little lost.""
I was kinda suprised since I had worked there like 5 times and I thought everything was going good. I told her I was fine, and she was like ""well okay, cause you may have noticed we try to do our work in a good pace."" I told her ofcourse I knew that and that I was doing my job without ever slacking off. She just looked at me and was like ""well, okay.""  
  
I was competely taken by suprise, I thought everything was going well. I try as hard as I can, but obviously that's never enough. I am retarded or something? 
This was in november and I havn't got a workshift from them since. I'm starting to think maybe she told the company I was lazy and they don't want me there anymore? I havn't been ""fired"" (since it's not the actual store i work for, and I don't know if you can get fired from a company likes this), but it feels really weird. 
  

So yeah. Basically I feel like a big failure that can't even do the easiest tasks. I can't get things trough my head and make them stay there, I'm clumsy and forgetful. I just feel like a burden wherever I go.
All my friends have jobs and I feel like I can't even do the easiest ones.
I don't have high hopes for the future. 
  
I don't know if it will always be like this. I'm just so tired of myself.

18kcn4,7,2013-02-14,Should I talk to my ex-friend and hear his apology?,mythrowaway19290,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/18kcn4/should_i_talk_to_my_exfriend_and_hear_his_apology/,"Here's the gist of my situation, I copied it from a comment I wrote right after it happened last April:

&gt; My really long term girlfriend (would have been six years soon) broke up with me at the beginning of the month because she ""wanted to be single for a while"". We're from the same town (out of state) and came to school together. I'm shy and she was my best friend, so I never put a huge effort into making new friends. The small group of friends I do have are all mutual, and so what was originally a heartbreaking breakup turned infinitely worse when I found out that she started sleeping with one of the mutual friends who I had been talking to and hanging out with for support (so he knew exactly what I was going through). 

Possibly relevant, missing details:

* ***edit:*** After originally writing the above, I found out that they first slept together before we broke up.
* I deleted my ex and ex-friend from my phone, blocked them on Facebook, and cut off all contact with my ex as soon as I moved out of the apartment we shared. I forgot a few things there, and asked my former roommate (and my ex's good friend) if she could give them to me when I came back to school. She must have told my ex because I got a really nasty text about it in August, which I promptly deleted (without replying).
* My ex and the ex-friend starting officially dating at some point soon after.
* I ended up finding out that she broke up with my ex-friend and started dating a co-worker.

All of that happened in April of 2012, so it's been almost a year. Fortunately, I managed to get a great internship from June-December across the country (away from school and away from my/our hometown), I made friends there, and had a blast.

Now I'm back at school. Knowing that she's here and me worrying that I'll see her occasionally triggers some anxiety, but it's gotten better over the last 6 weeks. Fortunately, I haven't seen her or my ex-friend. I'm still a bit bummed and lonely, but it's way better than the months following the breakup.

I talked to one mutual friend right after I got back, and she suggested that we all do something, but she mentioned that they would likely invite  my ex-friend, so I never really pursued the option. I've been hanging out with a couple other mutual friends once in a while and haven't had any issues there. Other than that, I haven't really made much of an effort to connect with the group like I used to.

A few weeks ago, I got a text from my ex-friend saying that he wanted to meet in-person to talk. This really triggered my new-found anxiety, so I just deleted the text and ignored it. Today I got a text from another mutual friend to the effect of ""ex-friend wants to talk so he can apologize and hopefully we can all start hanging out again. Would you be interested? We'd understand if you said no, we just want to see you more""

I really don't want to meet up or talk with the ex-friend, and I really don't think his apology will be worth much to me. I'm still hurt from the breakup, and I feel like a reminder is the last thing I need. Still, a little part of me feels like I'm being a dick if I don't try to accept his apology and move on.

**tl;dr: Ex-girlfriend cheated on me with a mutual friend a year ago. She has since moved onto another relationship. He wants to apologize and start hanging out again.**

Sorry for the lengthy post. I don't know what to do, and I could use some advice."
18k4er,4,2013-02-14,"Holy Mixed Episode, Batman! (just nonsense)",BipolarCos,bipolar,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/18k4er/holy_mixed_episode_batman_just_nonsense/,"OH DEAR LORD!  I'm so freaking manic right now.  Anyone who saw how many replies I just posted in the one asking for help about sexual impulses would have gathered this.

Not two hours ago I was sobbing uncontrollably.  Why? Oh no reason.  Well there was a reason...my best friend got a girlfriend.  Should be happy for him, right?  Oh no...My thought?  He's going to be spending all his time with her and I'm never the peachiest person to talk to so he's going to get tired of my shit and never talk to me and I'm going to be alone.

Oh and that relationship episode?  If any of you guys remember that whole situation...We're talking about dating.  He told me a few days ago that he didn't think us dating was a good idea and it hit me like a ton of bricks...I did have feelings for him...damn strong feelings...and when he said that I realized that I'd just taken him for granted.  Anyway...today we decided that we would wait on making a decision on whether to stay friends for now or try to move forward into a relationship until my therapist apt on Monday.

Holy cow I can't even focus to type...too much.  TOO MUCH.

I should do something productive.  I have school work I could be doing.  But that would require focus.  I need to do some SPELL SOME RIGHT DAMNIT!

I need to be doing some research for my classes.  I could do that with little focus.  Maybe I will do that when I get done typing this..whenever that will be HA! Shouldn't be too long, I'll run out of characters. 

Oh, so my doctor knows I'm mixed right now.  I saw him...last Thursday and he put me on an antipsychotic and upped my antidepressant.  I talked to my therapist about it on Monday because I've never been in a mixed episode this severe before.  The manic is bad enough that I would have slips of delusions...WTF is that you ask? It's what I named this phenomena because I have no idea what else to call it.
**Slips of Delusion** - A gradual chain reaction thought process that starts with a logical thought and ends with a delusional thought, but you are still sane enough to realize what is happening and draw yourself back.

An example you ask? SURE!  I've been watching Supernatural on Netflix.  I was watching it the other day and this was my thought process ""That's really cool.  I wonder if there really are stuff like that out there (btw  believe in ghosts, was actually in a ghost hunting group..want to get back in one..anyway)...I'm sure there are.  But to this degree?  Well no one in this show knows about them but the hunters, so surely there  COULD be something out there like that.  That would be an awesome thing to do. Hunt these bad creatures that no one knows about and save people's lives...Change the world even!  That's it...I'm going to do it.  How do I do it?  I know, I have to find someone who is doing it now and get in it with th... wait ...WTF...You know that shit aint real!""  And I could actually FEEL myself being drawn out of it.  It's so weird, I can't even explain it.

So I'm laying here in bed.  I'll be embarrassed and ashamed and crying tomorrow because me and that guy up there ^^^ that I was talking about just went further than either of us ever meant to..and he's going to feel like shit, which is going to make me feel even worse and that's just going to be bad.  But right now?  I don't care.  I'm freaking wonderful right now.

Man this chick's going to cut her fingers off in a minute.  Just wait...Yeah, I'm still watching Supernatural.

I've been going to bed early late..OH SHIT SHE  IS DRINKING BOILING WATER

Guess I was wrong about her cutting her fingers off.

Like I was said, I've been trying to get on a regular sleep schedule, going to sleep at about 10 or 10:30 and getting up at 6.  I started a diet..but today I so came off of it.  I'll do better tomorrow.  And I've started doing Yoga in the mornings.  I love it.  I tried to add cardio today..I only got 5 minutes into that.  I SAY that I stopped because they started using weights and I don't have any.  Man, that definitely is not true.  It was hard.  I guess 5 minuets is better than nothing but still.

I've gained almost ten pounds in about two weeks.  It's crazy and I hate it.  And Thursday my Doctor put me on something and told me it was temporary because it made you gain weight?  Damnit man.  So, I'm trying really hard on this diet and exercise routine, even if I messed up today.  It's okay to slip up every once in a while, you just have to keep at it and keep motivated.

I'm not going to get any research done.  I'm almost positive that I'm going to keep typing here until I run out of things to type about and then go to bed.

Holy cow, so I wanted to see about how long I've been typing this.  Surly it hasn't been over ten minutes.  It's been over 20! Close to 30!  Whaaa???  Maybe I just looked at the times wrong.

I have a three legged orange tabby kitten named Nemo.  I should take a picture of him and show him off.  I did once before but he got downvoted and it discouraged me.  Not here! I'm pretty sure it was in /r/aww or something.  He's a spunky little thing.  He wants to play with my other cat but she's apparently in a pissy mood. 

So Nemo..When my mom found him he had gotten fishing wire wrapped around his paw and cut off circulation and it...well...fell off eventually.  So when we got him he had a poor bloody and worn nub.  That's when I named him Nemo because he had a ""bad fin""  But when we took him to the vet they said they would have to take his whole leg.  And now he's mine.  And he's awesome.  I don't think he likes that I've been putting so many hours in at my internship though because yesterday and today he's been unusually needy.  OH and he helps me do Yoga haha.  That's not fun, I have to make sure not to kick him or something.

Man that cat TRIES to make you kick him though. If you stand up he runs up to you and as soon as you go to step he runs in front of that foot to headbutt your leg and either you bust yours ass (Which I've done before) or you kick him or step on him...AND HE DOESN'T LEARN.

You know that guy I was talking about...I really do want things to work out with him, I'm just scared. It's long distance and...4 out of my last 5 relationships have been long distance and it's sucked.  The one that WAS locally completely crushed me.  So I'm trying to put back the pieces..but this guy is so good.  I've known him for somewhere around 10 years.  I can't remember him ever being selfish and has never tried to hurt me or anything like that.

Man I wish my foot would stop bouncing.  I'm twitchy.  

There was a postcard on postsecret this week that said ""No one sends you flowers when you are crazy.""  It made me cry.  It made me realize I've never gotten a valentines gift from a guy I was dating.  Or birthday.  Or Christmas.  Maybe that is true.

I'm going to take a sleeping pill and get some sleep.  I'm sure no one has actually read down this far...I can't say that I would have..

Well...at least I'm not crying and I'm not delusional.  I just want to be level again.  I want to be able to make rational decisions.


TL;DR: Nothing important."

I am a third year econ student at a semi-target.
I am currently working as a full time intern at PwC.
I have a PE SA position interview next week and I need some advice.

It is my understanding that normal PE interviews cover DCF modeling and LBO modeling.

I dont have much finance background as my degree revolves around behavioral and macro economics.

I understand DCF pretty well from 2 finance courses I took at school taught by former MD of Goldman Sachs but for LBO i just barely understand the concept of it.

so here it is.


1. Would they be asking me to do modeling during the interview?
2. If, yes how and where could I get the informatoin to study for LBO?
3. What questions do you think might be asked during the interview?


I have never prepped for a buy-side job before so I really have no idea how or what to prepare for this. The firm is around 300mil funds, one of the largest in S Korea. It is focused mostly on the IT and entertainment industries.

**Essay**

Pursuing new knowledge and experience in my area of interest has always been an important goal of my life. I feel that the opportunities and resources offered by Queen’s University will allow me to develop new skills and gain a thorough education. The diverse student body, outstanding professors and the exceptional campus and facilities all contribute to the great appeal of the University to many students including myself. I believe that Queen’s would be a great fit for my aspirations.

My desire to pursue a career in the computing industry stems from my great interest of the increasingly prevalent technology sector. My interest has lead me to do much independant learning and I would like to continue that learning at a world class institution such as Queen’s. In the next four years of my life I would like to receive the best education possible. The Queen’s computing program would help me achieve that. My goal is to not only achieve high academic grades but also gain valuable experience that will benefit me in the future. The Queen’s Undergraduate Internship Program is a unique opportunity I am looking forward to. This program will allow me to gain the practical experience and skills that I will apply in my future career.

I consider post-secondary education to be one of the most important steps of my life and I hope that I can have the privilege of furthering my education at Queen’s."
18n2wg,13,2013-02-16,Led an exgf to cheat and I think I would do it again.,iwoulddoitagainlolol,confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/18n2wg/led_an_exgf_to_cheat_and_i_think_i_would_do_it/,"In 2010, I started dating a girl while in college. She was a year older than me at the time (me 18, her 19), and we'll call her D. Now, our relationship was solely based around sex, and it lasted a good 8 months or so based off of our sexual chemistry. She never really complained about the quality of sex, and my I, having been a virgin before this, had nothing to complain about. Anywho, fast forward to the start of the next semester, and we break up back at school. Our casual relationship once again ended up being a sex fueled stupor. 

Sex continued pretty much all the way back to spring break, when she informs me that she's been chatting with an old friend (hereafter referred to as M) who she has had a crush on for a good amount of time, and he'd be coming to visit her in the near future. I thought, ""hey, whatever, it's all cool."" He comes around a few weeks later, in fact, I recall being in the middle of some fun with D when he called her to say he had arrived. We finished things up in my dorm room and she headed back to her room to change and go meet M in the dorm lobby. Turns out I had never really fully grasped depression until this visit by M. D came to see me but found me in bed. She realized what the problem with me was and apologized. I asked her, ""did you do anything with him?"" I don't know why I asked her, but i needed to know i guess. She assured me nothing had happened. I barely left my bed for a good few days, and I am really thankful for the friends that I have for forcing me out to distract myself. The week came to an end, and D had just gotten into the elevator with M to head down to the parking lot. I had to investigate. My ever curious brain needed to tell the truth. I heard the doors to the elevator shut and I quickly moved to D's room, which was conveniently only a few doors down. As convenient as it may sound for me, D always left her door unlocked for some reason. As soon as I was in, I went straight for the garbage. I grabbed a pencil from D's desk and pushed some paper over to the side when I saw a flash of red. I held the papers to the side and there it was: a condom wrapper. This was almost three years ago and D still doesn't know that I know she fucked M that week.

D started dating M basically immediately afterwards and our sexual relationship ended. She still wanted to be friends, so I thought to myself, why not be friends with the girl who I allowed myself to become so infatuated with before, what could go wrong? Basically, everything stayed remotely normal. There were some times were D and I got a little touchy-feely (a little cuddling), but no kissing or anything sexual. Summer came and went and we were both (D and I) back at school in September. She would call us best friends at this point. I would go to her apartment a couple times a month to hang out a bit and we'd talk and she'd tell me about M and how that relationship is going. Naturally I don't want to hear anything of it but in an effort to be a decent friend I listened to her problems. M started off as a really nice guy, but by the way D described it, he was developing a problem with alcohol and anger (once threw a chair almost at D, punching a hole in a wall) and it was scaring D. She really, really liked him, but there's no way this could continue to be okay. I did my best to let her talk through her problems herself, but I admit to nudging her towards breaking up with M. Several times, actually. Several times I verbally expressed my unhappiness with the situation D was in. She acknowledged this and said something to tune of ""I know, I know"" and we went along with our business. Months go by, and it's spring semester again! It's been a tough one, homework out the wazoo, a house off-campus complete with parties and a dick landlord, and hearing about D's continuing troubles with M. He doesn't drink anymore at this point but expresses extreme jealousy when I am brought up in conversation. At this point I'm thinking she's just not in a good position and once again gently suggest a break up. She seems more receptive this time around but nothing happens. It is now March 2012 and my grandmother has been in the hospital all month. I was walking to my first class when my father called me and told me that my grandmother (his mother) probably only had a few hours left to live. In fact, she died right before my last class of the day let out, less than three hours later. I was depressed, my last remaining grandparent had died, and my family had lost a matriarch. Coincidentally D had called to say hello and could tell by my tone that I was not feeling well. She didn't ask why and immediately come over to see what was wrong. Once in my bedroom I laid down on my bed and told her my grandma had died about an hour ago. She starts crying and lays down next to me. I cried a little bit then too, but felt happy because D was next to me. What came next sort of caught me off guard: D sits up, looks at me for a few moments, leans close, and kisses me. Not a peck on the lips: a full, passionate, kiss. I suddenly remembered what it was like to be with this girl and I kissed back. Long story short, we had sex. Afterwards we just laid there kissing and touching each other but reality quickly came back to us when an alarm went off on D's phone, it was time for her to go back to campus for class.  We both headed down the stairs and outside. She walked down the driveway looking a bit flushed and turned around and smiled at me as she got into her car to drive away.

Summer came around and I was to spend half of it taking a summer course at school and the other half in New York City for an internship. Of course, D and I kept in touch, our relationship changed slightly to be more sexually open with each other, often reminiscing about things we had done in the past and how her having a boyfriend (still with M) has kind of complicated things. One step further, she briefly moved to the state in which M lived because she thought the distance is what was making things difficult. It wasn't. After moving down there and having nothing but terrible experiences with M and his family, she decided enough was enough and broke up with him. She moved back home and all seemed well. Since then we (D and I) have not had many sexual encounters (once when she visited me at school) and has had a new, much kinder boyfriend since January of 2013.

What bothers me is that she has recently (2 or 3 days ago) expressed discontent in the fact that we didn't have more sex or do whatever we wanted while she was dating M and that she is wondering why she didn't make a move to have some fun before she started dating her new boyfriend. I guess my problem is that I'm not bothered by kind of leading her to cheat on her boyfriend, I (like her) am bothered by our immense lack of sex during that time.

My relationship with D right now is like this: touchy-feely cuddling, intertwined legs, nude massages, she still flashes me on Skype, and I can still make her laugh like always. The way i see it, we're extremely close, but to most probably a little too close for comfort. Given the chance I would definitely make a move on her again.

TL;DR: Dated a girl in college who took my virginity and took part in an extremely sexual relationship. Girl breaks up with me over summer, gets new boyfriend, cheats on new boyfriend with me during the following semester, laments that we didn't do it more often, I think I might end up doing it again."
18mw4g,1,2013-02-16,I feel it coming back,throwawayy3211,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/18mw4g/i_feel_it_coming_back/,"I've struggled with depression before. I grew up in a very strict cult-like religion and only left last year in April. Last December was the first time I celebrated my birthday, wished other people happy holidays and do things I haven't done before. Life felt pretty empty though. I was at a temporary internship for 6 months last year and being alone all day with nothing to do really beats you...It was as if I was aware of my existence 24/7 and I'd comment on the status of my life all the time.

Fast forward to the Fall semester and I feel so much better. I have classes to keep my busy and distracted from those stupid thoughts and I made new friends. I started going to the gym to lift and stuck to a program since June. Now I'm at another 6 month co op and two days ago I decided to confess to a friend of mine...found out she wasn't available because she's taken which I'm sure is a lie. Boy did it hurt and it still hurts. I regret saying anything because we had a pretty solid friendship.

Lifting can only keep me up for so long. I'm only going 3 days a week and giving it my all trying to improve myself but it's so easy for these shitty thoughts to come back. Sometimes I'll just sit and stare at my computer at work not knowing what to do because I just keep letting shitty things hurt me.

Anyways...just felt like I had to post this here. Can't say I have enough close friends to just dump all of this on."

18psih,2,2013-02-17,I studied abroad and I hate myself for choosing to do so.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18psih/i_studied_abroad_and_i_hate_myself_for_choosing/,"I moved to collge fall of 2012, and discovered that there was an opportuinity to study abroad for first year students. Freshman year, living in London. How amazing!- but they planned on only accepted 10 freshman out of my about 10,000 person class. But I made it. They accepted me. And now I wish they hadnt.

Heres why I am so blessed:
-I'm only 19, born and raised in small-town NY, and now I'm living in London, England until June 2013.
-Through my dad (in the military), I've been able to get this funding for this schooling tuition.
-I have three beautiful (american) flatmates who i've bonded with faster than I have with anyone else.
-Classes are only once a week. Meaning I spend only one or two hours in class (never before 11 am), four days a week, and have almost no homework.
-I have plenty of time to play sports and work out and get good grades because I dont need to work.
-I have an iPad, with a texting app, so I can talk to my friends and family whenver.
-I have savings money to cover my transportation, food, schooling, ect expences, and STILL have enough left to be able to go out, buy clothes, and make unnecessary purchases.
-I'm only a freshman, so on top of having a fucking great resume, I'll be able to go abroad/ do internships mutiple times because ill  have the time.

Reasons why I'm a little shit:
-I'd give it all up to just be back at my homeschool to finish my freshman year, because I miss a boy, who I dont even know if he wants a relationship with me when I'm home.

I'm worried Ill look back on this trip and regret it, because I spent so much time thinking about someone from home.

First fucking world problems, right?

I just wish I could be more thankful. I realized i am so blessed, but I feel so guilty. There are so many people who are denied this opportunity, I wish I could give it to them. I can't wait for June."

To Whom It May Concern,

My name is Logan Healy, and I am a sophomore at the Davenport University. I have friends and family living in the Austin, and am seeking an internship opportunity in the area for this summer. 

Over the past few years, I have challenged myself academically and have received a 3.68 GPA at the collegiate level, including several courses pertaining to computer networking. While taking classes to obtain a bachelor’s degree in computer networking, I entered a computer networking internship to better my understanding of the field. To further complement these educational attainments, I am seeking an enriching, hands-on experience in an information technology working environment as an intern this summer. I know that an internship role at *place company name here* would be an ideal setting for me to thrive, and I am confident that I could add value to *place company name here*, as well. With the experience from my current internship, I have learned excellent customer service, troubleshooting skills, and plenty of networking based knowledge. Over the phone support has been a great way to better my skills as an IT support specialist. The specific dates I would be available for an internship are from May 7, to September 1st. These dates can be adjusted, if needed.

As you will see from my enclosed resume, I have also completed Kent Career Tech Center with a 4.0 GPA. In this we focused on computer networking basics, visual basic programming, Sony Vegas video editing, and computer mechanics.

I've always had clear skin, but in the last 6 months or so, my face has started to break out with small but pretty severe patches of acne. It has gotten worse over the past month or so. I initially thought it was my foundation (Revlon ColorStay) so I switched to CoverGirl 3-in-1 Stay Fabulous, but I haven't seen a significant improvement.

Because of the acne influx, I've been using Clean &amp; Clear Dual Action moisturizer but I haven't seen a decrease in my acne and by midway through the day, my skin has dried out again. 

I am on a very tight budget (working full-time for an unpaid internship on top of planning a wedding) and would love if you could recommend something I could find at Walmart, Target, etc.

As of the end of April, I will have graduated from the SUNY University at Buffalo with a B.A. in Geography/GIS and a minor in Computer Science. I've been studying CS for four years-- I earned an A.S. from Monroe Community College in Rochester, New York before moving to Buffalo.

I'm hoping to acquire a position in an application development job related to GIS, but as a new graduate, I'm looking for any position that will give me experience in the GIS and/or software development fields.

I have programming experience with Java, C++, VB.net, SQL, Python and ArcPy, HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript. I also have a lot of experience using ArcMap (v.9 - 10.1) and many of it's functions such as Spatial , Network, and 3D Analyst. Many of these skills began at school but continued ""beyond the classroom"" as taught myself more about each language. I also won the [2013 Marble-Boyle award](http://www.aag.org/cs/marble-boyle) for my combined studies in the geospatial and computer science fields.

I have intentions to move to her city when my internship ends in October. 

Recently she met a new coworker and has been hanging out with him almost every day since. I've met the guy once when I visited last and he's a really nice guy but other than that, I don't know him very well. He's a fairly attractive looking guy and he's single. 

This week she told me that she's stayed over at his place (alone) a couple of times after nights of drinking and being 'too drunk to drive home'. On the first occasion she asked if it was ok, and I said yes because I definitely didn't want her to drive drunk. I've since discovered that she's stayed at his place multiple times in a single week after more nights of drinking alone with him.

I do trust her around other guys but I know first hand that people make mistakes when there is alcohol involved. She's never lied about it but she hasn't been extremely open or direct about it either. She usually drops it casually in a conversation the next day saying things like ""oh I just crashed at _____'s place""

Questions:

1. Would you be upset if you were in this situation?
2. When I talk to her about how uncomfortable that situation makes me feel, what kind of response should I expect to receive from her? I've been told before that when you confront a SO about potential cheating issues, their response can be interpreted in certain ways to determine whether or not they've actually cheated."
18o8lm,1,2013-02-16,How can I turn my internship at a firm into a full-time offer?,[deleted],Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/18o8lm/how_can_i_turn_my_internship_at_a_firm_into_a/,"Hopefully some of you accounting professionals can give me some sound advice on how to secure an offer via an internship I currently have... I'll try to make a nice, concise list of the important stuff so you can get a better idea of the position I'm in...

* Interning @ a smaller firm, 12 partners, ~60 staff, 12 interns
* Family friend (partner) got me the internship
* HR lady hates me, mainly because I'm sure my connection basically told her to hire me and gave her no say in the matter, prior to even interning (I mean, every other intern got an ""offer letter"" for the internship, I didn't get squat and didn't even know what my pay was until I got my first check)
* I'm the youngest, still in undergrad (senior @ Berkeley)
* The other interns are all a year or two out, taking extension classes, doing masters programs, or simply looking for job experience
* Not to be conceited, but I have the best educational resume (3.6 @ Berkeley) while the rest all either went to San Jose State, Sacramento State, or Cal State East Bay.
* Firm typically offers full time positions to 3 interns


* Thus far, I've completed the most returns of anybody while having very few, if any mistakes.
* A few of the other interns seem to simply be ""going through the motions"" and don't seem to be fit for a higher-paced and stressful environment
* I'm always asking for more work and trying to get more involved.
* When asked what I want out of this internship, I replied... ""I want to get prepared to be a CPA.  I want to attain meaningful hours.  I want to be exposed to anything and everything.  I want a challenge with regards to the returns I prepare - I can't guarantee you they will be done 100% correctly, but I can guarantee you I will complete them to the best of my ability and learn from them as best I can""

So what else can I do, if anything, to try a secure a full time offer?  I really like the firm as it offers a lot - 20 minutes from home, very friendly and family like, everybody works together and partners are accessible, etc, but obviously as an intern I feel below everyone else and would like that to change in a matter of the next 3 months.

let me know.

After 5 years and 8 months of living with my girlfriend.  It looks like it isn't
going to  work any longer.  Only the first 8  months were peaceful.   Other than
that, the  rest of the  time we have  fought or she  has thrown a  fit virtually
every night.  I feel  like a fool for staying on this long  and now she wants to
split up.  I  have certainly done my share  of wrong here but the  end result is
that I'm probably going to wind  up semi-homeless, I've had a substantial amount
of money taken from me, I have no transportation and no job.  My best friend has
been telling me  to leave for years.  He is under the impression  that I've left
and I'm too ashamed to tell him that isn't true.

A little background: I'm a male currently in  my 40's.  For twelve years I was a
software engineer making a substantial amount  of money.  I had some college but
had not  finished my degree. When  I was laid-off  in 2002, I decided  to switch
careers to  something safer.  I  finally settled  on civil engineering  since it
seemed difficult to  outsource that kind of work overseas.   Even to the present
day  though, I  still kept  my feet  wet in  coding.  I  started some  projects,
and learned a couple of new languages.

I worked  at lower-paying jobs  with flexible hours and  went back to  school in
2003.  Some  semesters I took  off, others I went  part-time.  I also  shared an
apartment with my brother.

In 2007, I met this woman (my soon-to-be-ex  gf) and we dated she was very, very
nice but within two  weeks of going out she places her apartment  keys on my key
chain, which I found a little unusual.  I  stayed for a couple days but when had
to leave and she begged me to come back.   I came back a few days later and when
I had to leave again she said that ""it feels like we are breaking up""

A few things  about her: she is six years  older than I am and her  son (in his
early twenties) lives with her.

So eventually I moved in but kept paying my portion of the rent on the apt I was
sharing with my brother.  After one semester, I needed to move  back to my place
but it is clear  that this isn't what she wants.  She is  nice, she cooks meals,
she does my laundry.   We had some fun times together but ..   and I can't quite
describe this  .. I couldn't  seem to connect.  There  was this lack  of ""shared
understanding"" or emotional maturity.

Here is the part where I get stupid:

Eventually  I  left my  old  apartment  and  moved  into hers.   Problems  began
occurring.   I'm not  going to  go into  details but  it felt  like I  was being
bullied and controlled. Several  times I walked out but she  would follow me and
convince me  to come back.  But the  worst was her  tendency to come  home EVERY
NIGHT and  get upset at some  small facial expression or  some innocuous comment
that I'd make but  was taken the wrong way by her.  This  usually resulted in me
walking on eggshells for  the remainder of the evening to  avoid getting my head
bitten off.  This behavior continues to the present day.

I sold my car.  I  have no idea why I did this - but at  least it is easy to get
around where I live and I don't  like driving anyways.  There were other things:
she set  up my automatic  online credit card  payments and receives  the monthly
statement.  She had  access to my bank  account (card and online).   In short, I
fucking allowed her to manage my life.

All the while, she  is also happy to do some great things.   She never said ""no""
to sex.  She helped a great deal while  I was going to school.  The fact is, she
provided a foundation that I could rely  on.  (Note: she was *not* paying for my
expenses or tuition).

She has  always hated  my best friend  and accused us  of being  ""fags"" together
(which  is  false).  Her  hatred  of  gay men  knows  no  limits, which  is  odd
considering that she is  bisexual.  I was *not* allowed to  visit him except for
special circumstances.  Emailing my friend was frowned upon as was chat or phone
calls.

In Aug 2010 my grandmother died. My grandmother basically raised me.  When I was
young my mother and father divorced and  I went with my father for several years
.  My Mother never really came back and dad was a fairly nasty person so I spent
a lot of time at my grandparents.  In 2006 she was in slow decline mentally that
would last for  four years.  She had  several strokes and finally  was unable to
breath on her own.   After talking to the doctors, my family  and I decided that
it would be best to let her go since she would never regain consciousness again.
And here was the ONE TIME that I really needed some kind of emotional connection
or support  from my  girlfriend.  I  stood in  the bathroom  thinking that  if I
didn't  go  to the  hospital  then  this  horrible  thing wouldn't  happen.   My
girlfriend comes in and I just can't help  but break down and tell her: ""I don't
want to  do this.""  She  just stared  and commented that  she had never  seen me
like this.

Here is were I do something really stupid:

All of the grandchildren receive a substantial annuity.  As an act of good faith
and partly to  show my gf that I  want to build a real relationship  with her, I
place it  in the bank  in both of  our names.  I was  planning on putting  it to
better use but at the time just leaving it in the bank seemed reasonable.

In 2011  I find  an internship.   I landed  this internship  based partly  on my
programming skills  and it  was an absolute  pleasure to be  paid to  write code
again.  I had other duties but coding was  what I most looked forward to.  I had
forgotten what  it was like  for an  afternoon to just  melt away because  I was
totally absorbed in my work.

At this  point, things were really  bad with my gf.   Her son moved out  and she
blamed it on me.   Her son and I never really talked but  never really got along
well either.  I walked  out on her again and she tracked me  down in her car.  I
refused to come back but stupidly did a few days later.

Last June, I  became friends with a  woman who worked where I  was interning and
somehow we wound up  chatting online.  She told me about her  husband and I told
her about about my  gf.  I told her how we fight constantly  and how I wanted to
leave.  I am very attracted to this woman and tell my best friend (the one my gf
calls  ""a fag"")  that I  want to  cheat  (the actual  words were  a little  more
descriptive).  Somehow  my gf was able  to get  almost complete transcripts  of my
conversations with  my friend  at work and  my best friend.   We had  some nasty
arguments  and I  agreed not  to have  any contact  with the  woman at  work any
longer.

A few months later,  I discover that all of the money from  the annuity has been
withdrawn from  the shared account.   There was no  real explanation from  my gf
other than ""it  was used for expenses"".   This makes no sense since  we had more
than enough money.  She said that she can prove it to me but I doubt it.

I left again, this time she didn't stop me  or try to drag me back and it seemed
like we were through:  I was angry at what she had stolen  from me, and she said
that I  had cheated  on her.  I  was staying  with my brother  but, like  a fool
again, begged her to come back.  I came back a month later because the apartment
we are renting had both of our names on the lease and I didn't want her to break
the lease.  I also  came back because I was miserable,  jobless and thought that
maybe things would be  different. I had been telling myself  this time and again
for years so I  had no reason to believe it. She was  nice when I visited though
and genuinely seemed to want me back.

After several  months it has come  down to this:  she is leaving when  the lease
expires (with her  son - who has returned),  I'm looking for a job  in my field,
going  to grad  school,  and things  are  likely  to get  rough.   I have  given
everything I have to  this woman in trust and gotten screwed.   I am also afraid
that our beloved Chihuahuas  might wind up in a shelter.   I would be devastated
if this happened.

She claims  that she  can't trust me  and that is  something that  I understand.
There have been times  in the past when I've tried to  contact people on various
sites (but  never actually met).  She's  found pron sites in  my browser history
(and does  not approve). On  the other hand,  her behavior has  been suspicious.
For several  years, she refuses to  tell me why she  came home from work  two or
three hours  late every  evening and  jealously guards  her phone  and computer.
Under no  circumstances can  I use her  comp or  look at her  phone.  All  of my
accounts and chat logs are available to her though.

I know that I'm just as much to blame for this mess as she is but when you can't
find  a job,  lose  your home,  lose  almost all  of your  money  and lose  your
girlfriend then  the next  thing to go  is losing hope.   I keep  fooling myself
thinking that everything is totally my fault and that if I fix a few things then
she won't  always be biting my  head off, putting me  or my friends down,  be so
demanding or  so controlling.  I  keep fooling myself  and think that  she'll be
affectionate some  day but  it is  just a  lie.  Ultimately,  I don't  think she
would've been happy with me no matter what I did or didn't do.

Fortunately,  the last  six  years haven't  been a  complete  waste.  I  finally
finished  my degree  and am  going to  grad  school.  I  have a  whole world  of
interests and study new material, hack on some of my side projects or draw.  I'm
definitely not suicidal but there are times when  I feel as if I can't go on and
wonder if I'm going to be able to rebuild my life.

I'm 25 years old and have had serious problems with drugs since I was about 15. I started because I was depressed, and continue to be depressed but felt much better on the drugs at times. Mostly my use revolved around marijuana and prescription drugs. I've been clean for 6 months now, and used very little in the six months before that, but I've never been more depressed. I don't really have any friends anymore either, as much of our relationships were built around the use of drugs. 

I was never a motivated student in High School but could bullshit assignments easy and tested very well so I got into a top 25 university that I was never able to finish. I had a couple great internships where the offices seemed to love me and thought I'd do great in life, but as my problem with prescription drugs grew I pretty much stopped working. I'm currently on a (now 2 year) leave of absence with just over a semesters work left, but I've been gone so long that at this point I had to reapply to finish my degree. To do this I'd need to take a couple community college classes and work a job to prove my ethic and such. My grades at university were all over the place depending on how motivated I felt in the class: I have a string of Fs in introductory courses (failed some requirements 3 or 4 times) and straight As in some of the most challenging classes.

This gets me to my next problem, I haven't been able to hold a job down at all. I dealt to support my habits and have a small income from a couple rental properties I bought with inheritance. My parents paid for my schooling and tried their best to get me help. It took years for this to finally work, as I kept getting depressed and falling back on old habits as I felt like I didn't fit into the world. 

Now that I've cleaned up I'm trying to find work experience. I have no degree, and won't be able to finish it for at least a year and maybe two despite the small amount of work left. My parents are unwilling to pay for more school so I'm going to have to make a descent amount of money or get loans. I have very little work experience and can't find a job. Even jobs postings that say no experience necessary or that they will train you seem to want people with 2+ years experience in the field. I've been trying for two months now and just can't find anything in my area to even build experience. I really feel like if someone would give me a chance I would excel in any field, but I understand that on paper I look like a bad investment. I just feel discouraged about jobs at this point and don't want to even try anymore.

My parents are continuing to get angrier and more frustrated with me, and I really hate to let them down. I have two siblings that have by far outshone me, my younger sister is a star athlete at her college with sports management jobs lined up. My brother is an investment banker with an ivy league background. I often feel like my parents care about them more, I constantly over hear them talking about how great my siblings are and never overhear anything about myself. My siblings did a lot of activities when they were younger (Athletic camps, comp sci camps, competitive squash, tennis, sailing and skiing, etc) while my parents pretty much left me alone to go to school and play video games. I just feel like I was unwittingly and unknowingly neglected and have suffered for it.

I wish I could do better, but I'm at a loss for what to do. I just feel like I was happier when I was high, and want to go back to using. I don't feel like there is room for me in traditional society. Nobody seems to want to hire me and I don't hold out much hope for things getting better. The way I see it each and every day I am becoming less and less valuable to society. I was never this depressed on drugs and feel like I should just use again and melt away.

I'd really appreciate it if any of you guys had some advice on what I should do."

My boyfriend (21M) and I (22F) have been dating for about 2 years.
He graduated high school last year, and I graduated college 2 years ago. We live in a really small village, where just about everyone knows us. Bonus: our dads have known each other since high school, and are good acquaintances.

Anyway, we met each other during an internship at his dad's office. He's an insurance broker, and I interned there for about 10 weeks. After those 10 weeks, he and I started dating, because I didn't want this to influence my grades. I was hesitant at first, because he wasn't really my type (both mentally and physically), but we got along very well.

After I graduated in June 2011, we went on a vacation with my parents (3 weeks) and his parents (3 weeks). After that, I started working at an insurance office about 5 minutes from home. This office is a lot bigger than theirs, and they obviously disliked this. After I told them I got a job, his dad asked why I didn't ask him for a job (I did, he said they weren't hiring), but I dismissed it. After about a month at my current job, I wasn't really happy with the mood and I tried to resign. My boss asked me to reconsider, and he asked me to gave him my final thought after a week. Okay, I once again went to my inlaws, and asked whether his former offer was still standing. He didn't answer, no matter how many times I asked. After a week, I told my boss I would like to stay at my current job. Case closed.

I've been working there for about a year and a half, and in October 2012 my boyfriend started working at his dad's office. The trouble started in January.

I asked my parents if they wanted me to check out their insurances, and it became quite clear that they were paying way too much. I told my bf about this, and he got very angry about this. He said that we were greedy, and that we were stabbing them in the back. Mind you, I only told him that I made my parents a quote. I did this for 3 insurances, and the total cost was 4000€ (my boss) vs 5000€ (bf).

Because of this fight, my parents decided to just leave it the way it was. This month, I did the same for my brother, and again it was way cheaper. Because of the previous fight, I decided to first take over his insurance and tell my bf after I did this. My brother is marrying this year and is also planning to build a house, so it's pretty important for him to save money wherever possible. He also isn't too keen on my inlaws, so it really didn't matter to him. What's also important (because I realize I might sound like a complete and utter bitch now because I'm ""stealing"" clients from my inlaws) is that my current boss hired me KNOWING that I was in a relationship with my bf, the son of his competitor. I felt (and feel) like I should show how grateful I am for this opportunity he has given me. He easily could've given me the cold shoulder because of my relationship.

Now, of course I understand his point, but he just keeps blaming me for this, and I get very defensive about it. He starts talking shit about my boss (who is a very nice guy btw), and I honestly can't stand it anymore.

My plan wasn't to keep this job for the rest of my life, but only temporary (for about 5 years, or until I got pregnant). Right now, I'm wondering whether I should quit my job (not right now, but in a few months or so) and get a new job in an entirely different department, or if I should just give up on our relationship.

I've tried ""not talking about work"" but even when I have nothing but good things to say about my job (let's say about my colleagues, because we've been having a good time at work or whatever) he gets really annoyed. And we're both very talkative people so it's really hard, but I understand that this might be something we have to work on.

PS: My dream job would be helping the elderly, working in a clothes store (seriously, folding clothes or something, whatever, I'm starting to dislike the responsibility I have at my current job) or working in a bakery. 

TLDR: My bf and I are competitors in the insurance business. We argue about this a lot. Should I quit and find a new job?

I'm so sorry about the rant, but it helped me get things off my chest.

18qdpy,14,2013-02-17,I hate going to an Ivy League school.,[deleted],confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/18qdpy/i_hate_going_to_an_ivy_league_school/,"I hate my school. I hate my major. I hate having to live in this shitty small town. I hate being so far from home. I hate the weird locals. I hate how bars here close at 1. I hate that our athletics are subpar and the stands at a football or basketball game will never be packed.

I feel like I hate everyone here. Everyone is so uptight, concerned with what everyone thinks about them. Being involved in Greek life makes it that much worse. Everyone is so caught up in rankings and which sorority has the best looking girls and whether or not they mix with top fraternities. Girls are vicious to each other sometimes making personal attacks on anonymous forums online to bring other sororities down. Frat boys are just dicks. 

All everyone here talks about is how much sleep they didn't get the night before, how they have jobs and internship lined up at all these banks, how they ""failed"" exams though they only got a C. Everyone here is only concerned with wealth and status.

I don't have many friends. Despite being in a sorority, I wouldn't consider many of my sisters to be my friends. They're more like drinking and partying pals who I only see on weekend nights. My best friend and I got into the same sorority but lately I feel like our friendship has been deteriorating. It's gotten to the point where I'll only see her to party. I hate how most people here don't do romantic relationships and just have casual hook ups. They claim to not have the time or something.

The only thing that keeps me going through the week is the weekend, which to me begins Wednesday night. I spend so much money at the bars and I justify it by the fact that I work two jobs.

I wish I would have gone to a different school. I wish I could transfer out. I doubt anyone would even care if I left. I fucked up really badly last semester. Seeing as I hate my major, I just don't feel motivated to study. My GPA took a beating and I could never be able to get into a decent state school like University of Illinois or Michigan. I've already signed my housing lease for next year which is probably the biggest deterrent to me transferring. 

I don't fit in. I'm a very chill, laid-back girl who loves to have fun. I don't care if I'm rich or not in the future. I'm not looking to be a lawyer, doctor, or banker. I really only just want to be happy. I'm pretty miserable here to the point where I'm depressed and thoughts of suicide have crossed my mind. Sometimes I wish I could drop out. However, I have two younger siblings who look up to me and a mother and father I want to make proud. With the shit job I'm doing in school, I'm essentially wasting my time as well as my parents' and government's money. I'm frequently homesick. It's not that I miss my family much. I just miss my hometown. I'm just going to keep on keeping on I guess."

I'm a senior in high school, she's a sophomore in college HB8. When we originally met she thought that I was a junior in college, but I reassured her that I was at least 18. We met at my my internship for school &amp; we had been flirting for about a month off and on over text/at weekly meetings. It wasn't until last Monday however I decided to make a move.

For three days she was extremely into me. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. I met with her on Tuesday &amp; we ended up kissing. That Tuesday night however, I asked about her... Boyfriend. Her boyfriend lives 500 miles away &amp; I'm not very sure about his situation but I made it very clear that I didn't really want to hurt him... She was confused. So was I. Anyways, she said ""let's just go back to being friends."" I said... ""Eh :/"" &amp; we just kind of dropped the subject and that night she didn't want me to stop texting her even though I had an exam the next day &amp; throughout the next day we texted constantly. I couldn't see her, I had a meeting and a very long church service since I am Orthodox. 

Thursday comes along. Not flirty anymore. At all. I asked her if she wanted to hangout, we could get dinner, go to this basketball game, but she said that she was SUPER busy. She wasn't responding to me anymore with heart shapes in texts, and there was a solid two hours where she didn't say anything to me.

Friday was worse, same with Saturday, &amp; today we haven't texted at all.

Should I text her now? No. That would be weird &amp; possibly pushy... Right?

I'm seeing her tomorrow night at a meeting... What should I say? I was thinking of having small talk, and eventually asking if she was still into me... It was extremely obvious that we cared for each other more than friends would.

You don't lose feelings for somebody in  one day, so something must have happened. I'm super confused. What should I do? My goal isn't to ""bone"" her either. I want to connect mentally before I connect physically. If this isn't the right subreddit, I'm sorry. 

If you need some more info, just ask. I need the advice.

18ubm4,2,2013-02-19,Is it ok for me[24f] to apply for a job where my ex[24m] works?,concernedjobhunter,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/18ubm4/is_it_ok_for_me24f_to_apply_for_a_job_where_my/,"This is a bit of a weird question, but I feel really conflicted. 

**Background:** I sort of dated this guy James about 2 years ago. We were really close friends for about a year before anything happened. I liked him a lot but he sort of strung me along for 3 months until he ended it. I was hurt but got over it quite fast because I felt he'd treated me like crap. I moved on, he seemed not to even though he ended it. He asked me out a few months later and I said no. I heard later from friends that he was still trying to get me back a couple of months after, but it was around then I started going out with my boyfriend Dan. James and I are still friends, but not close. We have the same circle of friends so we occasionally hang out in groups and we still get on really well, but I haven't hung out with him alone since I turned him down. I assume he's over me now as this was over a year ago.

**Current Dilemma:** My problem is this. James and I work in the same industry, and it's not an industry flush with opportunities. The place he works is one of the few that are growing and hiring. They're hiring at the moment in fact. And it's a job I think I would be good at. But it's a small company, maybe 30 people, and only about 5 work in the section the job opening is in. James is one.

I don't think James has anything to do with the hiring of this job, but if I got it I would be, if not working directly with him, at least sharing a small office with him. For me this wouldn't be a problem, but would it be unfair to him? I'm certain he doesn't still have feelings for me, but would he feel awkward, would I be invading his territory? 

And what about my boyfriend, is it beyond inconsiderate to apply for a job with an ex? I know I would feel at least some pangs of jealousy if Dan was working with an ex, particularly if he purposely applied for a job knowing he would be. But is that enough reason not to go for it? I almost certainly wont get the job this time, but they hire and take on interns every few months so I know this dilemma will repeat.

Normally my instinct would be to talk to the people involved, but I know neither of them would tell the truth of how they feel about this. Who would tell a friend they don't want to work with them, or a girlfriend not to apply for a job.

What is the right thing to do here?

**TL;DR: My ex and I work in the same field, and his small company is hiring. Should I apply for the job or would that be unfair to my ex and my current boyfriend?**

I went to a good-not-great private local college (pretty well known for academics and basketball - highly regarded in New England). Studied political science and took a few computer science classes though I didn't finish the minor. At this time you weren't seen as a leech on society when studying liberal arts. (Much better days) 

I applied for job after job and had interview after interview but ended up working at a bookstore for two years after graduation before landing a professional job. I moved out, started law school the following year (while working - so nights at a good school, but not the best I got into because they only had day programs). This is 2008. Bad timing. 

I was laid off after my first year, unable to find work. I moved back in with my parents. I finished law school, but not well. I was miserable all the time and my grades were all over the map. This put me well into the bottom half of my class. And by this point, the legal market had collapsed so only top 1% got internships, jobs, etc.

Since being laid off in 2009 I haven't have full-time work. I've had a few part-time jobs that were temporary. Do a bit of freelance and have done a lot of work for free as ""internships"" with companies (not in law) that ""could lead to pay"" but never have. 

I'm turning 31 this year. I am not medically depressed or suicidal but I hate my life. My peers all kept their jobs through the recession, have mostly gotten married, and are having kids. I'm barely scraping by and it's killing me. I share an apartment with my younger brother now, so not at home, so at least there's that. Until he gets married.

I still feel like I'll find a real job again with the economy on the mend, but I have big loans and am almost 10 years older than all the people I'm applying against because my work history is so hit or miss.

When do you just give up on your life goals and settle for less? I probably won't get married at this rate, I won't be able to afford a house, I'm almost as old as my parents were when I was born and every day it gets worse. 

I have been rejected for jobs so nicely I have wanted to beg the person. Say I'd work for less. Just for something. Just so I could start to scratch my way back into the world.

I accept my failure. I studied subjects without jobs. I took on debt to make my legal dream come true only to have it go as poorly as possible. 

I seem people with my same background in the jobs I apply to. I feel like I'm on the right track. It's just like that Futurama episode, one flip of a coin, and I'm losing each flip the last few years.

TL;DR
having a crisis at 30. wasted money on law school right before economic collapse."

Part 2: Recovery


Enter seddit.  I slowly rose from the ashes, reading post after post about being high value, openers, keeping conversation going, body language, etc.  I started learning to refine what I'd already done naturally before, and attained results more consistently.  Being on my own helped me work on myself more, and I started getting better at pickup over the summer.  I began meeting a bunch of new people, and I soaked in all the wonderful advice.  However, I was doing it for the wrong reasons.  I read the posts but didn't fully understand them.  I saw seddit as a ""shortcut"" for sleeping with women.  I didn't understand what being an alpha male truly entailed.  I was running game and getting better, but getting more and more frustrated with rejection because I became so focused on the end game.  I did improve however, and by the end of the summer, I'd slept with more girls than I had in my entire life combined.  Yet, there was no further interaction with any of these women, I could turn them on but after that they'd be gone.  Everything felt so empty.  I didn't realize how easily they noticed I was still in love with somebody else when we'd be cuddling after sex.  They knew I was gaming them for self-validation, I was just able to keep it holed up until we'd be talking late at night and the real me would come out.  My front came crashing down once I reached that intimate point.  I thought sleeping with women would conquer my oneitis like so many sedditors had said.  I couldn't figure out what was driving this black hole of rejection and sadness.

Summer ends and the semester starts.  At this point I was a wreck, I still had feelings for her and even improving my game was making me more depressed.  I was so confused.  One day as I'm studying she called me and told me she wanted to see me.   We were living in the same city finally, and being my AFC self, I gladly invited her over.  She told me how she was still dating that guy but she had been having regrets the entire time.  I was crushed by the news and I tried to be strong by pushing her away and refusing to get back with her.  I told her about a girl I'd recently slept with and was starting to get to know better, and she went home shattered.  The next day I got a message from her boyfriend who angrily accused me of stealing his girlfriend which I laughed at considering I could say he did the same.

She came over that night, and that's when I left my self-respect behind.  I took her back.  We kicked it off right away, I forgave her for everything and we went right back to our old selves.  She lived at my place for an entire semester.  I was so happy, it was amazing, I had gotten my second chance and my life was back on track.  The depression was gone, so I stopped looking to improve myself.  That's where it all went wrong.  I went back to my old ways, I didn't feel the need to go out because previously the only purpose was to find women to sleep with.  Things went back into motion so quickly, and she felt super guilty about what she'd done so she tried really really hard to please me all the time.  This completely blinded me to my prior errors, and I reverted back to my content self, not creating any excitement, not pushing harder in school, playing a bunch of video games, just smoking with my closest friends every once in a while.  She became the reason behind everything I did, and I lost sight of everything else again.  It's crazy how obsessed I was.  As long as we were having sex and hanging out, I didn't need anything else.  

We both went back to our home town to visit family for winter break.  She broke up with me a day before we went back, all her stuff was still in my place.  This was a month and a half ago.  Turns out she had been cheating on me with the same guy and left me for him, AGAIN.  I had repeated my mistakes, and had become even more of an AFC during the time.  I had gotten her back into my life, and she became a bigger crutch for self validation than ever before.  

Before we'd become intimate I was a leader, confident, independent, outgoing, opinionated, smart, and willing to do anything to get what I wanted.  When I finally got the opportunity with her after waiting an entire childhood though, keeping her around became more important than everything in my life before then.  I lost all my other passions because I was so determined not to lose her.  When she left me the first time I didn't know how to handle it, I became a mess.

I was so caught up with her, that I became a needy person and it had only got worse after spending an entire summer failing to fix it.  When she came back to fix her ""mistake"", she found a weak beta looking for a girl to hold on to make him feel better about himself.  I had completely lost everything that had attracted her to me in the first place because I let myself be defeated by what she'd done to me.  I'm surprised she even lived with me as long as she did.  Had I been the person I am today, she never would've even considered leaving me.

This past month and a half has been brutal.  I let myself fall into the depressed state again, and it was worse than ever.  I was even suicidal.    I'd been browsing seddit on and off, but I wasn't myself at all.  I couldn't even pull myself to go out.  Women were repelled at even greater rates than ever before.  I wanted to drop out of school.  I was back at square one, and completely lost.  At this point I decided something had to be done, I couldn't live my life being dependent on her to feel good about myself.  I hated feeling so weak.  Luckily I'm passionate about school, and my Computer Science professors began to send plenty of my work my way as the semester picked up.  I was a complete mess still, but I kept myself busy and stopped thinking about everything else.  I spent the month alone mostly, trying to figure out what was wrong with me.  I began going to meditation sessions to clear my head.  I applied to a couple of internships, and finished my work early.

One day I tried texting her, and all I got for a reply was that she was in love with that other guy and that I needed to leave her alone.  I holed myself up and cried the rest of the day like a loser.  It was at that point when I broke.  I went off the edge and I considered ending my life.  It was drenched in tears, sobbing all alone in my bed when I realized something.  My entire life everyone had been telling how intelligent I was, what a good friend I was, what a great lover I was, how much I had going for me.  I didn't realize how much that had gotten to my head.  It's funny how no one ever tells you how you're going to get there, they just assume you've already got it made.  As if I never had to work for what I had.  

Everyone always believed in me, but at the time I thought it was just something that came naturally like everything else about my life.  I never understood that everyone had been talking about the strong person that I used to be.  I thought it was something I was born with, not something I had earned by being the confident passionate person I had been my entire life.  I was always reaching further than everyone else, working harder, and I never doubted myself.  That's why I accomplished everything I did, never had trouble in any area of life, and always women around.  I inspired people to better themselves, everyone was always trying to keep up and I had fun staying one step ahead.  I had thrown that all away because I thought this girl was more important than myself.  I had stopped my own ascent of self-improvement that had enabled me to do all the great things I've done.

Finally we get to the present.  This week has been crazy.  I just landed a research position with a professor at my school, and I got a potential job offer at a startup that just raised $18 million in venture capital last week.  I'm 20 years old, turning 21 in two weeks, and I finally found myself again.  I've reconnected with all my friends, cut my hair shorter then it's been since I was in 6th grade, and my approach anxiety is completely gone.  Women everywhere have been noticing me again, and I don't have trouble talking to any girl I want at any time of day.  I finally opened my eyes again and realized that I am worthy of attaining whatever I want in this world as long as I'm willing to work for it.  I don't need somebody to tell me I'm going places, I KNOW that I am and I'll be damned if I let anyone stop me.  I don't need any external validation anymore because I finally understand how important it is to have validation from within.  I no longer need to seduce women because I have become confident enough to be myself again.  All those posts about high value finally make sense to me.  I've stepped foot into my natural alpha state and it feels damn good to be focused on my passions again.  I've gained back my self-respect by reaching further than I ever have before, and BIG things are happening in my life because of it.  I've never been more excited for the future in my entire life, and it feels incredible to be a source of inspiration for other people again.  Never again will I believe somebody when they tell me I'm not good enough, because I know that's bullshit.  I'm done sitting back and waiting for my life to reach that point that everyone has always talked about.  I'm taking my life back right NOW.  

Thank you seddit for all your wise advice and for your patience in reading this.  I never could have gotten back into state if it wasn't for all of you.  For all those who didn't bother reading the wall of text, learn to have faith in yourself and nothing in life is ever going to stop you.  Everybody always talks about how important confidence is, but no one can teach that to you.  Get out and accomplish something, you're never going to convince others that you're something worth fighting for unless you've PROVED it to yourself.  Work every single day on being a better person, be healthy, and do stuff that you're truly passionate about.  If you don't reach out and take what you want it's always going to pass you by.  Don't stop believing in yourself, and focus on one step at a time.  Go talk to that cute girl you saw on campus today, she'll never have any idea how wonderful you are unless you go and SHOW her.  The way I see it, you can mope around and feel sorry for yourself or you can get off your ass and start becoming the person you've always wanted to be by working at it everyday.  TRULY believe that you ARE that amazing person, and one day you won't have to tell yourself anymore, it'll be apparent in every aspect of your life.  Your aura alone will begin to inspire the people around you, and the energy you radiate will attract more friends than you know what to do with.  If you want to be a social person, you have to learn to just let go and be authentic.  When you are genuinely satisfied with who you are, you'll never hesitate to go talk to that beautiful girl who just smiled at you from a distance because you won't be afraid anymore.  No woman can ever take away your accomplishments, your intellectual passions, or your value because they all come from within.  Stop feeding off other people's value, and become someone who takes joy in sharing their abundance with others.  Lastly, never stop striving for more.  The only limits are the ones you impose on yourself.  Anything is possible if you're willing to do what it takes."

* Other Debt: 6 more months of $150/mo car loan at 3.2% ($900 total)
* Savings: 2000 emergency fund
* Index funds: 5500
* IRA: 1000

About 88,000 of my student loans are at 6.55%. The rest of our student loans are at 5% or lower. 

We live relatively modestly and pay just over 1,600 dollars per month on our student loans, with everything more than the minimum payment going towards the 6.55% loans. Up until very recently I've felt this is the smartest thing to do financially. In fact, I was even planning on just applying the $150/mo I'm spending on the car loan towards my student loans when the car is paid off. 

In 4-5 years I will finish my residency training and make somewhere in the ballpark of 200-250k. We don't want children, and do want to retire very early (45 years old or so). Our plan is to keep our current lifestyle once I enter practice and put as much away as possible to retire on. 

Now for the questions. Should I keep paying so much on the student loans now, or start investing and saving more? I know you're supposed to do whatever brings the greatest increase in net worth, but the reason I have so many high interest student loans is because I had and continue to have no equity. Plus, I've made almost 8% on the S&amp;P 500 index fund since August. We also take a big hit in taxes being DINKs and all. Should I take the money I'm putting towards loans and put it toward my 401k (I have no employer contribution, but it'd be pre-tax)?

Any and all help is appreciated.

So I'll keep my story nice and short.

Last year, I got the opportunity to carry out a 6-month internship in HK. I got offered a follow-up back in London, but declined because I wanted to stay. I have been job-hunting since October, and my luck is seriously running out. My main focus is shared services within the financial industry (HR, Communication, Marketing). I have been told that the post-CNY period is lucrative for employment opportunities. Unfortunately, my deadline is nearing. My flight home is booked on the 28th of March, and that will be it.

Anyway, I was hoping that maybe some of you could keep an eye out for me. Perhaps drop me a message if you hear about any rumors or upcoming opportunities.. Any help at all would be seriously appreciated.

Below are some answers to questions you might be asking:

- I'm living with friends, so rent isn't a problem.
- I don't speak cantonese or mandarin, nor do I own a valid HKID
- I have an extensive network in Hong Kong 
- I am fortunate to have a strong CV with solid entry-level experience
- I regularly attend networking events, as well as personally meeting with professionals

If you have any extra tips or advice, please do let me know! 
Thanks guys."

Here it goes....
The show is finally televised, it becomes a hit on tv making everyone from the office famous. In the first weeks of the show they become a hot topic in pop culture and are becoming a household name in the american home. 
Dunder Mifflin at this time is the same as always and not growing as a company. Andy is having problems managing the Scranton branch.
Michael Scott becomes the most famous out of all of them and everyone that was on the show becomes wealthy from the new found fame. 
Jim decides to come to Scranton because he realizes that the show has given him enough money that he can quit Athlead and go back home to settle with the life he had. 
Michael comes back to Scranton.
Toby reveals that he is the Scranton strangler out of a raged outburst when Michael arrives.This is due to his jealousy of Michael's huge fame. So he reveals himself so he can gain more fame for himself.
Michael goes to David Wallace and asks for them to be partners in owning Dunder Mifflin and says that he will pay for the costs of expanding Dunder Mifflin into a big chain store. He tells him that they will not only sell paper and printers but computers and have a cafe. A lounge cafe. So that people can make business lunches with clients, but also use Dunder Mifflin products in the cafe like the computers and paper so that clients of all businesses can show each other business ideas or presentations on PowerPoint. Michael comes up with the idea from his love of mixing fun to the work place, making business that is boring to him more social. He always thought the office is a family so he introduces a place where you can have the tools to do serious things and lounge and have snacks and drinks with coworkers or clients. 
David Wallace accepts the idea although it is very risky, because he took a risk with suck it and succeeded. He says they would be a perfect team because he is logical and Michael is creative.
They tell the office about what they plan to do and everyone in the office wants to put in there money to be apart of it. 
Michael tells Ryan to come back to Scranton and that he will hire him and Kelly if they decide to be apart of it. 
Holly and Michael move to Scranton. 
From all of there new found fame they get lots of investors in the new business and decides to make Dunder Mifflin International.

Flash Forward, to present day a salt and pepper haired looking Andy walks out of the airport. He is holding a little boy in a colorful suit and a bow tie and they both follow a beautiful red headed woman. They run to a town car. They finally reach their destination and walk towards a very tall building and on the first floor is a famous store, it is a hybrid between a Staples an Apple store a Starbucks and a Dave and Busters. They walk in and go to the counter and a Young woman says ""Hello Mr.Bernard i have your beet scones and coffee ready upstairs i just sent it up."" Andy says "" Wow your getting big huh? give us a hug! why are you behind the counter today aren't you coming up with us?. Young woman says ""yah i just have to get someone to cover the counter for me. How is Andrea?."" Andy says "" shes at band camp for the summer. But don't worry we are going to bring her for Christmas to play the cello you know how your uncle Mike loves that. I heard you been seeing Dwight's son."" Young girl says "" Yeah my mom said that if i marry D.J. my dad will have a heart attack. Last week me and D.J. hid the coffee beans bag so that when the new intern had to make coffee he would have to go to the back of the store to get more. Brian's daughter Sam recorded the whole thing and put it up on Youtube. We got in trouble and my dad said we always cause trouble and Hank is to old to run after us."" Andy laughs and says "" Lets go upstairs together CiCi we are going to be late."" they hug and talk while going up to the second floor. 

They enter a big cafeteria what looks to be still a few remains of an old office. In it there is one room that use to be a conference room that says ""T.V. ROOM"" on it. It is so full that teens and toddlers are sitting on the floor. Everyone smiles and cries out ""Hi"" and Andy passes all of the people from his old office to say hello. They are all wearing a name tag. Dwight, Jim, and Andy wear a name tags that say COO, CFO and CTO. Others have Name tags that say Accounting Executive ,  Quality Assurance Executive, Sales Executive, Customer service Executive. Michael has a dvd in his hand and his daughter says "" Dad can i have some of your coffee"" Holly says "" You don't want that trust me."" The girl sips the mug that says Worlds Best CEO on it she spits a little on the floor. Holly says ""Honey, that's your dads milk and sugar"". Philip is sitting on the floor and says ""HEY YOU GOT SOME MILK ON ME!"". Meanwhile Dwight says ""MICHAEL THIS PLACE IS A DEATH TRAP"". Pam says "" Yeah Michael why didn't we do this in one of the big conference rooms!. We have at least 4 in this building!."" Everyone starts to argue, and Michael screams ""SHUUUUU---Shuuuttt shhutt it"" Michael is next to a T.V. on the wall trying to put a dvd in it. He cant reach and gets annoyed and says "" Who put this so damn high"" Erin replies "" You told Nate to put it high so it looks bigger because you said that you wanted a t.v. bigger than 80 inches and we could'nt find one.' Michael screams ""Can someone put the damn dvd in please? Not you Gabe you'd just mess it up, your worst then Toby. 

The Video Plays with a tune and then it starts with a bathroom sign with the words The Office on it.Then our tv screens go to black.
 
Sorry this post was so long and so different from the normal ideas of how the office should end."

I have an option in Rice university, but he hasn't answered, and he's only doing his PhD so i doubt he has too much power.

I have other options available, mainly due to friends of mine who have done summer internships in the past, but they're not for what i want the most. There's some at ASU and some in El Paso (i don't know the university's name), but they're in organic and inorganic synthesis.

So does anyone know of a good place to start, i'm trying all options and it's getting to a point when i might just start emailing my friends' contacts, which is why i have come to you for help.

Sex life continues to decline.,[deleted],DeadBedrooms,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/18x0jx/how_can_i_handle_my_high_libido_and_be/,"Hi, I hope this is the right place to post this.   We're both in college, I'm 22(F) and he's 25, been together 2 years. Due to our home situations, we only see each other on the weekends. We would usually have sex every day that we could, and then about a 7-8 months ago it started slowing down. Now we're at a once every other weekend, and I can tell that he's forcing it half the time. He says it's due to stress from school. He also recently started an internship (his first job) and that's taken a huge toll on his energy, even on weekends. I really want to be understanding, but it feels like something new always comes up to stress him out. He feels more distant than usual, but he assures me that he still loves me more than ever. I've talked to him about it but all he really says is that I pressure him when I initiate. He says that if we lived together, it would be different because I would be around when he's actually in the mood as opposed to me only being there twice a week. But we won't be graduated until late this year and I'm worried about how he'll handle things like a full time job, taking care of bills, and all the other things that come with it.  My question is, should I continue to be patient with him and focus on being supportive until we actually have the opportunity to move in together? Another question is: talking to him about it seems to stress him out more, which is the opposite of what I want to do. I want to give him his space and let him handle this on his own, but my sexual needs haven't been properly met in months and it's driving me crazy. I've been masturbating, but what I really miss is being close and intimate with him. Is there a way to talk to him about this without putting more pressure on him?"

I was so excited to come to college this past fall because it would be my first time out on my own, making my own decisions -- my first foray into adulthood and independence! After the first few exciting weeks, the activities started to die down and the real grind of work kicked in, along with some crippling homesickness. My parents have always been two of my best friends. When I was in high school and got ditched by some of my friends for more exciting plans, my parents would spend their whole weekends hanging out with me. My mom and I would get our nails done together, and we'd shop, and we'd have a grand old time. I really look up to and respect my mom. There are a lot of qualities about her that I want to see myself with one day. She's a great role model, and we love each other very much.

The problem is, we're not on the same page about something in particular: the very independence I was so excited to start experiencing last fall. In my opinion, I'm eighteen (I have been for some time) and living away from home for most of the year -- I should be able to operate sort of autonomously, without much interference from her. She texts me every day. Last weekend, she asked if it was OK for her to come visit me at college even though I'm coming home for a break next weekend. I have no classes on Fridays, but when I had a school-sanctioned break that really only consisted of a Friday free of classes (plus Saturday and Sunday off) she insisted I come home to visit. And even now, I'm working on a play (theatre major) that has rehearsals over Spring Break, and she expects me to tell them that my mom wants me home for the week, so I can't come back to my college town early. I've tried explaining that I need some space, especially when it comes to establishing my professional reputation (and that no professional director is going to take ""my mom won't let me"" as an excuse for an absence), but she takes it all so personally and thinks I don't want to be around her. Over Christmas Break, my boyfriend deployed overseas, and she would sort of make me feel guilty for spending so much time with him before he left because it meant that I wasn't spending it with her. The thing is though, when we spend time together, it typically just consists of us sitting in the living room on our computers watching TV. I mean, I love my mom, and spending time with her is important to me, but I feel like I'm being smothered a little. What if I just wanted to stay at school over spring break and enjoy the introvert time? I can't imagine her being okay with that. And, one day soon, I'll probably want to spend a summer away from home working at an internship or something like that, but I'm not sure I could even try to broach that topic without her getting upset. 

There's also the issue of my boyfriend (22). I feel like my parents should have no say in how I choose to conduct myself with my boyfriend. I'm on the pill, we're monogamous, and we love each other. My parents like him a whole lot, they think he's good to me, and they're totally fine with us dating, but they act like I'm still this pure thing that needs to be protected from all men. They're not even religious in the slightest, but they act like they have to protect my (long-gone) flower with all they've got. He and I are going on a trip together this summer with some friends, and the only way to get my parents to agree to letting me go with them was to assure them that he and I would not be sharing a room. He's in the military, and before his current deployment, I wanted to go to see him for a couple days before he left. He had a hotel room and arrangements were all made, but they refused to let me stay with him and made me stay with my grandparents who live nearby the base. Before he freakin' deployed! There's no way they can think that I'm not having sex with this man that I love, and there's no way that they can actually think that them forbidding me to sleep in the same bed as him a couple important nights before he left (for months) would keep me from doing it. My mom even knows that I stay at his apartment many nights when he and I are both at school. I know for a fact that my parents were living together for at least a year before they were married. They can't be oblivious. I think they just don't want to think about it. I also think that the actions that occur in my relationship should be none of their business. I know they're uncomfortable with that, so I'd never go against their wishes in their house (and I've told them that), but I think they need to butt out. 

There's definitely a double-standard between how my parents treat my brother (21) and how they treat me. I get that he's older, so they give him a lot more space, but when he was my age, they never asked where he was going at night. Occasionally they'd ask who he was going to be with, but for the most part, they just assumed they'd see him sometime. He'd ignore their texts and calls for weeks at a time, and though I saw how much it hurt my parents to feel like he was cutting them out, they started letting him do his own thing. Currently, he's not in school and he's living at home while he's saving up money, but he spends every night at his girlfriend's apartment. They realize this, but shrug it off because they ""cant control what he does."" I certainly don't want to hurt them and make them feel like they're not important to me anymore, but I don't know how to set the boundaries of my own life. 

Basically, I guess I'm just worried that my mom (and my dad, I suppose) still thinks of me as a child that she needs to check in on. I know I'll always be her baby, and I like that. My mom's a really cool gal. But I pretty much view myself as an adult. I know that I probably sound like a whiney teenager right now, but I really need some advice from you all who have had to do this. I definitely don't want to cut the cord with my mom, because I want her in my life, but I need to feel like I'm on my own, or I'll never learn how to be independent. 

Sorry for the long rant, and I'm really sorry if I sound dumb and stupid. Any advice is helpful. Thanks, twox."

Trying to breathe and not stress. Last time I was overcome with stress, I had panic attacks. And then having panic attacks stressed and freaked me out... It was a vicious cycle. I don't want to go back there. 

But I have been struggling with my brain and how foggy and tangled it is constantly. It all makes me feel so nauseated sick and also frustrated with myself. Stuff like this, anyone could make the decisions and take the steps. I want so much for everything to just be strands of yarn, simple and pointed out and clear. Instead, my brain takes everything and tangles it up in one ginormous ball and as I try to untangle, it just spins around and around.

My older sister wants to help me. I live with her and help take care of her two sons. She knows about my depression and wants to help me be active. Right now, she is making a nanny contract to help me. She wants me to tell her soon if I'll accept. 

What I struggle with is the fact that I don't want to live here anymore. I can't stand her arrogant and egocentric husband, I can't stand the days just passing with nothing to live for. I want to move out and live on my own or with my friend. But I can't because my dog. So until (and I really don't want this day to ever come) he dies... I'm stuck somewhere that'll let him live with me. I'm so unhappy here. I don't like going out of my room. I'm lost on this.

That's the tangible thing. My mind is cluttered with pain and frustration from my situations and past. I feel sick with myself. I just feel like a wanderer. No parents, no place that I feel like I'm home... I'm just one big ball of worthlessness and pain and hurt and lies. I feel nothing positive. And I just want to go to sleep till everything is how it's supposed to be or for everything to just stop. For me to just stop being. Because the journey to how things are supposed to be feels like walking around in a dark and empty land, like I'll never get there. I need to get there though. I don't want to end up living like this another day, let alone forever.

So this is my tangled web of a brain and heart. It's actually pretty clearer than what I thought I would write.

**A little on my life: 

-I've been struggling with depression for about 8 years

-Mom was severely physically and emotionally abusive, my three sisters and I were removed from her custody the summer before my senior year. Now 2 years out of high school

-Father left at 6, back at 10 and left at 12 on Christmas Eve.

-Raised and took care of three sisters while living with my mom. Used to taking care of myself and being left alone.

-Last year, I was in an internship. Lived with a family for about 6 months when I decided to move in with mom to try to mend the relationship. She drank a lot and we argued. She kicked me out with no notice within 3 months.

I am new to this subreddit so please direct me elsewhere if I am lost.

My business partner and I started up a small video production company just over a year ago. Over the course of that year, we have discovered that the people that we most want to provide media for are other small start-ups, non-profits, local artists/musicians (who self-promote and give back to the community), and we also enjoy helping students get on their feet in a real world environment (internships, training).

I have been toying with the idea to somehow work it out so we operate as a non-profit, but instead of giving away food/shelter/etc., we give away media (which, let's be honest, get's expensive!). This combines our two goals - helping those that need a leg up, and doing the media work we love.

Is this a viable goal? How would we get this in order?

Thanks in advice for any help or advice! Still trying to get our feet on the ground over here. :)"
18wns8,6,2013-02-20,What to do with two Roth IRAs?  One at Vanguard and one at TD Ameritrade.,NorwegianPearl,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/18wns8/what_to_do_with_two_roth_iras_one_at_vanguard_and/,"Howdy folks,

In 2011 I opened a Roth IRA (without brokerage ability) at Vanguard with wages from my summer internship and put in as much as I could.  I've since graduated, got a job, and maxed contributions for 2012 and 2013.  

I figured it wasn't much of my mom's business what I did with money, but she casually mentioned to me that I had a Roth IRA.  I was puzzled how she knew I had opened one, but it turns out she was speaking of another Roth IRA with TD Ameritrade opened by my grandfather without my knowledge.  He never put in much money...100 dollars here, 100 dollars there for Christmas or Birthday.  I'm in the process of gaining control of the funds here.

I have also opened a separate brokerage account with TD Ameritrade.

The TD IRA is at approximately 3000 dollars and my Vanguard IRA is at approximately 13,000

I know that I can have multiple Roth IRAs so long as yearly contribution is &lt;5500, but it seems to me that it would make sense to consolidate this money in one way or another.  

The options that become apparent to me are these:
1) Roll TD Ameritrade Roth IRA over into my Vanguard Roth IRA

2) Roll Vanguard Roth IRA over into TD Ameritrade Roth IRA

3) Withdraw contributions from one of my IRAs and roll over/take penalties on earnings, and invest contributions in my brokerage account.

I'd rather not pay any fees or lose money, but to me it doesn't make sense to me to keep 2 separate IRAs going as the funds are not easily transferrable to me. 

I would appreciate your guys' opinions on this subject. 

Thanks!"

I've thought that one of the biggest things LoL lacked was a sandbox mode to test builds and matchups. I wanted to make one for quite a long time, but never had a good database to pull info from. Frustrated, I made my own (by scraping LoLWiki and the NA site itself). Not wanting to keep the goodies to myself, I exported the data into a handy API so that any other interested developers would be free to create as well. The system is easily patchable, so whatever you make with the data will always be up to date!

As of now, I've only had the time to make champ data for champions whos name starts with A (being a full time student at University, and all), but the data is to the point where it (probably) won't be changing anymore. I wanted to go ahead and post about it so that any other developers looking to use the API could provide feedback before it gets into too many hands. Now that I have the scripts written, getting the rest of the champ data in there won't be a big deal. ^(Oh, also, XML support is coming soon, so don't worry!)

The project is entirely open source. The code can be found at http://github.com/Xavdidtheshadow/lolapi and the live app (that doesn't do much (and isn't meant to, really; it's just for calling)) is at lolapi.herokuapp.com. 

Additionally, the sandbox is in that repo (battle.py). It's command line but quite easy to use. I'm actively working on it, so bugs'll disappear throughout the day. There are instructions to download and use it now, though a bit of programming experience is recommended (this'll be more accessible when it's done). 

Coincedentially, this is the centerpiece for my internship application at Riot, so any and all feedback is *greatly* appreciated.

Thanks much!

If someone is willing, I'll ship off the Xbox as part of a trade with other hardware for a working one too. It's an HDMI model (case was stolen from a guy on CL who said he'd fix it, ended up with a system with no thermal paste, and a non-hdmi case), still my board and matching ODD (BenQ).

S.O. left me stranded after saying he wouldn't.,SuperAwkwardGirl,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18vyqy/just_venting_so_left_me_stranded_after_saying_he/,"This is a little bit of a rant.  I'm just so mad right now that I need to vent.  Hope it's okay to do it here.  

So: my husband and I share a car, which is not a big deal most of the time.  Usually when I need the car, he takes his bike and when he needs the car I bike or take the bus.  And usually when I need the car for going someplace too far to bike/not easily bus-able, it's there.

Well, this morning, I had to be at my internship at 8:30, and although it is technically bus-able, it's a ten-minute drive or else almost an hour by bus due to the fact that buses in a small city aren't always the best, and we had talked last night and agreed that I would have the car, like I do every time I go to this particular internship site (I go to different sites on different days).  Anyway, at 8:15, I go to get in the car and discover that it's not there. Because he took it to work.  After saying that I could have it for the morning, and me scheduling myself based on having the car.

Anyway, I probably should have just gone to my internship late, although it would have been about an hour and a half late by the time I arrived (stupid bus schedule) for a three-hour shift, so I just called out and will make up the time later.  Which is embarrassing, because I was upset and didn't have the presence of mind to say I was sick, so I said I had no ride, but it's not the end of the world or anything, just kind of embarrassing.

Anyway, I am just SO MAD at husband.  SO MAD.  I know it's kind of petty to still be so mad, but it's also my career, and we talked about it last night, so I feel really disregarded, and also I was up early for what turned out to be no reason.  I know that it's not *that* early for most folks, but it is for me, due to crazy schedule that has me burning the candle at both ends.

Anyway, thanks for reading.  I feel like I want to smash something.  I'm sure I'll get over it, but right now I feel so angry and disregarded and there isn't really anything I can do about it.  "

",portofmorrow,UKJobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/UKJobs/comments/18vt3x/i_need_some_help_making_a_decision_im_in_a_good/,"So I have been doing internships/work experience since graduating last summer, and in the last month or so I've finally decided I've got enough experience to start applying for jobs. I want to work in Wealth Management for Private Clients, but have also been considering Financial Planning roles. So this week and next week I got about 6 interviews set up, some slightly more relevant than others.

On Monday I had a final interview for a Financial Planning assistant postion (A), and I found out yesterday I got it! Then on Tuesday I had a final interview with the Wealth Management company (B) I did my main internship with - I haven't heard that I got it yet but they told me I was pretty much a shoe in for the role, which was nice to hear. Tomorrow I have an interview with a firm (C) who are similar in size to A, and although I haven't heard much about them I looked them up and they are the 3rd highest rated company to work for in the UK (2012). 

I was going to cancel the interview tomorrow (and the ones next week), and then take the job from A if B reject me, or have the choice between the two if they don't - I'd probably pick B based on the role. The only thing is that B is a temporary role, and I'd have to interview again for a permanent position in 3 and 6 months time. This is worrying me quite a lot as I would really like some stability to look forward to. 

What should I do? My options are:

A) Cancel all further interviews including at C, wait to hear from B, make my decision.

B) Go to C tomorrow (I haven't prepped for the role at all yet), and potentially have to chose between 3 positions, even though I probably won't pick C if I have all 3 to chose from. If it was between A and C, maybe. 

C) Ring up B, tell them I have received an offer from A, ask what the status of my application is?


I know this seems a bit petty seeing as I've got some good options to pick from, but it is all happening very fast (both A and B would want me to start on Monday). I feel some very strong loyalty towards B as they had me in for my internship and have been very supportive, I'm only put off by the temporary status of the role. And the salary, I suspect it won't be as high as A.

18vl9f,1,2013-02-20,Not sure if I'm depressed or just becoming a f*ck up[lengthy read],[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/18vl9f/not_sure_if_im_depressed_or_just_becoming_a_fck/,"I've been wanting to get this off my chest for awhile but didn't really know who or where to go, I can't talk about this with my family because they would hate my guts if I told them about some of this stuff. I figured this is a good place to start to get some insight to what I've been going through. 

I guess I will start with why I think that I'm depressed; I'm 22 and in my 4th year of college (on the 5 year plan) and the last year and a half have been full of new and exciting times in my life but at the same time I have never felt right about it. I originally went to community college for two years which was basically like high school as I was still living at home hanging out with the same people and doing most of the same stuff, but a year and a half ago I got to the breaking point to where I thought  I just had to get out of my situation. Keep in mind at this point my options were awesome, if I stayed in community college just one more year I would be able to transfer to some pretty nice schools such as UCSB, UCSD or UC Davis. I was just one year away but regrettably I opted out of the third year and transferred to where I am now (not going to say) but I transferred out of state and ended up going to literally one of the worst academically ranked colleges in the United States (I think it's 20-30 spots away from the worst school in the US.) I didn't know this at the time but had heard a lot of good things about the business school, and I am a sports fanatic and always wanted to go to a school with college football and basketball  which swayed my decision a little bit. Also, fuck it, I like to party every now and again. 

At this point you probably think I'm a complete retard, don't worry because I do too. I regret this decision everyday I wake up. I just think, what in the fuck am I doing here? Why the fuck am I so stupid? 

In CC I was a good student, I did all my work, studied everyday for hours, and ended up pulling a few semesters with 3.8+ and I believe I ended up with around a 3.4 or 3.5 before I left. Ever since I've been here there hasn't been a day where I can rekindle that kind of focus, hardly an hour of it much less a day. My first year my GPA fell to a lowly 2.7; I drank, I smoked, I did other kinds of drugs (I'll get into that part later.) Now school is a fucking nightmare. I almost failed my first class ever last semester, I can't grasp or memorize material like I used to (albeit upper division &gt; general ed shit but still) and I literally just feel stupid. I can't focus here, I can't crack down. I have no self control anymore no matter what kind of routine I try to get myself into. I constantly have shitty thought processes of dropping out of school and saying ""fuck this."" I used to be interested in school, I used to enjoy the process of studying. Now I fucking hate it, I hate everything about school but alas I grind away getting shitty grades that won't get me an internship anywhere. I realize my attitude sucks, I've changed a lot from where I used to be in a bad way. 

 I am also a member of a club athletic team who frankly, have never been a good team or had a good record. In high school I was a starter and I worked my ass off everyday to get there, and when  I came here playing this sport was one of my biggest passions I had and I worked my ass off to succeed in it. Long story short, I wasn't as good as I thought I could be, it just didn't happen. Two years in community college took a lot of mojo off my game despite being in the gym all the damn time in CC and practicing every weekend. Part of it I feel like has to do with the way the program is run but I can't say I've made every opportunity count either, I guess it just wasn't meant to be. I had a HUGE ego coming into the program because I felt prepared and ready to kick ass, unfortunately the coaches didn't think so and they slowly ruined my confidence by not playing me and other shit. I ended up starting for most of the season but by that point my head was so fucked with lack of confidence I was just never the same. Every little mistake I was reminded of, it was just too much for me to be perfect all the fucking time and kept thoughts trickling in the back of my head of doubt. I still play, and it's still the same old shit except I don't start anymore and I barely play at all. I'm only there to stay in shape and to hang out with my friends. The bull shit is even worse this year but luckily I have thick skin. (And before anyone mentions it, I've talked with all the staff face to face in a respectful manner countless times, but they say one thing and act in another way and it just pissed me off to no end.)


So that's why I think I'm depressed. I went from a life of doing well in school (even had a girlfriend for a little bit) and being good at sports to essentially feeling like the epitome of stupidity and un-athleticism. I also had a great group of friends (who would have split eventually) that was a bummer to leave behind. I made a decision to go to a school that I don't care for, in a city I have no fucking idea of why I would come here, living a life that had no merit or plan except for a decision on a whim. I fucked up and everyday being here I'm reminded of it, and it kills me inside every damn day. I think about just offing myself sometimes for putting myself in this situation, for being this stupid. 

On the flip side I feel like I could just be a fuck up plain and simple. I've casually smoked pot since I was 16, I don't feel like it had any negative bearing on me until I transferred from CC. I started smoking more and more, literally multiple times a day everyday. I had never done this before, I was going to class stoned off my ass sometimes, or just getting so high at night I wouldn't wake up the next day because I would be groggy as shit. (We have late practices from like 9-12am, so I would blaze after practice late at night) I think pot is a wonderful drug in moderation, things like social anxiety have gone almost completely away since I started using it, but I wasn't using it in moderation. Eventually the end of the semester comes and I find myself wanting to go hard in the paint after my last final is over. I end up getting offered some shrooms and I ate them (I did a hit of acid like a year before this but this was a much stronger amount of shrooms.) I swear to god I think these shrooms fucked my head up. During the trip there was a point where I was standing up and it felt like my brain exploded (ok not really) but my vision went black and I had to sit down immediately or risk passing out. After that I went home for summer vacation, and I stop doing any physical activity whatsoever. I started playing Diablo 3 for hours on hours everyday and developed a chewing tobacco addiction; I got fat and out of shape, smoked pot everyday, quit sports, did more shrooms, starting fucking around with cocaine and other pills (shrooms once, coke 2-3 times, and some nights drinking &amp; eating vicodins) By the end of summer I didn't want to go back to school, I sure as fuck didn't want to play sports anymore, I didn't want to work out or exercise or anything that I held as productive for a large period of my life. I just became content being my definition of a bum. 

I tried dedicating last fall to school, I put in a shit ton of effort compared to the year before. GPA still sucked, and now I feel like a retard for not being able to get a 3.0 at one of the worst ranked colleges in the US while riding the bench on a low-tier club sports team. My confidence is fucked, I haven't had a girlfriend in years and I'm lonely as shit, I just pretty much wonder how I can snap out of this funk of feeling like such a piece of shit and just forget about it and live my life. I can't love myself right now or accept what I've done, and I have no idea how. Maybe I'm just getting a reality check and not handling it well, maybe I'm being a pussy, or maybe it's something I don't know. My mom has depression and my brother THINKS he may be depressed to, we have alcoholism in the family and my mom's side definitely has some mental issues if that matters. Everyday since summer the things I used to do on a daily basis (study, go to the gym, getting things done and being organized and having DRIVE) are so much harder than it used to be. It takes so much effort to just get out of bed in the morning and go to class. Sometimes I won't even make food when I'm hungry. Everything is more difficult for me to find purpose in myself to actually accomplish. 

To anyone who actually read this, thank you and if you have anything to say don't hesitate, mean or nice.

18zbbr,3,2013-02-21,My [23M] GF [22F] of 3.5 years initiated a break then slept with someone but says she eventually wants to get back together.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/18zbbr/my_23m_gf_22f_of_35_years_initiated_a_break_then/,"I'm not sure if this entirely belongs in r/relationships or r/breakups. It honestly seems to be something in-between.

My girlfriend and I have been in a LDR for the last 3 and a half years. It's had ups and downs, but generally I felt it was going as well as something like that would for people our age. We had lost our virginity together, and neither of us cheated on the other. She is a year behind me in school (I graduated college in May of last year), but that never really was a problem. During my senior year, I became very stressed about what I was going to do after school for money. My degree is in a very specific field, and that field is localized almost entirely in one city. My attempts at finding a job - even at the lowest level - met with no success and I became very pessimistic about my chances in the future. Regrettably, rather than sharing this with my GF, or anyone for that matter, I just kept telling myself I'd be fine without actually confronting my fears about reality. 

As a result, I became increasingly hostile to my girlfriend and my family because they were the people involved in advising me through this process. It got so bad that my GF and I paused our relationship for about a month during my senior spring. We kept it monogamous but we gave each other much more space. I admit I still didn't confront my issues but she felt more comfortable once I had landed an internship and an apartment. She moved in with me over the summer and things were very good and we were happy. In the fall, she went back to school and I started a second internship, which I did not like. I became increasingly depressed - things I used to enjoy bored me, I was grouchy all the time, and I hated just getting out of bed. 

Meanwhile, she had  nervous breakdown at school because of academics and troubled relations with her parents, specifically her father who emotionally abused her beginning at about age 12 by telling her she was ugly and stupid pretty much constantly. During our relationship, I had always tried to build her self-confidence, tell her she was valuable, and carry her through anxiety attacks relating to school because she was afraid she wasn't smart enough to do well (even though she made dean's list multiple times). So, during the fall our individual issues both peaked: I was miserable with where I was post-college, and she was breaking down about her own abilities. We spent all our time either fighting or me comforting her or her trying to comfort me while I denied that anything was wrong aside from that I hated my job.

I moved back home in the winter, and when she came back we had several large fights where I realized I actually hadn't been sharing my problems with her and my emotional unavailability had made her resent me. We talked about it at length, and proceeded to have an excellent month a half. I worked on telling her when and why I was upset and we just had a great time. She went back to school and I immediately fell back into a depression about returning to an old (non-paying) employer while I await grad school responses. Two weeks ago, we had a small spat which grew out of my not telling her I didn't want to wait up to tuck her in for bed over the phone (a staple of our LDR). Two days later (Saturday) *she tells me she wants a total break for us each to work on our own issues - my dissatisfaction with my place post-grad and her not feeling self-reliant - and then try our relationship again.* The following day she officially said we were no longer together, changed her relationship status and told me she considered herself single.

*Now I told you that story to tell you this one.* I did my best to focus on myself and not contact her, including asking some hard questions of myself. But of course we talk here and there during the following week. Last Thursday, she tells me that she realized that she has never felt loved by her parents and it has prevented her from ever preserving her self-esteem. She told me she realized this the day after we broke up (Monday) after getting very drunk and having a one-night stand in an attempt to feel better about herself. I was stunned, particularly because we had only ever had sex with one another. I tried to take this in stride, and since that discussion we talked openly with each other about when we felt scared, including my talking her through three anxiety attacks. 

Then this morning, after much prodding from me about why she had been vague about whether or not she was going to sleep with any more people, she told me she was planning on sleeping with her one-night-stand again in casual fashion because she wants someone to have sex with while we were apart. I went ballistic, telling her I felt used and she said is trying to learn how to be on her own but reiterated that she really wanted things to work out between her and me and said ""If I wanted to break up with you permanently I would have done it by now. I'm not trying to spring you along or give you false hope."" I now have no idea what to do. I care for this person very deeply and enjoyed our relationship a great deal. I don't know how to feel about this, aside from confused that she could move on (sexually) so quickly and confused about her telling me she does want us to be together in the future but feels fine about casually sleeping with another man until then.

**tl;dr - GF of 3.5y LDR asked for a break after a tense year b/c of communication issues, told me she wanted to us work to work individually on our individual issues so we could reunite, slept with someone and told me she wants to start having casual sex with him, all while reassuring me she most wants our relationship to work again somewhere down the line. I am bewildered and conflicted.**

I realize now I wrote a novel; my thanks to anyone who actually reads the whole thing. It barely scratches the surface, of course.

I'm Chintan, a freshman at Georgia Institute of Technology, and I'm looking for an amazing internship at 
a startup.


Ideally, I'm looking for a startup that's doing something really cool - I'd love to learn about machine learning, data analytics, etc. I've gotten a few offers already, but I don't think I'd fit very well at a big company - I'm looking for somewhere where I'll have actual responsibility and be able to shape the direction of the company.


I have a fair bit of experience in web development (I interned at a RoR firm back in Australia and I've been working in PHP for a few years), but I'd really love to expand my experiences and learn more about the backend. I've got a fair bit of experience in Agile environments and with using Git in a large team (git-flow anyone?).


I'm currently in the process of founding a startup which is based on an app to predict outfits, and I'd love experience in a startup environment. My previous internship was in a small (but awesome) RoR shop, and it was nothing short of amazing. It was very startup-esque and everyone was extremely down to earth and willing to teach. 


I'm currently taking my college's course on data structures and algorithms (which I'm having to teach myself - terrible professor), and it's extremely engaging. Even though I'm a freshman, I have no doubt that I can teach myself the necessary skills required to hustle with the juniors and seniors.


If you're interested, send me a message for my resume. My github is github.com/chintanparikh


Cheers,

Chintan"

I commissioned from AFROTC at NC State Univ last December and I will not go active (EAD) until late September because of federal budgeting. I am currently having a good time trying to find a job for the next 6 months and so far I've landed nothing. (Even after sending my resume out to everybody I know and applying for half a dozen things.)

As a student and cadet, I did not take opportunities with internships either within the AF or civilian world, but instead took summer classes to make my normal semesters lighter, which in turn helped my GPA out. Although it was pretty good for me then, I am currently regretting that decision because the only things I have on a resume are a little bit of ROTC work/management experience and my engineering senior design project.

In the unlikely event that the AF cuts me from developmental engineering - electrical, I would be out of a job with no college internship experience to lean back on. However unlikely that seems, given the dire need for developmental EEs, it is still a small possibility.

My advice to you is to apply for internships when you can and gain experience in your field of study, because you aren't guaranteed anything. I realized the gravity of this too late and I am thankful that I am going into such a ""crucial"" career field. Along with having the perks of some extra money, an internship or co-op will help you out in the long run.

TL;DR: Get an internship or co-op while in ROTC because it will help you out when resume building.

I don't really know where to start. I've been socially awkward as long as I can remember. I think it all started in high school with my marijuana consumption. Being high made me REALLY awkward, but we smoked on lunch break every day from grade 8 to graduation. At first I was only awkward when high, but it started while being sober too.

Fast forward to last year of high school, we have to pick a college. This is where I started to get really anxious. I did not want to go to a college where I would not know anybody, so I picked the college where my 2 best friends were going. Obviously our schedules didn't match so I started to skip class in order to not being alone between classes. I barely made any friends at this school. I dropped out on 2nd semester.

I then got my first job as a cashier in a convenience store. I worked nights to avoid as much people as possible. I was really depressed during this year. I don't think working nights helped much. I enrolled into another school for a 3-year programming degree.

First weeks were hard, but eventually I made friends. People had similar interests to me so it was easier. There was a girl in our classes, which eventually became my first girlfriend. My anxiety wasn't so bad during the first 2 years, except for oral presentations where I would not sleep for like a week before it.

Work was hard. I now worked 3-11pm shift and I hated it. I eventually had to quit on my 3rd year of my degree. I could not find another job so I got into debt. I had no job so I could not pay, banks and credit card companies started to calling me daily. (This made me dread talking on the phone. I get so anxious when the phone rings or I have to call somebody, it's not even funny. Most of the time, my mom has to call for me. I'm 25 years old for fucks sake. )

At the end of my degree, I found a job where one of my friends for school had an internship. It's alright, except sometimes I have to call people... in english. While my written english is pretty good, I speak like a spanish cow. It does not help my anxiety at all and I stutter all the time. Say what you want, but native english speakers get really agressive when they speak to a french native speaker, like I'm some kind of burden. 

My anxiety also affects my driving. Thanks god for google street view. I have to look everywhere I go on street view beforehand every time I go somewhere new. I would not be able to drive if it wasn't for street view. I also dread driving in the city. 

I have a good group of friends, and love going to play catan or poker with them. But if they all want go out to eat out at the restaurant with their girlfriends and some people I dont know I have an anxiety attack and can't leave the house. It's really frustrating because I'm not awkward with them, but as soon as somebody new is there no words come out of my mouth.

My anxiety is getting out of control. I want to be able to answer the phone. I want to be able to go eat out with my friends. My fear of the phone is so great that I contemplate suicide every morning before going to work. Also I don't know if this is related but I'm tired, like completely dead every day. On the week-end, I wake up at 11am, eat, go for a nap and wake up at 5pm. I'll be ready to sleep at 11pm. What is going on with me? I don't want to go to the doctor, it stresses me out. Do I really have to?"

So I'm a third year software engineering student (for a bachelor degree) doing an internship.
Now, before this internship started I hadn't even heard about GIS, and have spend the last week reading through a lot of sites about it. Which was kinda fascinating. I'm not quite sure if I understand it all though, which is why I'm here!

So for my internship I've been tasked with setting up a data product catalog. To be more specific; a data product catalog for data-products (like models, predictions etc.) on the area of marine and socioeconomic data. 
Besides that, it has to harvest metadata from different sources, supply external GIS systems with a layer through WMS/WFS protocol and display the metadata on a map.


So some external research had already been done before I started this internship. 3 Commercial packages had been researched which would do the job (results varied, ArcGIS came out on top though) along with one open source combination. This was a combination of GeoServer, GeoNetwork and OpenLayers. Since my assignment is to set this all up with open source software, this is what I concentrated on. I've tried to find other open source packages, but these seem to be pretty popular and stable.

The researcher clearly didn't know what she was talking about on some points, she didn't seem to realize that OpenLayers is already packaged with GeoServer, but the combination seems to be the right one.
I've listed the functionalities below along with the software package that provides that functionality. 


* Data Product Catalog -&gt; GeoNetwork
* Harvest data from different sources -&gt; GeoNetwork
* Let other GIS use the metadata as a layer through WMS/WFS -&gt; GeoServer
* Read the data -&gt; GeoServer
* Connect with database (which is MS SQL Server) -&gt; GeoServer
* Display the data on a map -&gt; OpenLayers

As for the webinterface itself, they work here with ASP.net, but they're letting me free to chose it myself. They wouldn't be adverse to PHP. I still have to check to see what I'm going to be using though, but that's not really a priority this soon in the internship (still have 18 weeks out of 20 to go).

So for my question, am I on the right track? I mean, I think that these packages will do what I need it to do, but I haven't had a chance to play with them yet and I understand it more clearly when I do.

18y7c9,3,2013-02-21,I just want to share my story and hope to find some advice.,IwantToProgress,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/18y7c9/i_just_want_to_share_my_story_and_hope_to_find/,"Hey everybody, I just want to share my story.

I've been depressed for the last few years of my life and am having problems dealing with it. I've known of my 'condition' for a while and am having issues trying to cope. Let me start at the beginning...

I started college at my university very excited and willing to succeed. I was successful for the first couple years and enjoyed every bit of it. I started drinking in highschool and have loved it ever since. I am very anxious around groups of people and it helps me cope with my anxiety. When I am intoxicated, people find me very enjoyable, funny, lots of fun to be around. I also enjoy being around these same people while intoxicated as it removes the anxiety that I have and helps me 'be myself'.

Let's move on. Later on in my college career, I got a few different internships to make some money and make connections for possible later jobs. The first internship that I had went quite well. I mostly enjoyed it (it was a lot of menial work), but in general I had no complaints. Life was good, I was making good money and the good times were rolling.

So I went back to school and it came time to sign up for another internship. I chose a company that seemed very interesting to me and got hired! I loved working for this company. I got to do some interesting things, my boss was very lenient and I was paid very well. I loved it. I felt in control of my life. Things were awesome and I had nothing to complain about. The semester ended and I bid adieu to the company for the time being, as they said they intended to rehire me when I was up for another internship.

This is where things turned south. I started facing some issues that I had not had to deal with before. The main issue was money. I was lucky enough to have had a part time job chauffeuring around some affluent family friends that had usually been able to cover most of my expenses, giving me a very comfortable lifestyle. The extra money from my chauffeuring gig combined with my internship check was more than enough to cover my rent, bills and my very active nightlife. I'm talking going out every weekend (and some weekdays) to bars, clubs and restaurants. When I got back into school, I did not adjust my expenses to account for not having a paycheck every other week. I started running out of money.

I was paying rent late, my bills were getting to the point where sometimes I would lose electricity for a few days at a time and I was slowly losing my grip. How did I cope? By drinking. I had an ""image"" to keep up, and that image was as a party animal. Going out to clubs with friends, hooking up with chicks, etc...

My drinking got to the point that my family started asking me how I was doing. I was skipping every class, playing video games all night and sleeping through the days. The end of my school semester came and I found out that I had failed all of my classes. I should have been shocked, but I wasn't... I just didn't care. I used to be a very religious person, going to Mass every Sunday and in general keeping up with my spiritual life, as it was very important to me. I stopped all of that too. Missing sunday mass, which normally would have terrified me, didn't bother me at all.

My next internship came up and I signed up for it. The same company that I had worked for previously hired me and I was excited. I was excited that I would finally get my life back on track after the abysmal semester that I had had. I was going to start making some good money, get my life in shape, fix up my grades, blah blah blah...

That enthusiasm didn't last. My depression, that I was still unaware of, that had been haunting me was still there. This job that I loved a year ago bored me. I started showing up late, calling in sick multiple days at a time and browsing the internet when I should have been at work. Eventually I was let go via email during one of my week-long 'sicknesses'. This should have devastated me. It didn't, not at all. It didn't bother me one bit. I simply read the email, frowned and closed the tab.

This is where I currently am. I didn't register for school as I had no interest in it and didn't look for another job. I had to move out of my apartment and started living with my parents. They gladly accepted me, but I didn't exactly savor it. My parents went to bed early, didn't have internet access and I wasn't able to keep up my nightlife that I so dearly loved.

My father got me a job that was very demanding physically. I liked it at first as I got a very good workout, was losing weight and got decent paychecks. I was working very hard during the day and it wore me out. I spent most of my days after work hanging out with my friend who had internet access (I was gaming online as much as I could) and started to spend a couple of nights a week sleeping on his couch. This progressed to me sleeping every night on his couch, and being a good friend of mine, he didn't mind at all. 

I stopped showing up to work and calling in sick again. I wasn't sick, I just woke up most days when my alarm went off and just didn't feel like going to work. I simply didn't want to work and spent most of my days browsing reddit and playing video games at my buddy's house. I was let go from my job. I then began living at my friends house, sleeping on his couch and only eating when I was too hungry to put it off any longer. My friend tried to help me, getting me a job that I eventually got fired from for not showing up and trying to get me to work out. I lived on that same couch for an entire year. 

This is when my family and friends intervened. They had an meeting with me and asked me what was wrong. I started crying as I admitted that I was having regular thoughts of suicide. During that year on the couch, I would contemplate killing myself daily. I never went as far as thinking HOW I would kill myself, but the thought lingered in the back of my mind. Thoughts such as ""I could really just end this all pretty quickly"" and ""Wow, this would be so easy.""

So they started helping me. They introduced me to a therapist and I started meeting with him. I moved off of my buddies couch and back into my parents house. I got a part time job and am trying to get back into school. But my bad habits that I had formed still haunt me. I met with my therapist for multiple sessions. He gave me some great insight into myself. 

I have learned that I am a very negative thinker. I don't understand why people like me, despite the fact that my friends and family enjoy my company. I don't know how to accept compliments. My friends often say they love when I show up to events. I'm still convinced that they are mocking me. I don't understand why people enjoy my company. I don't believe anyone truly likes me. It feels like everyone is simply putting up with me. I know deep down that this isn't true, but I still feel have these feelings. I feel so alone.

And this is where I currently am. I have stopped seeing my therapist because everytime I set up an appointment, I don't bother to show up. He is probably tired of my unwillingness to change myself.

I just don't know what to do. I know that I want to better myself, but I'm just too indifferent to put forth the effort. Can you all give me some insight?

Sorry if this is a long read, but I felt the need to share my story. This account is a throwaway, so please feel free to comment or PM me any questions you might have. Thanks for anyone who read this and if this has helped anyone then thank you for reading."

With my parents' schedules, I have no means to get to work when I am not at school, which has made it very hard to get a part time job in order to save up money for a car. I do save what I can, however. I worked every day over this past holiday season since I was able to go in at 8am and leave in time to pick my mom up from work (only time I'm really able to take my moms car without inconviencing her). I have applied for an internship at my mom's job as well, so I will be able to ride with her to work all summer, and I plan on putting all of that money in a savings account to go to a car.

I would like you to sponsor a part of the Dodge Dart I have created on Dodge's website. I have set a goal of $25,000 to go towards a car. This is a large number, but the way Dodge has this set up, even if I don't reach that goal, I still receive what has been sponsored, minus about 10%. My hope is that I will raise enough for a basic model Dart, but since I will still receive the money sponsored, I would really like to raise enough to get a used car. Finally getting a car of my own would allow me to get reliably get a job without worrying about how I will be getting there everyday so that I can save up money for my next school year, as well as paying off the loans I have taken out for my tuition. Any help provided will be very much appreciated. Thanks.

Well, I have a phone interview for an internship in the UK this Friday, and I'm in need of some advice. The interviewer is obviously *from* the UK, and so the call with be done international and with a 6 hour difference. 

The biggest issue I am worried about is the difference in accents. I am from the US, but my accent is a bit different than the typical American accent (whatever that may be) as I speak with a different tone and emphasize different words. I can't completely explain it, let's just say I got yelled at a lot by my public speaking teacher for not speaking ""correctly"". But, is there any other way I could try to speak more clearly besides slowing down? Also, how should I approach trying to understand her accent? Is it appropriate to ask her to slow down?

Also, any tips on what questions to prepare for? I have of course gone through the interview process previously, although I am unaware of what questions I might be asked from someone abroad. It was suggested that I should prepare to answer questions that may revolve around ""Why are you trying to get a job over here?"" although I'm not sure if that really is reasonable question to prepare for.

Any other advice is welcome, thanks!"

I understand the need to get things out. I understand that I've always been your venting source, shoulder to cry on, tissue box holder, and the one who fixes your situation.

But latley, I worry about you. You're anxiety has been through the roof, worrying about every little thing you come across. The smallest problem turns into a natural disaster. I've had to calm you down about homework, our neighbors being loud, the printer not working, if you coughed, etc. I've blocked WebMD on your computer so you don't think you have liver failure or cancer when its really just gas. You lost sleep over your friend and I had to stop you from thinking she got in a car accident while doing cocaine, when in reality she was talking on the phone and didn't want her mother to hear.

I'm worried about you, I can't tell you anything in the worry that you might get anxious. I feel like my opinions or worries don't matter, or you turn all the outcomes to the dark side, stop me from talking, and make me feel as if my voice is a waste of space. 

I'm just as stressed as you, maybe a little more. I'm up all night working on portfolios for internships, major projects for class, weekly essays, making my mother happy, applying for jobs left and right with no responses, feeling as if my voice doesn't matter at all, AND listening to you and making sure you're okay. You have no idea how many times I've cried in the empty computer lab, just because it was safe to cry there.

I'm worried about you. I'm sick of this dark cloud that overhangs over your head constantly. I'm worried that you might have an anxiety disorder, and I don't want you to get run over by snowball effect that looms over your head. Quite frankly, if I say anything positive, the negitive snowball just engulfs it.

I'm sick of the negitivity, and I know this is something that can't be changed overnight. But please, please, I'm sick of every conversation turning into a depressing nightmare. I know that life if not all sunshine and rainbows, BUT PLEASE, if I listen to you 24/7 then you have to give me a chance and listen to me for once."

190npm,0,2013-02-22,Does anybody here attend UC Davis? I could use some guidance/help. (x-post from /r/UCDavis) ,ucdavisthrowaway,Veterinary,https://www.reddit.com/r/Veterinary/comments/190npm/does_anybody_here_attend_uc_davis_i_could_use/,"Hi, I'm Dave and I'm currently a 3rd year NPB student at UC Davis.
Edit* NPB stands for Neurobiology, Physiology, and Behavior. It is considered the general ""pre-med"" major for undergrads at UCD.

I originally chose this major because I was planning on going into the medical field, but after partaking in the volunteer program at Davis Medical Center as well as after going to a number of animal science interest programs as well as enrolling in classes, I find myself fairly committed to a career in the veterinary field.

If it's at all possible, I would love to be able to attend the vet school here at Davis, and I would like to know what undergrad courses and experiences I am expected to take/have while studying here. This is the resource that I am primarily using as of now:
http://www.vetmed.ucdavis.edu/students/dvm_program/admissions/required_prevet_courses.cfm

Quick summary of courses on that page:
CHE 2ABC, 8AB

PHY 1AB

BIS 2ABC, 101

ABI 102

NPB 101

STA 13 or 100

as well as 12 units each of English and Humanities

So I guess I have a few (maybe more than a few) questions:

Am I not expected to take the CHE118 series, and can just take the 8 series instead? This surprised me because I had often heard that the required courses for vet school were similar to as of those for med school, and apparently the 118 series is required for UCD Med?

Are the requirements for UCD Vet fairly similar to those of other vet schools? For example, I don't want to take the CHE 8 series instead of the 118 and find myself being rejected from other schools because they had expected me to take the 118.

Are there any courses that are not required but are highly recommended/expected for me to take?

Are there any particular internships or volunteer services that I should be applying for or be keeping an eye on?

Is my NPB major okay for my future plans or should I change it? There are a few reasons why I felt that I was okay keeping it:

I've already started taking upper div NPB courses (such as NPB 101L) and I feel that it would be wasteful to not put them towards a degree, as well as the fact that I would have to take additional courses for other majors.

The subject matter of the major seems relevant enough to the veterinary sciences to continue studying it.

From what I hear, animal science majors are required to submit a thesis/undergrad project at the end of their 3rd yr. It seems that because of this it is too late now for me to switch to an animal science major, as well as the additional courses that I would have to take.

Not a question, but any general opinions about the veterinary field as well as information such as job outlook, personal experiences, and job satisfaction would be greatly appreciated. One of the reasons I was dissuaded from medicine was because of a trusted mentor of mine (a general surgeon) telling me frankly that he feels the medical field as it is now is not worth it, and although he does not regret working to get where he is, if he had to do it again there is no way that he would. Honest opinions such as these are extremely welcome.

Thank you SO SO much for taking the time to read through this and help me. I know that I really should talk to a counselor about this manner, but I'm working two jobs to pay for school and I really just have not been able to schedule a time that works for them (within regular day hours). Also, if there are any volunteer programs or internships that are incredibly worth it, I would not mind quitting a job and taking out more private loans to be able to work towards my goal, as I'm passionate about working with animals and getting some more hands-on experience.

I hope this was comprehensible. I apologize for any unclear statements as well as any errors in grammar or format, as I'm not the best at submitting posts and it's kind of late.

Thank you!

Go Aggies!

I have always had a passion for design and creating things that people would be in constant interaction with, but I know that I am neither the most creative nor artistically gifted person, so I chose engineering as a ""safe"" major during school, but never really enjoyed it. I guess currently I am stuck with seeing that I might do something I don't care that much about for the rest of my life, so I am seeing if I can get into something I care about much more.

Some things going for me would be that I took all the CAD courses that were available to me, so I consider myself fairly competent at using the software that was used at school (SolidWorks). I also have a minor in Architecture, which I chose after taking some courses for a communication design minor. The school I went to had a much more stronger Architecture program which is why I switched, and also the courses seemed to deal much more with the interaction between the resultant product and the user, instead of focusing purely on aesthetics. Therefore I can say that I know a bit about the interaction process between designers when working on something together and have somewhat of a design education background. I had to learn quick as I was taking classes with senior/grad level students and had to discuss with the professor and students about my opinions on the finer details of architecture. I also have some experience from my engineering design courses and my Formula SAE team with designing something in CAD and handling the challenges of fabricating those designs into a physical model for use.

In a position where I would be working together with designers consulting and working on CAD models, I think I would do very well. I am a bit lost on how to show it however. I do not have experience with a company in terms of internships that would demonstrate my ability to do so. I do not consider myself having the strongest portfolio, as I just have my engineering CAD projects to show. However, I do think that if asked to work on or create something, I would not have difficulty making anything.

What do you guys think I can do to increase my chances of getting noticed and possibly hired?

Thank you very much."

Read about why my life sucks",canond08,stories,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/18zxd1/story_time_story_time_read_about_why_my_life_sucks/,"So I had an exam today. Nothing major, just Politics. I had stayed up pretty late cramming for it and seeing as I never, and I mean never ever, see the cute girl in one of my classes on Tues/Thurs, I just kinda fell out of bed and put on whatever doesn't smell of death and methane. Now, I live life with no regrets; my only regret thus far was not making a reaction video to 2 girls 1 cup, but this, this decision not to dress to impress beats even that out.

11:45 AM, 21-2-2013 I walk out of the building my class was in and see a booth for the Engineering Student Council. Crap. I know she is involved with them. I decide to walk the long way around to my friend's dorm since we usually eat lunch on these days, and going this longer way would help me to avoid the booth. I stare at the booth for a good 15 seconds scanning the faces before I conclude that this cute girl, let's call her A, isn't there. Good. I'm safe. I then hear a familiar voice getting closer. I turn and look up at another booth, this one is advertising an Energy Expo and as luck would have it, A is running the show and staring right at me. ""fuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuck"" I mutter as I change course to take yet another detour. I hope to myself that she doesn't see me, but I was right smack dab in the middle of the courtyard. Everyone can see me. I decide I'd rather lurk than go eat, so I find a comfy spot in a study lounge and hunker down. At least I don't have to endure that trauma for the rest of today.

12:05 PM, 21-2-2013 I get an invite on Facebook to the aforementioned Energy Expo. But the strange thing is, it's from A. Not directly, but through another organization she's an officer for. Using her moderator powers, she invites me through this account. I decide I'll decline. You know, always keep them wanting more, amiright? Upon further reading, I realize this is a field I am more than interested in, and a chance to meet potential employers so I take it under consideration. ""Spots are limited"", the page says. ""Deadline to RSVP is 2/24/2013."" I decide to make an executive decision by the end of the day to determine whether or not I attend. How will I decide?

1:15 PM, 21-2-2013 I feel the rumbles in my stomach, so I grab some food and move on to a new place with a power outlet. I then get an email from a professor asking me to meet him in his office later that day to discuss a group project. 

1:25 PM, 21-2-2013 I make plans to visit my professor in the Engineering building. I know of a lazy classmate who trawls the halls of the 2nd floor around this time so I come up with a plan to avoid him. Seeing as the 2nd floor is the easiest way into the building and my professor's office is on the 3rd floor, I decide to enter through the service tunnel which leads to the 1st floor entrance, and from there, take the elevator up to the 3rd floor, eliminating the 2nd floor from the equation altogether. It's risky business because the organization room where A spends a lot of free time is right across the hall from the elevators, but since I had seen her at the Energy Expo booth, I deduce that I'll be safe. What could go wrong?

1:45 PM, 21-2-2013 I successfully navigate my way through the service tunnels and arrive at the entrance to the EB. Before I go in, I take a quick glance to make sure there is no movement. Seeing no signs of life, I venture forward. This is the point of no return. I approach the elevator and hit the ""Up"" arrow. Both elevators are on the 3rd floor, and holding. As I'm waiting, I see something out of the corner of my eye. It's A and her red-headed friend, let's call her K, walking right towards me. I let out an audible ""fuck!"" followed by a facepalm. There's no way they couldn't see that. I still look like shit, I'm sweaty from the poor circulation in the service tunnel and I realize my shoe is untied as well. I do, however, have a couple things going for me. I'm a solid 8/10 and very quick on my feet when it comes to making conversation. But on this day, my greatest assets fail me. A whispers something to K upon turning the corner of the staircase, and K walks up to me and hands me a flyer for none other than the Energy Expo. I can feel A staring at us, K and I, and K is talking up the Expo, informing me of free lunch and internship opportunities. It all sounds so good, and then it gets even better/worse when K assures me both her and A will be going. I, still feeling A watching me, freeze up. The only thing that passes my lips is ""cool."" A and K return to the Org room. Had I arrived seconds earlier or seconds later, I could have avoided this embarrassment entirely. How could this possibly get any worse?

1:48 PM, 21-2-2013 I arrive at my professor's office only to find my group mates already in the room. They're complaining that I assign too much work to them and not enough to myself. I explain that I do a lot of the computations and that whenever they bring me anything, it's usually incorrect and I have to fix it or redo it entirely. My professor then yells at me and says I need to be more of a team player or let someone else lead the team. I leave in a state of disarray. I return home, a defeated man. No songs are sung."

I need some perspective, guys.",MKandtheforce,Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Amazon/comments/18zrl6/discussion_youd_think_id_be_happy_right_now_but/,"Today, I was offered a job at the farm.

Anyone who's seen me around here knows that working on a farm is a dream for me. I dream of being able to wake up in the morning, take care of my livestock, and then spend the day working in the fields and growing food, and being able to not rely on anyone else to function. Seeing as I've had no experience farming before, I needed to ease myself in. That's why I decided to become an apprentice on a farm, work there for a season, and decide whether or not farming is truly what I want. So I went to a farm I was really interested in today. I helped out around the barn, took a tour, met the family, and I felt so strongly that *this was it*. I was offered a job and told to email her back with a sort of confirmation, saying that I understood the commitment and agreed to try it out for three months. She even told me that is was possible for me to ""have"" a cow after a month-- she could arrange it so that I could borrow one, which is the ideal situation for someone who's as eager as me to learn about dairy.

Anyway, I came home and told my parents that she'd like me to start on April 1st. Contrary to what I was hoping, neither one was happy for me. They told me I should just volunteer on a farm instead, even though I want experience as a day-to-day farmer instead of just a whenever-I-can sort of one. I tried that last year, and I worked on the farm a total of two times. I told Mom that I didn't want to just be a volunteer-- I need to *live* it. They especially weren't happy that I'd only earn $200 a month, even though it includes room, board, and food. I do have a lot of bills (car insurance, school, credit cards), but I see myself being able to use it. Sure, I won't be able to spend money on myself as much, but why would I need to? It's a different experience to be out in the boonies, farming hard every day instead of working in a place where all people do is shop. I wouldn't be tempted to buy sushi from the grocery store every day, and I wouldn't even be on the computer as much to buy things online. I plan only on using the internet for blogging purposes. They still don't think it's enough, though. They know I'm bad with money. I suggested the idea of sending them my whole paycheck and having them take care of expenses, and request money when I need it, but it didn't seem to make an impression on them.

It's so important for me to have their support in this. I've always been the type to *need* her mother's approval. It's even one of the major sources of depressive episodes when I suspect that I don't have or wouldn't have her approval. But I need to be able to farm. I do earn more as a cashier (about $200/week versus $50/week), but I wouldn't be spending frivolously on the farm, which is something I do now as a cashier. I'd be gaining experience I need, which will ultimately help me own a farm one day, since there's an FDA-sponsored loan that requires three years' experience and no necessary down payment. I'd finally figure out if full-time farming is right for me. My mom told me that the apprenticeship situation sounds like slave labor, since I get paid so little-- but isn't it the same sort of deal as an unpaid internship?! I see it as something beautiful, whereas my parents think it's a scam or something I shouldn't focus on.

A lot of times, I feel like she thinks I'm not even interested in farming, and that it's another manic pipedream. I've wanted this for well over a year. I don't think I can take another summer of not being able to live the simplistic, industrious life on a homestead. I don't want to sit at home, eating pasta while my family enjoys factory-farmed chicken, getting fat while watching HGTV, and wanting to cry every time someone yells at me at the checkout. I want to live life that's full and vibrant and colorful, not fake and empty like how I've been living for the past few years.

I don't know what to do, guys. If you were so kind as to read this whole thing, what should I do? If I plunge into this without my mom's blessing, I'm worried I'll lose my sanity. If I stay home, I can only see myself staying miserable for another year. I'm not ranting, nor am I just trying to blow off steam. I legitimately just want a new perspective on this. What do I do, guys?! D:"

I hate him and myself.,[deleted],confessions,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/18zps1/ive_been_sleeping_with_my_old_boss_for_three/,"I was working an internship at a company and when it was nearing its end I was having a hellish time finding another job. Desperate, I accepted my boss's proposition - though it was vague I got the gist. To make it worse I had just reconnected with an old boyfriend and though we weren't sure of our ""status"" or whatever, it was pretty obvious we were falling for each again. Fast forward three months and I still hadn't been able to find a job. The constant rejection and weight of what I was doing left me numb and lethargic. I finally admitted what was going on to my boyfriend and now I think I've lost him forever. I can't bear the thought of not having him but at the same time I don't have an alternative means of making rent or paying my loans. The way he looked at me made me feel worse than I've ever felt in my life and I've felt sick to my stomach ever since. I know he'll never be able to look at me the same way again and I just don't know what to do. Regardless of whether he comes back or not, telling someone made the reality of the situation - the reality that I had been suppressing - all too apparent. It lit a fire under my ass to find a job - any job - so that I can get away but it's frustrating because I feel so so terrible. I guess I'm not really looking for advice or anything, I just needed to tell someone. "

When I first got my license, I took my savings and bought a [1999 Ford Taurus](http://i.imgur.com/NqJgu6w.jpg) for $1700 I think it was. this was back in 2010. I loved the car. It was quick and strong, not too many troubles. Bad alternator once and a few minor fixes here and there. not too bad. I wish I still had it now actually.


Then of course, [This](http://i.imgur.com/C6UNmcK.jpg) would happen to me. Some lady pulls out in front of me while i'm going 60mph. Worst thing to happen to me. I was devastated. Physically I was fine. but I lost my first car.
It held up like a champ though.
[album of the accident](http://imgur.com/a/jks9n)

So after the accident, in about 3-4 days I had purchased a new car for about $5,000 with all of the insurance money they gave me. which is what i am currently driving now. [2002 Mazda Millenia](http://imgur.com/a/Qa7sV), This car is alright. It's quick, looks beautiful whatever. It has an assload of problems though. The list goes on, I have spent almost $4,500 in repairs. It really is a junker and it needs to go soon.


So now you know my back story, here is what is happening currently.

The chance of me getting a good internship at **unspoken power plant** over the summer and following Fall semester is pretty good. So I will hopefully make bank. I am looking for a new car obviously. And this is where you will come in. I need help deciding what to get.

I am looking really new. I don't want anything older than 2010, and that's pushing it. I need something that will last me through college and until I have a really steady job and life. I think $20,000 is a spending cap, obviously the cheaper the better though. 

So what do you think?

192q4c,6,2013-02-23,My brother [17] has friends over often and the noise is driving my crazy because they are loud and right above my [f26] room (I'm living at home). Its driving me crazy,ShittyLifeThrowAway,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/192q4c/my_brother_17_has_friends_over_often_and_the/,"**TL;DR: is it appropriate for teenage brother and his friends to hang out often at home (xbox; right above my room) and be loud/obnoxious? or am I just crazy that it's driving me nuts? what should I do?** *extremely sorry for wall of text*

**Why my ass is at home:** I am in a tight financial situation where I had to take on an unpaid internship-like position, and I was invited by my very enthusiastic parents (and brother) to live with them while I finish this internship. Actually, I took the position *because* they said they'd let me live at home. Sometimes though, I feel like a burden and don't know when to say if something is bothering me and when to not. I also have some anger issues, so sometimes I question my annoyance and wonder if its reasonable. 

**For the sake of context,** because we're an Indian family, it is more of a norm that I'm living with my parents than it is in a western context and I don't think that my parents think of me as a burden. In fact, if I told my family how I feel they would most likely be offended. My mom always kept my room the way it was, even though they moved a couple of times (they would set up my room on their own); she refused to make it a guest room or something, even though I said that she could since I didn't live there any more (in the past). According to them it's their duty and pleasure to help me out, and despite the financial set back, I am on a good carrer path so it's not like I am a no-good loser with no prospect of ever moving out.

**The issue**: the problem is that I have a 17 yo brother with an xbox in a room directly above mine (minimal noise barrier) and he has just made a bunch of friends. They all have those annoying deep voices that you can't cancel out with ear plugs, and they all howl at the game or whatever it is they're doing up there like you can imagine any group of young men would do. Let's just say, they're not a quiet bunch - it is essentially a party when his buddies come over. *Context for brother:* we're not a normal sibling pair; I am almost a decade older than him and I almost co-raised him with my parents. So he looks up to me and we barely fight. If my parents need to have any talks with him, they usually try to do it through me, since he listens to me.

**I said no to everyday parties**: since his birthday sleep-over weekend (yes, it lasted the entire weekend) recently, it seemed like he brought home friends from school every day for another week or so before I got tired of it and told him that he can't have a party everyday - it is unreasonable. I told him it would be okay to do once a week or so, but that I can't tolerate the noise every day. I suggested that he and his friends can go to a mall, or to another friend's house or something as well, instead of always just coming home here and being incredibly loud right above my room.

**I mentioned it to my mom,** and she seemed a little uncomfortable about it. I asked her if I was being unreasonable and she gave me a not-very-convining response along the lines of ""don't worry about it, you are his big sister, you can tell him to stop making noise"". But it could be that she just didn't want to tell me off - my parents usually take my side as I am usually the more reasonable sibling, and also because I am the older one. Also, my parent's room is on the other side of the house, down on the main floor so I don't think she realizes just how much noise comes to my room. I think my dad would understand - he's the loner, loves his quiet, which is where I get it form, but he's not here for a month or so, so I don't really know who to turn to to in/validate my concenrs.

**What drove me crazy tonight:** It was okay for a while, but it has started happening again. Right now for instance: today, it's Friday night and at around 1:30AM there were at least 3 grown boys stomping around and being loud in the attic above me. This had been going on since after school, then they went to watch a movie so I had some peace for about 3 hours, and now they're back. While it really grated me, I put my ear plugs on and dealt with it during the day (for a full 3pm-9pm) - because it was Friday evening, and it was fair enough. But I just couldn't take it anymore. I almost wanted to cry and I could feel my anger rising with each noise. I just wanted it to stop, I also wanted to sleep soon and there are no signs of calming down from above. My brother's attitude was basically: *its Friday night, deal with it* (we had a slightly heated phone convo). And while he did quiet down out of respect (which I realize is a big deal) I could still hear them - it's impossible in the quiet night not to. So I just left the house - I am at my bf's house ATM (he's away but left me a key in case I ever wanted to come over).

**My question**: I keep thinking, I am living in their home for free. Do I have a right to say anything? But, they invited me to live there and promised me a place to stay, so shouldn't that also mean peace and quiet? Is it normal to have noisy teenagers spend hours and hours at someone's place; I mean, I don't think they even recognize the concept of inside voices. I am just confused because it is so incredibly annoying for me, but my brother doesn't seem to get it, and neither does my mom I don't think - which leads me to think maybe I'm just being unreasonable. Maybe I should get a personal loan and just move out. But then I'll just look like a drama queen: ""shut up or I'm leaving"". I can't decide how to deal with this problem. Halp."

Sorry in advance - I'm halfway through writing this now and its already huge!

Some context - I'm 23, she will be 23 next month. I'm in the final year of a Masters degree, with good job prospects on graduation and she is already working in a good job. We began dating in December 2010. For the past 11 or so months, there have been about 200 miles between us (across water) so a plane journey apart (she had to move to get a job, but I always said I would follow her).

So we met online, everything was great - I totally fell for her from very early on, but she was my first REAL girlfriend that I had real feelings for, and it was (still is!) a learning process for me.
From fairly early on (I would guess from maybe 1 year in) she would fairly regularly try to bring up ""our future"" in the conversation - getting engaged and stuff. At the start, I told her right off the bat that I was pretty uncomfortable with it, and would rather she didn't, because I wasn't planning it any time soon (in my mind's eye - I could see myself getting engaged around 27, married a year or 2 after).

She reluctantly (disappointinly, not angrily) accepted that and wouldn't bring it up as much after that.

Last summer (2012) I got the opportunity to work abroad for the summer. It was still only 200 or so miles between us (but in the opposite direction) but I didn't think it would be any different than before, though I did know it would be great for my resume. So I went, and was staying with a very large (25+) group of other interns, because I was always either working or hanging out / partying with those guys, I really didn't have time to miss her so much, but I know she missed me like crazy. I was away for 3 months, and I guess after 2 months, I told her that I think we should take a break.

This was due to a number of things. Firstly, I just didn't feel the same about her after being away for so long and also that every time we went on a trip somewhere for a few days, we would always have a blazing row - and it was always over absolutely nothing, but no one would back down. I'm sure you guys have been there. We were usually as stubborn as each other, but to be fair I think I was worse. I also said to her (please don't hate me!) that she had put on a fair amount of weight since we started dating, which was true - and I have always kept myself in decent shape but it was having an impact on how I saw her so I told her.

Breaking up was incredibly hard for me, at the time, she was visiting me and we were in a museum. I had been thinking about this and I told myself I would tell her today, and I actually started crying in front of her in the museum thinking about it. I then totally cried my eyes out as we talked about it later on in my hotel room - as did she. She didn't want to do it, but I paid for an early ticket home for her and she left and I wouldn't let her change my mind despite the fact I was absolutely heartbroken myself and I did it!

So within a fortnight, we were talking again, and I was telling her not that I had made a mistake, but that I saw this as a chance for us BOTH to work on our flaws or things that caused friction in the relationship. She even went and joined a gym for me and took up some hobbies (because I said she relied on me too much to do stuff and she didn't really have any hobbies of her own which I feel was also true) like baking and some craft things. We talked every day and eventually agreed that when I returned home, we would go away together for a few days and try to fix us.

We went away and it was fantastic, we got on so well and it was like we were closer than ever at the end. That brings us up to around 5 months ago.

I'm back home again, she's still working away and I'm now started back at uni. I know she is still missing me but god damn even though I know she wants to talk, I just can't bring myself to talk to her on the phone - I really want to talk to her, but its like I can't be bothered if it isnt in person. It's so hard to explain, I didn't do it anywhere near as often as I should have, and I didn't put enough money aside to spend on visiting her.

This kept going on right through Christmas and up until last week. We hadn't talked in like 3 weeks because of another stupid argument where we wouldn't back down. Eventually she said she needed a break and couldn't do the long distance thing anymore. I asked her was there more to it than she was telling me (ie. had she met someone else who was making her feel like this) - she told me no, but that if someone (though she hadn't anyone in mind) asked her out on a date, she might say yes.

OK so you are up to date. I should add that since before Christmas, the way I have felt about her has changed. I don't know why, but I suddenly stopped being afraid of commitment to her, and I KNEW that I wanted to marry this girl.

It's so hard to understand why I can feel like this yet not take the time to Skype or call her or whatever, but honestly, I can't imagine my life without her now. She means everything to me and I go to bed every night thinking about her. I even told her this a while back - that I knew I used to not like talking about this stuff, but now I can, because I knew she was the one for me.

So yea, that's where we stand - we are currently broken up, but I want her to realise that I am completely committed to making things work with her, and that I love her more than anything. She is fairly adamant that I can't change her mind, but I'm hoping I can. Also worth noting is that since we went away after I came back from abroad, we only saw eachother less than 10 times, for no more than maybe 4 or 5 days at a time, usually less.

I wish I could have moved over to her sooner, but I had already committed to an extra year on my degree when she accepted (and I was completely behind her) her job across the water, because I was planning to go there with her after.

TL;DR

Was with my ex over 2 years, just over 1 year in we had to start long distance because of lack of work at home - only saw eachother every 4-6 weeks or less for a couple of days. Been like that ever since and I really didn't pull my weight during that time.

After a ""break"", we then spent some time away to try and ""rekindle"" our relationship and it was amazing. We became closer than ever until she had to leave again.

After that I went back to my old ways of not putting in the effort, but at the same time, I realised that this was the girl I wanted to spend my life with and I wanted to change.

I started trying to put more effort in, but it wasn't enough and eventually she told me that she couldn't do the long distance anymore because my lack of effort almost made it like she wasn't in a relationship anymore.
I had always been planning to move to her when I finish University in about 4 months time.

Please help me get her back!! :("

I've had an up and down couple few years.  I was doing really good about 12 months ago.  I had been working out and eating well.  Down to about 170 and building some solid muscle.  Got caught up with school, internships, and then I was unemployed for a while without access to a gym.  Then the stress of moving and starting a new job.  Anyway, I'm trying to get back on the right track.  

Plan is basically to count calories ~ 1800 a day during workout days, 1600 on off days.  I may do some keto, but probably not strictly since it's hard to plan ahead for work sometimes. Try to get to the small but decent gym and work 3 days a week and start riding my bike to commute when it gets warmer ~5 miles each way if I dont take the train part way.

Desired weight goal by May 19 is 180 lbs for about 2 lbs per week.  I have a halfway goal of 15 lbs lost by the end of March and an interim goal of looking sexy for my friends wedding in late April.  Long term goal is about 165-175 with additional muscle mass.

My main challenge is that I am not a morning person and have to leave the house by 7:15 to get to work on time.  I hate going to the gym when I'm tired, but I'm hoping springtime and eating better will help.  

My motivation is to look and feel healthier.  I'm not sure how stable my job situation is and I want to be able to put my best foot forward every day no matter what happens."

194zhk,1,2013-02-24,Why is it so hard to do what is in your best interest?,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/194zhk/why_is_it_so_hard_to_do_what_is_in_your_best/,"So I (18 F) am seeing this guy (20) long distance for about 2 months now. We met at a party in December during winter break and were inseparable until he left to go back to college. For the first couple of weeks things were going ok (long distance isn't fun but it was bearable because we would Skype and talk regularly). 

But lately he's been so busy with his classes and his internship and just his life in general. It doesn't bother me that he's busy it bothers me that he will often forget to text me or when we agree to Skype he usually forgets and goes to bed. I figured I could put up with this because he promised he'd drive up to see me for a weekend but when he found out he had to go to an event for his job and couldn't come see me he didn't tell me, he waited for me to ask what was going on which I had a really big problem with because we agreed that communication was super important. I got over it until he did it again when I asked him when he'd be home for his spring break because we made plans for it but he told me ""his parents cancelled his flight"" (sounds really stupid to me). 

I feel like it's just disappointment after disappointment anymore. I definitely deserve someone who will be there for me and who will be honest with me and not always ignore me. I know, logically, that I can and should have a better relationship than this; that this is torture if it leads me to feeling like I have to be constantly smoking just to be able to deal with the stress. I don’t want to give him up but he’s hurting me a lot and the fucked up thing is I can see that so easily but I keep telling myself that it’s deeper, there’s more to this than what it seems. He tells me his feelings never changed, but how can I feel that if he never bothers to follow through on things he tells me? 

This is really hard. I'm trying to talk to him to see how we can deal with this problem but he never has any time I don't really know what to do, I don't want to just let this amazing person walk right out of my life but I'm beginning to feel like I have no choice. Any thoughts would be appreciated, thank you anyone who read this I'm sorry it's long!

194c09,70,2013-02-24,How my grandmother and I became fuck buddies,incest_confessions,incest,https://www.reddit.com/r/incest/comments/194c09/how_my_grandmother_and_i_became_fuck_buddies/,"Just over seven years ago, my mom passed from an aneurysm. My father left when I was a kid (I'm an only child), and neither my mother or I heard from him since. Since I was 16 at the time of my mother's passing, my choices were to go into foster care, or find my next of kin. Luckily, my grandmother (Corinne) was aware of the situation, and she took me in. At that time, Corinne was 55. Prior to the day she took me in, I barely knew of her.

My mother and Corinne didn't have much of a relationship. Corinne gave up my mother for adoption at the age of 17. From what I've been told, she took a year off of school to avoid embarrassing her family, and was forced to give up my mom. My mom was supposed to become ancient history until she started seeking Corinne out in her teens.

Long story short, when my mother found Corinne, she never received any replies. She did get in touch with my grandfather, though, which is how I know any of this. Although Corinne never responded, my mom kept her in the loop with holiday cards. She never gave up on her. I guess Corinne felt a sense of obligation to me, since my mother was always reaching out to her.

I was junior in High School when Corinne took me in. She was rarely home. She worked full-time as a VP at some regional ad agency. I mostly kept to myself, too. I had my own car—brand new. There was money left over from my mom's life insurance pay out, as well money from the sale of her condo. Although I had quite a bit of cash at such a young age, I stayed pretty responsible.

So, before going to college, I lived with Corinne for about a year and a half. During that time, there was nothing sexual. In fact, we rarely talked. I'm pretty confident, in that time before college, we never cooked a single meal or ate together. We had our own lives, and we merely lived together; we were like roommates. And, like roommates, we brought home partners. Neither of us said anything about that.

While I was away at college is when Corinne and I started getting close. Although she was in her late 50s, she was very tech savvy because of the industry she worked in, and we emailed pretty regularly. Later on, we started texting. We talked mostly about my school, and without really realizing it, she became my long-distance mentor. I was a marketing undergrad, and, really, her mentoring was invaluable.

In my third year of college, Corinne invited me back to her place for a week for the holidays. That was the first time we really celebrated anything. Previous holidays, I always stayed in the dorms. I never had too much trouble finding dates, so not really having a home to go back to was never an issue. But I was happy that Corinne invited me. I was applying for some internship positions, and I wanted to discuss them with her.

The first night I was at Corinne's, we had dinner together for the first time ever. She actually cooked. She made seared ahi tuna with mango chutney, a kale salad, and some sweet potato dish. It was amazing. She also served me white wine, as I had just turned 21 few months prior (that puts her at 60).

We were getting a little buzzed, but we kept it pretty professional. Our relationship was more like good coworkers, than any sort of family. She was vastly superior at drinking than I was, and I knew I wasn't going to keep at the pace she was going, so I thanked her for a fun night, and I headed to bed.

In the middle of the night, I woke to up to pee. As I sat in the dark of the hallway bathroom, I heard sounds coming from down the hall—likely Corinne's room. I didn't recall what time it was, and I was still a little drunk, but I listened and realized she had a partner over. I had seen men walk out of the house some mornings when I lived with her, but I had never actually caught her in the act (not that I ever cared to). Once I finished in the bathroom, my curiosity got the best of me, and I wanted to see if I could catch a glimpse of anything.

I crept down the hall, stumbling a little, but the noises of sex became louder with each step. Corinne's door was open a crack, and the lights were on. And, what I saw was amazing. She was riding reverse cowgirl on some guy on the bed who I couldn't really see. I watched, fascinated. Never had I really seen her as an object of desire, but I had to admit, at the age of 60, she looked pretty good. It was obvious she got some work done, since there was no way a 60 year old could look as tight as she did.

I'm not sure how long I stood there, but I suddenly noticed that she was looking at me, or at least in my direction. I quickly escaped back into my room. Watching Corinne fuck some guy was extremely arousing. I fapped and went to bed.

The next morning I woke up to sounds in the kitchen. Corinne and, I assume, the guy from last night were having coffee and poached eggs. I ended up joining them for breakfast.

Corinne introduced me as a college student she was giving room and board. I went along with the story. Later, it turns out, no one knew she ever had a daughter, let alone a grandson, so I guess she wanted to keep that part of her life hidden. The guy she was fucking was a coworker, looked to be in his late twenties, maybe early thirties. They talked about work, and we talked about what I was studying in college. The casual nature of the entire thing was strangely comfortable. I liked it.

As the week wore on, neither Corinne and I talked about me seeing her fuck that guy. It hadn't done anything to our relationship, but each night I fapped to that image of her. On Christmas Eve, she and I drank into early Christmas morning. She noticed the time, and she plainly asked if I wanted my gift. I had no idea I was getting one, and I apologized for not getting her one. She laughed and said that she wasn't going to get me one either, but she went out and got it the other night.

I opened it. It was the newest iPhone to replace my previous generation one. I thanked her, and she said that since we're texting regularly, I should have the latest tech. I thanked her again, and then, out of nowhere, she brought up the night I saw her having sex. Asked me why I watched for so long. I sat there, suddenly sober, and after what felt like an eternity, I said that I couldn't pull away. I told her I didn't mean any disrespect, and that I was still a little drunk. She laughed, and said she didn't care. She admitted that she accidentally saw me once, too, years ago when I was a senior in high school. I'm pretty sure I turned every shade of red. She laughed again.

I was pretty out of my element, but I guess I didn't know Corinne well enough to see that she was testing the waters with me. Also, she was pretty drunk. She started asking me about my sexual adventures in college, and we essentially swapped stories about our experiences. Clearly she was winning in terms of crazy sex stories.

Following that, she said she was going to call over that guy again, if I didn't mind, and I told her to go for it. I excused myself to go to the bathroom. When I came back to say goodnight, she said the guy couldn't make it out tonight. She had a few other people she could call, but some of them were either out of town, or too far away. I'm not sure what possessed me to say this, but I said, “I'm here.”

To which she replied, “Alright.”

She grabbed my arm and took me into the hallway. Without warning, she pushed me up against the wall, and we were making out. Honestly, at this point in my life, I was in my early 20s, and I was pretty much hungry for sex all the time, but I was taken aback by how carnal her sexual desire was; she had a need, and she was going to get it.

We groped each other and kissed in the hall for a bit before getting to her room. She started to undress, and I followed suit. Underneath her white blouse and pinstripe pencil skirt, she was wearing a matching set of black bra and boy shorts. She was breath taking. She unclasped her bra, and her breasts barely gave into gravity; they clearly weren't real, but they still seemed pretty natural.

She pushed me back onto her bed. I had stripped down to my underwear. She tore them off of me and started to give me a blow job. I had to focus extremely hard not to cum right into her mouth. After a while, she told me to lay down in the middle of her gigantic bed. She pulled off her boy shorts, and threw her leg over me. She hovered over my cock and pointed at the lube on the side of her bed. I handed it to her, and she opened it and let it drip onto my cock. It was the warming kind, and she rubbed it on. Her long, white nails grazed my skin, and I laid there in ecstasy.

After a few seconds, she tossed the lube container aside, and she used the remaining lube on her hand to wet herself. She grabbed my cock and slowly lowered herself onto it. All of this was effortless for her. I watched my dick get swallowed up by her surprisingly tight pussy. She moaned loudly, as if she finally got was she was needing all night. She kept a slow and steady speed, eyes closed, breathing heavily.

As I laid there, I immediately knew this was the best sex I had ever had, and maybe could ever have. I've had many partners over the past several years, but most lay motionless like a starfish, and others were simply not as good as Corinne—my biological grandmother.

She was picking up the pace. I followed her rhythm, and I thrust, too. I could tell she was really enjoying it, and I knew that I wouldn't last much longer. I announced that I was going to cum soon, and she all she did was grind even harder. I held out as long as I could until I just completely let go. At this point, she was screaming, but I could barely hear anything. I was literally cumming the hardest and most I had ever cum in my entire life. I probably shot 3 or 4 huge loads, but I felt my cock contract many times after that. Corinne had slowed down to a stop, with her head back. I couldn't see her face, but she had one hand on my abdomen, and one on my knee. She let out a long, deep sigh, and looked down at me. She told me it was great, and asked if I wanted to sleep next to her. I said okay.

I woke up around noon, naked in her Corinne's bed. She was gone. I put on my underwear, and I headed out. I could hear her in the kitchen. I came out to greet her, and she was cooking breakfast. I proceeded to tell her that last night was one of the best nights of my life. She flashed a smile while plating me up some bacon and fruit. We didn't talk too much while we ate, but I think that's because we really needed those calories.

After clearing the dishes, she told me to go take a shower in her shower, and I did. A minute in, she joined me, said, without any hesitation, “I want to fuck again. And I don't want to wait.” She grabbed my cock, and started to rub it slowly. It was a little sensitive from the night before, but I was hard in no time. She had a pretty big shower, and she leaned over and grabbed a rail. She put her hand between her legs, and used her fingers to spread her pussy. I stuck the head of my dick into her pussy, and I slowly rocked my way back and forth deeper and deeper into her. She still had some of my cum from the night before, and I didn't have trouble getting in.

The steam from the shower hung thick as I fucked Corinne from behind. This time we were sober, and I felt like I had a lot more control. She had even more energy than the night before, and I swear she was pounding back into me harder than I was slamming into her. I watched her has she held onto that rail, and her body kept a steady beat.

Since I wasn't as drunk this time, I was able to see her body more clearly, although this time from the back. She was fit. The only sign of aging that was apparent was her spine, where her bones were clearly defined. Her ass was tight, but I'm sure she's probably had a lift. Her skin wasn't youthful, but it was nowhere near elderly. Her arms were strong, and it's pretty clear that she works out reguarly.

It wasn't long before she I could feel her pussy start to tighten around me. She was breathing heavy, and grabbed my hand that was on her waist, and put it on her tit. She told me to pinch her nipples as hard as I could. I was hunched over her like a dog, squeezing and pulling her nipples as we collided into each other. The sudden demands were unbelievably hot, and I knew I was going to cum soon. I could tell she was just around the corner, too. She started screaming first, and I grunted a few times as I built up to my orgasm. I came hard as her pussy squeezed my cock over and over again.

We separated. She immediately knelt down before me. She took my softening cock into her mouth, and cleaned it up. I stood there as she gently pulled back her head, careful not to overstimulate my sensitive dick. She looked up at me with this satisfied look in her eyes. Without saying a word, she started to clean me, and then I returned the favor.

Before I left back to school, we fucked many, many more times. She always took the lead, but she wasn't a selfish lover. Since that amazing week, she's flew me out every other week to fuck and talk about my career, until I graduated. By then, she had gotten me a job at her agency, and I moved back in with her. We kind of went back to our old routine of little contact, as we focused on our jobs, and we still kept other partners. However, at least once a week, we fucked like animals, and many times, we've fucked at the office after hours.

I know Corinne's my grandmother, but I don't see her that way. I mostly see her as my mentor, and my sex life, outside of her, has improved because of her. But, I have to admit, no one has come close to beating her at sex."

I'd love your advice on what I should do with my finances.  (I hope this isn't a repost, I've kept my eyes open but not seen any posts that fit my situation)

I'm currently a single 21 year old junior in college and I'm on track to graduate in May 2014.  I'm so grateful to have an academic scholarship that covers most of my living/tuition/book/fees expenses and generous parents that control a college fund for my food, healthcare, and remaining learning expenses.  Overall, I am only spending money on entertainment, some food, and incidental expenses (like gifts, clothing, and personal care items).

I have 3 majors and I'm very involved on campus so I'm only able to work part-time.  My income is not always reliable, but I usually make about $100 biweekly.  I shop very frugally.

I am unsure about where I will be this summer, but I am hoping to work full-time at some sort of paid internship or student job.  I have applied several places but cannot really predict what my cash inflow will be from May-August.

Currently, I have:

* one college credit card (1200 unsecured limit, I only have ever spent up to 300/month), paid off in full every month with no problem
* 1300 between checking and savings (both give essentially 0.00% interest so I am unhappy with this)
* no student debt or debt of any kind, and no real anticipated debt

I'm considering:

* How much money should I set aside as an investment/savings?
* Should I consider a Certificate of Deposit?  Rates seem to be pretty low at the moment, but the security is attractive.
* What about an IRA?  I've considered starting a Roth IRA but am worried about the liquidity of the investment, possible risks that would be involved, and high minimums.  I may need access to my funds for expenses this summer.
* Is Vanguard the best way to go for Roth IRAs?  Seems to be the preference around here.
* Should I wait until next school year to start or try to begin saving now?

I study business so I have a general understanding of investment and business transactions.  I'm just in need of a little guidance.

Thanks so much for your help!"

The TL;DR of my very, very long post is at the bottom.** If you’re someone who prefers more background details before giving out advice, or can skim and absorb a lot of info quickly, please be my guest (I would be more than happy if you were able to pick out relevant details I may have overlooked). Be warned that it is quite long, though. Anyway, here goes…

I go to a small, private, liberal-arts college on the West Coast (obviously a throwaway account). Three weeks ago, my girlfriend and I broke up, but I've already successfully asked out someone (I'll call her Rachel) who I've had a big crush on for a long time. Rachel and I are both from the New York area, we met here in college about two years ago. We were involved in the same organization on campus, and though we were perfectly cordial to one another, we weren't all that close. Ironically, we started getting closer after both of us left the organization we were involved in, once: a) I got an internship in Bangkok last summer, where she used to live, and I asked her for advice via Facebook about living there, and b) we ran into each other at the start of the school year and found out that we were both from New York. Then, over winter break this year, she contacted me out of the blue to come hang out with her at an art exhibit in the city, and contacted me again after school started this semester to ask me out to lunch. I've really enjoyed hanging out with her and getting to know her; she's a really interesting person (in a very good way), we have quite a lot of common interests, and we've always had really good conversations. She's also gorgeous, which made her a natural choice for the Next Girl To Ask Out. 

So after taking two weeks of respite to get over my breakup, I texted her to see if she wanted to grab some lunch, the ulterior motive being that I wanted to meet with her face-to-face to ask her out. During our lunch, we had another really good conversation, and as we were walking out, I asked her out, and she said yes. 

The thing is, though, is that while she said yes, it came with a curious twist. I think it's worth it to replay the whole exchange as close to word-for-word as I can:

Marcus: So (name of ex-girlfriend) and I broke up three weeks ago.

Rachel: Aw, I'm sorry to hear that. 

Marcus: Anyway, the think I wanted to ask you is whether you would like to go out some time.

Rachel: Yeah, sure! Just let me know whenever you want to grab a drink or something!

Marcus: Great! What are you doing this weekend?

Rachel: I'm sorry, I'm busy this weekend, but I'm definitely free next weekend!

Marcus: Awesome, I'll text you before next weekend then.

Now, before you jump to conclusions, there are some things I should point out. 

*1) It’s very possible that her excuse that she isn't free this weekend is completely legitimate. She's a photographer that does a lot of really complicated work in a studio requiring a lot of time and planning. She's also pledging a sorority this semester, and is very involved in an entrepreneurship group on campus. 

*2) I realize that she may have felt pressured to say yes simply because I told her I broke up with my girlfriend, and especially because I prefaced how I actually asked her out with that info. I could be wrong, however. Regardless, I probably should have found a way to work it into the conversation during our lunch earlier, but I couldn't/didn't. (Sorry for going on a bit of a tangent there.) 

*3) When she told me that she is busy this “weekend,” I think it’s safe to assume that she meant Friday night and Saturday, and not Sunday, right? (This question will turn out to be important for the reasons given below). 

So, my question is: should I invite her to come watch the Oscars with me tomorrow night? Now, normally, I would just ask without a second's hesitation; I'm looking for a long-term relationship, and if another girl I had asked out wasn't game for something like this, then I'd have a pretty good indication that she wasn't quite relationship material. But here's the thing: I’ve grown to really like this girl and I think we would be great together. I don't want to make her feel rushed, since she seems to have more casual expectations for what dating between us is going to look like (the ""grab a drink"" suggestion she gave me when I asked her out took me by surprise), and especially since we haven't actually been on a first date yet. 

**TL;DR: Last week, three weeks after my now ex-girlfriend and I broke up, I ask out someone who I've developed a big crush on in the last year or so, and she says yes. But when I ask her what she is doing this weekend (by which I assume she understood as Friday night and Saturday), she tells me she is busy, but that she is free next weekend. Should I ask her to come watch the Oscars with me tomorrow (Sunday) night, even though we haven’t been on a proper first date yet? Or should I avoid making her feel rushed and give her some space?**

Again, I would greatly appreciate any replies within 24 hours. "

I was genuinely interested in both audit and tax and didn't have the opportunity to complete an internship in public accounting since I wanted to study abroad for a portion of the summer before my senior year. Luckily, I found a real estate management firm offering an in-house accounting job that let me work whatever days I could outside of traveling. While it looked good on a resume, it didn't help me get any closer to a decision between audit and tax. 

Now, I understand that an internship in public accounting is (supposed to be) designed to shed some light on a prospective career path, but how can students possibly know that an alternative path isn't better for them in the long run? It seems unrealistic to expect college students to know what they want to spend several years (or more) of their lives doing. 

The firm I've been working for since graduation has a program that I think more should offer. We allow employees to spend 3-6 months in one of our other departments (we're split between audit, tax, and systems) if they elect to. The number of open spots is obviously limited each year and only certain employees (generally staff and some seniors) are eligible since client needs come first, but it's still a unique opportunity to offer.

I'm a 3rd year CS student here and I feel like even though i've been doing fine in all of my CS courses, I am no where near ready to take on an internship or begin working.  Is this because I don't do much coding besides whats assigned in my CS courses? Or is it because I will take most of my upper div courses my senior year?

Also, I am familiar with the languages they teach here at UCSB (Python, C, C++, Java) but not much else.  Should I begin to teach myself some other languages on my own (some HTML maybe?) and if so, where would be a good place to start?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!"

I recently graduate from my school and I’m currently living in Beijing. It’s gonna sound a little cliche but I came back to china for my girlfriend to give it a try. 

I came back just before the spring festival and from January to February I tried to apply to as many jobs as I could. 
My background is system and network administration. I am a recently graduated guy so my experience is not top notch yet, I have only 2 years of experience I gathered in internships. 

I see many talks about English teaching jobs but never about IT, so far I didn’t get many positive response and it seems like companies are only looking for super mega expert with 7 years of experience. I guess I can also look for an internship to extend my knowledge but it seems that this area is limited to Chinese. Maybe I’m looking at the wrong place ? 

I used several website such as : 51Jobs, Zhaoping, indeedcn but only big companies are listed.
 To the IT guys working in China, any advice to get a job/internship in China ?

196kud,2,2013-02-25,"I Am, Simply, A Shitty Excuse For a Human Being",[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/196kud/i_am_simply_a_shitty_excuse_for_a_human_being/,"I have a lot of pent-up self-loathing that has been building inside of me for years now. It has probably culminated in mild depression, but that's not what Im here to talk about I guess.

Seriously, I'm just a really shitty person. As a bit of background to all of this, I come from a relatively wealthy family and suburb in midwestern America, and have been handed pretty much everything in life. I'm white, male, at least marginally intelligent and come from a loving and supportive family that saved enough money to send me to a very prestigious midwestern engineering school. I was able to get into this program because I excelled in a special program at my high school, and I got into that program because I was in another set of smaller, focused programs in middle school, which I got into because...the cycle repeats all the way down to 1st grade. I was in small classes with great teachers who probably coddled us a bit. I have had two internships at a great engineering firm because a family member knows the owner. I worked as a caddy at a country club for 7 years, and got preferential treatment for many of them because my dad worked for the same caddymaster when he was a teenager. I have had to work for almost nothing in my life. My family isn't super rich and I'm not blaming them for this at all, nor am I begrudging the opportunities themselves. I just fucking hate how I have dealt with and pissed away everything I have been given. [Very first-world-problem, I know, I know. If already want to punch myself in the face on a near-constant basis, I can't imagine how much somebody from a less-privileged background than I would despise me]

Anyway, I'm just going to tear into the reasons why I suck.

**Laziness:** This is a huge one. I didn't work nearly as hard before I came to college as I should have, in school or with my personal appearance/health/fitness. There isn't much else to say about this one, laziness is just self-explanatory. It seeps into everything I do. 

**Shitty Attitude Toward Work:** I have had a couple of jobs in my life, and I have been woefully ineffective in both. As a caddy, I was overweight, didn't hustle much, and really didnt like the job. I didn't want to head out onto the course and work, I didn't like the people I was working for, and hated one of my bosses. In my internships with the company I dont deserve to work for anyway, I constantly showed up late to work and took 15 extra minutes on my lunch breaks (though I made sure to work the full 8 hours everyday), didn't talk to many people, slacked off, didn't learn much of anything, and decided I really did not want to work as that type of engineer for a living. I understand everyone probably doesn't like their job, but I have an extreme aversion to it. **IMPORTANT THING/REASON FOR POST** I have, inexplicably, been invited back to that internship for a third year, and I'm actually weighing the option of NOT WORKING for an entire summer instead of working there again because it made me so unhappy. Who the fuck actually turns that type of thing down? What the fuck is wrong with me that I'd actually think ""yeah, I don't need to make roughly $6k this summer""? Again, my family isn't rich. Well-off, but not rich, and $6k would make a huge impact on my student loan payments/rent. I go to school with a very intelligent girl who would run me over with her bike for this job, and here I am, not wanting to take the offer because I hated last summer (other note, while I didn't enjoy caddying, I didn't look back on a summer of caddying negatively. I look back at last summer as one of the more horrible times in my life).

**Shitty Attitude Towards Others:** As I alluded to above, I was kind of gifted as a student, and grew up in an echo chamber where all everyone ever told me is that I was some sort of genius. I got a bit of an ego about me at a very young age, and sported a cocky, douchy, piece-of-shit attitude everywhere I went before college. I was a horribly offensive human being, and I don't know how I made friends at all. (I do, however, understand why I lost so many best friends). I still have moments where I am an arrogant asshole. What has remained most though is my overall cynical and angry attitude towards people and life in general. I get annoyed with people for no reason all the time. This has been coupled with a shyness borne out of being a fat kid and bullied in middle school to leave one hell of a terrible conversationalist who has trouble meeting new people and hates everything. (it is totally possible to be a huge piece of shit and shy and bullied all at once)

**Wasted Opportunities:** This is more specific than anything else, but I have wasted virtually every great opportunity presented to me. When I was young, I played baseball. I was pretty good, and threw the ball very hard at a very young age. Parents payed for lessons, and the biggest thing the guy stressed was that I needed to lose some weight. I completely ignored him, threw away the pamphlet he gave me to give to my mom, and never lost that weight. Ended up never getting better at the game and destroying my elbow. I never would've been great at baseball, but I loved it so dearly and yet refused to help myself get better...My junior year of high school, I was in great position to lose weight, and actually lost 15 pounds in my first month of trying to do so. And for whatever reason, I stopped. I think it was because of some mean remarks from people in the school weight room that scared me off, but I can't be sure. And here I am so much later and still having gained so much more weight, and now have a bad knee preventing me from doing too much at once...Also my junior year, a girl who is a thousand times more intelligent, kind, and pretty than anyone I could ever go up and talk to crushed hard on me. I basically ignored her out of fear I wasn't understanding her correctly/afraid she'd hate me the more we talked. I treated her like shit in our senior year and I will never forgive myself for it...Also in my senior year, I was contacted by a friend about opening for local band that had made it *huge* (no seriously, if you search the first couple of letters in their name on YouTube, all of the suggestions are related to them and they have like 5 videos with over 12 million views. I'd tell you exactly who they were or it'd be way too easy to figure out who I am.) for a benefit concert at the school. I said ""no, we havent really practiced in a month or so."" My friends/bandmates eventually found out and two of them don't talk to me anymore because of it. We wouldn't have become huge because of it, but who turns down the chance to play in front of 3,000 people? THIS asshole, apparently. I was/am terrified of failure and am easily scared away by really pushing hard for something. Which brings me to... 

**I have been a complete failure in college:** I actually technically ""settled"" on the school I'm at right now. I got into Northwestern, Notre Dame, Michigan, and a few other big name schools, but went where I went because I was worried about what those schools might cost. And I must have come into school with a ""settling"" mentality, cause I slumped out of the gates. I chose a private dorm rather than a dorm where I'd branch out more because I was afraid all the party people would hate me. I don't go to office hours because Im ashamed of my appearance and I am afraid that the professors hate me. I have failed a core class in a subject that I came to the school to major in, and that was the cumulative product of half-assing everything I did before that class. I now probably need to change my specialty to something less interesting that also lowers my earning potential by tens of thousands of dollars at higher levels. I don't really have the passion needed to succeed in the major I have chosen, and it is far too late to change majors or get back on the right track for this major. My GPA is mostly shit and I don't have enough credit hours left to bring it back up to something respectable.

**Zero Direction in Life:** All of this has left me mostly without close friends, no passion or interest in any future job, and lying around in a general malaise that I cannot shake. I am a bum, for lack of a better term. And everything I look back on in my life is just one major embarrassment or failure.

I really wish I'd stop hearing from the people around me that I am such a smart kid/that I have worked so hard to achieve what I have. It's fucking bullshit and it just feels like they're mocking me at this point. Because I really am a shitty excuse for a human being - overweight, lazy, cynical, and rotten. So that concludes my offmychest post. I'm a piece of shit and I wish more people understood that. Good late night writing, lol"

I've wanted to be a programmer in the game development field for a long time.  I had attempted to learn C++ a few times before, but never really stuck with it. This time I have and I've made your standard Pong, Breakout and a Plants vs. Zombies type clone (with a friend) in C++ with SFML2.0.  I currently only 'know' C++, and haven't used Java in about 9 years.

What I'm looking for is someone in GameDev who could use an intern-ish coder.  I'm happy to work for/with someone for 20+ hours/week at no charge.  The only problem with me (as a perspective intern) is that my knowledge base is fairly small and I'm severely lacking experience, i.e I'm a bit of a noob.  I do however consider myself a fast learner and a relatively smart guy.

Instead of being paid, I would rather have access to someone who knows a decent amount about GameDev so I can ask questions and learn from them.  If I'm able to do it (skill wise), I'd like to help you on your project with anything I can, in exchange for a bit of your knowledge.  I may need a bit of guidance when working on something I've never done before, but you won't have to hold my hand if it's within my ability.

I also wouldn't mind maybe a couple hours a week watching you code on TeamViewer (screen share program)/Skype as I found doing that with a friend to be fun and full of chances to learn.

If you have any questions feel free to ask.  It may be too early for me to be trying to work with others, but I think there may be someone out there who could use someone like me, although it's a pretty niche situation.  General advice is also welcome!"
199wj3,165,2013-02-26,[26/m] My [25/f] girlfriend of 6 years has a crushing amount of student loan debt.  ,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/199wj3/26m_my_25f_girlfriend_of_6_years_has_a_crushing/,"I'm 26/m, graduated from college and several years into my career.  I work in electrical engineering and make an decent salary, but far from amazing.  I've been dating my SO for 6 years, for the last two years super long distance across the country.  She's attending law school on the east coast, while I've been working in LA.  We see each other about once a month, when I fly out to visit.    

Between undergrad and law school (both at private universities), my girlfriend is looking to graduate with over $300,000 in student loan debt, most of which is at 6.8%, some parts as high as 10%.   I went to a community college and a state school, mostly on scholarships and working full time as an intern during my junior/senior years, graduating with savings instead of debt.  Everything I've read shows that the legal job market is collapsing; unemployment is skyrocketing and wages are plummeting.  Worst yet, she wants to go into family law, which is one of the worst hit markets.  Best case scenario she pays off her debt over 25 years, having sunk the price of an average home in LA into her education.  Starting salaries aren't great, and they don't get much better as you gain experience.

I'm kind of at a loss.  I don't want to see my girlfriend as a shackle of debt.  As I start to think about marriage, I worry that I'll never be able to afford a nice home if we're shouldering a $2500 monthly loan payment for the next 25 years.  

Every option I've considered seems like a horrible choice.  Do I stay with her, and keep our finances separate, dooming her to spend 50% of her income on loan payments? Do I stay with her and help her repay her loans, putting at risk potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars of my own money that can't simply be returned if the marriage ended less than spectacularly?  Do I leave the girlfriend that I love, that I've sunk 6 of my best years into?  Do I try to convince her to change course and go into something more lucrative that she may not love?

I don't want to feel selfish, but I can't help but feel like I could find a different woman who was a strong career earner like me, and enjoy an extremely high standard of living.  I love my girlfriend but I just feel like this isn't the life I wanted.  I know money isn't everything, but it certainly gives you freedom in this country; the power to make choices and not be railroaded into one option. I want to live in a nice house, raise a bunch of kids, send them to private school, drive a convertible, have a dog, the american dream you know?  I don't want to be living in a 1BR apartment and eating cheerios for the next 25 years.  I also don't want to end up single again when I'm past my prime.  "

Here's the run down. I've been working professionally in the Des Moines (Iowa) area for about a year now (3 years if you count my internship), and I would say I have medium to high job security. I graduated school here and love the town. My fiancee and I will be living together when she graduates college this Spring. My apartment lease is up June 1st, but I can also extend it on a month to month basis if I need to. She wants to rent a place, while I think buying is the better option. My reasoning:

-Another year of renting would be like dumping about $12k down the drain. 
-No one ever got rich or gained equity from renting
-I really don't want to move now, then move in a year when we get a house together
-The costs seem to be relatively similar for the two (of course houses are expensive to maintain but at least I'd be spending it on my own house)
-I'm 99.9% positive I want to stay in this town for a very long time. 

The ""rent versus buy"" calculator says that after 1.5 years, buying would be the better option, and since I plan on staying here, it seems like the better choice.

Any advice would be very much appreciated! Thanks.

I’m a 22 year old female. 6 weeks ago I decided to embark on a new weight loss journey. Stress from school and work really ruined my health. In the summer I had an internship in a different city and took 22 credits of engineering in the fall. I was pretty unhealthy and inactive, and gained a lot of weight. Since graduating, I decided I wanted to get healthy.I cut out white breads,pasta,rice, juice, cookies, pizza, crackers etc. I decided to do a lower carb, low calorie diet. I focus on lots of high protein foods, watch the fat, count calories, and eat many veggies a day.  I also drink over 8 glasses a day, take fish oils, vitamin d, multi, and vitamin b. I get at least 7 hours of sleep a night.

Having had previous success losing 40 pounds before, I know it’s not diet alone. The first week I did purely a diet. The second week I added in 60-80 minute walks 4 times. The third week, I added 4 days of cardio at the gym with 40 minutes-60 minutes. The fourth week I added a trainer twice a week along with my own 4 day individual 45 minute to an hour cardio sessions. I live in a college town and walk a lot on my days off.

That being said, I’m 6 weeks into eating healthier,  5 weeks into cardio, and 3 weeks into adding a trainer, and I just weighed myself and I gained 1.5 lbs in this time.  I’m 5’4” and 191.5 pounds, never been so heavy in my life. I usually allow myself one cheat meal a week on the weekends but try and not make it too crazy, I do drink on the weekends with my friends. But I am drinking a lot less and have gone from sedentary to active and changed my diet completely. But I just don’t understand why I’m not losing weight? Could it be muscle? Or maybe the fact I was on prednisone last week?  I really count my calories and watch what I eat, so I’m so distraught.

After graduating in 2005 from a math-and-science-oriented residential high school, I started a baccalaureate program for chemical engineering.  Unfortunately I was unable to complete it due to my mother's drug problems.  Having been addicted to cocaine for my entire life, it was not unusual for her to go on weeks-long binges but I never expected for her to quite literally go missing.

After my mom had been AWOL for more than six months, as well as during tax/FAFSA renewal time, I was unable to get financial aid assistance for school and certainly couldn't pay for my private institution's tuition.  I completed two semesters and then was forced to leave school because of these financial and family hardships.

From that point, I worked constantly.  I usually held two jobs, occasionally three, to be able to support myself (albeit meagerly).  As it turned out, my mother had indeed been on a drug relapse but this time had delved into crack.  She spent a year and a half in a Tennessee jail and another eight months in a South Carolina jail, during which time we had no contact.  

For a few years it seemed like I would never be able to go back to school due to financial reasons.  Since my dad, who I first met when I was 11, refused to have anything to do with me and my grandparents were (and still are) supported by governmental assistance, I had exactly no family support during this time.  My only hope was to wait it  out until I turned 24 so as to be considered ""financially independent"" by the Department of Education before I could return to school.

I reached age 24 in December of 2010 and planned to resume undergraduate core classes at a two-year school the following spring semester.  Unfortunately, that plan was precluded by extremely coincidental tragedy.  In mid-January 2011 I flew to South Carolina to visit my grandparents who I hadn't seen in three years.  Since my mother had recently gotten out of jail and was living in the same town, I told my grandparents not to tell her I was coming to visit; I wanted as little drama as possible.  My mom had still not contacted me since her disappearance in 2005, and there was no way I could bite my tongue and act as if the last six years of working dead-end minimum wage jobs because of her irresponsibility had somehow not happened.

The day after I secretly arrived in my grandparents' hometown, my mother committed suicide in a crack-induced panic, the week before her 42nd birthday.  She did not know I was in town, of that much I am sure, but it was incredibly, almost fatefully, timed.  As I mentioned before, my grandparents live on Medicaid and Medicare, and my mother survived on disability welfare which does not cover death by suicide.  Having just received a tax refund, naturally I was the one responsible for putting her remains to rest.  I could not afford a funeral or a casket, but I was able to buy a small grave marker, have her cremated and the urn buried in a small plot.  As you can maybe imagine, this was an especially difficult time for me.

The loss of my mother further postponed my return to school and for a brief time caused me to have suicidal thoughts when I contemplated my seemingly perpetual pond-scum socioeconomic status.  However, I pushed myself out of the mire and got up the gumption to start school in the fall of 2011.  

Since then I have been taking more than full time courseloads each semester and have changed my focus to both physics and computer science.  I will complete my AS of computer science this May and will transfer to a university in the fall to finish my undergraduate degrees.  I have been doing extremely well in school and have become very ambitious, so much that I have been applying to dozens of ""longshot"" programs.  Among the ""longshots"" were the springtime Texas Aerospace Scholars program at Johnson Space Center, and a summer internship with the Department of ~~Education~~ Energy (blah, typos) at Fermi National Laboratory.  

My applications for both of those programs were accepted -- this means that I am able to submit my Mars rover concepts to NASA and (I'm shaking in excitement) I AM GOING TO WORK AT FERMILAB for the whole summer!  The US Department of Energy is going to PAY me to have job experience at one of the most prestigious labs in the world.

Despite having a ton of bad luck in the past, I feel like the luckiest girl in the world right now.  Even more than that, though, I feel the rewarding effects of tenacity, ambition, and dreams.  I'm sorry this was so long, but I felt the need to put my exuberance into perspective.  Thanks for reading!


**TL;DR**: Forced to quit college at age 19 because of mom's coke addiction; finally able to go back to school at 24 but further delayed due to mom's suicide; eventually went back to school and just found out I got both a NASA program spot and an internship at FermiLab.

Having been addicted to cocaine for my entire life, it was not unusual for her to go on weeks-long binges but I never expected for her to quite literally go missing.

After my mom had been AWOL for more than six months, as well as during tax/FAFSA renewal time, I was unable to get financial aid assistance for school and certainly couldn't pay for my private institution's tuition.  I completed two semesters and then was forced to leave school because of these financial and family hardships.

From that point, I worked constantly.  I usually held two jobs, occasionally three, to be able to support myself (albeit meagerly).  As it turned out, my mother had indeed been on a drug relapse but this time had delved into crack.  She spent a year and a half in a Tennessee jail and another eight months in a South Carolina jail, during which time we had no contact.  

For a few years it seemed like I would never be able to go back to school due to financial reasons.  Since my dad, who I first met when I was 11, refused to have anything to do with me and my grandparents were (and still are) supported by governmental assistance, I had exactly no family support during this time.  My only hope was to wait it  out until I turned 24 so as to be considered ""financially independent"" by the Department of Education before I could return to school.

I reached age 24 in December of 2010 and planned to resume undergraduate core classes at a two-year school the following spring semester.  Unfortunately, that plan was precluded by extremely coincidental tragedy.  In mid-January 2011 I flew to South Carolina to visit my grandparents who I hadn't seen in three years.  Since my mother had recently gotten out of jail and was living in the same town, I told my grandparents not to tell her I was coming to visit; I wanted as little drama as possible.  My mom had still not contacted me since her disappearance in 2005, and there was no way I could bite my tongue and act as if the last six years of working dead-end minimum wage jobs because of her irresponsibility had somehow not happened.

The day after I secretly arrived in my grandparents' hometown, my mother committed suicide in a crack-induced panic, the week before her 42nd birthday.  She did not know I was in town, of that much I am sure, but it was incredibly, almost fatefully, timed.  As I mentioned before, my grandparents live on Medicaid and Medicare, and my mother survived on disability welfare which does not cover death by suicide.  Having just received a tax refund, naturally I was the one responsible for putting her remains to rest.  I could not afford a funeral or a casket, but I was able to buy a small grave marker, have her cremated and the urn buried in a small plot.  As you can maybe imagine, this was an especially difficult time for me.

The loss of my mother further postponed my return to school and for a brief time caused me to have suicidal thoughts when I contemplated my seemingly perpetual pond-scum socioeconomic status.  However, I pushed myself out of the mire and got up the gumption to start school in the fall of 2011.  

Since then I have been taking more than full time courseloads each semester and have changed my focus to both physics and computer science.  I will complete my AS of computer science this May and will transfer to a university in the fall to finish my undergraduate degrees.  I have been doing extremely well in school and have become very ambitious, so much that I have been applying to dozens of ""longshot"" programs.  Among the ""longshots"" were the springtime Texas Aerospace Scholars program at Johnson Space Center, and a summer internship with the Department of ~~Education~~ Energy (blah, typos) at Fermi National Laboratory.  

My applications for both of those programs were accepted -- this means that I am able to submit my Mars rover concepts to NASA and (I'm shaking in excitement) I AM GOING TO WORK AT FERMILAB for the whole summer!  The US Department of Energy is going to PAY me to have job experience at one of the most prestigious labs in the world.

Despite having a ton of bad luck in the past, I feel like the luckiest girl in the world right now.  Even more than that, though, I feel the rewarding effects of tenacity, ambition, and dreams.  I'm sorry this was so long, but I felt the need to put my exuberance into perspective.  Thanks for reading!


**TL;DR**: Forced to quit college at age 19 because of mom's coke addiction; finally able to go back to school at 24 but further delayed due to mom's suicide; eventually went back to school and just found out I got both a NASA program spot and an internship at FermiLab.

1992fe,1,2013-02-26,Help for an engineer interested in working for a product design firm.,Jamoker,IndustrialDesign,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndustrialDesign/comments/1992fe/help_for_an_engineer_interested_in_working_for_a/,"Hello everyone, I've been checking out this subreddit and finding it to be full of very helpful and informed people.

The question I have is on some advice on how to get hired by an industrial design firm as an engineer. I am a mechanical engineer in the process of applying for my first real job. While I am applying for the standard jobs mechanical engineers apply to, I am also looking at working as an engineer for a design company. I have always had a passion for design and creating things that people would be in constant interaction with, but I know that I am neither the most creative nor artistically gifted person, so I chose engineering as a ""safe"" major during school, but never really enjoyed it. I guess currently I am stuck with seeing that I might do something I don't care that much about for the rest of my life, so I am seeing if I can get into something I care about much more. 

A kind of job I would be really interested in is something like: http://www.coroflot.com/jobs/45203/Junior-Mechanical-Engineer

Some things going for me would be that I took all the CAD courses that were available to me, so I consider myself fairly competent at using the software that was used at school (SolidWorks). I also have a minor in Architecture, which I chose after taking some courses for a communication design minor. The school I went to had a much more stronger Architecture program which is why I switched, and also the courses seemed to deal much more with the interaction between the resultant product and the user, instead of focusing purely on aesthetics. Therefore I can say that I know a bit about the interaction process between designers when working on something together and have somewhat of a design education background. I had to learn quick as I was taking classes with senior/grad level students and had to discuss with the professor and students about my opinions on the finer details of architecture. I also have some experience from my engineering design courses and my Formula SAE team with designing something in CAD and handling the challenges of fabricating those designs into a physical model for use.

In a position where I would be working together with designers consulting and working on CAD models, I think I would do very well. I am a bit lost on how to show it however. I do not have experience with a company in terms of internships that would demonstrate my ability to do so. I do not consider myself having the strongest portfolio, as I just have my engineering CAD projects to show. However, I do think that if asked to work on or create something, I would not have difficulty making anything.

What do you guys think I can do to increase my chances of getting noticed and possibly hired?

Thank you very much."
199185,2,2013-02-26,"Can't sleep, need to let all of this off my chest. Just need to write it down, sorry for the length.",LateNightInadequacie,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/199185/cant_sleep_need_to_let_all_of_this_off_my_chest/,"I’m coming to realize I’ve been crankier as of late. Technically, this isn’t my realization, this is the realization of some of my friends, but they’re absolutely right.  I don’t know when it happened, but somewhere, at some point, I was happier. I was a happy person, and now I’m angry. I treat those who are close to me like shit. I’m a straight up asshole, and I really need to atone for what I’ve done. I need to make right. I need to find ways to be more constructive. Two things are for sure: I need to write more often, and run without headphones. Writing, like I’m doing right now, always seems to alleviate some of the stress. It flows through the lungs that won’t stop going, into the fingertips, and out onto paper. Or, I suppose, the keyboard. Headphones are the bane of my run. They cheapen the experience. Every time I run without headphones, I am imbued with life, with the livelihood of the environment I am surrounded by. I live in a beautiful place, but to experience it to its fullest, I need to ensure that every sense is alert, including my hearing. I love running, but  There’s a third thing I need to fix; I’m on the computer too much. I’m not even doing homework. I need to stop procrastinating, and do things without a computer.

Why am I this way? I’d argue it’s lack of sleep, but it honestly makes me sleep less, so if it’s that, well, it’s cyclical. If I don’t sleep, I’m angry. If I’m angry, I don’t sleep. That sucks.

But, in addition to that, I’m lonely. When my friends told me the other day that I’ve been an asshole recently (they said it jokingly, but every joke has a kernel of truth), they theorized that it’s “because I need to get my dick wet.” As obnoxious, immature, and chauvinistic as that sounds, its true to an extent. The fact is, in high school, I had girlfriends, and I was happy enough. But, ever since twelfth grade, I’ve hardly tried. I definitely haven’t attempted even trying to go after a girl in at least a year. It has been 2 and a half years since I’ve even kissed a girl. And while I’ve done more than kiss, I never lost my virginity. As juvenile a complaint as that sounds, it’s getting to me. The only girl I’ve ever loved is happily in a relationship (and I’m happy FOR her), lost her virginity to the guy she dated in between him and me (a guy who was my friend, but a total asshat to her), and I almost feel like I’m behind somewhere here. I should be way ahead. College was supposed to be a blossoming period for me, girls were supposed to be crawling everywhere. A couple days ago, my housemate (who doesn’t know I’m a virgin) said to my roommate “yaknow, you either lose your virginity before your twenty one, or its not happening for awhile.” My 21st birthday is coming up (woooo), and I don’t think he realized how much that comment got to me. It really cut deep. But it’s not just the virginity thing.
I need a teammate. Someone who is on my side, who I can confide in. That’s how I’m lonely. I have friends, but I feel like I have very few friends who I can truly get personal with. And, perhaps because I spend so much time with my fraternity, I feel like I have no female friends, with the exception of a few girls from high school who I hardly talk to anymore. Honestly, there is a huge difference between girls and guys, and sometimes its nice to have close friends who are girls.

I’m also wasting my potential. I have no idea what I’m doing with my life. I want to write or teach, but I’m majoring in government, which I find fascinating enough, but I’m not engaging myself in my classes. I don’t have any special relationships with my professors (the one professor I thought I was going to ask to be my advisor, I found out tonight, can’t advise). I hardly do the work. My grades are extraordinarily lackluster (not terrible, but not what I want). I’m being pressured into applying for internships, something I’m not really trying to hard to do. I’m just not interested. The phrase “think tank” means nothing to me, and I don’t see how it will help me in my life to do this, but I feel like I’m wasting my summer if all I do is work at the movie theater again, while my peers are in DC doing fancy things with their lives. I’m really passionate about film and writing, but I don’t see anyway I can do anything about that because I’m so fucking behind. I don’t know how to make a movie, I don’t even own a camera, nor do I know how to use one. As for writing, I’m taking a class in playwriting, but I’m such a fucking procrastinator that every time something is due, I end up hastily writing it the night before, sacrificing sleep and quality, and my professor sends me back mark ups that are full of disappointment. 

I’m thinking, instead of an internship, I’ll keep the movie job. I need the money. But making 8 bucks an hour won’t do for a summer. I want to make a movie, buy a camera, final cut pro, etc., but I’m worried I don’t know anyone who will be willing to go along with my idea and star in the movie. And even if I did, I probably wouldn’t be able to energize them to help me out.

If not that, maybe I’ll go learn a foreign language at the school near my house. I need to increase my worldliness, and, on that note, I want to study abroad. However, I feel like I just want to study abroad for the sake of studying abroad. I don’t care where, or if its relevant to what I’m studying. I just want to go, but I might not even have good enough grades for that. 

Damn.

Sorry for the length of this. I couldn’t sleep and had to get these things off my chest, and there’s no one I feel I can tell most of them to.

Could nay of you shed some light on my situation?,[deleted],Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/198ij3/im_not_sure_what_i_am_experiencing_is_anxiety_or/,"This is my last semester of college, and I am juggling a lot of things. School,  internship, job applications, my sport, nothing that nobody else has gone through and I do still find time for myself as I am an introvert. My sister and my Dad both have anxiety issues and have both had numerous panic attacks. My Dad regulates it through meditation and using a workbook and my sister uses medication. 

Lately, I have been experiencing a weird sensation, that at first occurred when I was trying to go to sleep, but has now been creeping into everyday situations. When I close my eyes my brain feels like it is almost swimming and swirling, like there is a rushing sensation where it is almost a panic feeling. It is really hard to explain that aspect of it, but I feel really rushed and my mind jumps from topic to topic, as I work myself up. I also experience a weird feeling of objects that are around me being very far away, like I am almost isolated from them. I am sorry I can not explain it in more detail, its a unique, unsettling feeling that I am not familiar with. Usually it resides after a few minutes, and I really have to focus on making it go away and open my eyes to keep my head from swimming and breathe deeply for a while. Like I said it started usually when I was trying to go to sleep, but now its happening in everyday situations, like parties and class. 

Is this anxiety, like my father keeps telling me, or something else entirely. Thank you for your time and help. "

Don't want to say I'm ""over-weight"" but I feel there is definitely room for improvement!

I want to feel good again; mentally, emotionally, and most importantly, physically. I want to be able to walk with confidence in a city where looks mean a lot. I'm not dissing my body, I love my curves, and my boobs especially. I just need a pick me up; a new challenge to get me going. I want to surprise everyone when I come back from my internship with how much I've changed. 

I plan to start with cardio every day in the form of walking and running then slowly move up to lifting (scary thought for me). I have signed up for a yoga class for mental and I guess physical focus (thanks groupon!) As for diet, I eat pretty well (lots of chicken and veggies), however the main items I will be cutting out are carbs (more specifically bread and pasta, 2 of my main staples), diet soda (my guilty pleasure), and hot chocolate. 

Wish me luck, as well as every one else who enters. Here's to bettering our lives and ourselves!"
198a1v,1,2013-02-25,My crappy friend and my own darkening depression.,Bristol_Larkin,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/198a1v/my_crappy_friend_and_my_own_darkening_depression/,"I'm going to preface by saying that I haven't exactly planned out exactly what I'm going to say, so I'm sorry if I ramble. I will try and edit along the way to make this as understandable and readable as possible, but you have my apologies if I don't fully succeed in doing so. It will also probably be long. I wouldn't be surprised, I always find more to say.

I was considering writing this in a journal or word document, because mostly I'm looking for the catharsis of writing it down, but I figured OffMyChest would be a good place to go due to the possibility of feedback and creating a dialogue. I'm not really expecting any, but I think that allowing the possibility of it is better than no response at all. 

So, with all that out of the way, I'll get to the meat of everything.

I have a friend, and I use that term loosely, and I haven't spoken to him in over a year. Sometime I like some statuses on Facebook, but that's about it. I'm not entirely sure why I just didn't defriend him after we fell out, maybe because I didn't want to be the side that fully wrote off the other side, but I'm not entirely sure.

The rest of this will make sense if I explain exactly why we fell out. I've known this guy for about four or five years since taking a year off college. I moved back in with my parents in southern Delaware and got a retail job nearby. This guy probably wasn't someone I'd normally associate with, but people in my age group (I was 19 at the time) that had roughly the same interests as me was pretty hard to come guy. Southern Delaware is predominantly older and with middle aged couples with kids. We formed a pretty fast and close friendship. Cut to about 3 years later, I was taking the long route through college at the University of Pittsburgh with internships. Electrical Engineering isn't exactly a cake walk to begin with anyway.

Anyway, taking a longer time to get through school, a lot of friends had begun to move away and I was getting a little depressed. My fiancee had moved in after getting a job as a teacher in the area, and that was awesome, but it's still upsetting to have a steady stream of friends move away. At any rate, this friend of mine I had made in Delaware was looking to move to Pittsburgh to start college. He had gotten tired of the retail life and southern Delaware. We had a two bedroom apartment, and he asked if he could move in with us for a year to get his name on the lease and start working towards in state residency to get in state rates and in the meantime, do community college.

My fiancee and I made a pros and cons list as we heard bad things about letting friends be roommates. Our list was basically break even, with biggest con being we'd lose our own place and privacy, which we were enjoying. On the pro, the help with rent would allow us to contribute more to our wedding, which my in-laws said they would cover, despite struggling financially. At first we said no but tried to convince him to move out to Pittsburgh and find his own place.

Looking back on it, he basically guilted us into it by saying the school year was starting soon and he didn't have time to find a place. I, in my infinite wisdom thought, well, with all my friends moving away, it would be nice to have a friend move here. We would beat the odds by making a roommate agreement. He and his girlfriend were moving into our place so they'd have to play by our rules. Through the year, as far being good roommates and doing what was expected, there were no issues. In fact, things were going well. And it was around this time that I was debating back and forth between my cousin or this guy being my best man. It was a real dead heat. My cousin lived no where close, and this guy was living in the apartment with me! He'd be seeing the current status of my relationship and we'd be able to do buddy-buddy things, so he became my best man.

As the year progressed however, his true colors really came out. He moved his girlfriend away from her home in Maryland to Pittsburgh, away from her friends, and then left her after 4 months because she became depressed from being so quickly and suddenly removed from her safety net, friends, family, job, and the place she had lived all her life. He would condescend my fiancee and bury me with backhanded compliments. We came to head many many times, but always seemed to fix things. Looking back on it, he charmed and manipulated me into fixing things. He's a Grade A salesman. If there is any one thing he is good at, it is being a pitchman. I'll also give credit to say he's a phenomenal musician and lyricist, but it ends there.

So anyway, things finally blew up when I realized he had failed at every duty I needed him to do as a best man, and every time, my cousin would swoop in to save the day. He'd complain about money or scheduling, but it was just always a result of poor planning. And every time, my cousin would save the day. When my cousin finally managed to pull out a last minute bachelor party with only a week, maybe two, of planning it became pretty apparent who my best man needed to be, and I did just that. This guy got pretty pissed, and we had a very long and angry grudge match before I finally said ""you know what. Fuck you, this is my wedding.""

That might seem somewhat petty, but the real under lying feeling to this is that we opened our home to him. In return, he couldn't get his act together to be my best man. I certainly made my own missteps and mistakes with him along the way, I can not claim to be 100% innocent. However, the fact that in return for us allowing him to move in he could not be responsible for the duties of being best man hurt, and really came across to me as sense on not caring and to an extent, betrayal.

Now, this is far from over and I realize this has already very long. Longer than I intended, but that background was necessary. If you've stuck around this long, you're a pretty amazing person. If you stick around till the end, you're probably a saint.

So, we will cut forward to present. This guy who I watched for a year burn everyone around him, his ex, his co-workers, his roommates and new friends he made in Pittsburgh and simply got 'tired of' has suddenly found himself with a life that someone who has been so shitty to everyone doesn't deserve, and confuses the ever living fuck out of me. I'm entirely aware I'm going to come off bitter here, and I will address it shortly. So, anyway, this guy has become engaged to a very, very smart and successful electrical engineer from the number one engineer school in the country and now working on their PhD in Pittsburgh. And this guy has found himself to soon be a father. And I'm just sitting wondering how, in a world that is supposed to balance itself out, something like this could happen. I know he had a really crummy life growing up, but this woman just seems to so far out of his or anyone's league, and I just don't *get* it.

So, I know this makes me sound bitter, and part of it is because I'm projecting myself into this. He is living the life that I worked hard to achieve and have somehow missed it, and all he's ever really done is be an ass, yet he's traveling around to exciting places and meeting new people. I have always tried to do the right thing. I'm certainly no saint, I've stepped on a few toes, and there are some things I wish I could go back and redo, but I don't think I've ever deliberately gone out of my way to screw people over or put myself first just to get ahead. 

Strangely, I want to be happy for him, and hope he has changed, but at the same time, I feel like he is some continuing to burn by getting what I had wanted. At the same time, I'm also legitimately afraid that he will just get tired of her at some point and burn her, and then leave her with a kid and become an absent father. I actually don't want that to happen, but I'm afraid it could. At the same time, I feel like if it did, then he wouldn't be living the life I worked for and all would be even and square again. Thinking that though makes me feel like a real jerk and I know that it is wrong. A kid's life is now concerned and that's what more important than me feeling cheated.

Currently, my wife is getting her PhD in Philadelphia, so we moved from Pittsburgh. It is a 7 year program and she is one year in. I supported this decision and will continue to do so as I would never do anything to compromise her ambition and dreams, but I **hate** it here. I miss the ever loving fuck out of Pittsburgh. I have friends that moved back to the area and made friends in my last year of school that are still there. Where I'm at now, I just haven't really met people that I feel I can connect with. I live just beyond the suburbs of Philly, my wife takes a train into Philly and I drive to my work outside of Reading. I'm into electronics, video games, Doctor Who, European tabletop gaming and weight lifting and the majority of the people I've met are into hunting, working on their cars and the like. I'm a Grade A nerd stereotype who is most at home with other nerds and the people that I've so far met around me are decidedly not.

Compounding the problem is my job. When I first started, I had lots of varied and interesting work. I was actively making use of my electrical engineering degree, to the extent I was still consulting my text book and notes. It was challenging and exciting, and I was able to do some domestic traveling. Unfortunately, they have an overly complex management systems which keeps the company's cost extremely high and they are currently non competitive in the power market, which is where my interests lie. Lots of jobs have been pulled and they are losing lots of bids and it is a day to day struggle to have enough work and I've become quickly disenchanted with the work I do have. My interests lie in relay coordination, grid communications, power storage and power generation. The work I have is none of the above, it is not engaging and is not satisfying. I'm not looking to change the world, but I would like to have work that gets me out from behind a desk, away from the cubicle farm and makes a difference.

I wish I could say I was looking, but I am on the graduate development leadership team and have made my commitment to that. That position ends in June, and then I will probably begin to look. Being in this leadership position offers me the opportunity to go to senior management meetings, though I myself am not, and hear their business development plans. It legitimately sounds very interesting what they are trying to bring in, and I'm almost tempted to stay, but I don't think they are structured effectively to be competitive to do so, and they don't market themselves well enough to be visible to this new work.

The past few months with work near zero has made me considering going back to school. With my wife already in a PhD program, I have no idea how we'd afford if I return to school. We signed a two year lease to keep rent locked at its current rate. I know I want to get my masters, but I go back and forth if I want to get my PhD. I'm really interested in smart grid technologies and grid power storage, but most of this is still in research, and I'm not interested in a life in academia, I'm interested in design, application and instrumentation. Basically, I want to have my cake and eat it, too. I don't know what to do about that. Also, with my wife in her PhD, I'm limited to the schools I can apply to. I don't really think I can ask her to try and do a long distance marriage just become I feel bad. Furthermore, I think I'd fall apart without her. She's my absolute best friend.

Meanwhile, I see this guy who has always been an ass living the life I hoped I was going to have while I tried to always do things the right way. I've taken my risks, and they haven't panned out the way I hoped they would.

So, that's my wrap up. Sorry it ended up being so anti-climactic. If felt really good to get this all out there. Also, my apologies for this being so long, and any edits or typos I may have missed. I think it at least flows and is understandable. If you made it this far, you're pretty fucking cool, and if you leave something to say, then you're a better person than I could probably ever hope to be.

Edit 1: Found some typos and fixed them. Sorry

Edit 2: Also, I know you're not supposed to compare your life to someone's Facebook highlights. I certainly have my own hobbies and accomplishments, but given the past history, it just really irks me for some reason."

We've been dating for a little less than a year, and things have been going well. We are on the same page about nearly everything, sex life is great, no serious arguments, etc. Personality-wise, I feel like he's my other half. I've never felt more comfortable with anyone else as I do with him.


When I first met him, he had been in college for five years and not had a resume. I had to give him my resume format so he could have one. He filled it with three pages of pointless fluff like ""worked as a movie extra"" ""worked on the set of this TV show"" ""worked at a bakery in Korea"" etc. when his major and the jobs he's applying for has nothing to do with baking or television. I told him it was common knowledge that a resume should be a page long and should contain only relevant experiences, but we actually had an argument over this because he wanted to keep his irrelevant work experiences since they were ""cool"". He's not active in any sort of school organizations and has worked as a bus boy for more than 6 years instead of looking for relevant work experiences because he it's easy and he ""gets paid to eat"". I had several arguments with him over this because I was so frustrated that he had spent his college career doing nothing that would have helped better his future. As a fifth year college student he didn't even know that three pages for a resume is too long by any standard. Now he's starting to get nervous and is looking for jobs but has not heard back from any about a job offer. I'm waiting on him to sign a lease because he wants to move to the same city as me and get a job here. However, I feel like we have different goals for the future. For me, I want to be successful in my career and have been working hard since starting college to secure internships and relevant work experiences to help me in the future. He hasn't taken much initiative to market himself as a qualified candidate for jobs that he's interested in.



I told him before that if our positions were reversed, I couldn't reciprocate what he's doing to be with me (moving to the same city and getting a job here). But he is still keen on moving to the same city as me to be with me. I don't think this is fair to him so I've been seriously considering breaking up (which we have done so in the past for a few days, but got back together). He thinks that it's stupid to break up when we have no serious disagreements or irreconcilable differences. I just have this feeling that while I have a great time being with him, and I do love him, our differences will eventually become too apparent and it wouldn't work out.



Is this a justifiable reason to end a relationship? I've told him in the past that I felt that in a relationship, both parties should help motivate each other. With our relationship, I feel like I'm the one who feels like I have to keep pushing him forward. I thought that dating someone several years older than me would mean dating someone who was mature and could be someone I could look up to, to have a shoulder to lean on.



I told my friend about my feelings and he told me that as someone who comes from an Asian background, we're ""hardwired"" to be more concerned about jobs and our future, and white people are more laid back. However, I know plenty of white people who are doing internships and job fairs! I'm not trying to secure a future so I can have money and status (which he has accused me of...saying that I am just looking for someone who is successful/rich). I'm genuinely passionate about my area of study (which does not guarantee a high salary at all) and I want a significant other who has passion and drive as well.




Right now, I feel like I'm at a crossroad. I really care about him and I love being with him. I don't think I'll ever find anyone more compatible or similar to me. However, it's difficult to see us working out in the long run. I just don't know what I should do right now. This is my first serious relationship so I'm a bit clueless and may have been a little incoherent with what I wrote. Sorry about that, and thank you for your help in advance.



tl;dr: I feel like my bf and I are on completely different pages when it comes to our future and goals in life. Should I/is this a justifiable reason to break up?

I'm Bipolar II, and I'm currently in my 2nd year of getting my MSW and I have an internship as part of the program.

I've missed a few meetings (the internship is online) and I hate coming up with ""lame"" excuses.

I'm afraid to tell ""the truth"" because I don't want to be seen as unable to perform well enough for this job.

Any thoughts or advice? How have you handled this? 

UPDATE: Talked to my supervisor, and she said that she is glad to know more of the ""context"" of why I've been missing meetings. She said that in the future to call ahead rather than apologize and ask for forgiveness after teh fact. So, it helped and made me feel better about it. She appreciated the disclosure and acknowledged that there is a stigma with it, but it does help (sometimes) to know what it going on rather than making up excuses. 
So, even though it may not be best for everyone, it seems to have worked out for me. Thanks for all of your help, and I hope this can help some of you :) "

19cfzc,6,2013-02-27,"I [f22] work as a graphic designer. My little sister [f20] works for a company with no real job description, but is apparently 'designing' their website.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/19cfzc/i_f22_work_as_a_graphic_designer_my_little_sister/,"Note: I tried to be as clear as I could in that title. I'm a bit frustrated and I didn't know how to word my frustrations.

Backstory:

I went to college right out of school to get my degree in Visual Communications (Graphic Design). Once I completed college, I picked up an internship, which then turned into a full time job. I have been with this company for nearly two years. Though, I'm not paid very well - The company is fairly busy but because of a choice client refusing to pay his bill we have fallen in rough times until the case is taken to collections. Anyway...

My little sister has no education, other than highschool. She's been in the workforce since she graduated. First she worked for a children's hair salon (hair stylist, still uneducated). She then left when she fell ill and had to go live with my parents. (The house they were renting was riddled with mould and made her very sick. Her and her fiance lived in my parents basement for about half a year.) 

While she was recuperating, she took up an office job at a trailer manufacturing company. While there, she approached me and the company I work for for a website. We met, quoted it out, and never heard from them again.

She eventually quit this job, despite the incredible pay and how good the company was to her. She bought a house with her fiance, and went back to the children's hair salon. After about 6 months there, she's back at the trailer manufacturing company. (Wow, I didn't realise how back-and-forth she's been).

I actually picked up a part time job on weekends at said hair salon because I'm having money issues.

To be fair, I'm fairly resentful of her job. She gets paid a LOT more than me. She doesn't realise how fortunate she is to have this opportunity. She was hired on initially to do their safety program, and work on the floor doing something to do with safety. I don't know exactly, but she kind of had this handed to her on a shiny silver platter.

Yeah, I've always had resentment for my sister. Likely relevant.

The problem: 
Once my sister got her job back at the trailer place, I asked her if there was any chance to revisit us designing/building their website. She told me the owners decided to go with 'some girl' instead.

Which, happens to be her! And this kind of really PISSED me off! I only found out because my mom mentioned something about it last night. She's also been emailing me these last few days asking about templates, design, and 'back office'.

I told her that if she intends to change the design, she'd need to know HTML and CSS, and I don't know what a back office is because we build our stuff custom from the ground up - no templates or the like.

When it finally clicked I became enraged. I've kept most of it bottled up inside me but I am wondering how I should go forward with this.

I feel like she's pissing on my career choice. I went to school for this. I do my job, and I do my job well. It's my livelihood. We have a programmer, who does his job well. She lied to me about who was doing their website, and she's asking me for help. She is going to do a hacky shitty job (other than hair styling, she has no creative talent), and she's obviously aiding in taking away work from our company.

I don't know what to do. I want to call her out on it. In fact, I may have already emailed her about it. Just asking if she was designing the website, but I don't know what to say once she responds.

Side note: I'm supposed to meet with her this week to work on designing her wedding invites, but the childish mad side of me wants me to tell her to go design her own invites seeing as she thinks she's capable.

And rereading all that I feel like a childish brat. So feel free to call me out on it if you see fit. I just don't know how I should act about this. I know what I WANT to say, but I also know that won't go over well. I do want to make her aware of how this is effecting me. How, with the current financial issue I'm in, it's become even more frustrating. We get clients like this all the time, who take their work to 'someone else aka their nephew who knows dreamweaver' or something, but when it happens with my own family it's a bit more personal.

**TL;DR Little sister, always having thing handed to her on a nice shiny platter, knowingly takes away design work from the design company big sister works for to do it 'herself', which spells disaster. Bit about education, big sister works her ass off to get where she is, while little sister just floats through life. Obviously resulting in angry big sister, but unsure how to approach the little sister to talk about it. Like adults. Hopefully.**


EDIT: Ah, a short-lived drama, flaired by my rash temper. I appreciate all the helpful advice given. I guess morning when I realised what was going on, and not hearing the full story directly from her kind of pushed me over the edge. I'm glad I wrote here before I confronted her because I can guarantee things wouldn't end well.

I haven't heard from her, but I did email her and say that I was bothered by what happened. It was a piss on my career. I didn't feel good about it. I didn't like that she lied about it to me, and that I found out through someone else. I also said I realised that it wasn't her decision where the site was made, and I can't blame her for that. I told her that she can't ask me for advice. I won't give it away freely. I worked hard to get where I am and I'm not going to spend my time trying to help her when I've taken the time to figure out these things for myself.

And I said I'll see her tomorrow. So, if I haven't enraged her too much, this means I can still do her wedding invites for her.

I've been reading this sub for a while now - you guys always give great advice, so I was hoping a few of you could check my thought process here.

I'm a grad student, living with my SO.  Together we take home about 3.6k a month.  We currently live in a city and don't need or want a car.  However, I have a mandatory (paid) internship for the summer in a part of the country where, sadly, a car will be necessary.  We would want the car for driving across the country to the internship, daily commuting, and driving back.  After that, we have no more use for the car.

Since I started grad school in the fall, we've managed to save up about 5k.  This amount constitutes the entirety of our savings/emergency fund.  The internship is paid, and our take-home pay will be about the same per month (possibly a little higher).

As I see it, my options are either:

- Buy a car, and then sell it (possibly for a small loss) at the end of the summer.  OKish looking used cars sell in my area for about 3-4k with 150k miles on them.  The benefit of this strategy is that over the long-term I wouldn't pay too much, since I could sell the car at the end of summer.  The drawback is that it would cut significantly into our pretty meager savings, and if something goes wrong (like the engine fails), we'd be out 3-4k and have no car.

- Rent a car for 3 months.  I've called a few places up, and it looks like this would cost about 1700-2200 dollars for the entire summer, split over 3 months.  Since this is roughly equivalent to what we've been saving per month, we could definitely afford this kind of a monthly payment without even cutting into our savings, though we'd stop contributing for the summer.

Advice?  My current thought is that option 1 would technically be the overall better option for someone with a little more in savings, but for us it would be too risky.  I don't really know a lot about cars or how likely they are to fail, though, so maybe I'm overestimating that risk?  

I'm happy to provide other information, if it's relevant.  Thanks a bunch for your thoughts!"
19bejg,1,2013-02-27,It's been 3 weeks an I don't know how to feel...,[deleted],BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/19bejg/its_been_3_weeks_an_i_dont_know_how_to_feel/,"I'll give you a little background, and I apologize in advance but this will be long. I just want to vent, or maybe even just write down my thoughts. Anyway, here it goes.

I started dating my girlfriend in November of 2011. We were really good friends starting around May of that year, and got closer and closer over the summer. By the fall, I had to start my first semester at college. Not being able to bare the thought of her finding someone else while I was away at school I made my move on her. We finally kissed and were dating the same day. Everything was amazing from November throughout the school year and summer. We grew even closer, I loved her more than I thought I could love a person. And even though we were only 18 and 19 years old, we started talking about marriage down the road and planning our lives out together. She said she wanted to be with me forever, and I was stupid enough to believe it. At the end of the summer we were both heart broken to let each other go. But, she had to start her Freshman year at school and I had to begin my second year. Our schools were 2 hours from home in different directions so we figured it wouldn't be any different than being long distance last year. We agreed that we'd both come home every 2 or 3 weeks to see each other. It sounded doable and I was ready for the start of the semester. But after only a few days at college she started to seem more distant. I didn't know what was going on, but I didn't like it. Late one night, still in our first week into the new school year, I told her that I felt like she was getting more distant with me, and I just wanted to know what was going on. She said she wanted to break up.

I was stunned. She was my whole world and out of nowhere she just wanted to be done. She was my first girlfriend, and obviously my first breakup, and this was a very serious relationship in my mind. So all of those factors led me to be really upset and depressed. She said that she still loved me, but she just didn't want to have a boyfriend in college. She didn't want to be tied down. As I said before, I was heartbroken and it seemed like our breakup lasted an eternity, in reality, it was 6 days. 

After less than a week, she realized that other guys didn't compare to me. They weren't worth saying goodnight to is how I think she put it. Anyway, she wanted me back and, not having any time to get over her, I took her back with open arms. Everything was going great after that, it felt like we were back to normal...for about a month.

Around the beginning of October last year I asked her a very potent question. One that was stupid and that I knew I wouldn't like the answer to. I asked her 'before me, when was the last time you had sex?' She didn't want to answer, but I finally got it out of her, and she told me that it was the day we first kissed. This crushed me. I felt like the song and dance we were going through before we started dating was a mutual experience. I felt like her sleeping around while we were in that 'pseudo-dating' phase cheapened all of the memories we shared during that time. So, after she told me that, I lied to her and told her that while we apart for 6 days I slept with someone. I hadn't really; at that point I hadn't slept with anyone else in my life. I had never kissed anyone before in my life. I just wanted to feel some idk, vindication? I wanted to feel like I could do what she did. But, after about an hour of thinking about this, I decided I didn't want to lie to her for the rest of my life and I told her the truth. She flipped out, asked me how she could ever trust me again, that kinda stuff. I still feel like she was over reacting a tad, but what I did was really shitty, and really stupid I know. So she used that to break up with me a second time.

 A few days later she said that she forgave me, but still didn't want to date me anymore. She gave the same reasons as last time, saying she didn't want a ld boyfriend blah blah blah. This time, we don't really talk at all for 2 weeks. That's when she calls me on the phone crying. She says she misses me, and how she's a terrible girlfriend, and she's really confused, and feels alone and all of this. I was a little overwhelmed but just told her that I was there for her. That kicked off a period of a few weeks where we were unofficially dating. I even went down to see her at school one weekend and it was feeling like we were going to get back together again. But she was still on the fence. So, I told her that we wouldn't talk for 2 weeks, she could get an idea of what not being with me would be like, and then she could decide what she really wanted. Well, the 2 weeks went by, and she decided that she wanted me back. Again I excepted. I also found out that she slept with someone while we were in our 2 week nc phase. I didn't blame her for that. All that stuff goes on with being single and not having a bf. 

So we get back together AGAIN and everything is good for awhile. We have less than a month left in the semester, she comes up to my school to visits me and then winter break hits. We were inseparable. For 5 weeks we spent maybe 2 nights  away from each other. Alas, winter break ends and we go back to school. About a week into school, I go on Facebook for the first time since break and notice that she's logged in. I go to log her out, but see her messaging her friend. They were talking about how she was thinking about cheating on me with another guy. I'm shocked once again (even though maybe I shouldn't be at this point) and call her angrily. She says she wasn't really going to do it, but that a part of her wanted to. And then she goes into the exact same thing about not wanting a relationship right now. 

So we break up again. And the first week, being 2 days before Valentines day (when I was going to go see her) I was a complete wreck. Crying every day, it was awful. The next week, a switch flips, I talked to my ex (that still feels weird to say) and she said that she still loves me, and even misses me, but that she doesn't want this right now.We decided that we would see each other in a month, so that we could return each other's things. But I hope that's just a front. I really can't picture giving all of her stuff back. I hope that she misses me just as much as I miss her. Anyway, since the feelings are still there, I decided to look at this more like a break and go out and experience things that I never thought I'd be able to do. So, I did that. 

It's been 2 weeks since I made that decision and for the most part I'm happy. I joined a bowling league, I got an internship in the nature preserve on my campus, I started a tv show for the school tv station, and I made a ton of new friends. I'm a little embarrassed to admit this next part, but I've also slept with 8 girls in about a week. And I think that's whats getting my depressed lately. No matter how many girls, or how good it is, I still feel empty afterwards. It's not the same. None of these girls can compare to her. It's not her. There's no connection. And I miss the connection, and I miss her.

Like I said, I've taken the mindset that this is a break that will end in a month when I give her stuff back. I feel like that will be enough time for her to realize what she's done again. But a part of me is starting to think that this isn't going to be just a break again. And I'm worried that it won't be. Despite everything that she's done to me, I still love her, and I still want her back. If I get that chance I won't be so careless with how we treat the relationship. We're obviously not perfect, and we need to change some things. Both of us. But if she's willing, I would love nothing more.

So that's my story. I feel  little better just writing it down, but I'm still confused. Getting over her is going to take a long time, but I don't want to think about that. I don't want to get over her, I want to get back with her.  Despite what she's done, and the pain she's put me through, I want her back. And I don't know if that's going to happen.

So what are your thoughts? How much time did it take you to get over your SO? Based on my story, do you think she'll want me back at some point? If she does should I do it, and if so what types of ground rules could we put down so that this doesn't happen again? I have some ideas but any advice is appreciated."

So I've been trying to get healthy for a while, with moderate success. I started going to the gym with my brother when I was 19, and started going off and on. I lost a good amount of weight, but kept on eating shittily. In the past year or so I've really started eating healthier, but I haven't going to the gym as much, the longest I've been away from the gym was the 3 months that I was working at my internship. I really want to get a good, consistent gym routine going, and my brother pointed out BTFC and asked if I wanted to do it with him. I said I would be down as it would be a good motivator and it's a lot easier going to the gym with someone else than by yourself, at least for me. So here I am now, and hopefully I will be able to stick to the routine that we made and have some good progress in the months to come."

[The study cited in this article was done on data from a past population in a single country, in/during which life was significantly different than it is today](http://www.shine.yahoo.com/parenting/study-having-boys-months-off-life-175000907.html). It doesn't show cause or even genuinely negative implications of the subject matter (the effects of having a baby boy on a mother's lifespan) yet the author's title implies relevance, cause, and negative effect.    
    
According to the article, the study was done on data from families living in pre-industrial Findland. The population sample size described is odd, with the number of mothers evaluated nearly double that of fathers. This leads to the question, ""Why so few fathers?"" Since this was during a more traditional time period, it isn't likely to be because of divorce. It is reasonable to wonder if the reason is that some fathers' shortened lifespans were ignored due to circumstances to which their deaths may have been attributed, such as accidental deaths.     
       
One factor providing some insight as to why the correlation discussed in the study cannot be related to cause is buried in the middle of a paragraph placed halfway through the story.    
&gt; In Finland during the 1700s and 1800s, a girl helped her mother by shouldering many of the household responsibilities, which could have increased the mother's life span slightly.    
    
...which can be turned around to say women died earlier if they didn't have daughters, as daughters represented the same type of help a business receives from an unpaid intern - free labor in trade for training.    
    
Attribution of shortened maternal lifespan to boy births involved speculation on the varying effects of gestation and childbirth on the body. The Daily Mail story linked in the Yahoo story even states that testosterone weakens the immune system.    
   
This idea did not make sense - If weakening of the immune system by increased testosterone shortens the lifespan, wouldn't that negatively impact on the survival of men in societies existing prior to modern advances in medicine like antibiotics?    
    
Most of the links I found in a search leading to assertions that testosterone weakens the immune system opened bodybuilding discussion forums in which laypeople were discussing the possibility, but almost nothing of a medical or research nature.    
    
Finally, I found [an interesting article on the topic on sciencedaily.com](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/1999/10/991007083730.htm) which, instead of confirming the notion, contradicts it. The article suggests that rather than suppressing the immune system, elevated testosterone actually activates it, triggering the stress response and sending immune cells to locations where the body is often the most threatened.   
    
[This news-medical.net article agrees with the notion that testosterone weakens the immune system](http://www.news-medical.net/news/2004/11/08/6138.aspx?page=1), but if the study relied on blood testing for its evidence, it may suffer from exactly the type of flaw cited in the sciencedaily article... and the news-medical.net author admits that further study is needed before applying the concept to medical treatment.     
    
Regardless, one must also consider the fact that even with elevated levels following childbirth, women are still exposed to a lower level of testosterone than men, and shortness of male lifespan is not attributed to elevated testosterone, but to [other factors](http://men.webmd.com/features/why-mens-lives-are-shorter-than-women), some of which [can be linked to *decreased* testosterone](http://kwikblog.kwikmed.com/2012/04/17/preliminary-research-shows-potential-benefits-of-testosterone-for-heart-failure-patients/). Certainly, if testosterone were as dangerous as suggested in that one line of the article, there would be more evidence in the portion of the population whose testosterone is generally higher. 
    
The Daily Mail article also suggested that the size of baby boys had an effect. However, the size of baby girls varies among women, as well, and there is nothing in any of the articles to suggest that the study controlled for that factor. Further, the difference in weight we're discussing here is an average of 100 grams (about 3.5 ounces,) not a huge gap in weight. Birth weight of babies can vary by a few pounds, and has [increased over the last generation](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=9&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;ved=0CH8QFjAI&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Faje.oxfordjournals.org%2Fcontent%2F144%2F6%2F563.full.pdf&amp;amp;ei=uuEvUf3nO4e_0QGOhIHYCA&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNFwbqJiQZNjmS-wF-2DxbQ2tmpHmA&amp;amp;sig2=ZyxhQ7EPyAoCNgQD93IqbQ&amp;amp;bvm=bv.43148975,d.dmQ), possibly [due to changes in nutrition, and apparently also affected by the mother's weight](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2022126/Why-todays-babies-born-BIG.html).     
    
There is also nothing to show whether the cited study controlled for hereditary health concerns or environmental factors unrelated to pregnancy or the sex of one's babies.     

This leaves us with a study which may be flawed in its failure to take into account factors affecting its subjects, is made inapplicable to modern populations by medical advancement, changes in environment, and changes in family planning, and doesn't provide conclusive evidence of the assertion made in the story's headline.
   
In the end, the article did provide an example in answer to two questions.     
How badly is modern media biased against males?     
How far are they willing to bend in the exercise of that bias?     
Apparently the answer is at least to the point of publishing glaring misrepresentations and exaggerations of the results of narrowly (if at all) applicable studies, if such can be done in a way that casts a negative light on the human male."

19f3nm,1,2013-02-28,Bachelor's degree in CS? Or just learn the basics and seek out an internship?,Dante2k4,web_design,https://www.reddit.com/r/web_design/comments/19f3nm/bachelors_degree_in_cs_or_just_learn_the_basics/,"I recently posted a topic here about dealing with uncertainty when first attempting to tackle this field. Everybody that posted was *very* helpful for a variety of different reasons, but one thing I noticed that was a pretty common suggestion was that I should find a job or internship or something with a company and learn from *that.*

Right now I'm learning the basics at a community college so that I can earn my transfer degree, then move on to a university and earn a bacherlors in computer science. Thing is, I feel like I'm wasting *so* much time meeting the requirements of all these other classes, which aren't teaching me *anything* relevant to what I need to know. I'm an excellent writer, I know as much math as I need, science isn't gonna help me with jack at this point, and my social science teachers have all been terrible. I *hate* taking these classes and wasting time and money on them, but I've been making myself do it so that I can transfer to my university as a junior and get my bacherlors done.

But then I'm not even sure if a bachelors is actually necessary! I know that having a degree just by itself will make me look better... but I've heard *so* many tales of people who no degree who make it in this field simply because they have the knowledge to do their jobs.

So, you all were *so* helpful to me before, I figured I'd come to you again and ask, how much do you value a degree in regards to web development? Or even in general tech support type work, which I may end up doing as well?

I am *so* fed up with taking classes that don't teach me anything of real value, and I'm really genuinely contemplating just blowing all those classes off, taking the relevant computer science classes (web design, PHP, javascripting, hardware &amp; repair, etc), and looking for an internship or entry-level job of some kind.

So what do you all say? Should I just continue to endure the shitty classes and accumulating student loans? Or should I learn the necessities and look for work as soon as possible to gain experience on the job?

Also, something I thought of during the last topic when everybody was telling me to look into internships... where should I be looking? I don't actually know where you'd find those kinds of positions &gt;_&gt;"

Ask R/Frugal time!",jazzband,Frugal,https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/19esi8/riding_on_the_tails_of_the_getting_rid_of_your/,"**TL;DR on top - because time is money! Questions on if/how we should go about downgrading our 1 really used car/1 ok used car (2 cars total) situation to only 1 family car.**

Since I was late to read the [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/19d5kv/can_we_please_stop_saying_get_rid_of_your_car_as/) about 16 hours ago (In reddit time, that's about 2 weeks), I have a unique situation where my family is looking at the idea of downsizing our car situation. I didn't want to get buried and not get the your talented money saving minds to pick apart my predicament. 

**Back story:**

We're a two car family in the mountain west (of the US).  Under both our names, my wife and I bought a (pretty used) 2007 Dodge Caliber about a year and a half ago. We were bad in not being careful in getting it inspected and overall it still has about $1200 (non- detrimental) work needing done to it and our payments are already $190 a month (not including whatever insurance is.) It's a regretful situation, but it works okay enough. 
We're not gonna be heart broken to get rid of it though.

The other car is a 1993 Suzuki Sidekick and it's kinda on it's last leg. I've had it since my college years, about 2003. It's missing the driver side mirror (wife busted it off backing out of the driveway, lol), pretty busted driver side inner door mechanism, overall outer aesthetics have fallen off over time, squeaks and squeals when driving, the steering wheel sounds like the TARDIS when it's cold out and the roof leaks when it rains or the snow melts. It's been paid off and the upkeep has been standard barring the aesthetics and minor mechanical problems but the obvious noise issues could become deeper problems in the future.

My wife works full time, less than a 10 minute walk from home. I work part, timeless than a 10 minute drive from home and will be telecommuting a design internship.  We have a young son that's still in a car seat, so we would need a reliable car (which prompted our being duped into the Caliber). 

We're trying to pare down our lifestyles to afford everything with what little we make and the idea going down to one care came up. Still, with me? OK.

**So, the questions are:**

* Should we even try to trade both in, knowing the Sidekick could bring almost nothing to the table and we're only a few grand down on our payments on the Caliber?
* If we do, how and where should we go about finding the best deal.
* We know we're dumb asses for not getting the Caliber inspected, so what other things should we look at if we trade?
* Regarding choices, what would be the ideal used car for a one car family that would meet the essentials of lowered payments, reliability and functionality? We are **NOT** particular about aesthetic but sheer utility.

We appreciate any insight that you all can gives us. This can be another wonderful discussion about many other options of lifestyle changes as well. THANKS!"

19edaj,71,2013-02-28,UPDATE: My Mother-in-law is driving me insane and I feel like she is taking advantage of us for money. Please help,[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/19edaj/update_my_motherinlaw_is_driving_me_insane_and_i/,"[Link to original post here](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/199q4i/my_motherinlaw_is_driving_me_insane_and_i_feel/)


I spoke with my husband about how I felt about the whole situation, and he went over to his parents to discuss the situation. When he came home, he walked in the door and refused to speak to me. He stomped around the apartment cleaning up and would not acknowledge me at all. I finally asked him if he would like to talk, and he said ""about what?"" When I finally got him to talk, he explained to me that he forgot to tell me that his mom had told him before we even got married that she planned to claim him on her taxes for 2012. I was angry that he had this conversation and made a financial decision of that nature with his mother instead of me, and he said ""we weren't even married yet anyway!"" I then asked him why he is okay with his mom taking his education credit, because it is for his education which he pays for in full and the fact that we owe the government over $40,000 for our education. He explained that when he went to his parents, they sobbed and said they are in a bad place financially, so he decided to give them his education credit money as a gift to ""help them out."" I, admittedly, lost my cool and freaked the f out. I can't believe that he sat down and talked to me and felt uncomfortable with the situation, but then he went over there, listened to his parents cry for two hours, and suddenly he wants to help them out. 

I am the most upset that he made a large financial decision with his parents and omitted me from discussion entirely. When I explained to him why I felt uncomfortable with the way that his mother approached the situation, he screamed at me that I am insane and told me I had fifteen minutes before he was leaving. While I tried to talk him down, he repeatedly looked at his watch and then started putting on his coat and boots. I sobbed.. I couldn't believe he would leave me over something so small and so silly.. I can't believe I can't question his parents without him calling me insane. When I was talking, he shoved his finger in my mouth to prevent me from talking and lunged at me to get me out of the way of the door. I slapped his hand out of my mouth when he did this. I can't believe it escalated to this point.. I never expected it to become such a huge issue.

I am terrified at the fact that this is such a small issue.. In the big scheme of things, this is likely the smallest issue that we will encounter in our marriage. He divulged to me that he is a person that will ""do everything in his power to avoid conflict"" and feels that I do not pay enough attention to him and he is lonely (I work 60 hours a week, 16 hours a week are an unpaid internship, and I am also taking 3 college courses. I commute an hour one way four days a week - so he probably does feel lonely, I am friggin busy). 

I should have kept my cool and not gotten so upset. I should have prepared what I was going to say before he got home, because I knew that he would change his mind after talking to his parents. I knew he would side with them, because he always does. He purchased a vehicle without speaking to me once about it, he went over to his parents, stayed there for two days, and then surprise! He had a new car. He didn't even go to purchase the vehicle, his parents did it for him while he was working. There are many situations when he has made important financial decisions with his parents instead of me. I am offended that they feel that it is okay to make these kinds of decisions with their married son without considering his wife, and I am pissed that he thinks its okay to cut me out. He told me that I am ""too immature"" to make decisions with him, so ""until I grow up, he is going to keep making decisions with his parents.""

The whole ordeal ended with him calming down, telling me that he is trying to create boundaries, and that ""the taxes this year will be the last thing, I promise."" When I asked him how I was supposed to trust that he was going to make large financial decisions with me instead of his parents, he said ""yeah, I am totally going to go out and buy a boat and a vacation home. What other financial decisions will I be making in the near future anyway?"" 

I am shocked that he thinks it is okay to talk down to me. I am shocked that he thinks it is okay to decide financial stuff without me. I fear that, regardless of the situation, he will side with his parents. I refuse to ask him to choose between us because that is unfair. I don't want him to lose his family, I never had, but he insists that I am trying to force him to cut off his family. I don't want that. I know that if I did make him choose, he would not pick me. I don't know if I can live with that. "
