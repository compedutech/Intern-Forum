I'm moving to Vancouver/Burnaby BC area in September for an internship for 4 months at a Video Game study (as a video game programmer).

Won't know anyone so I figured i'd see if I could meet people through reddit.

I've made friends before through POF so why not here as well :)"

I am a graduate student about to finish my masters in structural engineering. The US-school I have attended is well known for its petroleum and offshore oil-industry links. I have internship experience in the offshore oil industry, and I'm currently seeking a full-time position for after my December graduation.

Anyway, I'm conducting a broad search, and I'm not limiting myself to domestic positions. I know Norway has a large offshore oil industry and may need qualified technical people. I am fluent in only English, but I could certainly learn another language. I'm interested in Norway because it seems to be strong in the offshore oil industry, and I do have a fair amount of ancestors from Norway (though this was several generations ago, too far back to have an impact on immigration.)

Basically I'm wondering if anyone has any experience on this. Does anyone know anything about the Norwegian offshore oil industry? Is there a need for technical people from abroad? How does one go about finding such a position?"
cz46g,16,2010-08-09,I fucked up.,ididsomethingstupid,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/cz46g/i_fucked_up/,"My girlfriend and I have been dating for about 9 months now. Me 21, her 20. We haven't been as sexually active as we used to be (weird to say after dating only 9 months). It used to be daily, then weekly, now monthly+ thing. I have mentioned numerous times in non-argumentative ways how I have wanted this to change i.e. ""Hey it is really important for me that we have a strong sexual connection in our relationship."" Her: ""I know, I like sex with you, we will have sex tomorrow because I am too tired tonight."" Story repeats all the time. I asked if it was performance and she said no as she comes easily.

Now, one of the new interns at my work (CIO's niece O_o) started to really have a thing for me. We have hung out a few times (did nothing out of line) as a group with other co-workers. Another time, she asked me to come hang with her and her friend at her Uncle's(the CIO) house where she was staying. Went there, played video games, and again nothing happened. Nothing ever came up about dating or if either of us had a boyfriend/girlfriend (as I didn't get the impression she felt that way about me). However, she did know I had a girlfriend.

Now comes Saturday night. She was going to the club with some of her friends and a bunch of people from work. She invited me and I accepted. I met up with her there and danced a bit and I had a drink or two. Then when we were dancing, she grabbed me and we made out. I am in no way blaming the alcohol for me making out with her. I knew what I was doing but I did it anyway. My girlfriend is NEVER forward like this which is a huge turn on for me and I have mentioned that to my girlfriend as well but nothing changed.

I have decided to tell my girlfriend for two reasons. I want to own up to my mistakes, even though she will most likely dump me. The second, I know she will find out in one way or another and if I want any chance at a continued relationship with her, I know I have to own up to it. However, I am starting to like this new girl a lot.

In you experience Reddit, should I try to salvage my relationship or is it time to move on to new opportunities?

TL;DR I have a girlfriend, made out with CIO's niece, salvage relationship or move on?"

We shared a house together, have two dogs, and until a few days ago, I thought everything was fine...

I'm finishing my doctoral degree in engineering (should be done in about a year), and took a summer internship which had me about 1000 miles away for three months.  She is a few years older and works for the government, so she obviously stayed in our home, no big deal, it was only three months. During that time, she expressed that she was unhappy that we are still in the area near my university (major metropolitan area, it's not like we're in the middle of nowhere) because she grew up in the area and didn't imagine we'd be still be here when she moved in with me three years ago.  We never talked about any of this at the time, it was just something that happened.  I told her I understood, and began to make plans so we could move to wherever we needed to be for her to be happy, I could finish my dissertation wherever and didn't need to be on campus.  The summer progressed, she visitted several times, and I made several trips to visit her.  Every single one of them was absolutely amazing.  During one of the trips we talked about marriage, looked at rings, and joked about getting married at some point in the future.  We've been talking about the future for a while, and I was taking the steps to make everything we both wanted happen.

Flash forward to my homecoming.  She says she doesn't feel well (in all fairness she had a terrible week of travel for work), but otherwise, everything is absolutely fine.  We had a nice dinner, played with our dogs, and went to bed.  The next day, we hung out at a baseball game, went to dinner with friends, and spent Sunday night like we spend most Sundays, watching True Blood on the coutch.  We go to bed, I lean over to kiss her good night, and I notice she is just kind of there and very diengaged.  I ask her if everything is alright, and she says ""No... I'm not alright... I'm not happy...""

She proceeds to tell me that she has been ""dreading me coming home every single day,"" and that she ""just wants to be alone right now.""  She thinks I'm ""an amazing, absolutely brilliant person who [she] has an amazing time with..."" but that she ""has a lot of amazing people in her life, and she doesn't want to be in a relationship with them either right now.""  She doesn't understand what after five years, she still doesn't want to be married, and she doesn't want to keep ""forcing it.""  To top it off, she added that ""you're not supposed to marry someone you can live with, you're supposed to marry someone you can't live without.. and there's no one [she] can't live without...""

After several hours of back and forth, we get down to the fact that we work well together, we have the same goals in life, we have the same interests, she is essentially the female version of me.  But... she is incapable of being happy with another person, because that would mean that she wouldn't be in 100% control over her future and herself, and that somehow makes her a weak person.  She is unwilling to be responsible for another person's feelings regardless of how much she enjoys being with that person, or how much that person loves her in return.

If there was a reason why things didn't work out, I could understand.  If we weren't good for each other, didn't enjoy our time together, or we wanted different things in life, I could understand. I just don't understand her, and I don't understand this.  I feel like I'm losing the person I am supposed to be with, and I can't do anything about it.  I have never met another person who understands me the way she does, or to whom I would give anything to keep from pain or hurt or to provide for.  We challenged each other, we supported each other being our own people and having our own lives, we had an amazing life together.  I don't understand how she just walks away...

I was completely blindsided.  I have no idea what to do right now, I feel like every plan I had made for my future is out of the window, and I am completely lost.  It's cliche as hell, but I feel like my heart has been ripped out, and I am missing out on the chance to spend my life with my soul mate.  This absolutely sucks."

Advice greatly appreciated.",grad_school_blues,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/d18xu/im_applying_for_phd_programs_and_my_boyfriend/,"Hi Reddit, I'm a 22 year old female, currently dating a 25 year old guy.  We've been together for a year and a couple months.  (We don't live together; we live in the same neighborhood.)  Everything's been going great--but there's one big problem.  It seems that, at this point, our respective career choices are totally incompatible.  I want my PhD, and eventually a research position at a University, and he wants to be very active in the startup community in the city we currently live in.

We're both already more than on our way to our respective (career) goals.  He's currently working for a local startup, and absolutely loves his job.  I'm just finishing a research internship on the other side of the country (we live in the USA), and will be applying this fall for programs starting in Fall 2011. 

This across-country internship made us realize that 6 years of a long distance relationship isn't possible for us--2.5 months was hellish enough.  (We talked about it, and came to that consensus.)

So, it seems like the only option for me to pursue my PhD and for us to stay together would be for me to go to a University in the city we currently live in.  However, there's only one school in our city that I'd consider going to for grad school--and it's consistently ranked #1-3 for grad schools in my field.  So, if I get in, problem (temporarily) solved.  However, I obviously can't count on getting in.

So, it seems like my options are:

* If I don't get into the school in my city, say the relationship was nice while it lasted, and leave it at that.

* If I don't get into the school in my city, try to defer for a year for the schools I did get into (I think this is possible?), apply to said school again, and then make a final decision.

* Get into the school in my city, and then pretend this problem doesn't exist for the next 6 years.  (I can't really control where I get accepted for post-docs or research positions, either.)

So, any advice?  I just can't see how any of my options don't eventually make me choose between the career I want and a relationship I want."

I recently graduated and moved out to a new city.

By coincidence we both ended up on the other side of the country. She landed a summer internship and I just landed a job.

Most of the interactions have been harmless and I would have no problem telling my old roommate.

This weekend we were at a club, Michelle was adamant about taking me back to her place.

Initially Michelle was going to share her bed with her friend Kelly who also spent the night out with us.  I got the twin bed in the other room. 

Next thing I know I find myself sharing the bed with Michelle who is trying to pull my pants off.  (most of you are probably facepalming at this point, but stay with me) 

Michelle knows I normally sleep in my boxers so I really can't tell if she was trying to make me comfortable or **comfortable**. I decline and decide to keep my clothes on.

There was some physical interaction not quite cuddling /spooning but she was lying on me. We ended up talking for a bit and then went to sleep.

Was it the alcohol making her extra friendly or did I miss an open invite?

Then there's the issue of man laws. Your roommate's girlfriend is off limits. Since I moved out I'm technically not roommates anymore and there's no ring on her finger. It still seems like a dick move though.

so reddit am I reading too much into the situation or do I have the opportunity to be the other guy?"
d1z9k,9,2010-08-16,Another whiny post. Sorry.,ffoffail,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/d1z9k/another_whiny_post_sorry/,"I hate doing this. I'm sorry, I'm sure you read posts like this all the time. I just would like some anonymous advice coming from an anonymous person. 

My family has a history of depression, alcoholism, and other serious mental disorders. I've accepted that I am very prone to receiving them, and more so accept that I have one. 

When I was 15 my depression started. I was accepting my sexual orientation (gay), getting a fresh new start in High School, and continuing a rocky relationship with my parents (we are very passionate people who refuse to admit when we are wrong). This made me feel very lonely and upset. I started drinking almost nightly to help deal with it. One night I was about to kill myself when one of my friends came to my house and forced me to stay alive. Ironically my parents never let me speak to this person again because they believe that she made me gay (they don't believe this anymore) and that she made me have depression. 

I started going to therapy after my parents found cut marks on my arm. My first therapist literally gave me an internet test and diagnosed me with bipolar disorder and wanted to prescribe me some sort of anti bipolar medication. We didn't take it because it was too early to say that I have depression. Later we found out that she was getting paid by the company that makes those medicines and she lost her license. None the less, this gave me a complete distrust towards psychiatrists.

I went to another therapist later on but did not enjoy it. I faked my way threw it because I didn't appreciate his attitude and the way he treated me and my religion/activities (running, I hated it, he loved it). I kept on going to him because my parents liked him and I figured I could give an hour of my week if it eases their mind. I convinced him, my parents, and I now think myself that I was okay and over my depression.

During the rest of high school I devoted myself to extracurricular activities, mostly Speech and Debate and our Green Club. I have never been the best student for some reason or another, but activities have been my forte. 

Fast forward to college/present day. I moved 4 hours away from home to go to college because I strongly disliked my hometown and felt that I needed a break from my parents. During college I decided to follow up on the same path that I left in High School. I devoted myself to extra curricular activities (College Democrats (which I'm the president of), Alliance (Activism and Communications chair), and I was part of my hall government before I moved out). My schoolwork hasn't been the best, but it hasn't been the worst. I changed my major from Computer Science to Politicial Science. 

I love politics so much that I applied for an internship working for the 2010 elections. This also gave me a chance to get a head start on our 2010 GOTV plan for our campus.

During college I've met some of the best people that I could imagine, including my best friend/boyfriend. I've been in two long relationships before (neither ended on bad terms, but just happened to end) and can honestly say that I have told him more about myself and opened up more to him than anyone else, and I know that he has done the same to me. My parents and my relationship has gotten much better. 

Despite everything going right for me I still feel like the biggest failure on the planet. I feel that I will never be able to move forward or make any sort of small difference in society. Despite me being in a relationship with an amazing guy who I trust more than anything I feel more alone than ever. For some reason I can't bare to tell him how depressed I have become because I fear that he will view me as whiny and spoiled (he comes from a much more difficult background than mine which is obviously a very lucky background with a few small kinks) and him leaving me. 

I have never felt more empty in my life. Despite finding the best friends, doing exactly what I want, having a great relationship, having a better relationship with my parents, an extremely fun internship where I've met a lot of great people and learned a lot about my interests. 

What am I doing wrong?"

In Phoenix, the last time I weighed myself (End of June), I tipped the scales at 250. I am now 230 pounds.

In Phoenix, you have to drive EVERYWHERE. Even down the street to a friend's house cause it's so goddamn hot. In Boston, you can walk EVERYWHERE. Twice a week I go out to Wellesley on the T, get off the subway car and walk to my internship. I end up walking around 5 miles each time I go out there.

I also do not have a paying job yet so the grocery bill is being cut. I am not getting as much protein as I used to. On the positive side, I'm not drinking soda or eating fast food. I have no funds to join a gym. I walk at least a mile every day (besides going out to my Internship) between going to the library or walking a friend to work.

I am afraid that most of what I'm losing is muscle. In fact, I'm almost certain of it.

What can I do now, with no liquid funds, to reverse this trend? I want to lose fat, not weight (fittit has taught me so). Should I try cutting the carbs in my diet and putting more protein back into it?

What can I do in the future, after I earn an income stream, to continue the reversed trend? I am slightly skeptical that as soon as I have money I'll be out buying cigarettes and soda again, so I guess this is more of a question of motivation than anything else. 

TL;DR: Losing muscle, not fat. Help me fittit."

Frequent Fittit lurker here, and first-time poster.  Been through the FAQ but it doesn't specifically address my issue.


Background: I'm 19 years old, 5'10"", 155lbs.  A bit on the scrawny side and my goal is to get stronger and whatever growth comes about naturally as a result of that.


For several reasons, I'm in a situation at the moment where I can't really be eating the amount of protein/calories that Fittit recommends.  I usually eat two boiled eggs and a banana for breakfast, then two more bananas before lunch, and then lunch (which isn't especially nutritious or voluminous due to it being a free meal at the staff canteen of my summer internship company) and dinner (also at staff canteen, unless I go pay up for a Subway sandwich).  


However, I'm currently on week 3 of [Stronglifts 5x5](http://stronglifts.com/stronglifts-5x5-beginner-strength-training-program/) and things seem to be going great.  I started with mostly empty bars (20kg) to get my form right, but each workout feels like palpable progress and I'm feeling great about the whole thing.


My question is, what can I expect from possibly not having my diet match up to workouts?  Is it alright, since I'm a beginner?  Are plateaus inevitable without sufficient intake?  Is it okay to start eating more *once I hit those plateaus*?  Right now I seem to be getting more toned and losing the slight belly flab I usually have, so I'm cautiously optimistic.


Thanks, and please let me know if there are more details I can provide."

So, here is the deal. I am moving to DC for 3 months for an internship. I have a cat who I love, but unfortunately, even after tons of searching, I can find no place that will let her come with me while I live there. My parents would watch her, but she has a hard time living with other cats. She is perfectly fine when living alone with me, but she cannot stand to be around other cats or use the same litter box as them. I have tried everything I can think of, but it looks like I might have to get rid of her if I can't find a place for her to stay for 3 months. None of my friends can take her in, as they are either in college dorms or apartments that don't allow pets, and I am at a total loss. I really can't lose her just because of 3 months. 

So please, if you would not mind housing a small black kitty for 3 months, let me know. I would be happy to help with food and litter, and she has toys, a litter box, and a little bed she likes to sleep in already.

I am a 21 year old, 3rd year Software Engineering student from Canada looking for a job/adventure during the Winter 2011 semester (January-April).


The engineering program I'm in features co-op study program so essentially I'm in class for 4 months, then off working for 4 months and it alternates until graduation. I would love to take one of my work co-ops internationally in the United Kingdom (preferably Scotland :) ).


Now I have browsed the University of Edinburgh's career center for student jobs but it seems that the general idea is that most student internships are unpaid, this would pose a problem. Here in Canada thats considered illegal-ish but it is common in the United States because it is more of a ""learning experience"". 


Now I don't want to give up on my search just yet so I wanted to ask all of you if you have heard of temporary paid student positions before? I also wanted to know if you have heard of any software development or related companies that are successful enough to warrant a junior developer, I have heard that there are some big game development companies, any big names?


Just to give you an idea, I have a decent background in web development but I am more interested in control systems and automation. Not that I would be picky of course because if I wanted another work-term in a field I was interested in I could just stay in Canada... but I would like a change of scenery to something new and exciting. I'm really looking for anything as long as its related enough to my field of study so that it can count toward my degree.

d468d,1,2010-08-22,Ideas on how to green computing and electronics?,[deleted],environment,https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/d468d/ideas_on_how_to_green_computing_and_electronics/,"Hello all,

*So I've always wanted to make a comprehensive list of ways to make people's computer use as green as possible.  I understand this is a mammoth task, but here's the ideas I have so far:

*Conserve.  Don't leave your computer plugged in if it's at 100% battery or off.  Print double-sided when possible.  Use your computer as long as possible before buying a new one.  Try replacing hardware to keep up as long as you can.

*Conserve (sort of).  This one is more abstract: Use the appropriate service for your needs.  YouTube is not a music site; do not use it as one.  You get low quality audio (usually less than 128 cbr, which is very noticeable on good speakers) at high bit rate (the video stream, even if it's a static image, puts the bit rate over 300 cbr for most videos; it goes much higher for higher resolution videos).  This wastes a lot of data, which is moved about by electricity.  Use dedicated music services for streaming like Pandora or Grooveshark.  Better yet, if you plan to listen to a song a lot, just buy it.  Downloading a 4mb song that you listen to twenty times uses less resources than streaming that same song at 1mb per completion, twenty times.  (As for that, I don't know what to say about methods of data transfer . . . torrenting eliminates the need for server farms, but ratio needs at private trackers cause many to leave their computers on for extra periods of time in opes of seeding.)

*Volunteer your unused e-resources.  This is my fave: Let your computer use your extra CPU to perform calculations on a climate model through [BOINC](http://boinc.berkeley.edu/) (Berkeley Open Interface Network Computing).  I have mine limited to only running when my laptop is plugged in and to not use more than 60% CPU (to avoid overheating and slow down).  So if I'm writing a paper (and thus only using like 5% of my CPU), I donated half of my computer's power to improving UC Berkeley's climate models.

*Donate or recycle your computer and hardware.  If you want to donate it, but are afraid people will find a way to steal your personal info, either remove the hard drive or have it wiped by a licensed professional.  If you recycle, do it through a legitimate agency.  Unfortunately, I don't think there is a way to verify this in the US.

*Demand respect for the environment.  Many computer companies have only started recycling programs and environmentally-friendly design programs because the market has shown that those things are desired.  Make sure that you let companies know what you want by sending a message as a consumer.

Does anyone else have any ideas?  I hope to make a guide/presentation on this topic when I start my internship with my school's environmental office this fall."
d4wca,10,2010-08-24,Am I in the friend zone?,throwawayrarst,seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/d4wca/am_i_in_the_friend_zone/,"It's usually pretty clear to me if I've been LJBF'ed, but this situation is a little different.

I met this girl a couple years ago back when I was in a LTR.  We were friends, had the odd cup of coffee together, etc.  We stayed out of contact for the better part of a year (she was on an internship).  Shortly after she came back I was single.

It turns out she was unaware of my breakup the first couple times I saw her, but since she has found out I've been getting the impression that she's interested in me because she's gone from random coffee breaks, to dinners and drinks, etc.  In the latest case I had mentioned that I was going to a particular concert and within the week I got a message from her saying she had bought a ticket to it too.

I'm unsure how to proceed.  Mainly I'm trying to figure out how to get more kino in as I didn't touch her much before (remember, I was in a LTR) and it would seem kind of awkward to start doing that now.

Is there any easy way to tell if I've been LJBF'ed?  I don't ever hear from her about problems, ex-bfs, guys she's interested in, etc.

**EDIT**: Goddamn I'm dumb.  Everyone on the Internet is aware I'm not in the friendzone from a brief description of the situation.  I met her for coffee today and it suddenly turned into an hour and half long chit chat.

2. Relationship type: Met in college and we've been together for nearly 1 year. Because of my housing situation, we actually lived together for about 4-5 months (we had been together for about 4-5 months beforehand). We have each since both finished college and moved back home to our parent's house, we now live about a  40min car ride away. We used to hang out together 24/7, but since moving back home we now only able to see each other a few times a week. While I do miss being with her daily, I am okay with this but she has not taken it so well. It has been about 3 months in this situation and my love for her has not changed due to the drop in time spent together.
3. I have talked to her about this, and she knows I am upset, but I don't think she truely understand how unhappy it makes me feel. I don't think I can ever tell her everything I'm feeling (not good with expressing my emotions in the first place), but more so I feel like she will not be able to handle how unhappy I am. For the last few months, I have not been able to sleep very well, which has led me to stay up very late at night because my mind is always 100mph before bed. She has been to a school counselor before our relationship, and also went to a few sessions while we were still in school. Also, she is currently working at a temporary internship, in a very bad environment where she feels overworked and under appreciated. I feel like this environment is 10x worse for her than it would be for anyone else in that situation.
She has talked to her mother, and is planning to speak with a professional soon.
4. Problem: She has occurances, about once a week, where she feels anxious and depressed but doesn't know why. I try to lift her mood by telling her I love her and that everything will be okay, but it does not ever seem to help much. She  also sometimes feels like I don't care or love her enough, and misses me so much even when we just recently hung out for the entire day. She gets very sad when I have to, whether it is off the phone or home.

5. Her past: she has been through a lot, especially with her parents, family, and past boyfriends. Talking to her, it seems that she has never lived up to her father's expectations. She has a better and good relationship with her mother. Despite this, I can tell that everyone in the family really does love her, even though their way of displaying affection is different or not the ""norm"" (i love you, hugs etc). A few years ago she found out her dad was cheating on her mom, a little after that time, she found out that her boyfriend was planning, or already (i'm not sure) cheating on her. I am definitely not planning or thinking about cheating on her, I love her too much. I don't think she is afraid I am going to cheat on her, but the thought still affects her because of her experiences.

6. I am not a psychologist nor do I think I am qualified to diagnose her, but I believe she possibly is codepedent, manic depressive, or bipolar. Not all these things, but I feel she displays many of these symtpoms.

tl;dr: I think my gf has mental illness; some sort of depression. I try my best to help her through it but I am now it has caused me to feel very depressed myself. I can't tell her how I truely feel because i think it will just exaccerbate her situation, and make her feel more depressed. I have told her that I really think that she needs to seek help, she has agreed and has taken a few steps to do this.

Please help me, I love her so much, but I don't know how much more this I can handle :( I know this is A LOT, but please let me know if I missed anything or if you need anymore additional information. thank you for taking the time to read all this."

Can you possibly help me out?",TescoValueThrowaway,reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/d717r/reddit_my_love_life_is_currently_nonexistent_can/,"Hey reddit, I've got a problem and you guys always seem so good at sorting things out so I'd like some advice.  Obvious throwaway account because I do not want to personally identify myself.  I'm going to offer a bit of backstory and some of the problems I seem to be faced with.  Apologies in advance for the length of this post and thanks for reading.

I'm a 22 year old guy and turning 23 in December, and I graduated from University in early June and am starting a Masters degree in October.  All summer, I have done nothing of note apart from a one week family holiday because there are very few jobs or internships available where I live (south West England).

Essentially, my love life is non-existent.  While I was at University I feel like I worked too hard and as a result I didn't socialize as much as I probably should have done which ruined the experience somewhat.  At the grand old age of 22 I have *never had a girlfriend*.  Sounds weird but it's true, and to be honest it's starting to wear me down and make me feel inadequate and feeble.

My first kiss was aged 19 towards the end of my second year at University and since then I have only pulled about six girls.  I have done lots of groping, spooning, kissing and heavy petting but never anything naked, and I have never had foreplay and am still a virgin.  All of my activity with girls has involved at least a small amount of alcohol as I am a bit shy and lacking in confidence, and there are a number of girls I grew pretty close to and them to me (some of them were definitely interested with some even texting me like girls do when they're interested).

This is hardly anything considering my friends are all screwing like rabbits on viagra whereas I have nothing, and I really feel like life has passed me by.  I can't turn the clock back and it feels like such a waste.  I've only been on three sort of half-dates which was nice although I didn't ask any of the girls out - I went to a show with a girl and her friend and I met up with the girl before the other guy turned up and we had a drink (I liked that girl) and the second one was with a girl I lived with at University as we were meant to be going out as a group, but the others decided they didn't want to so we went on our own.  It was also quite nice, we had a nice chat and a quiet cozy drink in a pub together but we fell out weeks later when it turned out she thought I was coming on to her, so she began to shun me which made me very angry and upset because I could see no clear reason for it.  In December 2008, I got hopelessly drunk and came within 10 minutes of having a one night stand and losign my virginity.  We got back to the girl's (not one of the aforementioned girls) flat but she suddenly changed her mind and asked me to leave despite she had been leading me on basically all night previous to this, and I still can't work out why.  I have several long term close female friends who have rated me as an 7.5 or 8 out of 10 on the looks scale (sorry, no pics) and they have tried very hard to encourage me and cheer me up.  I have had problems with unrequited love on a small number of occasions and I think I'm getting too hung up on looks as there was one girl who obviously really took to me and I liked her personality, but she just wasn't good looking enough somehow.  There was another girl who texted me for the whole of Summer 2009 because I met her in a club and kissed her, but again it was my fault that we never dated or made anything of it.

I was teased and picked on at school whenever I showed an interest in anything at all, including girls so I think this has damaged me because even now I'm conscious of what my old school peers might think if I were to ever enter a relationship.  My sense of humour isn't what it was (I used to really make people laugh but now I can barely crack a smile) and I think I subconscioulsy push people away when they try to get close which makes relationships difficult so I do wonder if I'm suffering from a form of depression.  I can't really relate to other peoples feelings beside my own (this is quite a recent change)

I basically have one more crack at University to get all this sorted out, but I'm worried that I'm going to be far too busy to socialize enough to make it happen.  At this rate I can honestly see myself hiring escorts and using online dating, sad and pathetic as it is, next October as I leave University for good and any opportunities I had will be gone forever.  Society says I'm screwed and destined to live alone and miserable forever because I didn't get my first girlfriend aged 12 or have sex at 14.  My lack of sexual experience at age 22 is embarrassing and it would be really obvious if I ever slept with a girl properly.

I realize most of what I have written here is self pity and I've probably brought some of it on myself, albeit involuntarily, but I do genuinely want to put it right and I need some help in doing so.

Thank you for reading.  I'll answer any questions as best as I can and all comments and suggestions are welcome."
