We have being together more than a year now.  A year and 2 months. We both still students, and we both still live at home with our parents. He started his first year at university on September this year . Im at this moment at my 3de year of my bachelor. And I’m doing my internship at a tourism company at this moment. Recently we argue a lot, like really a lot. I get mad at him so often. His actions triggers me. And since that he started with his new school, his actions seems to me changed a lot. He is getting busier and busier. Busy with school, after school parties and going out with his mates and girl friends. We don’t see each other as frequent as in the past anymore. I feel that he is keeping a distance from me. Even in the evening we used to call each other and sometimes till we both fell asleep. We saw each other in the past also more often than now. 

But the fights that we had recently gets him numb. He told me that he starts to feel normal every time when i get mad.  He could easily walk away from our fight than before because it doesn’t bothers him that much anymore. And leave me just behind in middle of the fight.

It scared me when he said that. What should I do? Is he going to keep feeling like this? Is there a way that he ever comeback to me and say that he miss me and wants to speak to me more often and see me more often. I feel like this is going to end... but he says that he still loves me only he need some more time. What is happening and how long is it going to take till i get that old lovely boy back... am i losing him?"

—————————————

Honey,

We have been married over three years now. I am filing for legal separation today. After reassessing my feelings for you, and taking a thorough inventory of our relationship, I have decided that it is time to man up, grow a set of testicles, and cut you from my life like the malignant tumor you are.

As a courtesy to you, and as fair warning for all women out there, I have posted this on Craigslist hoping you read this letter as you are always reading these rants, and every other woman out there, knows what is coming as the wages of the described course of behavior.

Let's start with sex: We were at an amazing resort in French Polynesia on the first day of our honeymoon: over-the-water bungalows, lavish buffets, still, blue lagoons, crystal-clear to the bottom...Wow, was I blown away! Then I had this great idea...""Let's have sex!"" I mean, what the hell? It was our honeymoon, after all. ""I'm tired."" (in your whiny tone) was your response. ""Yeah, but it's our honeymoon! We're in paradise, for crying out loud, let's get it on!"" ""I guess I have to,"" was your response. Boy, did that make me randy... The next couple of days were a study in sexual procrastination and avoidant behavior on your part. Trying to finagle sex from you had, overnight, become like pulling teeth. Suddenly there were politics involved...not like the entire year before, when you were good to go, 24/7/365.

At the risk of presenting as disjointed, or lacking in continuity, let me interrupt my own letter to pose a question at this juncture: What on earth, outside of regular, willing, and adventurous sex, do you think you have to offer a man? Do you think I married you for your company?...your intellect? Do you think I find following you through Target with a shopping cart more interesting than kicking back with my male friends? Do you think you have a single insight into politics, philosophy, religion, life, sports, finance, or general trivia that has ever shed a single photon of illumination upon my perspective? You do not. Let me be clear: there is nothing, besides the promise of regular, enjoyable sex, that I ever wanted from you...that would ever have made me consider committing to you for the rest of my life. Once sex became an unwilling labor for you, I stopped wanting even that. Men want willing sex. Rapists want unwilling sex. Outside of willing, eager participation in sex, you are nothing but a nuisance, a liability, an annoying distraction, interrupting my otherwise constant state of serenity, and my flow of good ideas.
Oh, back to my story: It was day four of ten of our honeymoon when you pronounced, ""I'm not expected to have sex with you every day."" ""Of course not,"" I politely answered. ""But this is our honeymoon. We're on the other side of the world, in the South Pacific. People would kill to be where we are right now."" I should have noted the huge red flag waving when, some weeks before, you tried to make the case that it would be fun to take some friends along on our honeymoon, and maybe even your grandmother, and we could all hang out the whole time. ""Wouldn't that be fun?"" Let me answer all women on the planet here and now: Hell no! That would not, by any stretch of the imagination, be fun.

It was about the same day that I realized how poor a conversationalist you were. Somehow, over the prior year, when you were fucking me six ways from Sunday, I had overlooked and/or simply rationalized the gigantic reality that you were, quite simply, stupid as a post.

Anyway, there I was, ten grand into the most potentially romantic, amorous, and otherwise amazing bonding experience ever put together; and I had as my companion a tyrant who refused to have sex...or who offered nastily, ""If you want me to pretend I like it, I will."" It was then, immediately, that my eye began to wander.

She was the French girl who worked behind the counter at our hotel...an intern from some hotel school program in France. She was a little goofy looking: big, bulgy eyes, a bit of a swayback. Still, she was kind of sexy somehow. Upon checking in, I had thought she was an atypical Frenchie, who was uncharacteristically friendly. There, one evening, as I was exchanging some traveler's checks for the local currency while you laid on your already-becoming-lazy ass in the room, she asked me how my honeymoon was going. I was at a loss for words. I'm sure my facial expression told the whole story. Perceptive creature that she was, she flashed an unmistakable look, and touched my hand for much too long to be accidental. ""Have you been to the spa?"" she asked me. I had not. ""Oh, you really must see it."" She said something to her manager in French, and, in no time flat, she was kindly walking me down the darkened path to the spa. Good Lord. It was like those cheesy porn movies of old where the mailman shows up at the door to deliver a ""package,"", and the lady tenant's towel falls off. It was that easy. Can I just add one more ironic detail? Her name was actually Marie! How poetic is that?

Let me ask you something: Did you ever even wonder why I stopped hounding you about sex on our honeymoon? I'm sure you, in your way of rationalizing things, thought that you had won; and that I had accepted your embargo. It was, in fact, simply because that need was being met elsewhere. Two weeks into our sham of a marriage, I was getting serviced somewhere else. As unbelievable as it sounds, it was happening. I have to tell you, more pleasurable than the strange, new, clandestine sex itself, with an otherwise unremarkable woman, was the satisfaction of completely undermining your false and inflated sense of power. Let me assure you: that was just the beginning. I say ""unremarkable?"" Still, she was certainly one for the check list, and my how the check list has grown, and how those numbers keep moving closer to thirty.
Somehow you took on this persona of a wife in control. I listened, almost laughing out loud, as you gave relationship advice to your girlfriends, colleagues and cousins over the phone. You were so confident. Had I closed my eyes, I would have thought Oprah Winfrey was waxing philosophical in the background.

After the honeymoon, the drought continued. You grudgingly gave it up once a week for a while. Still, you had become rather critical. You called it ""coaching me,"" or ""teaching you what I like."" Funny, you had never had a single complaint before we got married. It was all wild and free back then. In a matter of weeks, the occasional sex you were willing to give up became a chore for me, not even worth the effort, too humiliating and frustrating to bother with. Eventually, I lost all interest in you. When I did decide to give it a go, I found myself having to conjure up all sorts of visions of all sorts of illicit encounters in order to be able to perform for you. In contrast, I was having no difficulty whatsoever outside the marriage. Eventually, I was able to use the excitement of my extramarital affairs to conjure up some grudging wood for you.

Let me be clear, so that the memories can start to click back into place for you, I have tagged, slept with, and had trysts with almost every restaurant hostess with whom you have ever though I was too friendly. I have followed up on every counter girl, every book clerk, every sales assistant, masseuse and apprentice...even the parts girl at the car dealership, and, yes...one of your very own girlfriends...everyone who ever gave that knowing flash...that tacit go-ahead. I have gone back later. I have talked to them. I have closed the deal with more of them than I would ever have thought possible in my wildest dreams. The head I have received in elevators, in dressing rooms, in staircases, in their apartments (twenty minutes, in-and-out while out running errands); the soccer moms shopping at target...the women I have encountered buying oranges at Whole Foods, or walking their dogs. I swear to you that I have had the most exciting sex of my entire life over the past three years of marriage...and none of it has ever been with you.
Now you want a baby. Let me just say that if I were some outsider hearing this story; I would pronounce a complete idiot the man who would stupidly impregnate you. NO!!!, I'm getting out while the getting is good, baby and child support-free. It occurs to me that I may have to pay a year and a half of alimony. Let me say in advance that it will be worth every penny to be rid of you at last.

Women of the world, heed this advice. Heed it good; and don't you ever think that you and your magic vagina are the exception to these few very simple rules: Take care of your man. Treat him right. Shower him with love and respect, and yes, I mean take care of his physical needs...satisfy him sexually. Wear him out. If you want to guarantee fidelity in your marriage, there is a simple way to achieve that: Never let your husband leave the house with a single drop of semen remaining in his body. Trust me, if he is not dumping it at home, he is dumping it somewhere, unless he is a hopelessly unattractive, beat-down loser. When you use sex for power and control, you do damage that cannot be undone. When you withhold sex and affection from your husband you drive a wedge between you and your man. Not only that, you drive him elsewhere to get his needs met. It is that simple. For the record, let me assure you that the world is literally brimming with women who are very happy to be a friendly port in the long, nasty storm. There are people out there who take satisfaction in undermining your hollow little conquest of controlling the sex in your marriage.

Let me further assure you that there is no such thing as controlling your man sexually. The simple reality is that, if he has any game at all, and does not have a parasitic twin growing out of his forehead, the world is full of other offers. You can only control whether he is getting it at home or not. If you want to control your man, give him all the sex he wants. If you want to lose control of your man, go ahead and cut him off.
Let me add a further tidbit of wisdom at no extra charge. There is an old saying: Women get married hoping everything will change, men get married hoping everything will stay the same. Women, if, somewhere in the back of your mind, you are waiting for the day when your male partner is bound by contract, finances, and perhaps biology, so that you can cut off the sex and become a mini tyrant...don't get married. Join a convent. Work at an orphanage or a pre-school. Adopt a child on your own. Find some way to fulfill your maternal instincts that does not involve marrying under false pretenses. Your man would not have stuck around before the marriage if it were loveless and sexless. He also does not want a marriage that is sexless. There are a million things you can do to have your child or children without suckering in some poor dope, too naive to foresee your evil plan. Are you an honorable person? Then live honorably. Do not live in breach of the spirit of the marriage contract. Trust me, the sex you were willingly giving up as a sell job before the marriage is the only commodity you have to barter that makes it worthwhile for your man to tolerate the rest of what comes with you. Don't sucker a man in, and then expect him to comply with your skewed and artificial construct of fidelity.

If you breach the spirit of the marriage contract, you lose all trust and intimacy with your man. If man were to change his nature, our species would vanish in less than a hundred years. Cutting your man off is not only disrespectful, it is simply counterproductive. The quality of your relationship, his attachment to you, his dedication and sexual fidelity, will be determined by his feelings of access, of being welcomed and embraced, of desirability. We are who we are. We are hard-wired creatures of nature. It is biological. Deal with it, or don't; but don't' do it under false pretenses.
Let me further comment, for the reader' information, that, after the marriage, you, Pumpkin', stopped cooking. You stopped cleaning anything. You don't do dishes. You don't vacuum. You don't dust. You don't do laundry. You leave your dishes all over the house. You spend money like it is going out of style; and nothing ever makes you happy, except unlimited shopping. You infidelity manifests itself on a thousand fronts that are not sexual. Let me ask you something: what good are you to anyone? Good luck finding your next sucker, now that you're 31, fat, and much less attractive than before. By the way, I shall not miss your nagging, or your complaining, or your ""making me a better man,"" as you like to call it. I shall not miss your car driving tips. I have purchased a new flat screen TV and home entertainment system that will neither nag me, not interrupt me while I'm watching the occasional game. I have also decided to splurge on a cleaning lady in my new place. Finally, I'll have a woman who gets things done...and the price will be known and agreed upon up-front.

So, Honey...Pumpkin...you stupid, narcissistic cow...how do you feel now? Do you feel powerful? Or is the helium beginning to seep from your balloon? How many of you women sitting are at your desk at this very moment are wondering if it is not your husband who wrote this letter? Do you know what's strange? I used to think infidelity was wrong. Now I think it is perfectly right and justified. If your husband is out fooling around; it's because you are not doing your job. Not only is he justified in fooling around, you have it coming. You deserve it. One breach of contract deserves another. Men of the world, a woman who changes the terms of your sexual arrangement after marriage deserves infidelity. She plays a two-edged game...violating her implied duty as a wife, yet still holding you to the letter of your contract. It is the oldest, cheapest manipulation in the book: and, very likely, the root cause of the oldest profession in the world.

The Oxford English Dictionary defines infidelity as ""unfaithfulness or disloyalty to a person,"" among other things. Let me redefine it for you. Fidelity is living and being, on a daily basis, contract or no contract, the person you have represented yourself to be. In business contracts, we use the term ""good faith"" a lot to describe the expectation that both parties of a contract will behave in such a manner as will benefit both parties as much as possible. For instance, if a record company signs a contract with an artist, both parties agree to act ""in good faith,"" meaning that the company will do everything in its power to represent the artist favorably, and sell records. The artist, in return, agrees to put their best efforts into their records, their performances, and whatever promotional activities may be expected. Without the expectation of that somewhat ambiguous ""good faith,"" either party could choose, at any time, to not honor the spirit of the contract, thereby creating disadvantage for both parties. ""Good faith,"" is an absolute must.

A marriage is the same. Perhaps the ""faithful"" part of the vows goes deeper than sexual fidelity. I believe it means you put your best foot forward, always, and in all things. I believe it means that you do not allow yourself to become a fat lazy, nagging, complaining toddler who doesn't want to have sex with your partner any more. Any deviation from whom you represented yourself to be before, and upon signing the contract is, in fact, a failure to meet the implied ""good faith"" of the marriage contract. Any false personality you create in order to bag your partner, and then shed as soon as you're married is a misrepresentation. We need to stop defining infidelity as sexual only. Infidelity has many faces, and many manifestations. When you stop trying as a partner, or decide to renege on what you previously offered, you are in fact being disloyal, unfaithful and false to your partner. The idea that unfaithfulness is physical, via the sex act only is a semantic game we need to no longer play. Husbands need to start calling their wives on it. I would go as far as to say that prenups need to include specifics as to sexual frequency, sexual behavior, including attitude, and division of household chores.

After all has been said and done, it may surprise you all to know that, in my humble opinion, most men don't fool around because of the sex itself, it's really about the validation, the feelings of being wanted and valued. Women, if you want your man to seek his validation elsewhere, then you know exactly what to do. Cut him off.

Men, make it part of your own personal credo to fool around if your wife cuts you off. Let all women know that they have it coming. Let them know beyond a shadow of a doubt that the minute they cut you off, protest, make a fuss, or become grudging about sex, you will walk out that front door and get it somewhere else.


***TLDR:*** Bitch wife is a bitch to her husband so he fucks other chicks, and realizes marriage is just not worth it., dumps her ass, writes a roasting open letter. "

9t5tc9,8,2018-10-31,I need advice. I’m in a really bad situation.,confusedme9,domesticviolence,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/9t5tc9/i_need_advice_im_in_a_really_bad_situation/,"Okay so I will try and make this as short as possible but I know it’s going to be long. But please bare with me. Because I’m scared and don’t know what to do or where to go and I feel like I have NO control.

So almost 3 years ago, I entered into a relationship that would later on become abusive. Physically, emotionally, mentally, spiritually, and financially. 

He reeled me in so good. I was “hooked” in a sense. I’ve never been that way with another boyfriend before but I just truly felt like I NEEDED to be with him and that I needed to do anything for him. 

Examples of my stupidity: I accused him of cheating once, about 6 months into our relationship (he actually was cheating and I was just trying to get him to fess up), and he played so many mind games and fucked with me so hard that he had me convinced that I needed to “prove” myself by buying him something he wanted. So I dropped close to $1,000 on a graphics card for him. I didn’t want to do it at the time. I was uncomfortable doing it. But I still did it and I can’t explain why. 

Another example: the first time he physically abused me was about 8 months or so into our relationship. We were driving, I don’t remember where we were going but I was the one driving. I was in his area of town that I didn’t know well and I missed the turn. He seemed annoyed but not violently so. He told me to just pull into this restaurant to turn around in it. It had a really weird parking lot (that I had never been in before) and I accidentally drove to the back of the parking lot because I misunderstood what he said and he very violently grabbed my ears/hair (while clawing at my face) and started shaking me SO hard. I was terrified. Even in that moment I knew it wasn’t right. And I wanted to leave and never see him again. But I stayed. And I even ended up apologizing for not listening to his directions better. 

Anyway- 1 year and 5 months into our relationship I moved out of state with him. The violence was still happening. The mind games were also still happening so I felt like it was my fault. That I had done something wrong to “deserve” it. I supported both him and myself in this new state while he was in school.  I ended up losing my job for reasons out of my control and had a really difficult time finding a new job. So we went through all of the savings I had. And I got credit cards. MULTIPLE. For us to live off of (this is stupid, I know. But he told me this is what needed to be done and if I didn’t do it I didn’t want to see like I didn’t care and I also didn’t want to be hurt). However, despite all that I did for him and myself and despite how loyal I was he cheated on me one more time, only this time after doing so he broke up with me. But this didn’t cut our ties unfortunately. We were still living together and he was still telling me that he loved me and wanted us to be together but that we had issues to work on before that could happen. Mostly he said *I* had issues to work on. But he also said that should I start seeing or even talking to anyone else that I would regret it. So I never saw anyone else. And we continued living together (because there wasn’t a lot of money to make changes) and we continued saying I love you and talking about marriage and being together. The abuse continued. And so did him sleeping with other women, which I see now is just more abuse. 

I went a little crazy and hid his secret burner phone that he didn’t realize I knew existed. Which was wrong of me and I shouldn’t have done it. I was going crazy because I was sick of him sleeping with other women to hurt me. But he found out I did it and I got scared and lied and he beat me so hard. I was terrified. I ended up a bunch of stuff and driving 8 hours back to my home state to state with a friend. I stayed for about a week then he somehow convinced me to come back down and try and work everything out. So I did. During this time, maybe a few days after I was back, we had another fight and he stormed out after telling me he was going to fuck a chick that was “attractive unlike [me]” and I was so sad. Because I felt like all I was trying to do was work out crap out because I loved him and he said he loved me too so I felt like why wouldn’t we want to try? While he was out I went to a store to pick some stuff up and ended up picking up a box of pregnancy tests. I honestly couldn’t tell you why. I just suddenly had this weird feeling. And yep. It turned out it was positive.

So with that new information I FaceTimed my sister and told her I was pregnant. But I didn’t tell her about my boyfriend. And after I got off the phone with her, I immediately started packing EVERYTHING I could fit in my car. When I was almost done packing, he came back home. He was still made at me so he didn’t really care that I was leaving. In fact he let me know it was probably for the best because *insert comments on how he apparently thought I was ugly and boring and how he hated me*

Right when I went to go leave, I literally threw the pregnancy test at him and RAN. I guess because I wanted him to know? I swear a part of me thought he wouldn’t even acknowledge it and then i could be free and not worry because I had at least told him. Nope. He dragged me back into the apartment and beat me. Hard. Over and over. I screamed and screamed. Financially the apartment curtesy officer showed up to see if things were okay. I immediately just said I was on my way out. And left and never even said bye to my abuser. 

After I moved back to my home state (for good this time) we, my abuser and I, eventually started to communicate again because I wanted him to at least acknowledge the baby was real. Only I ended up having a miscarriage at 15 weeks. For 11 months my abuser and I basically started up a long distance relationship (that was never officially a relationship) where at least once a month we would visit one another. The physical abuse was significantly down due to use not seeing each other frequently but other abuse was still strong. He’d manipulate me into paying for things for him. All kinds of things. It effected my money situation drastically. 

Then one month he suddenly had some money (from a refund) and he expressed then that his money was my money (just like how he always said my money was his money because we were a team). And he gave me verbal permission to use his card to buy some things I needed since he had all but drained my card for the previous 2.5 years. So I did use it. I felt like that was a good sign that he was willing to help. So things felt like they were good. 

So that brings us to May 2018. I live in a big city in a different state than him. He told me if I helped him get an internship near me he would come stay the summer with me and we’d get back together. And in my abused mind at the time this sounded amazing! So I did it. I landed him a great internship. And he came to stay with me in mid May. After 3 weeks of him staying with me, one of my friends stumbled across one of his “Facebook friends” that he was suddenly listed as “in a relationship” with. I don’t have Facebook so I assume he thought I would never see. Well obviously my feelings were hurt and I confronted him. It didn’t end well for me physically, and then he called the new girlfriend and literally talked shit about me to her right in front of me. 

Since then, he lost his job (the internship),he is still dating this new girl, he is STILL living in my apartment despite that tomorrow is November and he was only supposed to be here for the summer, and the physical abuse has been sporadic but still happens. 

I don’t know how to make him leave because he says if I do that he will go and dispute all the charges I ever made on his debit card and say it was fraud and he will have me prosecuted. In the past when we were together I stupidly sent him private photos of myself and he threatens to send them to my church, my parents, and my bosses. He says he will do whatever he can to ruin my life and see that I lose my job and lose the respect of everyone in my life and have legal consequences go using his money (which again, he said I could but now he’s saying I’m lying). I feel like he literally dictates my life. He breaks things in my apartment. Injures me. He prevents me from being able to go out with friends or date (despite that he has a girlfriend), he prevents my family from being able to visit. He spends all day either laying on my couch or in my bed (because he makes me sleep next to him). He has no job. No money. The leaves occasionally when his girlfriend comes into town to visit and they go get an Airbnb. He’s also trying to make me pay his storage unit fees and moving company fees so he can have his things moved from the other state to this state and into my apartment. Which I don’t want his things in my apartment. I don’t know what to do. I’ve even reached out to his girlfriend and tried to explain things to her and how I don’t want to live with my ex and she basically said that I was lying about everything and that I needed to suck it up and help him out by letting him continue to live for free in my apartment. 

I hate him. I hate him being in my apartment. I hate that he forces me to sleep next to him. I hate that I so afraid that this man will ruin my life if I force him out. "

-taking equal billing with an intern after 20 years in ""show business"" for the money
-his addiction to being a recovering addict when all he did was a few months of underage social drinking

Maybe I'd say a few words to you every now and then, have a pleasant conversation, maybe even get a picture at the end, but I mostly did it to help out the potential of working in movies later on in life.

As part of my compensation for the internship, I was invited to the movie premiere. I got myself a new suit, dressed up and walked along with everyone else that was involved in the movie, getting a taste for this life and wanting more.

It was at this premiere where I saw you again, like I usually did, except this time you were alone, and you looked stunning. You were seated at the bar, having a drink, and I figured now would probably be my last chance to say something. So, I downed the rest of my drink and walked over to you.

Hey! I'm Matthew, 21 years old and I'm looking for a girl to play as a celeb on this big movie premier. Ideally the two of us flirt for a little bit before sneaking off for some alone time. This can be as vanilla or as kinky as you desire, either way is perfectly fine with me.

I don't know and I don't care. The problem of staying here is that as far I've seen they keep saying in this stupid system ""they are me"", and of course they are not. I'm me and myself, and they are them. All that story of that woman named Elena that abused from me knowing exactly and precisely what she was entirely doing. The woman that got paid in the Casino. I never knew anything at all, 100% ignorant. Well. All this way back to the story of a Spanish classmate of 1st degree of elementary school, who's name was Helena with H, from Tarragona, that was my crush, I don't want to disclose her last name, because I respect her privacy, but has the difference of just a letter with the word ""Diego"", the name of my maternal grandfather. I remember once staying in the house of a guy that now I think he's a deplorable person, basically, we made friends because my mom and his dad were from the same town, or nearby. singing a song bouncing on his bed with a toy guitar ""singing her name and last name"". Upon this just a few days from now, I looked at my mom's cell phone, and I see that she has the contact name of Elena with no H the local whore, because there's no other qualificative for this shit but that with her contact saved as ""Helena \*\*\*\*\*"" and 5 asterisks. I told my mom; ""Who is this woman?""; she responded; ""Ohh, she's Elena, is the way how I identify her"". I thought like ""Uhhhmm...."" this is bullshit. And I start remembering this story of the ""improvising with music"" and how they somehow corrupted the story. From an innocent genuine tale, they gave a complete turnaround, perverse, because there's no other words to express but PERVERSION. how they conglomerate, how they built a league of sinistrous people upon your own life, that they started talking, sharing your personal information, your sensitive and innocent data, to corrupt it. But at the same time using female nodes, of persons that are the most amazing and big whores and prostitutes, you can ever imagine. I remember talking with this biatch once, and she said to me (The no H); ""In the internship of Switzerland, there where many Arab girls, that since they need to get virgin to their marriage, they copulate with males by their asshole"". Suddenly long time ago I remember the woman in a hotel she owns, she made a reunion with many girls that were her classmates from a lot of places in this country and invited me. I'm telling you that this happened more than 10 years ago. I just want to save a little bucks, and get the fuck out of here, immediately no matter, I don't pass time with my dad, now, I  think I have to take care and look for my own sake, I have enough things and proofs to say ""This is something perverse"". You qualify a range between, manipulations, upon stupid shit, ambitious shit, etc.. and then you qualify things as ""high perversion"". It's amazing the amount of abduction they performed. ""where they want to reach?"", Just please place in my shoes, what you will do, if you are a professional executor, that you know, that you have a clear policy that; ""No mercy, even if they cry, shoot you the gazing to your solar plex of their feelings"" do you know what I think? Then I won't kill this man, Then I will kill all his trace of DNA from Top to Bottom, wipe them entirely from this universe, kaput. You know why, because when they organized, confabulate, did all this fucking shit, do you think they thought on my sacred father in law?, and in his sacred daughter?, hell no, they didn't do that. Do you think me and my only woman, we have something to do with sacrifices, with child murderings, that we need to stop them or not? Man, please don't lose focus, this was a complete fraud since 2010 from some religious ultra-fanatics from a political party, Jesus freaks. I remember some news, that a Texas little boy, grabbed his mother's gun and shoot her and killed her. Just imagine the wookiechucky show. That can raise the range of a of comprehension, between an accident, and an entire bunch of real ""perverse, sinistrous, and Nigro implicit associated people, that use forcedly my personality"", there's no other judgment but reality. I won't kill my mom, just please tell me ""What would you do?"" that crap of ""WWJD"" fuck Jesus, Jesus was a pussy, and is an ingenious literature invention. A pacifist, an Aikido believer, he would just walk away, to have a father and mother figure, maybe someday... I really don't even know what the fuck I'm doing here. A stupid said yesterday ""What you keep doing on planet earth?"", and I just laugh, think ""This stupid loser I think he don't know about spheres"" ""Maybe he knows but they want to rape my sphere, force reality"", ""take my personal empire down"". I can be even in the middle of hell, with ""the angels"" hahaha, but in my sphere. Meow!, so let's hit the road! There's a lot of people that's ""Enrolling in the army"" at least now they accept, since as you know is a hierarchy, who are going be their ""bosses"", ""more perverse than them"", because as you know there's ""natural goat evolution""..."
9t78g9,0,2018-11-01,Weight loss plateau + back to my starting point :( What do I do?,BeeTris,xxfitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/9t78g9/weight_loss_plateau_back_to_my_starting_point/,"TL;DR: I don't know what to do. I can't eat less because I know it's unhealthy for me (and my dining hall doesn't have healthy options as it is...), but working out (lifting, body weight HIIT, running, and soccer) every day isn't working.

I'm a college freshman right now and I recently noticed that I'm chubbier than I was before summer started. I actually started losing weight a year ago and was at my smallest (145lbs, 29in waist from 170lbs, 34in waist) around May/June, but then I started working two jobs at a university (research intern) and a movie theater. I never had money or time to eat during my internship, so I would just eat granola and wait until I got to the movie theater and snack on the food there. I was still going to the gym, but only 1-2x a week, 3x if I was lucky. I also didn't get to eat at home since I would get home from my movie theater shifts around 1am and had to wake up at 7:30am for my internship.

By the end of the summer, I gained 5lbs. When I came back home in September, I had lost those 5lbs again. However, when I did my body measurements again this month (I actually stopped doing them around June, which was irresponsible on my part) I was around the same measurements I was a year ago (150lbs but 32-33in waist right now), which was absolutely devastating for me. I hadn't been working out much since I first got to my university, so I started working out regularly again and paying more attention to what I eat.

The thing is, I don't think I can eat any less than I already do. I probably consume around 1300-1500cals/day as it is, and I still find myself gaining weight so easily. Although I'm working out, I don't see a change in my weight or body (granted, it's only been about a month -- but I saw more change in a month when I first started and was in my old habits). What prompted me to seek outside help was that I suddenly gained 5lbs on the scale in one day with no major change to what I normally eat. I am so frustrated with myself. I'm thinking maybe it's because it was my first time lifting in a few months (I had a tendon injury) and I did some heavy butt/leg work, but I've never seen my weight jump just like that.

I feel like nothing I do is helping and I feel like there is nothing else I can do unless I want to develop an eating disorder. My confidence if failing, and I'm back to wearing baggy clothes that cover my body all the time because my boobs are getting bigger (my main goal for losing weight is to have smaller boobs). I can't even concentrate in class or study because all I can think about is how fat and disgusting I've gotten. My boobs are bigger and they pop out of my bra and made my bra much tighter and they just get in my way like they used to. My arms are flabby and my arm exercises aren't cutting it, no matter what I do or how much I lift. And for some reason, my legs didn't grow in proportion to my upper half over the summer so I look disgustingly disproportionate. And my acne is coming back for some reason, and my face absolutely hurts. And I don't have any money to buy my own food, to top it all off.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have any advice at all? Any suggestions? I want my family back in Mexico to see how much I've changed and how much healthier and confident I've gotten, but I don't know if that's possible anymore."

I wanted to share what i discovered about my own 8 years of depressions. As a refugee who fled Iran in the war and came to holland.

I've been kicked out my parents house when i was 16, started living on the streets, at friends houses and where ever i could at that time. There was a lot of drugs and negative experiences, which i mostly honestly don't even remember. (people sometimes tell me; remember this? and i don't.).

Thankfully i always had a small light within me somewhere, i always cared more about other people then myself. So while trying to ruin yet another degree i was chasing, i discovered an amazing group of kids at my internship and that place gave me a chance to work as a youth counselor and lifecoach for the age 14-28. Helping them made me realize i was helping everyone to feel better, except for myself. My amazing fiancé, who stuck with me through everything, pushed me to the edge, and eventually the pain of not being happy was worse than the fear of failing. I said fuck it and went for it..

I started my youtube channel and just started to throw out all my feelings and thoughts and rants and whatever I thought could mean something to someone, somewhere. Just helping 1 person is good enough for me..

I've been at it for 2 months and I have never felt happier, i finally felt like things are getting better and i'm adding something to people instead of just sucking our their energy. 

I owe a lot to my fiancé but i also owe a lot to listening to that little light within, it is there, within you. It might be fucking tiny, but it's there. As long as it's there, u can get better.

If you guys wanna check out my youtube, i'll drop the link in the comments, i just wanted to share this story.

9t8g2a,1,2018-11-01,Me[23/m] having gift giving issues with my ldr girlfriend[23/f] am I just unfair and stupid?,armyrelthrowaway,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9t8g2a/me23m_having_gift_giving_issues_with_my_ldr/,"Copying [our post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9szes3/me23m_having_gift_giving_issues_with_my_ldr/) from /r/relationships as we want more input into our issues.

My girlfriend and I have been in a long distance relationship for 9 months now. This is my first relationship. We met online a few months before we became a couple and I visited her after 2 months of starting dating. Right now I am in the army also until next year's spring. And for the record this is what I am struggling a lot with - we are not physically together and I find myself unable to notice many nuances about the other person.

Recently we have hit an issue with her birthday which was coming up. She talked about how those days were special and I need to also show that to her.

Prior to this, I had sent her a care package before leaving to another country for an internship, which consisted of letters, ""open when"" letters, my shirt and a necklace. She asked for something that she could carry with her and remember me by. I chose something from my culture that had a bunny carved to it (she used to call me her bunny). She was however visibly devastated by this as it wasn't something that she had expected. She had expected something like what she carries every day - a silver necklace which is plain and not sparkly. I apologized and made a promise to get to know her better.

Now her birthday was coming up and I was inquiring about things she would like to have as a gift. Firstly she said that she doesn't believe that I know what to get her as evidenced by the necklace disaster. Also that I don't know her although we have been together for so long (which for me is not so long and we are 2000 km apart having spent only 3 days together physically). We found something together when I proposed to make a game of it by her giving me a site to look at and her telling me if I am getting warmer or colder by showing different jewelery.

Later on however she told me not to get it as it was too expensive (it was not for me really but I respect her decision) and even later on saying that she did not like it anymore.

We got into another issue of me not knowing how deep her feelings for me were and if she loves me. I like hearing feedback on everything I do and I explained to her that hearing words of affection make me feel loved. She told me that she is the opposite and doesn't want/need to hear them. This was also an issue previously when I didn't feel good for not hearing compliments and it turned out that she was not feeling lust towards me and that I was not handsome in her eyes. A month ago I proposed for us to make the love language quiz as I wanted to know what her love language is so that I can get to know how she shows her love. It turned out to be acts of services and gifts. While mine were words of affection and spending quality time.

Based on these, I set out to find a gift. I showed her some jewelery I thought she would like but they were not in her taste. She told me not to get jewelery because I did not know what to get. I thought about a poem (as I wrote many of them in the start) but after knowing that words of affection were not her thing, I decided to drop it. Then I thought about sending her a Spotify playlist of music she would like, but I turned that idea down as I did that once before, but I she did not comment about her listening to it or answering if she liked it. I took that as meaning that she didn't. Then after pondering for quite a while, I decided to ask her if there was something specific she would want or a gift idea. She told me no and that I should be able to come up with it myself as this is an instinct in every man. Which I seemingly don't have. My next idea was then to buy her flowers (daisies are her favourite), chocolate and arrange a romantic and relaxing date (having a dinner, watching a movie and playing a game we both enjoy) for 3 reasons: 1) She liked when I previously had sent her flowers but later on said that it was feeling too much and I stopped. 2) The overall gift would fulfill her two main love languages: a service and gifts 3) A relaxing date would help her current situation which is stressful

A few days before her actual birthday, she visited her relatives and celebrated her birthday that way. She received gifts from her friends and family. I planned to give mine on her actual birthday and then congratulate her.

However before that, I told her about my plans and asked for what she thought of them - was I getting closer to knowing her or not. This erupted into us having an argument. Many people asked her what I got for her birthday and she said nothing. Later on she talked about this with her friends and came to the conclusion that it is a rubbish gift - something friends do and something we do constantly. Which I agree. However it was all I could think of with the knowledge I have now.

I tried to come up with solutions that would not make this happen again: - a list of things like on pinterest of things I could get to her on days like these (she turned this down by saying there is no thoughtfulness in it) - saying what kind of a gift she wants for starters so I would get to know her style and wants later on - a book or a website giving me advice on how to find things that suit her

She told me that this should be an instict and that I am already 23 and I should know what to do by now. I am a person who learns from example and doing things over and over again, which I explained to her. She responded by saying that this is an universal thing and I should have known what to do.

And now here we are. We are here to ask for advice and solutions as to how I can become a better gift-giver and how we can avoid this situation from happening in the future.

tl;dr: Am I borked in the head for not being able to know from the top of my head what my girlfriend wants for a gift. How do I make myself better in knowing what the other person wants without them outright saying it?

Edit: I am the female side of the story and I would like to add my parts of the story to make a clear judge around everything. And I am sorry to write a long story about things we can fix.

Me and my boyfriend (both 23) have a ldr. He is from Finland and I am from Turkey. We have a good understanding of each other and a nice rhythm.

I love him, he is the best supporter I have and just the one whom I want to build a future with. But there's a big problem which grows between us. He is more inexperienced compare to me, I am his girlfriend, sometimes its a journey that we both learn, sometimes it's just painful like today.

I was in Canada in order to complete my research time. Before I leave, I just said I want something that i can wear all the time which is small yet rememberance of you. He gave me a wooden bunny necklace which is nearly same to playboy rabbit. And I was totally frustrated bc I asked smt nice yet got a playboy rabbit.

And during my time in Canada. We talked about plans for my bday. And I said like 5 times that I find 3 dates important. My and his bday and our first year anniversary. He knows it. Firstly I wanted a bracelet but then I found it expensive, bc he is in the army and I didn't want him to spend 50 bucks just for a bracelet. It would be too much for him and I said I didn't like the bracelet obviously I adore it but it was expensive and wanting it wasn't the most correct idea. Since it's a gift, he should have find a good one which he wanted to buy.

When the time was closing to my bday he started to ask what to buy as a gift. In Turkish culture its not acceptable to say what you want as a gift. And since he is my bf for 10 months he should be able to find smt nice and meaningful. After the bracelet, since he loves meaningful gifts, I thought it would be a book he loves or smt small as pricey but big in meaning. But he didn't buy anything at all. He said he just wanted to spend the day with me as usual, the game lotro and a Skype call plus buying a flower. Tbh, he knows that I don't like to idea of flowers bc they only last for 2 3 days. And giving money for it just craziness. And, doing the usual things doesn't sound correct to me.

I am totally broken, hopeless about him and devastated. He knows how much I wanted it to be special. I don't care about seconds and so. It would be our first and firsts are important for me. I don't know what to say or do. I know, I am his first but buying a gift is a simple thing. According to me, even a bad gift shows that someone cares about you which is obviously better when your friends give you small gifts but your bf doesn't do at all.

And he is the closest one to me. Having him like this was a shock bad for me. I am open to ideas."

9t9qkn,28,2018-11-01,Finally after 5 years...,dovress,homelab,https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/9t9qkn/finally_after_5_years/,"Hi everyone. Just want to share my homelab journey after lurking for soooo long.

The idea of setting up my homelab started around 5-6 years ago during my college internship. The company's documents were accessible through a Windows network share and it was painfully slow. I thought to myself ""I could do better than that!"".

It was all daydreaming until one day Google announced that they will be shutting down Google Reader. My dreams suddenly had a tinge of practicality as I can self host web applications and become less dependent on SaaS.

**Version 1 Homelab**

Without much experience, I started out with a Synology DS112. I found out I should have bought a 2-bay NAS when I started learning about RAID during the setup.. Anyways, it was really just experimenting around with stuff like SMB file share, DDNS, remote access. It just so happens that during this time the electricity supply in my home keeps tripping and so I learnt about the UPS.

**Version 2 Homelab**

I found the Synology NAS very limited when I comes to customization. So I set out to built myself a server.

* TYAN S7040GM4NR
* Xeon E5-2430L V2
* 48 GB RAM
* MegaRAID 9260-8i
* 2x Crucial M500 120GB (RAID 1 for Microsoft Server 2012 R2)
* 2x Crucial M500 240GB (RAID 1 for Virtual Machine OS VHDX)
* 2x Seagate 4TB (RAID 1 for Virtual Machine Data VHDX)
* Corsair 1050HX PSU
* Corsair 750D Full Tower Case

Some components are overkill (like the 1050W PSU, I barely use 200W) but hey, it's my first time building a computer.

I learnt a lot of stuff (mainly by Googling) like writing Powershell script for graceful shutdown, Hyper-V virtual machines, Storage Spaces, WSUS, Active Directory, Certificate Authority, firewall virtual appliances like Sophos UTM and pfSense, Atlassian JIRA, Confluence, Crowd and integrating their Single-Sign-On feature, Owncloud, PRTG.

At this point in time I have graduated from college and in a full time job and night class uni. Lack of documentation and too little time for my homelab caused me to lose track and having to start all over from scratch a few times. I was so burned out from maintaining my homelab that I switched off my server for a few months.

**Version 3 Homelab**

I figured that although an off-the-shelf NAS lacked the flexibility of my DIY server, the plug and play features would help a lot in maintenance so I went and bought the DS3018xs beginning this year. I am now in my final test stages before I officially 'operationalize' my homelab services.

[Network Topology](https://i.redd.it/fvredt8v3qv11.jpg)

[My Homelab](https://i.redd.it/817bls1p3qv11.jpg)

Hardware:

* Arcadyan Router (ISP provided) running as WiFi Access Point (top left)
* Netgate SG-2440 (top left rear)
* Synology DS3018xs (middle left)
* Linksys SE2800 Unmanaged Switch
* TYAN DIY Server (the big monster)
* Eaton 5E1100iUSB UPS (not in picture)

Services:

* Synology DS3018xs
   * 6x 3TB RAID6 as main homelab storage
   * LDAP server (DokuWiki and CrushFTP uses same authentication database)
   * DokuWiki for homelab documentation, intranet landing page, personal notebook/journal
   * CrushFTP (Ubuntu VM) for file management
   * Arq Backup (Windows VM) for cloud backup
* TYAN DIY Server
   * Currently serves as lab environment for testing stuff

Roadmap:

* Family photo gallery
* Internal Root Certificate Authority
* DNS Server with blocklists
* NTP

With version 3, documentation is a priority and everything is recorded in DokuWiki. I have adopted a changelog and roadmap to 'release' new features in stages so I won't get overwhelmed again."
9t9sij,1,2018-11-01,17 days left,poor_icarus,u_poor_icarus,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_poor_icarus/comments/9t9sij/17_days_left/,"Another slow day in the office. 

It's driving me crazy.

I feel like I am a background character of a movie, walking through the set with no name, no reason, no destination. I might as well take off my name tag and ID card and toss it down the trash can of Point B. I have two weeks left, but it is as if I have already faded, like exposed photographs, like dry leaves. 

I am starting to miss my life before coming here. I miss going to the Saturday market with my mother and smelling leafy vegetables and iced fish spread across the long tables. I miss my mother's cooking. I miss the places out of Hulu Selangor. I miss going to lectures in tall quiet buildings and eating in the pretentious restaurants in Bangi. I miss the quaint roads of Ipoh and its street food. 

There is a man in the office, and he is a reason to come to work, a reason to get excited for Mondays. I've told him I'm gay, and he doesn't seem to freak out, instead, we keep at it with our little conversations, almost like real friends.  

I try not to get too attached to him because I'm leaving soon, but it proves to be quite difficult. Still, I accept the reality that in the end, I'll have to add him to the long list of people I used to know.

Anyway, I've been charting everything that is happening in my life so far, and almost everything travels back to Medo. I chose to do my internship in Rawang instead of Ipoh because I wanted to be close to Medo again. I went to Bangkok as a way to get revenge on Medo. Now, Medo and I barely talk, and the memories we shared is like a corrupted file that cannot be opened. 

There are things of his I still keep, like that Panda plushie, and the black wallet, I take that everywhere, and the Joker card from his table, I keep it in the sun visor of my car. When I look at any of these things for longer than ten seconds, I start to get really sad but I rather not entertain the questions that follow. 

Medo would want this. To leave him behind and have a great life. No one other than him will ever know if he loved me at one point, but what we all do know is he wants the best for me, which is not him. 

But I think I've been working in this factory for a little too long, because my mind just blanks when I try to imagine any life other than the yellow and blue corporate uniform, the morning exercise with that music from hell, the rows and rows of office's computers, and the canteen's food. Boring! 

It's hard to remember the days I had with Medo, the carefree life in Kajang, the life in my parents' home. 

It is almost as if the past was something that happened to someone who is not me. 

You know, I've been thinking... what will I do when I get out of here?

I know I want to go to the Netherlands and visit Rene. Haha yeah, I think that would be nice, after all that happened since the last time I saw him. Maybe I can get him to treat me some bacon. I miss bacon so badly. It's not like we don't have bacon in Malaysia, just, difficult.

He asked me if there's anything I want to see. Two things, I answered. Van Gogh paintings and Anne Frank's hideout. If I get to see even only one of both, it would be a dream come true. But even if it doesn't happen, it's not a big deal, just the time away from Malaysia would be enough. 

Heh, look at me, dreaming of a life outside Perodua. 

I've been thinking, Perodua is nice and all, but it's a bit too ""small-community"" for me. I don't know how to articulately explain this phenomenon. It's, like, if you fit in, you'll be so happy, but if there's one outlier thing about you, they will pick and pick on it like it's a scab.  And with everything they do, there's an accompanying religious undertone.

This is nice to experience, for example, the Family Day was a success because of this specific herd mentality, but it's not nice to have to live this every day for the rest of your life. I bet it would grind you down to a nub. An obedient nub without individuality. 

I always say that the biggest lesson I've learned here is discipline, but the truth is, it's not. I lie. Instead, the biggest lesson is how to keep your individuality while still conforming to the rules -- bend them, not break them. 

It's true, every master was born a rebellion, but being born is just half the equation.

The client currently just recently renewed their contract with us and signed up for an additional 2,000 licenses with the possibility to expand beyond that should the seats be filled before next November. We are currently trying to find a way to get in touch with the regional leaders throughout the country ( We already have their contact info) and convince them to sign the rest of their team up for our application.

My question is how do we get these leaders to pick up the phone? how do we cut through all the clutter and convince them to sit down with us and discuss the possibility of expanding our program throughout their team? Do we invite them through an email that states our value and maybe offers some customer testimonials? Do we invite them to a webinar that might offer us some time to explain the value of expanding our program to their team?

&amp;#x200B;

If you guys have any best practices or tips that would be awesome. Thanks!

Just wanted to share a fun story that is true, maybe more tame than some of the things I read on here.

I went to a nightclub with a few friends for an EDM concert. At the time I was in a long-distance relationship (my gf was doing an internship in Europe) and we were keeping things open. While I wasn't planning on pushing for anything to happen that night, I was definitely not opposed to it.

On the dance floor, I briefly locked eyes with this gorgeous tiny Indian girl with wavy black hair, in a blue top and this tight gray skirt dancing next to her friend off to my side, a few people down. We exchanged a smile. My friends wanted to go outside for a smoke for a bit, and as we were leaving I approached her, and said to stay right where she was because I wanted to dance with her when I returned. When I came back we immediately got close, with her tight ass grinding on me to the music. But the story isn't about her. We were all over each other, making out, but ultimately she wasn't down to take it further as I was in a relationship albeit an open one. We parted ways.

I wanted to get a drink from the bar and started to make my way through the crowd, when I passed by a cute girl wearing this sexy skintight one-piece lacy top, and jeans. I commented to her that I liked her shirt. Without hesitation she grabs my hand and pulls me with her into the tightly packed crowd closer to the stage. She starts making out with me; she's sucking on a cough drop and passes it to my mouth. We grind on each other, and she reaches down and feels the outline of my hard cock against my leg. I hear her sigh as she does this and she presses harder against me with her ass. She turns and softly says into my ear, ""I'm not wearing anything underneath this."" Fuck. I want her so much at this point.

We eventually make it back to her place in an Uber. We get undressed and get in her bed, and she immediately goes to pull out my cock from my briefs. She's stroking it, and I'm loving how her small fingers are wrapped just around the top of my dick, not touching all the way around. She reaches over to her nightstand and puts a cough drop in her mouth, and then makes her way down to my crotch, ass up in the air, and gently wraps her mouth around my tip. She's trying to take me deeper but her mouth goes halfway down my shaft at best, but I'm loving it. The cough drop is giving my cock a tingling feeling and we both laughed after I commented how good it felt.

Neither of us had condoms, so I couldn't fuck her that night. But what happened next was just as good. I stood up next to the bed and had her laying on her stomach, with my hands on her head and in her hair, guiding her as she sucked my cock. As she was sucking, she would take breaks to talk dirty about me and my cock. ""You have a really big penis, it's so hard to suck it without choking on it. It's like ..whoaa"" and she made a gesture with her hands like when someone shows the size of a fish they caught. She said how she noticed me earlier in the night and that I looked cute, and how glad she was that the first girl I was dancing with didn't end up being the one enjoying my cock.

I loved this experience, and haven't had a girl talk about my cock like that before. It felt so good to have it admired and serviced. Maybe it was the mixture of alcohol and being tired as it was so late, but I didn't end up cumming with her. My cock and balls felt so good and heavy, when I got home, I rubbed one out and blew a huge load.

We flirted for a bit later over snap but never ended up meeting again, and it fizzled out. But I still remember that night fondly."

I just feel that this is the appropriate place for what I have to say. I just turned 21 years old a couple months ago. Life has always been hard for me, there are times that I thought about giving up but eventually thoughts are just thoughts you know. I am always described as driven, always know my end goal and dreams. I am passionate and love what I am doing. I am currently a junior in a reputable university in United States working on my engineering degree. Good grades and everything, why should I feel sad? Since the beginning of this year, I have been operating on 80-90 hours week with working full time and going to school full time. The reason behind it is to make enough money to pay all the rent, utilities, etc... and as well as keeping on scholarship status. I had a loving girlfriend who always care for me and listen to what I have to say. You could say that my stress has been manageable. About a week and a half ago, my girlfriend walked out of the bedroom telling me that she has to do homework downstair. For some odd reasons, I felt like something was not right. Thirty minutes later, I went downstair to check and she took the car and was gone, with all the homework and school backpack at home. I ran outside like a madman, even driving my car right in front of the house and waited for her. I waited for about 3 hours until 4AM when I realized the relationship is over. She came back at 5:30AM with messy clothes and I knew exactly what she did. For the rest of that day, we spent our time together crying, again I don't know why we did that. Perhaps it was the fact that we were engaged to each other and I made plans revolving around our future family. The emotional pain and the toxicity of the situation did not hit me until the next day. I had an interview with an engineering company for a summer internship and the first question they asked me was What is your strength? It was at that moment when I managed to get 5 words out of my mouth and started crying uncontrollably. I drove an hour to her house and when I did not see her car outside at 11, I thought about what happened the day before. I don't know what my thought were at the time but I downed about 20 pills of Extra Strength Tylenol. Now if you know something about suicide, OD on non-prescription drug has about 6% of success rate. Perhaps I did it to lash out on my ex as well as a way for me to cope with the stress and trauma. I ended up rushing to the hospital where they held me for 2 days under suicide watch. I have been told to go to Student Counseling Services as well as Student Assistance Services and they have been going extra mile to help me cope with what happened. But now... a week and a half after all the drama and emotional pain, I don't think I can take it anymore. I know I have a lot of live for, part of me still wants to live because of my dreams and goal and not wanting to give up. But the other part is in extreme pain and there are times that I feel I can't continue anymore. I don't have a lot of friends and family but they all care about me. I just wish that they don't care so much so it would have been easier on my conscience to give up."
9tb5j5,3,2018-11-01,Delusion of April O'Neil- Fanfiction/Dark Theory,KyoHisagi,TMNT,https://www.reddit.com/r/TMNT/comments/9tb5j5/delusion_of_april_oneil_fanfictiondark_theory/,"Very mild spoiler for Bay's TMNT Movie ahead.

 I have never liked Michael Bay’s TMNT (except maybe for Swiss Army knife Shredder). But one particular scene stucked in my head very hard. Thanks to it, this idea was born.

I am talking about scene where &gt;!Whoopi Goldberg character fires April O’Neil. She didn’t believe her tales about four human-sized ninja turtles.!&lt;  


But what if April was the only one who could see them? What if they really hide in the shadows?  


Their first meeting probably would have happened when April was going home after her classes. I think she’s attending college, I am not sure. Maybe she’s 18-19 years old. Some criminal tried to steal her bag and that’s when brothers appear. They easily kick his ass and save the day. April is under impression but Leonardo asks her to not tell anyone about them.  


At this moment a line between reality and mirage gets really thin.  


I think the story should be named “The Delusion of April O’Neil”. Suits it well. Someone could say it’s pretty dark and conspiracy story but I say- it was on the surface all the time.  


April really gets into Turtles. She draws them in her notebooks, she reads about criminals and superheroes, she even tries to become one- but unsuccesfully.  


She runs away from her problems- because she has a very sick dad and a very poor mom. She runs away in this magnificent world of saving the planet and fighting villains.  


One day she decides to help her parents. She becomes an intern in Stockman Industries thanks to her charisma and intellectual brilliance. With her ambitions she easily becomes in high position in the company.  


And that’s when she meets our beloved quartet the second time.  


They break into the building and try to steal the researches Stockman was working on. Turtles tell April that her boss is a criminal and uses her works for illegal experiments on humans and animals. She helps them to steal the data- and gets caught in the process. Guys jump into the open window. No one have seen them. Like they have never existed in the first place.  


She gets interrogated by cops, federals. Stockman especially was interested in her story- but April told nothing. Stockman fires her and obligates to attend psychological help meetings.  


Casey Jones attends these meetings too.  


Casey has a rough childhood too. His father beats his mom- and Casey gets beaten too. One day Casey brings his hockey stick at home- and his dad ends up in a hospital.  


Jones fells in love with our heroine. You could say it’s the love at first sight. He loves her stories about giant turtles fighting crime. He loves to talk to her, to someone who has problems too.  
Casey even starts to see TMNT- very blurry, just like an image on defective TV. But still.  


In her spare time miss O’Neil helps green guys- she hacks into systems, she steals food for them, she beats bad guys on the streets. Casey is really worried about her- in her mental condition she spends too much time on rooftops. But he wants to see her happy- and when she’s taking part in these crazy adventures she’s so happy.  


Donatello tells her that she’s not a part of their world. April didn’t listen to him. All she wanted to hear is how they have beaten the Shredder.  


And then her mom dies in car accident. April is sure it was Stockman’s handiwork to get the revenge on her and Ninja Turtles. She tries to kill Baxter but of course his guards apphrehend her.  


April ends up in a hospital for mental illnesses. In the very end of the story she sees Leonardo, Raphael. Donatello and Michelangelo in the last time.  


\-Guys! Have you come to save me?  


What I love about this story is that aspect you can’t tell what is real and what is not. Was April crazy all along? Or Turtles really exist and trying to save the world? Was Stockman really guilty for her mother’s death- or was it just an accident?  


Okay guys, that’s all what I have for today. I want to deeply sorry for any mistakes I’ve made here- my English is faaaar away from perfect, but I hope someone enjoyed reading this. I had this story in my head for a pretty long time and I am happy to tell it to someone.  


Someone could say this story is dumb and illogical. I couldn’t agree more- it’s pretty rough idea, this is not complete story. I see many plot holes myself. For example- what is Casey’s role in this? Why April didn’t end up in prison for stealing important research?   
Maybe one day I will fix them and turn it into a real comic. Or maybe I just let this be. I don’t draw well and I better let someone else do the drawings for this. I just really wanted to share this tale with you guys.  
Have a nice day. Cowabunga! "

9tb7ep,0,2018-11-01,[M4FFFFF+] Overwatch on Glassdoor: “Internship was lit. Good food. Great boarding options. Tracer gives head like a champ.”,SuckMyDPPenis,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/9tb7ep/m4fffff_overwatch_on_glassdoor_internship_was_lit/,"Of course, that’s not the review I actually left, but maybe if Hana begged a little harder I would have. I’m kind of getting ahead of myself, though, so let me explain what’s going on here.

Two years ago, when I was sixteen, I went to the museum with my little brother. The poor kid broke his wrist like a week prior and was cooped up inside the whole time while he ‘recovered.’ Frankly, I thought the whole thing was bullshit; he wasn’t torn up about the whole thing since it was his off hand, and within a day of getting the cast he was already flying around the house like a maniac, but Mom *insisted* that her little baby boy not risk it by going to school for a while. It wasn’t all fun and games, though. Like I said, he was forced to stay inside, and Mom practically butchered Timmy’s lessons when she tried to teach him to keep him caught up. Lucky for him, I went to the same school, and I saved my notebooks, so it wasn’t life or death for him.

Anyways, not the point. The point is I felt bad for him because of everything that was happening, and to make it up to him I brought him to the Overwatch Historical Museum. I half expected Mom to object, but of course she was *thrilled* that I was ‘spending time with him’ and ‘getting involved in his hobbies.’ I sort of just rolled my eyes at the time, the way she was gushing over it like it was some big deal, but I never realized just how much it would change my life.

If you’ve seen the security tapes that got released all over the news, you know what happened next. Lots of guns, lots of spandex. I did a lot of staring at butts on the side as a hormonal teenager, then I did some punching, the robbers fucked off and Tracer made Timmy’s day. I did a lot of bragging after. I thought that would be the highlight of my life, too; not many people get to say they saved the day by punching a Talon sniper in the gut. Of course, if I was right, the story would’ve ended right there. So, yeah, I was wrong. My highlight was about to get a whole lot highlight-ier.

Maybe it was luck, destiny, karma paying off or the butterfly effect in action, because I saw a whole lot more of Lena Oxton after that. She spoke at the school district, showed up at restaurants, I saw her in the park, and each time we recognized each other and spoke. Somewhere along the line we traded contact details, and chance encounters turned into planned ones. I learned that she was in state for a while on unofficial Overwatch business. She learned I was on the chess team at my local high school (riveting, I know). It didn’t take long for me to realize that this was what having a role model felt like. She was always there to listen, always eager to answer questions. It felt weird to have a peer that wasn’t a peer.

I guess at some point she began to feel a little differently, because on my eighteenth birthday, after all my plans for the day were exhausted, she sent me a text. In it, she apologized for calling so late, but she had a gift for me and needed me to come as soon as possible. I, of course, was only too happy to oblige, not realizing what the gift was. Yeah, this is going exactly where you think it is.

Lena mounted me like an animal. Perfect, perky tits, tomboy locks that made for perfect sex hair, and a bush so well trimmed you’d swear she took a clippers to it every night. We must’ve gone through two boxes of condoms, each one filled just a little less than the previous one as I mustered up everything in my balls for her— and when we ran out, we switched to anal. The whole time we were doing it, she talked about how she’d been waiting for my eighteenth birthday, how the way I carried myself made her buzz inside, how she was screaming my name for the past month as she fingered herself to this exact scenario. I, on the other hand, was too busy working her holes to talk.

The morning after was... well, surreal to say the least. I thought it was a dream, but that theory went out the window as quickly as it came, because when I tried to sit up another hundred and thirty pounds was keeping me down in a fancy hotel bed. Not that I was complaining; I just rolled over, held the woman as tightly as she held me, and went back to sleep. The next time I woke up, she was up too, eyes locked with mine and smiling like a devil with a soul to claim. I was too busy watching those eyes to notice her reaching under the pillow and pull out an envelope, labeled with the words: **URGENT. OVERWATCH INTERNSHIP DETAILS ENCLOSED.** I guess she noticed when I stopped looking at her and started looking at the envelope, because she only had one thing to say to that.

“There’s more where this came from, luv.”

- - -

**TL;DR:** In which an Overwatch agent gets frisky with a barely legal teenager and invites him to get frisky some more. At the Overwatch HQ. With other Overwatch agents.

The scene we’ll be playing will kick off a couple months after this prompt. Tracer’s just invited Brian (from the cinematic trailer) to serve an internship with Overwatch after he finishes his senior year, all expenses paid. He knows Lena’s ready to get down and dirty with him, but the British brunette’s been very vocal about her opinion on Brian back home, and a couple other agents want their fill of teenage dick— and if they don’t yet, all it takes is a little convincing. Luckily, Tracer is all too willing to share.

I’m typically completely limitless, but I’d like this roleplay to be a little more lighthearted. That being said, I’m more than willing to redefine what that means, so if you want to put a specific fetish into this, feel free to ask.

I’d like to put some focus on these particular fetishes.

**COSTUMES/COSPLAY:** ‘Tis the witching season! Could be one of the alternate skins, could be a new costume altogether. Who doesn’t want to see Mercy in a ‘sexy nurse’ costume?

**IMPREG:** Everyone’s a consenting adult with a lot of money. No reason Brian can’t leave everyone with a bundle of joy in their bellies!

**WATERSPORTS:** Urine’s just hot. Shower in it, pour yourself a glass, or just drink straight from the tap; that golden glory is just *divine.*

**FUTA/TRAP:** I don’t mind if certain heroes are packing beneath their suits. D.Va’s a trap, Mei’s a futa, change my mind.

Of course, four fetishes doesn’t nearly encompass my list. I’m also into BDSM, latex, drugs, consensual abuse, pet play, toys, tattoos, piercings, exhibitionism, and foodplay. But again, that doesn’t cover everything. Certain fetishes may apply to certain heroes.

I can’t wait to see those orange envelopes, guys. Don’t disappoint me!

*First of all, sorry if this is the wrong sub-reddit to post in, but I couldn't find a more suitable one.*

I'm a few months to finish school and I want to get a job in helpdesk, preferably in Linux (I really hate Windows and MS).

&amp;#x200B;

My knowledge (20% from my course / 80% just studying it at home because I wanted and I liked to learn new stuff)

* Similar knowledge of CompTIA+ Network and Security+
* Very little of CCNA but know at least what routing, switching and subnetting is
* Decent understanding of Linux commands and how the system works 
* Basic bash script knowledge (really need to learn this right?)
* Done a 6month as intern on a IT department and helped in the hardware stuff and went a few times with the network engineer to do the maintenance on different servers

&amp;#x200B;

**So, which tools or topics should I study in-depth or just have a decent understanding before applying?**

&amp;#x200B;

By the way, I might have the opportunity to have the RHCE or the RHCSA certification, is that enough to get me a job without a collage degree (is it even possible that I pass the exam since I study network all by myself?).

She was kind of a mentor to me and we became work friends and then started hooking up. Over the course of the next year I started falling for her in a very real way and I told her I wanted to get serious but she said she that she said that she wasn't ready for a committed relationship and she didn't think I was mature enough for her but that maybe we could talk about it later.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

For the next couple years we still spent time together and hooked up occasionally, but we both saw other people. Eventually we talked about things again and she told me that she was ready for a real relationship and we started taking things more seriously.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes it really didn't really feel like it though. She was always very dedicated to her friends and her career and would always insist on fitting our entire relationship within her schedule and expect me to work my schedule around hers. She would always insist on taking the lead in planning when we'd hang out and what we'd do together and when I tried to initiate she would almost always be busy. I tend to have a more ""go with the flow"" kind of personality so I never really minded this too much, but sometimes it could get a little frustrating.

This past year she asked me to move in with her which totally surprised me. Since she owned her own place there wasn't any rent but we split bills like utilities and stuff 50/50. Despite this she still seems to act like the whole condo is her space and she knows what should go where and stuff like that. Similarly, while we will split the housework between us she always likes to be the one who determines who does what. A few weeks ago I made a comment to her about these issues and she just kind of rolled her eyes and acted like it was no big deal.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

She also likes to make jokes about our relationship sometimes, like she'll joke about our age gap or how I'm immature or how she has no idea why she's into me. She was a very sarcastic personality and we like to banter back and forth a lot so I don't necessarily think this means anything but given everything else it just adds fuel to the fire.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

All that being said though, there's a lot of good in our relationship too. We have a lot in common and I enjoy spending time with her, we have great conversations, and she can be really sweet and caring sometimes. Our sex life is pretty amazing too, though there is a bit of a similar problem where she always prefers to be the one to initiate and likes things to happen on her terms. So in spite of these problems it's not like our relationship is a total trainwreck overall.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the wall of text, I just have a lot of thoughts on this and I'm really confused right now

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr Sometimes it feels like my gf doesn't really take our relationship seriously

9te48z,0,2018-11-01,I [21F] want to reach out to him [28M] and ease his worries,Large_Inevitable,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9te48z/i_21f_want_to_reach_out_to_him_28m_and_ease_his/,"You know when you’re going through a breakup and you feel completely empty and depressed and have lost any sense of objectivity? Yeah, that’s me right now.

&amp;#x200B;

So I met him in May. I am a 21 (soon 22) yr old undergrad student in NYC. He is a 28 yr old grad student. We met in the library but we go to different universities. (I started hitting on him first lol).

&amp;#x200B;

We have talked every single day since May 3rd (who’s counting) pretty much. We were talking long distance from June-September (internships for both of us), and have seen each other in person like 3 times a week out and are constantly talking. All together we've been ""seeing"" (talking, dating?) for 6 months.  He would say things about feeling like he had a girlfriend. We would say “miss you”, act like a couple, constantly go on dates and study together. I have overnight shit stored at his place, we have a night routine. He gave me no reason to worry by his actions except for maybe this last week or two. We seemed solid, constantly talking, taking care of each other, doing sweet things, being a couple. We weren't seeing other people. 

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to make things a bit more serious because he has made comments about our age gap and not being able to get past it.  I orchestrated a type of “check-in” a month ago to discuss where we are at romantically and if we want to pursue this into a relationship. It went pretty well and he was like yeah I have these issues but I want to work past it and move towards a relationship. I was \~elated\~ because I’m fully obsessed with this guy.

&amp;#x200B;

He’s been kind of distant as of late and was kind of hard to reach for like a week and it was making me insane. I didn’t know if we had plans or not and I missed him and I was giving him space but I’m also here thinking that we are moving towards a relationship like we should be in communication more, not less. I was also getting bothered by some things like I haven’t met many of his friends, he goes to events and hangs out with my friends. It makes me feel like he’s super embarrassed by me.

&amp;#x200B;

So on Monday (3 days ago) after having a weekend of being in my feelings, I asked him to meet me to talk about where we are at. I told him I need more and he told me that he has these issues like the 6.5 yr age gap, he’s been single for a long time and is used to it, he may move in a year (so will I), he thinks he wants to get married soon, he doesn’t want to get hurt, he knows how I’m going to grow and change from my age to his-- kind of all over the place. I was able to talk to him about some of these things like returning my agency to myself, him not deciding what’s best for me, the getting hurt argument and I felt like there was hope. He was on the same page as me.

&amp;#x200B;

I gave him an ultimatum really, I told him I don’t want to wait for you to figure out your shit and I don't want to be an “I don't know”, I want to be a “yes” because you’re a yes for me. I don’t want to wait around for this.

&amp;#x200B;

He told me he wants to keep seeing me and he may be making a huge mistake and that he probably is making a huge mistake in fact. We haven’t talked since. I think it’s probably over. These last few days have been miserable. I want to reach out to him, I want him to reach out to me, I really want to write him a letter. I want to be strong through this. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's where I'm at: when we ""broke it off"" it was very quick, a 30 min conversation (I cried) and it didn't feel solid, he was talking about maybe making a mistake, I told him it would take me a while to get over him. I want to write out my feelings and send him a letter, try to ease his woes about me being 21 and explain again that I have agency and to not make me feel like a child, that he doesn't get to decide what's best for me, and that I still want him.  Am I crazy? Will he reach out? How long does it usually take guys to get over someone?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Can I cure a 28 yr olds woes about dating a 21 yr old by reaching out to him post a breakup?"

9te8fk,875,2018-11-01,A followup after my lottery win,LuckySod,UKPersonalFinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/UKPersonalFinance/comments/9te8fk/a_followup_after_my_lottery_win/,"[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/UKPersonalFinance/comments/7y3vp1/i_won_1_million_and_feel_completely_out_of_my/) 

I promised after all of the advice that I got with my original post that I'd provide an update. I apologise that it's been a little while, but as you can possibly imagine it's been a little bit of a wild journey for me. Sorry if this is a bit long. 

The first thing to say is that Camelot have been fantastic. I was worried that they would introduce me to financial advisors pressuring me into buying lots of products that I didn't understand. I could not have been more wrong. 

The man from Camelot really stressed the importance of taking things at my own pace. He got me in contact with someone at my current bank who set up a ""hidden"" bank account for me that wasn't visible to the branch network, and the money got deposited in there. He also arranged a meeting with some representatives from other banks and funds who could offer advice and services. They were really good at just clearly laying out what their products or services were without any hard sell, and again emphasised taking my time and thinking things over.  

Because I had questions about giving money to my Mum anonymously, I was also put in touch with a solicitor with specialist knowledge in the area of gifts and inheritance. She was really nice, and said that it's common that people want to keep their win secret but help put family members, but explained that large anonymous cash gifts just attract suspicion from a tax and law enforcement perspective, and so practically there wouldn't be a good way of doing it without telling Mum. She also helped me write a will, which felt very weird but also means Mum will be sorted if anything happens and that I won't be inadvertently helping Dad drink himself to death. 

I then spent a month going through various sources of information and making a plan. I bought a couple of books (Graham and Hale were the best reads, thanks for the suggestions), and poured over posts here and on moneysavingexpert. I reviewed my budget and decided to keep it the same essentially for the time being. I also think I must have logged into my online banking at least 3 times a day for that first month just to make sure I wasnt dreaming! 

Then I got to work putting my plan in action. 

I put an amount equal to my living expenses for the remainder of my time at uni in a high interest current account, and have cancelled my maintenance loan. I have decided to continue to receive my tuition fee loan, and not to pay off my loan early because my understanding is that unless I make it big time in journalism I'm unlikely to pay back the full amount before it's written off. I can always review the situation later and change my mind if I get lucky (again).

I decided not to buy any property yet. I don't have any sources of income that would explain how I could afford a deposit, let alone a full property, without arousing suspicion. I'm also now in my final year and have a lot to think about in terms of finals, and going through the additional stress of house hunting doesn't seem appealing at the moment. Also I don't know if I'll end up working in the same location as I'm currently studying. Once I finish uni and get a job (hopefully), then I plan to buy somewhere. I figured I can always pretend that I'm renting it if people ask. 

I lied to my Mum and told her that I'd won a package holiday for 2 to somewhere she's always talked about wanting to visit, and took her on said holiday in the summer break. It was awesome, and she had the time of her life, but I also found it really hard lying to her, and almost told her a couple of times. I think this will continue to be one of the most difficult aspects that I will struggle with over the coming years. 

Dad got pissed off that I didn't ask him to come on holiday instead of Mum, despite the fact that I'm not sure he's even got passport, and now he's refusing to speak to me. I hope he'll come round, but it makes me feel a bit better that I didn't decide to give mum cash because based on how he's acted I think he'd definitely be trying to get some of that out of her. 

The rest of the money has gone into Vanguard index trackers, with the maximum allowance in an S&amp;S ISA and the rest in a regular account. I plan to finish uni, and then hopefully get a job, and I'll give myself a withdrawal of up to 3% each year if needed. My thinking was that this will be especially useful in the first few years out of uni while I'm likely to need to be in unpaid/low paid internships or freelancing. 

One thing I can recommend to anyone in a similar situation is counselling. I've been wrestling with feelings of guilt since the win. It's difficult seeing Mum renting a shitty flat when I know I could help her out, it's hard for me to accept that I now have an unfair advantage in my job hunt outside of university because unpaid internships are now an option for me, and I just generally feel I've done nothing to deserve this money. My university offers free counselling, and it's been a real help having someone to talk through things with and help me identify and work on addressing these negative feelings. Even if I had to pay for the service, I would. 

Again, I apologise for the length, but hopefully this is  the sort of update people were looking for. I'm happy to answer more questions if people have any, although they may have to wait until the morning...

Between MICU and EM rotations, I’m constantly switching between night shifts and day shifts - often multiple times a week. I don’t mind it one bit, as I’m a night owl, but I’d like to hear from all of you. Sometimes I feel like I lose a whole day or 1.5days sleeping/adjusting my sleep habits in order to get back into a routine, and then I’m right back to switching again. 

What are your tips &amp; tricks to working swing shifts/transitioning between night and day?"
9te9p7,7,2018-11-01,Intro to Programming Group?,Mr_Eeus,newjersey,https://www.reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/9te9p7/intro_to_programming_group/,"Hey all. Not sure if there's a rule against this in this sub, so shoot me down if that's the case - couldn't find anything too particular in the sidebar. If it's against the rules, apologies all.

&amp;nbsp;

Just wondering if there's any interest in a prepatory coding group? For context: I recently completed an internship, and the owner there loves to teach. Essentially he's looking to put together a group of 6 - 12 people, for a month long course to meet maybe 3 times a week, who want to learn coding and the fundamentals. Since there's office space available, it would be in Keyport, but it's a matter of finding out levels of interest? We're not affiliated with any coding bootcamp or anything like that, just local devs who want to bring up more programmers however we can lol.

&amp;nbsp;

Right now I don't have much in terms of what would be covered - It's an idea we sparked up on Wednesday and are trying to get sorted out. I know there are a lot of coding bootcamps springing up, so this would ideally be for people in the area to get a small group of people to learn and network with, and prepare people to go into either a bootcamp, or continue their learning. The huge point I want to stress is it wouldn't make you job ready, but it would be a way to learn from 0 if you preferred an 'in-person' experience. It would be an after-hours thing, so one could still work a job simultaneously, so from 6pm to 9pm, or something to that effect.

Lastly, for those who see this and think of things that they'd like out of that kind of program, can you share? We're looking more to teach than to benefit from it, and there would be a cost, but we have no idea what's fair for that sort of program."
9tejtu,0,2018-11-01,Denied my dream job... what now?,Orni96,nursing,https://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/9tejtu/denied_my_dream_job_what_now/,"Hey everyone,

I’m 21 year old male nursing student. I graduate this December from a very reputable nursing school.

Little bit of background on me:
I have good grades- B average.
I have three jobs; I work two EMS jobs (2 years) and a job as a nursing tutor (1 year).
I had an ER nursing internship over the summer which was an awesome experience.
My professors like me, my preceptors have all liked me and I my current employers really like me.

So here’s the deal,

I recently had an interview for a new grad staff nurse position at a trauma 1 emergency department- literally my dream job. It was a three stage interview. One with the nurse recruiter, one with a panel of employees in the ER and the last with the managers of the ER.

If I had to grade myself on how well I did in those interviews it would be A, B, B+; respectively. The interviews went really well, I felt confident, I kept eye contact well, I answered questions directly and gave real life examples of situations I’ve dealt with, etc. Basically, I felt extremely good about the interviews afterwards. I didn’t walk out feeling horrible or embarrassed, I felt great.

Fast forward to today, I get a phone call from the nurse recruiter who tells me I did not get selected for the position... I didn’t know what to think. As conceited as it sounds my first thoughts went directly to “Who is more qualified than me? How could I NOT be chosen? What did I do wrong?”

The last part is my question for you guys, what did I do wrong? Please help me figure this out 

This position is literally my dream job. I cannot see myself doing anything else in nursing... I can’t imagine doing anything else. Almost anything else besides ER/Trauma would make me a miserable person. 

I’ve applied to a trauma ICU position at the same hospital in hopes of working my way to the ER...

I’m just having a very difficult time processing all of this and it couldn’t have come at a worse time in the semester. 

Sorry for the mess I just needed to get my thoughts out there to my nursing buddies. "
9tewtu,7,2018-11-01,College senior not getting interviews. How do I get started?,productthrowaway1,prodmgmt,https://www.reddit.com/r/prodmgmt/comments/9tewtu/college_senior_not_getting_interviews_how_do_i/,"I'll keep this brief. College senior at a Ivy league school with a ~3.3 GPA, PM internship at a Fortune 100 company last semester, a leading &amp; PM-like role at a big on-campus organization.

Basically, I think I'm decently qualified to at least get a first round interview at a lot of places, but if I'm wrong, I'm fine being wrong. Are APM programs really this competitive? I've got two interview pipelines going, and I got rejected after a first round from another company. But dammit, I've submitted around 80 apps to companies of various size and prestige, and my ego is really taking a beating here.

Do I really have to get into this industry via networking? Is it a numbers game and I'm not doing enough? How did you all do it?"
9tf5z2,3,2018-11-01,[EVENT] Investigation into Groen headquarters incident,jjdive824,GlobalPowers,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalPowers/comments/9tf5z2/event_investigation_into_groen_headquarters/,"
June, 4th, 2022

[Belga] has been a few months since the large power protests against the closing of all nuclear facilities in Belgium, but the public is still asking, “Who broke the window?” This question has still not been answered, but after large support from anti-nuclear activist, and Groen no longer able to quell the Brussels Police Departments intuition, an investigation has begun. With some eyewitnesses saying they saw bricks thrown from the headquarters, and others including a few police on the scene saying they saw them thrown from the crowd. The investigation is expected to be complete in the coming month. Next up, violence continues between Israel and Palestine, with a Palestinian sponsored attack on a new IDF Housing facility. 

June, 29th, 2022

[Belga] We have reports that it turns out Groen employees were the ones responsible for the bricks. These employees were Sebastian van Oord and Ishika Laanstra, who were both interns at the building. Groen have made in an official statement, “These employees don’t represent the party as a whole, Groen does not support the actions taken by these employees, and condemns the violence they caused. These employees have been fired, and have been blacklisted, we have asked Ecolo and multiple other parties too as well and they have all compensated.” But according to recent polls, a portion of Groen voters no longer support the party, where are these supporters going? To the ps.a, who support the, “United Belgium” movement. This is expected to overall make ps.a and Groen votes more balanced.

9tfzld,8,2018-11-01,How to decrease client load?,blueoscar,psychotherapy,https://www.reddit.com/r/psychotherapy/comments/9tfzld/how_to_decrease_client_load/,"Hi all--I've been a private practice therapist for a little over a year. When I first started, I had several clients who I started out seeing as an intern; therefore, I wasn't getting paid for them. Now that I am seeing them as a private therapist, I am getting paid, just very little ($20/session) compared to my other clients ($90/session) who I brought on after graduating. I have a caseload of about 12 clients and ideally I'd like to cut it down so I can work less hours and make same amount of money. I seem to have little problems getting clients and I see them pretty much all of them weekly.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I'm planning to get pregnant in the next 6 months, so ideally, a lighter workload with higher paying clients would also be good for my stress levels--but I'm worried about abandoning my longer time clients and sometimes I feel like I just have to suck it up as part of the work.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice on how to decrease a client load, especially if some of the clients have been coming every week for over a year?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit to add: the low paying clients also don't have much income, so increasing pay is not an option... also, there is some pretty hefty erotic transference that has come up with these 3 clients (all men, I'm a woman), so at times I think another therapist would be helpful for them, even though they each have made pretty significant progress since working with me.

I’ve had depression and generalized anxiety most of my life, I was 8 when I was first diagnosed and treated (the doctor originally thought I might have bipolar, my dad and older brother both do, but I’ve never had a manic episode), it got worse in my teen years but one of my triplet brothers mental illness came out too, and he is schizophrenic and violent at that (I’m aware that the majority of schizophrenia patients aren’t) and my needs were put on the back burner. 

I had originally planned on going to college to become a nurse, but after I graduated I had a surgery on my ankle because of a childhood injury, the injury was worse than previously thought and I was told I’d never be able to do a job that needs me to be on my feet all day, so i didn’t know what to do with my life, and I just did odd jobs.

I did that until I was 23, that’s when my other triplet brother talked me into going to college, as I was deciding what I wanted to pursue I started having symptoms... and I got hit with Cancer, it took two years to fully recover from chemo and be able to think and remember things well enough to go back to college.

At 25 I met the girl of my dreams, she was amazing in every way. We connected over health struggles, she had epilepsy and a muscle disorder that she needed leg braces. After a few months we were together, but a few months after that she got sick, a misdiagnosis and botched surgery snowballed into a chronic state of illness, she was only 20. Despite that I stayed, I knew what it was like be told “I can’t handle that you’re sick” and I would never hurt her like that. Life proceeded, With her encouragement I started going back to college, in reality I was doing it for our future together, I wasn’t worth doing something like that for myself.

My second semester in college she ended up with pneumonia bad enough her oxygen levels dropped and she slipped into a coma. She’s a fighter and made it through, but forgot our entire relationship, she remembered who I was and how she felt, just nothing else, she broke up with me, that was too much for her. After a month we did get back together, she decided we needed to start over, and we did.

And here I am, just an internship to finish to get the associates degree I’m working for, and some dipshit resident decides her life isn’t worth living and lets an infection progress to the point that even if she fights it off, she’d die from organ damage in the following months, never informing her or her family or even considering treating her... she was 23, and she wanted it live. she passed away 5 weeks ago, and I don’t know how to continue with life, I’m lost, my future shattered, and I have no clue how to even start picking up the pieces.

9tgay3,56,2018-11-01,House Rewatch - Season 1 Episode 1,Umberoc,HouseMD,https://www.reddit.com/r/HouseMD/comments/9tgay3/house_rewatch_season_1_episode_1/,"Well, there was talk of starting a rewatch thread a couple of weeks ago. Since it hasn't materialized I've decided to jump in a start one beginning with the Pilot. I'm going to try to review one episode per day. Not sure how it will go, but I think it will be fun to start over and take a closer look. I've watched most of the episodes multiple times, but I often start in the middle of Season 1 when the show is starting to really roll. Even good pilots can be hard to watch.

**Season 1 Episode 1 - The Pilot**

Patient - Rebecca Adler, a kindergarten teacher

Presenting symptom - Seizure, loss of ability to speak

Final diagnosis - Tapeworm larva in the brain

**Notes**

The patient is so happy! She met someone and apparently got laid. That's about to come crashing down. Apparently the show was about happiness not lasting from the get-go. Also, the introduction of a slutty, lying kindergarten teacher also establishes that the show is going to break tropes.

The music is so intense! They really seem to be trying to make this suspenseful. The laughter of the children and horror movie sound effects as she's having a seizure are pretty freaky.

House's disability seems worse in this first episode. It really slows him down.

Making Foreman new to the team let's Cameron and Chase explain things to the audience. Good move for a pilot episode.

Hugh Laurie's bald spot is showing! I guess they didn't care about covering it up yet.

Ah, the very first MRI disaster. I swear MRIs on this show are like transporter's on Star Trek. The patient's throat closes and they have to do a tracheotomy. The actors are pretty slow this first time.

First clinic patient is the orange man. Funny thing is the weird color palette/lighting of this episode means everyone looks pretty orange.

Chase tries to give a patient a comforting lie and Cameron undermines him. It looks like they might have originally meant to make Chase the feeling one and Cameron the harder one.

Foreman is surprisingly good with kids. Is it working for House that turns him into a robot?

Wilson tells the patient that if we judge people by their actions, House cares about people. Interesting.

Foreman actually seems like a neurologist who knows neurology stuff the others don't.

Some backstory bits and details - Foreman went to Hopkins, Cameron had an internship at the Mayo clinic, Wilson is Jewish.

I like the animations. I guess they ate up time? The use them a lot less in the future.

Wait, the patient who was so happy in the beginning is now ready to die? That seems like quite a turn around. I realize it gives House a chance to argue in favor of living, but it's kind of hard to believe. Also, it's right here in the pilot that House believes in seeing life through. He struggles with this in the future, but always ultimately reaffirms this belief. So, we might even call it a core belief.

Chase has the idea to use the x-ray and House actually says ""Chase is right."" Ha!

Cameron is sitting in House's chair at the start of the scene where he tells why her hired her. Reminds me of the end of Season 3 when she resigns. (Or rather it should work the other way around). House and Cameron already have a lot of chemistry in this scene.

Chase is the one who brings the treatment and really connects with the patient in the end.

**Final Thoughts**

The pilot does a good job introducing the characters and the format of the series. The basic ideas of the show are already in place... everybody lies, you can't always get what you want, etc. The color palette and lighting are awful.

Hope you will rewatch too and let me know your thoughts!

9tgvo6,18,2018-11-02,[Clinical] Feeling lost on MICU rotation,Jan-Itor-MD,medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/9tgvo6/clinical_feeling_lost_on_micu_rotation/,"Hello,

A little background: I'm a final-year IMG who is doing a rotation in MICU at a big US hospital. My plan is to match in IM next cycle.

So basically, I'm feeling incredibly overwhelmed at the MICU. It's not the workload, I just follow one to two patients and don't do much more than presenting and charting. The thing is, I have never been this hyper-aware of how much I don't know. The complexity of the cases just makes me lock up and struggle to understand what the hell is going on. I struggle to answer the most basic of questions during case discussions.

I did rotations in cardio and GI before this, and while I definitely didn't know everything, I never felt this lost. I'm so stressed out that whenever someone speaks to me there, I answer in a meek voice and even make mistakes in my English, which rarely happens in a normal situation. I'm usually confident, calm, and collected, but not over there.

The intern on my team is super nice and tries to teach me stuff whenever he can. But he started residency just a few months ago, I never would have expected the gap in our knowledge and general clinical aptitude to be this huge at this point. And it's not just the knowledge, he can keep up with like 10 patients and know most things about them off the top of his head, while I barely manage to present from a piece of paper on which I've written everything (and still manage to miss stuff).

Granted, I have not taken step 2 CK yet, but I did well on step 1 and always thought I was actually doing ok clinical wise. I realize that attendings expect students to be at or close to the level of an intern, but from what I can tell, I'm nowhere near that. I'm not sure if I'm gonna be able to get a good LoR from an attending, which I really need.

Rationally, I'm aware that MICU is relatively intense. I'll power through it. But I'm very worried about what kind of intern I'm going to be when I begin residency. Will I always be playing catch up? 

**TL;DR: IMG doing MICU rotation. Feeling completely lost while the intern seems to have it all perfectly under control. Does this reflect on what kind of resident I'm going to be?**"

9thzvm,1,2018-11-02,TW Rape - Such Self Doubt,nspaf,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/9thzvm/tw_rape_such_self_doubt/,"As with a lot of posts: apologies for formatting, I'm on mobile :) Additionally, I'm posting from a throwaway.

I (24, F) don't know how to begin this, so I suppose I'll start with the backstory and then work my way to the 'night'. Fair warning this will be VERY long, but I'm getting it off my chest. Also there'll be a TL:DR!

I was a depressed teen and one personal thing lead to another and it ultimately ended with me transferring to an alternative high school the start of my sophmore year. All was getting to where I was more cognitive of my mental health and working on myself, but I felt lonely. So junior year starts and I meet her - we'll call her Josie. Josie was new to my school that year and we ended up reveling in our loneliness and becoming best friends very quickly. As most people would tell you, becoming best friends with someone shouldn't be a quick and fast decision but telling that to a depressed 15 year old is hardly easy.

After developing a friendship and whatnot it started becoming clear to me (and my parents) that Josie was kind of a crap person. Where I was lonely out of emotional walls and self destruction, Josie was lonely out of everyone realizing she was awful. I try to be a positive person, even today I struggle with deeply negative emotions but try my best to make sure I'm not putting out this energy into the world - I'd hate to think my negative thoughts caused the same feelings in another. That said, I feel comfortable saying this: Josie was awful. She was selfish, insincere, lies frequenting her tongue more than kindness, and inconsiderate of others. She only acted ""kindly"" if she thought it would benefit her or benefit other's views of her. So what did I do when all of this became apparent? Attached myself to her because I was (and sometimes still am) a self destructive dumbass.

Years pass and I move away after I graduate. I go to college, do an internship away from home and meet a boy. After returning home I decide I miss my best friend and the cheaper life in the town our high school was in (home = a much more expensive city) so I decide to move in with her and her immigrant boyfriend (this is a semi-important detail, I'll call him Hassan).

Living with her is hell. It was a 2 bedroom apartment; one for her and him, and one for me and my boyfriend when he moved from his home state. She had let a friend of hers (we'll call Brittney) move in to save on rent until I moved in, but didn't bother asking her to leave once I got there since ""she was here first and she's my best friend"". Which is fine, I'm kind of surprised to hear her say this because if I called anyone else even a friend she made me swear up and down they're not my best friend, only she is. But okay, this girl can stay... But all Brittney's stuff is in my room that I'm paying half the rent for, so all my stuff gets piled up in Josie's room and I sleep in my ""room"" while Brittney sleeps in Josie's room. So that leaves Josie and Hassan sleeping on the living room floor and so they can complain whenever is convenient for them and they need an upper hand.

As much as I complain about Josie looking back, this is almost all hindsight. I knew she was kinda crappy as a friend and not a great person in general, but she was there for me when I had no one and I felt I owed it to her to stick through until Brittney finally moved out and we could get back to being friends and normal roommates. 

About a month and a half after moving in I broke up with my LDR boyfriend who was supposed to move in with us. It was my first serious, adult relationship and I was pretty torn up but I knew it was for the best because I knew we wouldn't work long term. About a week after this Brittney moves out, and I feel like a huge weight has been lifted. So I start drinking a bit because I'm upset over breaking up with my boyfriend and have this manic energy of Brittney is finally gone but he is now too. Sensing I'm upset and could use a pick me up, Josie suggests going to a club - our first time going to one together since we were under aged when I first lived in that town.

We have a girl's night and she takes me to a gay club (I'm not straight so this is perfect, and she's dating Hassan). I'm still a little tipsy from drinking about an hour beforehand and Josie gets us more drinks. Which lead to a couple more for me, she stops after the first - her goal is to get me to hook up with someone since she ""has always found me cute, and [I] need this"" but I'm not really a hookup person normally. 

I'm drunk enough that I'm just in the mood for a movie and bed, not hooking up with a stranger, so I ask if we can go home. She's fine with this and calls Hassan asking him to pick us up. He's already in the area and we're on our way fairly shortly. In the car I kiss her cheek, in a 100% friendly way, and say thanks for looking out for me but I'm better being alone tonight.

She kisses my cheek back and says she loves me and I'm her best friend, and she holds my hand while Hassan drives. He starts making cat call noises and talking about liking the show. She starts giggling, talking about being soOoOo drunk (she only had 1 drink and can hold her liquor as she drinks frequently) and kept doing this arm brush thing so she'd graze my boobs whenever Hassan was at a red light and looking at us. I don't mind casual breast play since I'm very drunk and know my friend would never hurt me.

We arrive home and she won't let go of my hand into the apartment. We walk in and she drags me to the bedroom giggling and talking about making sure ""I don't die in my sleep"" which I think is sweet. Throughout high school we'd slept in the same bed a million times so I thought nothing of this, and when she'd brought up if we could ever fool around together several times I'd always been against, firmly. 

I still didn't think much of it when she started helping me take my clothes off to change for bed. When she started doing the same without offering me any replacement clothes, drunken alarm bells started going off. When Hassan joined us it sounded like Tinkerbell was having a panic attack in my head.

One thing lead to another and I felt like I left my body. My hands were guided onto his dick, into her, into me... I vaguely remember reminding her I didn't want this but her telling me it was fine, I remember saying things I didn't want to do but not really saying stop. I remember their hands forcing me onto of them, one at a time. I remember them placing themselves in my mouth and telling me that this is what they wanted and that they loved me and that I lived with them so now they could be there whenever. I can feel them on top of me still, 2 years later. Choking me, entering places I didn't want. 

He didn't use protection and I remember for weeks afterwards freaking out about getting pregnant. I got checked for any diseases and when the nurse asked if I knew if my partners were clean and remembered to use protection if they were strangers thinking ""I didn't partake it just happened around me, it happened to me"" but all I really said was ""we were drunk, I'm just being cautious"". I talked with her briefly and she joked about ""having gotten a threesome out of [her] system"" and not wanting to be that drunk again. I told her how I hated that it happened, felt shameful, and that Hassan kept making goo goo eyes and cat call noises if I'd even leave my room for the bathroom at night.

Shortly after I moved home and made some new friends and met a new boy. He's amazing and loving, supportive, and my best friend. I went no contact with Josie after moving, and when she'd reach out saying she was depressed or lonely I'd suggest a hotline to call or reaching out to one of her friends like Brittney. I'd all but buried that night when about 6 months after it happened a couple of my friends and I were talking and one of them mentioned one of his friends living in a crappy apartment with 2 others who made her uncomfortable and something broke in me. I froze and got quiet. We dropped the other friends off and when it was just my boyfriend and I (just friends at the time) I burst into tears. I had a huge panic attack and felt the urge to self harm for the first time in several years. He held me and listened, he didn't pry but let me know he was ready when I was to talk. 

For the next year and a half since then I've had on an off panic attacks about that night. There's been things in life I regret after the fact, but that's one of very few things I remember regretting while it happened. I talked to my therapist about this and she's explained it as rape and that I have PTSD. I believe her on the PTSD but I don't know if I'd call it rape, personally. I was drunk, and I just let it happen. I only barely put up a fight and they assumed I was for resisting since I'm into kinkier things. Everyone I've told thinks it's rape. I don't feel like a rape ""survivor"" I feel like a rape ""existentialist"". My therapist says if you wouldn't have given the consent sober and had to be drunk to give it then it's not consent. When talking about anyone but myself, I'd agree.

The biggest thing is the self guilt. Hassan is an immigrant and I haven't reported anything because I don't think it was rape because it happened to ME. I don't want to call it rape because Josie and Hassan wouldn't think of it as that if they talked about that night. They'd call me a liar and say it was my choice, and I asked for it. They wouldn't think it's rape, so why should I? This issue is that since I'm not considering it that and don't have the balls to report it (plus it was 2 years ago) Hassan is still able to apply for citizenship.

I feel selfish if I call it rape because there's actual rape survivors and they're so strong and had horrific experiences. I feel selfish if I call it rape because I'm letting a rapist become a member of our country without at least reporting it.

Way TL;DR: Ex best friend and her boyfriend forced me into a threesome I didn't want to be a part of. I have self guilt over calling it rape and over NOT calling it rape. I'm kind of crappy as a person."

&amp;#x200B;

Recently a friend of mine got a really high end, well paid internship in the UK and that got me thinking about trying to find out if there are any high-end opportunities as an intern in Denmark. And yeah, I imagine the chances of that are low :P.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been studying software engineering here for the past year and (almost) a half so in the next semester I will have to apply to an internship. I am aware that most of the internships which are paid follow the typical standard set by IDA, however I would like to find out if anyone knows of some local companies that offer a higher salary than that. Alternatively, maybe someone knows of some international companies that might have higher salaries with internship opportunities in Denmark such as Google in Aarhus.

&amp;#x200B;

Some of the obvious international companies that I have already applied to are the usual big names like Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon, Twitter etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Since I’m not asking about my chances of getting hired I don’t think my knowledge of Danish is relevant here but if you really want to know, I know as much as a year and a half of studying it gives you.

I either got very drunk on two cans of beer or someone slipped something into my drink because even though I said no, it happened and I can't remember too much about it. I was covered in cuts and some bruises the next day.  I'm not sure what to call it, but it wasn't great experience. I went to the nurse to get plan B and cried but didn't discuss it with her other than I needed emergency contraception.

I also experienced a sexual assault by a man I didn't know, I blamed myself but I did see a counselor about this and it did help me to process the assault and my feelings a little.

&amp;#x200B;

I have experienced lots of incidents of groping in bars, clubs, parties and men who I thought of as friends sending me photos of their junk and as an intern I experienced sexual harassment from an older man - who told colleagues that I slept with him (I did not).

I'm glad to have a forum to voice my experiences and I'm sorry for anyone who has experienced any sort of incident covered by the #metoo umbrella."

Back in my first year at my internship, I was extremely attracted to one of the other interns.  One day I'm sitting there plugging away at my work, when I hear this woman, on speaker phone at someone else's desk, complaining about my crush's professionalism during a recent service request, and she didn't know what she was doing (even though she fixed the problem).  My coworker with whom she was on the phone, heard me stand up and quickly interrupted her saying, ""I'll call you back"" and hung up.  


I quickly asked, ""Who was that?  She must've known she was on speaker phone despite acting like such a jackass.""  My co-worker showed me the woman's company photo and told me her name.  I said calmly, ""Send all of her helpdesk tickets to me.""

&amp;#x200B;

For the remaining 3 months I worked in this seasonal position, every morning as soon as I got to work, I opened up Active Directory.  I brought up her account and I checked one simple box.  ""User must change password at next login.""  By week 2 she was losing her mind, and I kept playing dumb.  Telling her I didn't know why it was happening and ensuring her I was hard at work trying desperately to fix this problem.

&amp;#x200B;

My Director thought this was the funniest shit he'd ever seen.  I got glowing letters of recommendation from several colleagues, including him.  So don't think complaining to higher ups will get you anywhere; we take care of our own.

&amp;#x200B;

In the end, this didn't help me sway favor with the young lady I was interested in, but I got a great story out of it and furthered my career in the process.

9tkk0p,5,2018-11-02,Sometimes you have to fail to succeed. This is my story...,ljodzn,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/9tkk0p/sometimes_you_have_to_fail_to_succeed_this_is_my/,"TL;DR I was fired twice in 2 years, then I learned to see my personality as a huge asset when interviewing, and I've never been happier. I'm finally at a good place after fighting and clawing my way uphill and I want to talk about it so here I am.


Three years ago I was working in a mom-n-pop shop as a graphic designer. I enjoyed the work but I wasn't being paid much and I needed a change. I went to community college to upgrade/refresh my coding skills, the plan being to get into web design. I accepted a high-paying position at a local medical facility in spite of knowing I wasn't a good culture fit but I needed the money. I'm a very bold personality and I don't blend in with the wallpaper, believe me I tried.  I was fired within a few months because I ""just wasn't a good fit"" and went crawling back to my old job, embarrassed and licking my wounds.

Then I was offered a position at a competing mom-n-pop shop the next town over (which created some uncomfortable tension with my employer but that's another story) but was fired there a few months in, again because I ""wasn't a good fit"", and again I came crawling back to my old job. Fortunately, the owner was happy to have me back.

Being fired twice in 2 years was hugely embarrassing, I genuinely wondered if I was even fit for society.  

I took some time to reflect and lay low, I received lots of love and support from my family and friends.  During this time, I got tested and diagnosed for ADHD and clinical anxiety, in addition to my existing depression diagnosis. Being on the right medications and getting a great therapist helped stabilize my mental health and give clarity to other things.

On a whim, I emailed my resume to a place I'd wanted to work at for a very, very long time, asking if I could intern as a web designer. To my surprise, they gave me an interview and I walked out with a full-time job instead of an internship.

I've been here a year and a half and I'm a great culture fit here. That alone has been such a relief! 

Recently, my company's president/founder retired and promoted my VP as the new company president. She does not value web design &amp; development and I can foresee my position going away in the next 3-6 months as she finds ways to minimize costs. I updated my resume, updated my portfolio site, and started reluctantly applying to web design jobs again.

This time, my highest priority is finding a good culture fit *first.* I've never seen my personality as an asset before, but this change in perspective has been a game-changer.

I'm happy to report I went to 2 interviews last week and I nailed both of them. Company A is waiting on the official OK to extend an offer (ugh), Company B will let me know next week but I could tell they really wanted to hire me by the time I walked out of that interview. Crossing my fingers Company B will extend an offer!

What I've learned;

• Don't be ashamed to shine your light; being your authentic self goes a long way

• Learn from failure, but keep fighting for success

• Live your best life; I'm actively shaping my life to look how i want it to look and I've never been happier

Thanks for reading!"

So if you’re reading this just because you like Harry Potter, you’re going to have a bad time. Probably.  

I think the private lesson stuff is pretty hot, so I milked it again for this chapter. The next chapter will be different.) 


Hermione walked into the Gryffindor common room and looked around. She spotted Harry, Ron, Lavender, and Parvati sitting by the fire. She and Ron hadn't been on good terms for a while. She hated that he was dating Lavender, and was annoyed that he couldn't figure out why she didn’t like that. 

Scanning the room further she spotted Ginny sitting alone in the corner reading. There was an empty chair beside her so she took it. 

""Hey Ginny, mind if I sit?"" She asked. 

""Yeah, go ahead, I need a distraction anyways."" Said Ginny. 

Hermione sat down and they began talking. They talked for ten minutes before Hermione couldn't help but remember Ginny and Michael and everything she heard about them. She was burning to ask about it, and now she had her chance. Everyone except for the two of them had left the common room. 

""Ginny?"" She said tentatively. 

""Yes?"" 

""Why do you keep sleeping with Michael? He's a jerk and you can do better."" 

Ginny smiled at her innocent friend. 

""For a boyfriend: hell yes! I could do MUCH better. Just for sex? No, I couldn't."" 

""So you're not dating him? You're just having sex?"" Hermione asked curiously. 

""Yeah, why? Do you like him?"" Asked Ginny, teasing her friend. 

""Oh, God no. He's a pig, who only views women as trophy's an-"" 

""And sperm dumpsters, I know."" Said Ginny, finishing Hermione's sentence for her, but in a more crude manner. 

""Then why do you keep doing it?"" Asked Hermione incredulously. ""Is he really that good?"" 

""He's fucking amazing. Or should I say, amazing at fucking!"" Said Ginny enthusiastically. 

""Really?"" 

""You have no idea! The sex is honestly amazing.” 

""Is it just really large, or-"" 

""It?!"" Laughed Ginny. ""Hermione, we're alone. Just say cock."" 

Hermione laughed and blushed all at once. 

""Ok, ok! Does he have a big cock?"" 

""Yes. Yes he does. And he knows how to use it. And his hands. And his tongue. Anyways, why so curious?"" 

""No reason, just thought I'd ask."" 

""You can borrow him if you'd like."" 

Hermione snorted. 

""I'm serious. His cock would take all your stress away, you'd love it. You'd hate it, but you'd love it."" 

""Very funny."" 

""Do you hear me laughing? I mean why not? He's not that bad. He thinks the exact same way every other guy thinks, he's just more open about it."" 

""All guys are not like that."" 

""Yes, they are! Do you think McLaggen hasn't fantasized about fucking you? Or stared at your ass as you walked by? He does Hermione, they all do; and I don't blame them, you've got an amazing ass.""

""Harry doesn't."" 

""Oh yes he does. I guarantee he's checked you out before."" 

""You're being ridiculous."" 

""Hermione, the only person in this school who's not in tune with their sexuality is you."" 

“Thats ridiculous, I can’t be the only one. And again, not all boys are like that.” 

“Hermione, earlier today a couple of third graders asked me if I wanted more butter for my muffin... and no, we weren’t in the great hall. Face it, boys are disgusting. Wonderfully disgusting.""

Michael tried with all his might to keep the image of Professor Davies incredible tits fresh in his mind. 

He failed. However this wasn't a bad thing, it just increased his drive to get a better view. 

He entered their next lesson feeling more excited than he had in his entire life. So far each lesson had taken their relationship further and he was hoping today he'd get either a view of her pussy, or feel her tits. Hell, just getting to see them again would blow his mind. 

He walked in and saw her standing there wearing a dark blue blouse with a matching skirt and a scarf draped around her neck. She smiled as he walked in. 

""Only five minutes early today. Have you already seen all that you wanted to?"" She joked. 

""Definitely not."" He said. ""And even if I never got to see more, it'd still be the best experience of my life."" 

Before she came here tonight she made an important decision. She thought about their situation. She weighed the pros and cons of what she and Michael were doing and decided that she was ok with it. Or was going to be. This was the best way for him to learn, and she decided it was her duty as his teacher to ensure he gets his education.

This was all bullshit, but she didn't care. All she knew was that she was enjoying their lessons almost as much as him and she was excited to see where they'd go tonight. 

Her enjoyment aside, she never intended to take their lessons any further than his education. If he desired to learn about the female anatomy she'll gleefully oblige him. But she knew that thats where the line had to be drawn. She knew she shouldn't fuck him. 

""Well then, lets see if we can give you another."" She said, still smiling. ""So lets make this lesson simpler. For each properly performed spell, I'll remove one article of clothing. Just to be clear, that includes my shoes and scarf... I wouldn't want to make it too easy on you."" 

Michael smiled. 

""Of course not, Professor."" Said Michael. ""But what about if you run out of clothing?"" 

""You'll have to wait and see, won't you?"" She said, teasingly. ""So, lets get started. We'll begin with an easy one. A disarming spell."" 

""Ok."" Said Michael as he drew out his wand and took aim. 

He performed the spell on his second attempt. 

""Well done!"" Beamed Ms. Davies. ""You've definitely improved."" 

She removed her scarf from her neck, and Michael was delighted and surprised that the blouse she wore showed a fair bit of cleavage. 

She seemed to read his thoughts.

""I figured you've already seen my breasts, so a bit of cleavage wouldn't be considered inappropriate."" She said. 

""I consider it a treat."" Said Michael, not bothering to look away. 

Ms. Davies laughed. 

""Well, if you continue to perform like this then there'll be plenty more treats to come."" 

""Then lets continue."" Smiled Michael. 

""Lets see if you can replicate the spell."" Said Ms. Davies. 

Michael performed the spell a second time. 

""Very good."" Said Ms. Davies as she retrieved her wand. 

She kicked off one of her shoes to the side near her scarf. 

""How about once more?"" She asked. ""It's dreadfully uncomfortable standing on one shoe."" 

Smiling, Michael performed the spell for a third time. 

""There."" Said Ms. Davies, as she kicked off her other shoe. ""The sets complete."" 

""What now?"" Asked Michael. 

""I think a shield charm would be a good idea."" Said Ms. Davies as she demonstrated how. ""Now you."" 

Michael tried and deliberately failed. As badly as he wanted to see her naked, he knew he had to keep up appearances. He tried no less than thirty times, but he was still determined to draw out this performance. He was a thespian and this was his stage. 

Ms. Davies felt it was a good time to play up on his motivation. She began slowly walking towards him in a sultry, sexual manner. 

""Michael."" She said, fifteen feet away. ""I want you to keep in mind what you're missing out on and what you'll get if you perform it properly."" 

Ten feet away. 

""Think about my large breasts hidden beneath my blouse, begging to be released. You only saw them for a minute last session. You could see them for a hell of a lot longer tonight."" 

Five feet away. 

""Think of my big, stiff nipples and my bouncing breasts. Can you see them Michael?"" 

She was a foot in front of him. Far closer than she's ever been to him. Michael swallowed. 

""No, I'm afraid I can't."" He said, honestly. He was furious at his memory for failing him. 

She stared into his eyes for a minute before saying: ""Then perform the spell."" 

She stared up at him for a few seconds longer before turning around and walking back into position. 

He drew a deep breath, and then he performed the shield charm perfectly. This triggered a smile from both of them. 

""See?"" She said. ""That wasn't so hard."" 

Ms. Davies removed her blouse and tossed it on the floor. 

She was wearing a very sexy black bra. He stared at her wonderful bra covered breasts. He was so fucking horny. 

""Do it again."" She instructed. 

He performed the spell a second time. 

She turned around, facing away from Michael, taking away his view of her breasts. Then she grabbed hold of her skirt and started to slowly pull it down her legs, bending with it as she did. She stayed there for a few seconds, her beautiful ass sticking in the air. She was wearing a pair of black panties to compliment her bra. She slowly stood back up and turned around to face him. 

She was thoroughly enjoying this. Even the time spent in limbo, waiting for him to perform the spells correctly, was exciting to her. She was imagining what to reward him with once she was naked, and one idea after the other caused her vagina to become wet. She had been soaked for a while now, but this time the smell of her vagina didn't bother her. It excited her and she hoped Michael could smell it too. She hoped it made his big cock rock hard and ready to fuck, even though she had no intentions of doing that. But a girl can fantasize. 

""Ok, Michael. Next we'll do a stunning spell."" 

""Was it named after you?"" He asked, causing her to giggle. 

""Wow, that was terrible."" She smiled. ""For this one, lets practice on a dummy."" 

She whipped out her wand and made a dummy appear out of nowhere. She then went and stood right beside Michael. She glanced down at his cock. 

""Someone's excited."" She teased. 

""So is someone else."" Said Michael, as he audibly sniffed the air. 

She couldn't help but blush at this, even though she was happy he could smell her. She still couldn't help but laugh. 

""Touché. Now watch closely."" She said as she demonstrated the stunning spell. 

""I will."" He said, taking a step back and getting a great view of her panty clad ass. 

She smiled as she performed it again, enjoying the attention. 

""You're turn."" She said, stepping back. 

He stepped forward, and once again deliberately performed the spell wrong. He did this a little more than ten times before deciding it was ok to do it properly. 

""Terrifically done, Michael."" She praised him. Then she reached around and undid her bra. She slid it off and gave him his second view of her perfect breasts. 

They were better than he remembered. He stared at them, mesmerized, trying to carve the image into his brain. The size, the shape, the light pink colour of her nipples. 

""Wow."" He said. 

""I'm glad you like them."" Said Ms. Davies, giggling. 

""They're perfect."" He said, meaning every word. 

He stared at them for a minute longer before Ms. Davies broke the silence. 

""I think I have one or two more things to show you. If you're good to continue."" 

""Yes."" He said, excited. ""I am. 

""Ok, then. Perform it again."" 

He took aim, thought about her wet pussy and performed the spell. 

""Heres to you, Michael."" She said as she pulled down her panties and stood back up. 

He couldn't see much of her pussy because her legs were closed, but his mouth still watered at the sight of it. It was pink and glistening, with her pubes shaved into a triangle, guiding him to the most intimate part on her body. 

""As you can see, and smell, it's as excited to see you as you are to see it."" She said, staring down at his bulge. 

She turned around, giving him a full view of her ass. It was big, creamy, and very round. He just wanted to squeeze it so badly. 

She turned back around. 

""Now, I have one more spell."" She said, pausing to let him soak in the view of her naked body, as well as realize what that meant. ""Now, I can't let you touch my body, but that doesn't mean I cant touch it, or give you a better view. So... If you perform the full body bind, I'll sit on that chair and spread my legs for you. Would you like to see that?"" 

""I'd love to see that."" Said Michael, a bit disappointed he didn't get to touch her. 

He performed the spell in only 6 tries. He desperately wanted a good look at her pussy. 

""Great work today, Michael."" She said as she sat down. ""Now you can't touch me, but you can get as close as you'd like."" 

""Ok."" Said Michael, swallowing. 

She stared into his eyes as she slowly parted her legs, giving him a great view of her wet pussy. 

""You can get closer, don't be shy."" She said, loving the look on his face. 

He did just that. He got on his knees and kneeled between her open legs. He could heavily smell her pussy and it made him want to bury his face in her hot pink twat and lick away. She was so fucking beautiful. He couldn't believe his luck, as he was just a foot away from her pussy. He sat there for a little while before she figured she should end their session. 

""You should get to bed, Michael."" 

""Ok, thank you so much for this Professor."" He said, earnestly. 

""Anything for my favourite student."" She said, winking. 

He got up and walked towards the door, as he opened it he looked back at her. She had her hand between her legs and was rubbing her pussy. He watched for a couple seconds before she called to him.

""Goodnight, Michael."" She said, slightly breathless and inserting a finger in her twat. 

""Goodnight, and have fun."" Said Michael, and then he left the room taking one last look as he did.

Harry got up early one morning and went for a walk. Not for any particular reason, just to clear his head, and start the day right. After 20 minutes of aimlessly walking around, he decided he’d go see Hedwig. 

A few minutes later Harry opened the door to the owlery and saw that Hedwig already had some company. 

""Hello Harry."" Said Ms. Davies, warmly. 

""Hello, Professor."" Harry greeted back. ""How are you?"" 

""I'm good, thanks for asking."" She said. ""Is this your owl?” 

“Yeah, her names Hedwig.” 

“Shes a beautiful bird.”
Said Ms. Davies, gently stroking Hedwigs feathers. “Oh, I’m so sorry, do you need to send a letter?” 

“Yeah, kinda.” Said Harry, feeling a little bashful around his beautiful Professor. He had never been alone with her before. “But thats fine. She seems to like you.” 

Hedwig cooed in acknowledgment, and rubbed her head against Ms. Davies hand. 

“Well, since I’m keeping you from your owl, you’re welcome to use mine, but he’s not as friendly I’m afraid.” 

Harry spotted a large, black owl staring at him, its large eyes piercing Harry’s soul. 

“I’ll give it a go. I’m pretty good with animals.” Harry cautiously approached the haughty looking owl. 

“Yes, Hagrid’s told me all about it. Never misses a chance to praise you, that man.” 

“He’s just a very kind Professor.” Harry said, nearing the owl with his hand outstretched. “Whats your owls name?” 

“Aegis.” Replied Ms. Davies. 

“Well, Aegis. Would you be willing to deliver a letter for me?” 

The dark owl leaned forward towards Harrys hand, inspecting it. After a few moments, Aegis cooed and rubbed the side of his head against Harrys fingers. 

“Wow.” Said Ms. Davies. “He doesn’t like many people.” 

“Well, like I said. I’m just good with animals I guess.” 

“Harry, the last person who tried to touch him nearly lost an eye.” 

“Why didn’t you say something earlier?” Asked Harry, genuinely concerned, his eyes darting from Aegis to Ms. Davies. To his surprise, she was smiling. 

“I’m joking. He wouldn’t hurt you. Not too bad.” 

They both laughed as Harry scratched under Aegis’ chin. 

“Besides,” Continued Ms. Davies. “I’m certain that if I had told you that, you’d want to do it more.” 

“Fair enough.” Chuckled Harry, and he began to attach his letter. 

Harry really liked her as a teacher and wasn't surprised by how easy and enjoyable it was to talk with her. She was always really warm towards her students. He laughed as he imagined attempting to do the same with Snape. 

""Whats funny?"" She asked, smiling. 

""Nothing. I was just imagining trying to start a friendly chat with Professor Snape."" 

She let out a burst of laughter. ""That would be a sight.""

They both sat in silence for a minute, each gently stroking the others owl. 

""So, Potter."" She said, using a jokingly stern tone. ""What are your plans after Hogwarts?"" 

""I'd like to become an auror."" He said. 

""Really?"" She asked, intrigued. ""I guess with your history that would make a good fit."" 

""Yeah, I'm sort of an unofficial intern."" 

""Would you like a little extra help?"" She laughed, causing his spirits to soar. 

""Yeah, that would be great!"" He said, ecstatic. ""If it's not too much trouble.""

""None at all."" She said, happily. 

They continued to talk for a while longer, enjoying each others company. Once they parted ways Harry couldn't help but feel elated at the thought of having private lessons with the most beautiful woman in Hogwarts.

Michael postponed their next lesson a few days. Partly because he wanted to make her wait and build up her libido. The other was so that he could surprise her on her birthday. He got her a gift for being such a great teacher. As sweet as that sounds, the real gift was for himself. 

He knocked on her door mid-morning on Wednesday. She didn't have a class at the moment.

""Come in."" She called. 

He entered and she smiled, though she looked puzzled. 

""Michael?"" She said. ""Why aren't you in class?"" 

""I have a free period."" He said. ""And I wanted wish you a happy birthday."" 

He pulled out his gift and handed it to her. 

""Michael!"" She exclaimed. ""You didn't have to do that."" 

""I wanted to. You're the best teacher I've ever had and, I hope you don't mind me saying, I've come to think of you as a friend. You deserve it."" 

""What is it?"" She asked and shook the box. 

""It's... Not something you'll want to open in front of anyone. I hope you don't mind, but you said last week you were a bit stressed, so I thought this could help."" 

She looked at him curiously and opened her gift. It was a box of sex toys. 

She knew the gift was terribly inappropriate for a student to give their teacher, but because of their relationship she wasn't upset. She was delighted. 

""Wow!"" She said, grinning slyly at Michael. ""How did you know?"" She joked. 

She began rifling through the box, examining each item. 

Inside was a purple vibrator (7 inches long), a buttplug, a small vibrator for the clitoris, and vibrating underwear. 

""Wow, I'll be busy tonight."" She said, holding up the vibrator. ""Is that all?"" 

He smiled at her. 

""No, actually it's not."" 

""I was joking, Michael."" 

""I'm not."" 

She smiled and looked around the room uncertainly. 

""Where is it? I don't see another box."" 

""Well see, the fun in this gift isn't about taking it out of a box. It's about putting it in one."" He winked and stuck out his huge tongue. 

She grinned at him devilishly. Her panties were already wet, and despite her promise to herself, she was struggling to justify not doing it. 

""They didn't have a sex toy for breasts, so I figured my tongue would have to do."" 

""How unfortunate."" 

""Not really."" He said and he walked over and kissed her. 

He slipped his large tongue into her mouth and swirled it around, mixing his with hers. She tasted like mint. 

She was caught off guard and knew she shouldn’t allow it. Knew that she should break away from his lips, tell him off, and cancel all their future lessons, but she didn’t. She couldn’t. This, whatever it was, was the one exciting thing in her life. And damn if she wasn’t one of the best teachers to walk through the Hogwarts front entrance. She deserved this. 

He pulled his tongue out of hers and looked into her eyes. She had an animal look in her eyes as she looked into his. 

""Take my clothes off."" She said. 

She deserved all of it. 

He kissed her again as his fingers undid her blouse. She pulled it off as he kissed her neck, smelling her wonderful perfume. He then stuck his tongue back in her mouth and reached back and undid her bra. Kissing down her neck, she slid her bra off her shoulders. Her bra dropped just below her magnificent breasts. He pulled his head away and stared at them hungrily. 

""You have the best tits."" He said, earnestly. 

She smiled at him before he suckled her right nipple into his mouth, causing her to let out a soft moan. He grabbed her other breast in his hand and, looking into her eyes, he ran his tongue all over and around her nipple, sloppily. He lightly bit her erect nipple making her jump, and revelling in her squeal. 

""Fuck!"" She moaned, pushing her breasts into his face. 

As he suckled and squeezed on her breasts, he ran one of his hands down her side onto her leg. He slipped his hand beneath her skirt and panties and rubbed her wet pussy. His fingers rubbed over her slick folds, back and forth, over and over. He spread her warm lips and slipped part of his middle finger inside, feeling her constrict around his digit. 

""Oh, fuck."" She groaned as his thumb rubbed against her engorged clit. 

""Michael, that feels sooo good!"" She said as she looked into his big brown eyes. ""I've been wanting this for a long time."" 

Michael unwrapped his mouth from her breasts. 

""So have I."" He said as he stared at her big, wet, pink nipples. He really wanted to fuck them, but today was about her. ""I've been dreaming about eating your pussy out since our first lesson."" 

He began kissing down her stomach to her belly button. He grabbed her skirt and panties and pulled them down together, exposing her wet pussy. He soaked in his view as he dropped to his knees between her outstretched legs. This was a gift to him as much as it was to her. 

He kissed up her leg starting from her knee. He made his way up at a painfully slow pace. He got to her crotch and kissed all around her vagina, catching it with the corner of his mouth, the edge of his lips. Professor Davies was breathing heavily, awaiting the moment he buried his tongue inside her. 

""Just do it."" She pleaded, driven wild by his teasing. 

""Just do what?"" He asked, kissing the inside of her warm thighs.

""Eat my pussy, Michael!"" She said huskily. 

Michael grinned upon hearing the respectable proper Professor make such a dirty request. One that he was happy to oblige. He ran his hands under her and grabbed a chunk of her ass in each. 

""As you wish, birthday girl."" He said as he licked her pussy from her vagina up to her clit. He slowly licked, his big tongue covering every centimeter of her pussy. He savored her musky taste as he lapped at her amazing folds. 

""Oh Michael."" She said, her eyes closed in pleasure. ""That feels incredible. Unnhhhh!"" 

Michael had slid half his tongue into her pussy and wiggled it around. He licked her vaginal walls as his nose rubbed against her clit. His face was coated in her juices, while he tongue fucked her, hearing her moan his name. She was building up to an orgasm when she heard the classroom door close. She looked at Michael, horrified. She grabbed her clothes and threw them under her desk. She then put on a teachers robe that covered her entire body, relieving her of the need to put on anything else. 

""Under the desk."" She said to Michael as she heard footsteps coming up the stairs. 

There was a knock on the door. 

""Come in."" She said, red faced. 

Harry entered the room. 

""Hello Professor."" He said cheerfully. 

""Hello Harry."" She replied, hoping he didn't think too much of the smell of the room. 

Potter, thought Michael. He noticed the bastard getting close with the Professor and it deeply annoyed him. He would've loved for Harry to walk in on him tongue fucking Ms. Davies. He suddenly got an idea. He knew he shouldn't, but he didn't want to pass up the opportunity. He lifted Ms. Davies robes, giving him a tunnel view to her pussy. Then he rubbed his hands all over her thighs. 

Professor Davies jumped a bit. 

""Am I interrupting anything?"" Harry asked. 

""No, nothing."" She said, rather quickly. Michael's tongue was licking the inside of her thigh, working its way towards her delicious twat. 

""I just wanted to wish you a happy birthday, and give you this."" He said as he presented her with a gift. 

""Thank you, you didn't have to."" She replied, trying to remain calm. 

""I wanted to."" Said Harry, smiling at her. ""As a thank you."" 

She opened her gift and Michael licked her vagina. 

""Unnh wow!"" She said, trying to pull off excitement rather than her arousal. 

Harry looked at her strangely. The gift wasn't THAT great. 

""I love it, thank you."" She said as Michael continued to lick her pussy, causing her to breath a little heavily. 

She was squirming around in her chair, trying to manage her arousal. Her face was really red and she was perspiring lightly. Harry thought she looked incredibly sexy. 

""Anyways."" Harry said. ""I think I just heard your next class come in. I'll leave you to it. Bye."" 

""Bye Harry, and thank you."" She smiled at him, as Michael sucked on her lips. 

As soon as he left she lifted her wand and performed a silencing spell on the door and walls. It was good that she did, because Michael began licking her clit and she couldn't keep quiet any longer. 

His warm tongue continuously flicked against her love button, sending a jolt of pleasure each time. Wanting to give her a great orgasm, Michael slipped two fingers inside her hungry pussy, and began to finger her. He fingered her shallowly, only going in an inch or so, when he suddenly slipped them in as far as he could, rubbing against her g-spot. Michaels tongue on her clit, and his fingers pumping in and out against her g-spot, sent Ms. Davies over the edge. 

She let out her breath and began moaning rapidly. 

""Ooohhhh fuck!"" She screamed as she came all over Michaels face, coating him in her juices. She continued to breath heavily as Michael removed his head from between her legs, and his fingers out of her tight hole. She smiled down at him and he smiled back at her sweaty red face. She looked so fucking sexy. 

""That was unexpected."" She said. ""Thankfully Harry didn't stay long."" 

""Yeah, definitely."" Said Michael. ""Are you two close?"" 

""Do I detect a hint of jealousy?"" She asked, grinning. 

""He should be jealous of me."" He said as he leaned up and kissed her. His tongue coated in her tangy juices slipped past her lips, leaving her taste in her own mouth. 

""Wow."" She said, as they broke up the kiss. 

""Yeah, you taste really good."" He said. He chuckled as she playfully slapped his arm. 

""You're filthy."" She said, but she'd be lying if she said she didn't like the taste. 

""You have no idea."" He said. She took this as a joke, but it was anything but. 

""Well, thank you for the gifts Michael. I finally got one that I can use. Now, I have a class to teach, so you better go."" 

""Bye professor."" And Michael left, closing the door behind him, not caring that Ms. Davies class could see her pussy juice on his chin. "

So if you’re reading this just because you like Harry Potter, you’re going to have a bad time. Probably.  

I think the private lesson stuff is pretty hot, so I milked it again for this chapter. The next chapter will be different.) 


Hermione walked into the Gryffindor common room and looked around. She spotted Harry, Ron, Lavender, and Parvati sitting by the fire. She and Ron hadn't been on good terms for a while. She hated that he was dating Lavender, and was annoyed that he couldn't figure out why she didn’t like that. 

Scanning the room further she spotted Ginny sitting alone in the corner reading. There was an empty chair beside her so she took it. 

""Hey Ginny, mind if I sit?"" She asked. 

""Yeah, go ahead, I need a distraction anyways."" Said Ginny. 

Hermione sat down and they began talking. They talked for ten minutes before Hermione couldn't help but remember Ginny and Michael and everything she heard about them. She was burning to ask about it, and now she had her chance. Everyone except for the two of them had left the common room. 

""Ginny?"" She said tentatively. 

""Yes?"" 

""Why do you keep sleeping with Michael? He's a jerk and you can do better."" 

Ginny smiled at her innocent friend. 

""For a boyfriend: hell yes! I could do MUCH better. Just for sex? No, I couldn't."" 

""So you're not dating him? You're just having sex?"" Hermione asked curiously. 

""Yeah, why? Do you like him?"" Asked Ginny, teasing her friend. 

""Oh, God no. He's a pig, who only views women as trophy's an-"" 

""And sperm dumpsters, I know."" Said Ginny, finishing Hermione's sentence for her, but in a more crude manner. 

""Then why do you keep doing it?"" Asked Hermione incredulously. ""Is he really that good?"" 

""He's fucking amazing. Or should I say, amazing at fucking!"" Said Ginny enthusiastically. 

""Really?"" 

""You have no idea! The sex is honestly amazing.” 

""Is it just really large, or-"" 

""It?!"" Laughed Ginny. ""Hermione, we're alone. Just say cock."" 

Hermione laughed and blushed all at once. 

""Ok, ok! Does he have a big cock?"" 

""Yes. Yes he does. And he knows how to use it. And his hands. And his tongue. Anyways, why so curious?"" 

""No reason, just thought I'd ask."" 

""You can borrow him if you'd like."" 

Hermione snorted. 

""I'm serious. His cock would take all your stress away, you'd love it. You'd hate it, but you'd love it."" 

""Very funny."" 

""Do you hear me laughing? I mean why not? He's not that bad. He thinks the exact same way every other guy thinks, he's just more open about it."" 

""All guys are not like that."" 

""Yes, they are! Do you think McLaggen hasn't fantasized about fucking you? Or stared at your ass as you walked by? He does Hermione, they all do; and I don't blame them, you've got an amazing ass.""

""Harry doesn't."" 

""Oh yes he does. I guarantee he's checked you out before."" 

""You're being ridiculous."" 

""Hermione, the only person in this school who's not in tune with their sexuality is you."" 

“Thats ridiculous, I can’t be the only one. And again, not all boys are like that.” 

“Hermione, earlier today a couple of third graders asked me if I wanted more butter for my muffin... and no, we weren’t in the great hall. Face it, boys are disgusting. Wonderfully disgusting.""

Michael tried with all his might to keep the image of Professor Davies incredible tits fresh in his mind. 

He failed. However this wasn't a bad thing, it just increased his drive to get a better view. 

He entered their next lesson feeling more excited than he had in his entire life. So far each lesson had taken their relationship further and he was hoping today he'd get either a view of her pussy, or feel her tits. Hell, just getting to see them again would blow his mind. 

He walked in and saw her standing there wearing a dark blue blouse with a matching skirt and a scarf draped around her neck. She smiled as he walked in. 

""Only five minutes early today. Have you already seen all that you wanted to?"" She joked. 

""Definitely not."" He said. ""And even if I never got to see more, it'd still be the best experience of my life."" 

Before she came here tonight she made an important decision. She thought about their situation. She weighed the pros and cons of what she and Michael were doing and decided that she was ok with it. Or was going to be. This was the best way for him to learn, and she decided it was her duty as his teacher to ensure he gets his education.

This was all bullshit, but she didn't care. All she knew was that she was enjoying their lessons almost as much as him and she was excited to see where they'd go tonight. 

Her enjoyment aside, she never intended to take their lessons any further than his education. If he desired to learn about the female anatomy she'll gleefully oblige him. But she knew that thats where the line had to be drawn. She knew she shouldn't fuck him. 

""Well then, lets see if we can give you another."" She said, still smiling. ""So lets make this lesson simpler. For each properly performed spell, I'll remove one article of clothing. Just to be clear, that includes my shoes and scarf... I wouldn't want to make it too easy on you."" 

Michael smiled. 

""Of course not, Professor."" Said Michael. ""But what about if you run out of clothing?"" 

""You'll have to wait and see, won't you?"" She said, teasingly. ""So, lets get started. We'll begin with an easy one. A disarming spell."" 

""Ok."" Said Michael as he drew out his wand and took aim. 

He performed the spell on his second attempt. 

""Well done!"" Beamed Ms. Davies. ""You've definitely improved."" 

She removed her scarf from her neck, and Michael was delighted and surprised that the blouse she wore showed a fair bit of cleavage. 

She seemed to read his thoughts.

""I figured you've already seen my breasts, so a bit of cleavage wouldn't be considered inappropriate."" She said. 

""I consider it a treat."" Said Michael, not bothering to look away. 

Ms. Davies laughed. 

""Well, if you continue to perform like this then there'll be plenty more treats to come."" 

""Then lets continue."" Smiled Michael. 

""Lets see if you can replicate the spell."" Said Ms. Davies. 

Michael performed the spell a second time. 

""Very good."" Said Ms. Davies as she retrieved her wand. 

She kicked off one of her shoes to the side near her scarf. 

""How about once more?"" She asked. ""It's dreadfully uncomfortable standing on one shoe."" 

Smiling, Michael performed the spell for a third time. 

""There."" Said Ms. Davies, as she kicked off her other shoe. ""The sets complete."" 

""What now?"" Asked Michael. 

""I think a shield charm would be a good idea."" Said Ms. Davies as she demonstrated how. ""Now you."" 

Michael tried and deliberately failed. As badly as he wanted to see her naked, he knew he had to keep up appearances. He tried no less than thirty times, but he was still determined to draw out this performance. He was a thespian and this was his stage. 

Ms. Davies felt it was a good time to play up on his motivation. She began slowly walking towards him in a sultry, sexual manner. 

""Michael."" She said, fifteen feet away. ""I want you to keep in mind what you're missing out on and what you'll get if you perform it properly."" 

Ten feet away. 

""Think about my large breasts hidden beneath my blouse, begging to be released. You only saw them for a minute last session. You could see them for a hell of a lot longer tonight."" 

Five feet away. 

""Think of my big, stiff nipples and my bouncing breasts. Can you see them Michael?"" 

She was a foot in front of him. Far closer than she's ever been to him. Michael swallowed. 

""No, I'm afraid I can't."" He said, honestly. He was furious at his memory for failing him. 

She stared into his eyes for a minute before saying: ""Then perform the spell."" 

She stared up at him for a few seconds longer before turning around and walking back into position. 

He drew a deep breath, and then he performed the shield charm perfectly. This triggered a smile from both of them. 

""See?"" She said. ""That wasn't so hard."" 

Ms. Davies removed her blouse and tossed it on the floor. 

She was wearing a very sexy black bra. He stared at her wonderful bra covered breasts. He was so fucking horny. 

""Do it again."" She instructed. 

He performed the spell a second time. 

She turned around, facing away from Michael, taking away his view of her breasts. Then she grabbed hold of her skirt and started to slowly pull it down her legs, bending with it as she did. She stayed there for a few seconds, her beautiful ass sticking in the air. She was wearing a pair of black panties to compliment her bra. She slowly stood back up and turned around to face him. 

She was thoroughly enjoying this. Even the time spent in limbo, waiting for him to perform the spells correctly, was exciting to her. She was imagining what to reward him with once she was naked, and one idea after the other caused her vagina to become wet. She had been soaked for a while now, but this time the smell of her vagina didn't bother her. It excited her and she hoped Michael could smell it too. She hoped it made his big cock rock hard and ready to fuck, even though she had no intentions of doing that. But a girl can fantasize. 

""Ok, Michael. Next we'll do a stunning spell."" 

""Was it named after you?"" He asked, causing her to giggle. 

""Wow, that was terrible."" She smiled. ""For this one, lets practice on a dummy."" 

She whipped out her wand and made a dummy appear out of nowhere. She then went and stood right beside Michael. She glanced down at his cock. 

""Someone's excited."" She teased. 

""So is someone else."" Said Michael, as he audibly sniffed the air. 

She couldn't help but blush at this, even though she was happy he could smell her. She still couldn't help but laugh. 

""Touché. Now watch closely."" She said as she demonstrated the stunning spell. 

""I will."" He said, taking a step back and getting a great view of her panty clad ass. 

She smiled as she performed it again, enjoying the attention. 

""You're turn."" She said, stepping back. 

He stepped forward, and once again deliberately performed the spell wrong. He did this a little more than ten times before deciding it was ok to do it properly. 

""Terrifically done, Michael."" She praised him. Then she reached around and undid her bra. She slid it off and gave him his second view of her perfect breasts. 

They were better than he remembered. He stared at them, mesmerized, trying to carve the image into his brain. The size, the shape, the light pink colour of her nipples. 

""Wow."" He said. 

""I'm glad you like them."" Said Ms. Davies, giggling. 

""They're perfect."" He said, meaning every word. 

He stared at them for a minute longer before Ms. Davies broke the silence. 

""I think I have one or two more things to show you. If you're good to continue."" 

""Yes."" He said, excited. ""I am. 

""Ok, then. Perform it again."" 

He took aim, thought about her wet pussy and performed the spell. 

""Heres to you, Michael."" She said as she pulled down her panties and stood back up. 

He couldn't see much of her pussy because her legs were closed, but his mouth still watered at the sight of it. It was pink and glistening, with her pubes shaved into a triangle, guiding him to the most intimate part on her body. 

""As you can see, and smell, it's as excited to see you as you are to see it."" She said, staring down at his bulge. 

She turned around, giving him a full view of her ass. It was big, creamy, and very round. He just wanted to squeeze it so badly. 

She turned back around. 

""Now, I have one more spell."" She said, pausing to let him soak in the view of her naked body, as well as realize what that meant. ""Now, I can't let you touch my body, but that doesn't mean I cant touch it, or give you a better view. So... If you perform the full body bind, I'll sit on that chair and spread my legs for you. Would you like to see that?"" 

""I'd love to see that."" Said Michael, a bit disappointed he didn't get to touch her. 

He performed the spell in only 6 tries. He desperately wanted a good look at her pussy. 

""Great work today, Michael."" She said as she sat down. ""Now you can't touch me, but you can get as close as you'd like."" 

""Ok."" Said Michael, swallowing. 

She stared into his eyes as she slowly parted her legs, giving him a great view of her wet pussy. 

""You can get closer, don't be shy."" She said, loving the look on his face. 

He did just that. He got on his knees and kneeled between her open legs. He could heavily smell her pussy and it made him want to bury his face in her hot pink twat and lick away. She was so fucking beautiful. He couldn't believe his luck, as he was just a foot away from her pussy. He sat there for a little while before she figured she should end their session. 

""You should get to bed, Michael."" 

""Ok, thank you so much for this Professor."" He said, earnestly. 

""Anything for my favourite student."" She said, winking. 

He got up and walked towards the door, as he opened it he looked back at her. She had her hand between her legs and was rubbing her pussy. He watched for a couple seconds before she called to him.

""Goodnight, Michael."" She said, slightly breathless and inserting a finger in her twat. 

""Goodnight, and have fun."" Said Michael, and then he left the room taking one last look as he did. 


-

Harry got up early one morning and went for a walk. Not for any particular reason, just to clear his head, and start the day right. After 20 minutes of aimlessly walking around, he decided he’d go see Hedwig. 

A few minutes later Harry opened the door to the owlery and saw that Hedwig already had some company. 

""Hello Harry."" Said Ms. Davies, warmly. 

""Hello, Professor."" Harry greeted back. ""How are you?"" 

""I'm good, thanks for asking."" She said. ""Is this your owl?” 

“Yeah, her names Hedwig.” 

“Shes a beautiful bird.”
Said Ms. Davies, gently stroking Hedwigs feathers. “Oh, I’m so sorry, do you need to send a letter?” 

“Yeah, kinda.” Said Harry, feeling a little bashful around his beautiful Professor. He had never been alone with her before. “But thats fine. She seems to like you.” 

Hedwig cooed in acknowledgment, and rubbed her head against Ms. Davies hand. 

“Well, since I’m keeping you from your owl, you’re welcome to use mine, but he’s not as friendly I’m afraid.” 

Harry spotted a large, black owl staring at him, its large eyes piercing Harry’s soul. 

“I’ll give it a go. I’m pretty good with animals.” Harry cautiously approached the haughty looking owl. 

“Yes, Hagrid’s told me all about it. Never misses a chance to praise you, that man.” 

“He’s just a very kind Professor.” Harry said, nearing the owl with his hand outstretched. “Whats your owls name?” 

“Aegis.” Replied Ms. Davies. 

“Well, Aegis. Would you be willing to deliver a letter for me?” 

The dark owl leaned forward towards Harrys hand, inspecting it. After a few moments, Aegis cooed and rubbed the side of his head against Harrys fingers. 

“Wow.” Said Ms. Davies. “He doesn’t like many people.” 

“Well, like I said. I’m just good with animals I guess.” 

“Harry, the last person who tried to touch him nearly lost an eye.” 

“Why didn’t you say something earlier?” Asked Harry, genuinely concerned, his eyes darting from Aegis to Ms. Davies. To his surprise, she was smiling. 

“I’m joking. He wouldn’t hurt you. Not too bad.” 

They both laughed as Harry scratched under Aegis’ chin. 

“Besides,” Continued Ms. Davies. “I’m certain that if I had told you that, you’d want to do it more.” 

“Fair enough.” Chuckled Harry, and he began to attach his letter. 

Harry really liked her as a teacher and wasn't surprised by how easy and enjoyable it was to talk with her. She was always really warm towards her students. He laughed as he imagined attempting to do the same with Snape. 

""Whats funny?"" She asked, smiling. 

""Nothing. I was just imagining trying to start a friendly chat with Professor Snape."" 

She let out a burst of laughter. ""That would be a sight.""

They both sat in silence for a minute, each gently stroking the others owl. 

""So, Potter."" She said, using a jokingly stern tone. ""What are your plans after Hogwarts?"" 

""I'd like to become an auror."" He said. 

""Really?"" She asked, intrigued. ""I guess with your history that would make a good fit."" 

""Yeah, I'm sort of an unofficial intern."" 

""Would you like a little extra help?"" She laughed, causing his spirits to soar. 

""Yeah, that would be great!"" He said, ecstatic. ""If it's not too much trouble.""

""None at all."" She said, happily. 

They continued to talk for a while longer, enjoying each others company. Once they parted ways Harry couldn't help but feel elated at the thought of having private lessons with the most beautiful woman in Hogwarts.

Michael postponed their next lesson a few days. Partly because he wanted to make her wait and build up her libido. The other was so that he could surprise her on her birthday. He got her a gift for being such a great teacher. As sweet as that sounds, the real gift was for himself. 

He knocked on her door mid-morning on Wednesday. She didn't have a class at the moment.

""Come in."" She called. 

He entered and she smiled, though she looked puzzled. 

""Michael?"" She said. ""Why aren't you in class?"" 

""I have a free period."" He said. ""And I wanted wish you a happy birthday."" 

He pulled out his gift and handed it to her. 

""Michael!"" She exclaimed. ""You didn't have to do that."" 

""I wanted to. You're the best teacher I've ever had and, I hope you don't mind me saying, I've come to think of you as a friend. You deserve it."" 

""What is it?"" She asked and shook the box. 

""It's... Not something you'll want to open in front of anyone. I hope you don't mind, but you said last week you were a bit stressed, so I thought this could help."" 

She looked at him curiously and opened her gift. It was a box of sex toys. 

She knew the gift was terribly inappropriate for a student to give their teacher, but because of their relationship she wasn't upset. She was delighted. 

""Wow!"" She said, grinning slyly at Michael. ""How did you know?"" She joked. 

She began rifling through the box, examining each item. 

Inside was a purple vibrator (7 inches long), a buttplug, a small vibrator for the clitoris, and vibrating underwear. 

""Wow, I'll be busy tonight."" She said, holding up the vibrator. ""Is that all?"" 

He smiled at her. 

""No, actually it's not."" 

""I was joking, Michael."" 

""I'm not."" 

She smiled and looked around the room uncertainly. 

""Where is it? I don't see another box."" 

""Well see, the fun in this gift isn't about taking it out of a box. It's about putting it in one."" He winked and stuck out his huge tongue. 

She grinned at him devilishly. Her panties were already wet, and despite her promise to herself, she was struggling to justify not doing it. 

""They didn't have a sex toy for breasts, so I figured my tongue would have to do."" 

""How unfortunate."" 

""Not really."" He said and he walked over and kissed her. 

He slipped his large tongue into her mouth and swirled it around, mixing his with hers. She tasted like mint. 

She was caught off guard and knew she shouldn’t allow it. Knew that she should break away from his lips, tell him off, and cancel all their future lessons, but she didn’t. She couldn’t. This, whatever it was, was the one exciting thing in her life. And damn if she wasn’t one of the best teachers to walk through the Hogwarts front entrance. She deserved this. 

He pulled his tongue out of hers and looked into her eyes. She had an animal look in her eyes as she looked into his. 

""Take my clothes off."" She said. 

She deserved all of it. 

He kissed her again as his fingers undid her blouse. She pulled it off as he kissed her neck, smelling her wonderful perfume. He then stuck his tongue back in her mouth and reached back and undid her bra. Kissing down her neck, she slid her bra off her shoulders. Her bra dropped just below her magnificent breasts. He pulled his head away and stared at them hungrily. 

""You have the best tits."" He said, earnestly. 

She smiled at him before he suckled her right nipple into his mouth, causing her to let out a soft moan. He grabbed her other breast in his hand and, looking into her eyes, he ran his tongue all over and around her nipple, sloppily. He lightly bit her erect nipple making her jump, and revelling in her squeal. 

""Fuck!"" She moaned, pushing her breasts into his face. 

As he suckled and squeezed on her breasts, he ran one of his hands down her side onto her leg. He slipped his hand beneath her skirt and panties and rubbed her wet pussy. His fingers rubbed over her slick folds, back and forth, over and over. He spread her warm lips and slipped part of his middle finger inside, feeling her constrict around his digit. 

""Oh, fuck."" She groaned as his thumb rubbed against her engorged clit. 

""Michael, that feels sooo good!"" She said as she looked into his big brown eyes. ""I've been wanting this for a long time."" 

Michael unwrapped his mouth from her breasts. 

""So have I."" He said as he stared at her big, wet, pink nipples. He really wanted to fuck them, but today was about her. ""I've been dreaming about eating your pussy out since our first lesson."" 

He began kissing down her stomach to her belly button. He grabbed her skirt and panties and pulled them down together, exposing her wet pussy. He soaked in his view as he dropped to his knees between her outstretched legs. This was a gift to him as much as it was to her. 

He kissed up her leg starting from her knee. He made his way up at a painfully slow pace. He got to her crotch and kissed all around her vagina, catching it with the corner of his mouth, the edge of his lips. Professor Davies was breathing heavily, awaiting the moment he buried his tongue inside her. 

""Just do it."" She pleaded, driven wild by his teasing. 

""Just do what?"" He asked, kissing the inside of her warm thighs.

""Eat my pussy, Michael!"" She said huskily. 

Michael grinned upon hearing the respectable proper Professor make such a dirty request. One that he was happy to oblige. He ran his hands under her and grabbed a chunk of her ass in each. 

""As you wish, birthday girl."" He said as he licked her pussy from her vagina up to her clit. He slowly licked, his big tongue covering every centimeter of her pussy. He savored her musky taste as he lapped at her amazing folds. 

""Oh Michael."" She said, her eyes closed in pleasure. ""That feels incredible. Unnhhhh!"" 

Michael had slid half his tongue into her pussy and wiggled it around. He licked her vaginal walls as his nose rubbed against her clit. His face was coated in her juices, while he tongue fucked her, hearing her moan his name. She was building up to an orgasm when she heard the classroom door close. She looked at Michael, horrified. She grabbed her clothes and threw them under her desk. She then put on a teachers robe that covered her entire body, relieving her of the need to put on anything else. 

""Under the desk."" She said to Michael as she heard footsteps coming up the stairs. 

There was a knock on the door. 

""Come in."" She said, red faced. 

Harry entered the room. 

""Hello Professor."" He said cheerfully. 

""Hello Harry."" She replied, hoping he didn't think too much of the smell of the room. 

Potter, thought Michael. He noticed the bastard getting close with the Professor and it deeply annoyed him. He would've loved for Harry to walk in on him tongue fucking Ms. Davies. He suddenly got an idea. He knew he shouldn't, but he didn't want to pass up the opportunity. He lifted Ms. Davies robes, giving him a tunnel view to her pussy. Then he rubbed his hands all over her thighs. 

Professor Davies jumped a bit. 

""Am I interrupting anything?"" Harry asked. 

""No, nothing."" She said, rather quickly. Michael's tongue was licking the inside of her thigh, working its way towards her delicious twat. 

""I just wanted to wish you a happy birthday, and give you this."" He said as he presented her with a gift. 

""Thank you, you didn't have to."" She replied, trying to remain calm. 

""I wanted to."" Said Harry, smiling at her. ""As a thank you."" 

She opened her gift and Michael licked her vagina. 

""Unnh wow!"" She said, trying to pull off excitement rather than her arousal. 

Harry looked at her strangely. The gift wasn't THAT great. 

""I love it, thank you."" She said as Michael continued to lick her pussy, causing her to breath a little heavily. 

She was squirming around in her chair, trying to manage her arousal. Her face was really red and she was perspiring lightly. Harry thought she looked incredibly sexy. 

""Anyways."" Harry said. ""I think I just heard your next class come in. I'll leave you to it. Bye."" 

""Bye Harry, and thank you."" She smiled at him, as Michael sucked on her lips. 

As soon as he left she lifted her wand and performed a silencing spell on the door and walls. It was good that she did, because Michael began licking her clit and she couldn't keep quiet any longer. 

His warm tongue continuously flicked against her love button, sending a jolt of pleasure each time. Wanting to give her a great orgasm, Michael slipped two fingers inside her hungry pussy, and began to finger her. He fingered her shallowly, only going in an inch or so, when he suddenly slipped them in as far as he could, rubbing against her g-spot. Michaels tongue on her clit, and his fingers pumping in and out against her g-spot, sent Ms. Davies over the edge. 

She let out her breath and began moaning rapidly. 

""Ooohhhh fuck!"" She screamed as she came all over Michaels face, coating him in her juices. She continued to breath heavily as Michael removed his head from between her legs, and his fingers out of her tight hole. She smiled down at him and he smiled back at her sweaty red face. She looked so fucking sexy. 

""That was unexpected."" She said. ""Thankfully Harry didn't stay long."" 

""Yeah, definitely."" Said Michael. ""Are you two close?"" 

""Do I detect a hint of jealousy?"" She asked, grinning. 

""He should be jealous of me."" He said as he leaned up and kissed her. His tongue coated in her tangy juices slipped past her lips, leaving her taste in her own mouth. 

""Wow."" She said, as they broke up the kiss. 

""Yeah, you taste really good."" He said. He chuckled as she playfully slapped his arm. 

""You're filthy."" She said, but she'd be lying if she said she didn't like the taste. 

""You have no idea."" He said. She took this as a joke, but it was anything but. 

""Well, thank you for the gifts Michael. I finally got one that I can use. Now, I have a class to teach, so you better go."" 

""Bye professor."" And Michael left, closing the door behind him, not caring that Ms. Davies class could see her pussy juice on his chin. "

So if you’re reading this just because you like Harry Potter, you’re going to have a bad time. Probably.  

I think the private lesson stuff is pretty hot, so I milked it again for this chapter. The next chapter will be different.) 


Hermione walked into the Gryffindor common room and looked around. She spotted Harry, Ron, Lavender, and Parvati sitting by the fire. She and Ron hadn't been on good terms for a while. She hated that he was dating Lavender, and was annoyed that he couldn't figure out why she didn’t like that. 

Scanning the room further she spotted Ginny sitting alone in the corner reading. There was an empty chair beside her so she took it. 

""Hey Ginny, mind if I sit?"" She asked. 

""Yeah, go ahead, I need a distraction anyways."" Said Ginny. 

Hermione sat down and they began talking. They talked for ten minutes before Hermione couldn't help but remember Ginny and Michael and everything she heard about them. She was burning to ask about it, and now she had her chance. Everyone except for the two of them had left the common room. 

""Ginny?"" She said tentatively. 

""Yes?"" 

""Why do you keep sleeping with Michael? He's a jerk and you can do better."" 

Ginny smiled at her innocent friend. 

""For a boyfriend: hell yes! I could do MUCH better. Just for sex? No, I couldn't."" 

""So you're not dating him? You're just having sex?"" Hermione asked curiously. 

""Yeah, why? Do you like him?"" Asked Ginny, teasing her friend. 

""Oh, God no. He's a pig, who only views women as trophy's an-"" 

""And sperm dumpsters, I know."" Said Ginny, finishing Hermione's sentence for her, but in a more crude manner. 

""Then why do you keep doing it?"" Asked Hermione incredulously. ""Is he really that good?"" 

""He's fucking amazing. Or should I say, amazing at fucking!"" Said Ginny enthusiastically. 

""Really?"" 

""You have no idea! The sex is honestly amazing.” 

""Is it just really large, or-"" 

""It?!"" Laughed Ginny. ""Hermione, we're alone. Just say cock."" 

Hermione laughed and blushed all at once. 

""Ok, ok! Does he have a big cock?"" 

""Yes. Yes he does. And he knows how to use it. And his hands. And his tongue. Anyways, why so curious?"" 

""No reason, just thought I'd ask."" 

""You can borrow him if you'd like."" 

Hermione snorted. 

""I'm serious. His cock would take all your stress away, you'd love it. You'd hate it, but you'd love it."" 

""Very funny."" 

""Do you hear me laughing? I mean why not? He's not that bad. He thinks the exact same way every other guy thinks, he's just more open about it."" 

""All guys are not like that."" 

""Yes, they are! Do you think McLaggen hasn't fantasized about fucking you? Or stared at your ass as you walked by? He does Hermione, they all do; and I don't blame them, you've got an amazing ass.""

""Harry doesn't."" 

""Oh yes he does. I guarantee he's checked you out before."" 

""You're being ridiculous."" 

""Hermione, the only person in this school who's not in tune with their sexuality is you."" 

“Thats ridiculous, I can’t be the only one. And again, not all boys are like that.” 

“Hermione, earlier today a couple of third graders asked me if I wanted more butter for my muffin... and no, we weren’t in the great hall. Face it, boys are disgusting. Wonderfully disgusting.""

Michael tried with all his might to keep the image of Professor Davies incredible tits fresh in his mind. 

He failed. However this wasn't a bad thing, it just increased his drive to get a better view. 

He entered their next lesson feeling more excited than he had in his entire life. So far each lesson had taken their relationship further and he was hoping today he'd get either a view of her pussy, or feel her tits. Hell, just getting to see them again would blow his mind. 

He walked in and saw her standing there wearing a dark blue blouse with a matching skirt and a scarf draped around her neck. She smiled as he walked in. 

""Only five minutes early today. Have you already seen all that you wanted to?"" She joked. 

""Definitely not."" He said. ""And even if I never got to see more, it'd still be the best experience of my life."" 

Before she came here tonight she made an important decision. She thought about their situation. She weighed the pros and cons of what she and Michael were doing and decided that she was ok with it. Or was going to be. This was the best way for him to learn, and she decided it was her duty as his teacher to ensure he gets his education.

This was all bullshit, but she didn't care. All she knew was that she was enjoying their lessons almost as much as him and she was excited to see where they'd go tonight. 

Her enjoyment aside, she never intended to take their lessons any further than his education. If he desired to learn about the female anatomy she'll gleefully oblige him. But she knew that thats where the line had to be drawn. She knew she shouldn't fuck him. 

""Well then, lets see if we can give you another."" She said, still smiling. ""So lets make this lesson simpler. For each properly performed spell, I'll remove one article of clothing. Just to be clear, that includes my shoes and scarf... I wouldn't want to make it too easy on you."" 

Michael smiled. 

""Of course not, Professor."" Said Michael. ""But what about if you run out of clothing?"" 

""You'll have to wait and see, won't you?"" She said, teasingly. ""So, lets get started. We'll begin with an easy one. A disarming spell."" 

""Ok."" Said Michael as he drew out his wand and took aim. 

He performed the spell on his second attempt. 

""Well done!"" Beamed Ms. Davies. ""You've definitely improved."" 

She removed her scarf from her neck, and Michael was delighted and surprised that the blouse she wore showed a fair bit of cleavage. 

She seemed to read his thoughts.

""I figured you've already seen my breasts, so a bit of cleavage wouldn't be considered inappropriate."" She said. 

""I consider it a treat."" Said Michael, not bothering to look away. 

Ms. Davies laughed. 

""Well, if you continue to perform like this then there'll be plenty more treats to come."" 

""Then lets continue."" Smiled Michael. 

""Lets see if you can replicate the spell."" Said Ms. Davies. 

Michael performed the spell a second time. 

""Very good."" Said Ms. Davies as she retrieved her wand. 

She kicked off one of her shoes to the side near her scarf. 

""How about once more?"" She asked. ""It's dreadfully uncomfortable standing on one shoe."" 

Smiling, Michael performed the spell for a third time. 

""There."" Said Ms. Davies, as she kicked off her other shoe. ""The sets complete."" 

""What now?"" Asked Michael. 

""I think a shield charm would be a good idea."" Said Ms. Davies as she demonstrated how. ""Now you."" 

Michael tried and deliberately failed. As badly as he wanted to see her naked, he knew he had to keep up appearances. He tried no less than thirty times, but he was still determined to draw out this performance. He was a thespian and this was his stage. 

Ms. Davies felt it was a good time to play up on his motivation. She began slowly walking towards him in a sultry, sexual manner. 

""Michael."" She said, fifteen feet away. ""I want you to keep in mind what you're missing out on and what you'll get if you perform it properly."" 

Ten feet away. 

""Think about my large breasts hidden beneath my blouse, begging to be released. You only saw them for a minute last session. You could see them for a hell of a lot longer tonight."" 

Five feet away. 

""Think of my big, stiff nipples and my bouncing breasts. Can you see them Michael?"" 

She was a foot in front of him. Far closer than she's ever been to him. Michael swallowed. 

""No, I'm afraid I can't."" He said, honestly. He was furious at his memory for failing him. 

She stared into his eyes for a minute before saying: ""Then perform the spell."" 

She stared up at him for a few seconds longer before turning around and walking back into position. 

He drew a deep breath, and then he performed the shield charm perfectly. This triggered a smile from both of them. 

""See?"" She said. ""That wasn't so hard."" 

Ms. Davies removed her blouse and tossed it on the floor. 

She was wearing a very sexy black bra. He stared at her wonderful bra covered breasts. He was so fucking horny. 

""Do it again."" She instructed. 

He performed the spell a second time. 

She turned around, facing away from Michael, taking away his view of her breasts. Then she grabbed hold of her skirt and started to slowly pull it down her legs, bending with it as she did. She stayed there for a few seconds, her beautiful ass sticking in the air. She was wearing a pair of black panties to compliment her bra. She slowly stood back up and turned around to face him. 

She was thoroughly enjoying this. Even the time spent in limbo, waiting for him to perform the spells correctly, was exciting to her. She was imagining what to reward him with once she was naked, and one idea after the other caused her vagina to become wet. She had been soaked for a while now, but this time the smell of her vagina didn't bother her. It excited her and she hoped Michael could smell it too. She hoped it made his big cock rock hard and ready to fuck, even though she had no intentions of doing that. But a girl can fantasize. 

""Ok, Michael. Next we'll do a stunning spell."" 

""Was it named after you?"" He asked, causing her to giggle. 

""Wow, that was terrible."" She smiled. ""For this one, lets practice on a dummy."" 

She whipped out her wand and made a dummy appear out of nowhere. She then went and stood right beside Michael. She glanced down at his cock. 

""Someone's excited."" She teased. 

""So is someone else."" Said Michael, as he audibly sniffed the air. 

She couldn't help but blush at this, even though she was happy he could smell her. She still couldn't help but laugh. 

""Touché. Now watch closely."" She said as she demonstrated the stunning spell. 

""I will."" He said, taking a step back and getting a great view of her panty clad ass. 

She smiled as she performed it again, enjoying the attention. 

""You're turn."" She said, stepping back. 

He stepped forward, and once again deliberately performed the spell wrong. He did this a little more than ten times before deciding it was ok to do it properly. 

""Terrifically done, Michael."" She praised him. Then she reached around and undid her bra. She slid it off and gave him his second view of her perfect breasts. 

They were better than he remembered. He stared at them, mesmerized, trying to carve the image into his brain. The size, the shape, the light pink colour of her nipples. 

""Wow."" He said. 

""I'm glad you like them."" Said Ms. Davies, giggling. 

""They're perfect."" He said, meaning every word. 

He stared at them for a minute longer before Ms. Davies broke the silence. 

""I think I have one or two more things to show you. If you're good to continue."" 

""Yes."" He said, excited. ""I am. 

""Ok, then. Perform it again."" 

He took aim, thought about her wet pussy and performed the spell. 

""Heres to you, Michael."" She said as she pulled down her panties and stood back up. 

He couldn't see much of her pussy because her legs were closed, but his mouth still watered at the sight of it. It was pink and glistening, with her pubes shaved into a triangle, guiding him to the most intimate part on her body. 

""As you can see, and smell, it's as excited to see you as you are to see it."" She said, staring down at his bulge. 

She turned around, giving him a full view of her ass. It was big, creamy, and very round. He just wanted to squeeze it so badly. 

She turned back around. 

""Now, I have one more spell."" She said, pausing to let him soak in the view of her naked body, as well as realize what that meant. ""Now, I can't let you touch my body, but that doesn't mean I cant touch it, or give you a better view. So... If you perform the full body bind, I'll sit on that chair and spread my legs for you. Would you like to see that?"" 

""I'd love to see that."" Said Michael, a bit disappointed he didn't get to touch her. 

He performed the spell in only 6 tries. He desperately wanted a good look at her pussy. 

""Great work today, Michael."" She said as she sat down. ""Now you can't touch me, but you can get as close as you'd like."" 

""Ok."" Said Michael, swallowing. 

She stared into his eyes as she slowly parted her legs, giving him a great view of her wet pussy. 

""You can get closer, don't be shy."" She said, loving the look on his face. 

He did just that. He got on his knees and kneeled between her open legs. He could heavily smell her pussy and it made him want to bury his face in her hot pink twat and lick away. She was so fucking beautiful. He couldn't believe his luck, as he was just a foot away from her pussy. He sat there for a little while before she figured she should end their session. 

""You should get to bed, Michael."" 

""Ok, thank you so much for this Professor."" He said, earnestly. 

""Anything for my favourite student."" She said, winking. 

He got up and walked towards the door, as he opened it he looked back at her. She had her hand between her legs and was rubbing her pussy. He watched for a couple seconds before she called to him.

""Goodnight, Michael."" She said, slightly breathless and inserting a finger in her twat. 

""Goodnight, and have fun."" Said Michael, and then he left the room taking one last look as he did. 


-

Harry got up early one morning and went for a walk. Not for any particular reason, just to clear his head, and start the day right. After 20 minutes of aimlessly walking around, he decided he’d go see Hedwig. 

A few minutes later Harry opened the door to the owlery and saw that Hedwig already had some company. 

""Hello Harry."" Said Ms. Davies, warmly. 

""Hello, Professor."" Harry greeted back. ""How are you?"" 

""I'm good, thanks for asking."" She said. ""Is this your owl?” 

“Yeah, her names Hedwig.” 

“Shes a beautiful bird.”
Said Ms. Davies, gently stroking Hedwigs feathers. “Oh, I’m so sorry, do you need to send a letter?” 

“Yeah, kinda.” Said Harry, feeling a little bashful around his beautiful Professor. He had never been alone with her before. “But thats fine. She seems to like you.” 

Hedwig cooed in acknowledgment, and rubbed her head against Ms. Davies hand. 

“Well, since I’m keeping you from your owl, you’re welcome to use mine, but he’s not as friendly I’m afraid.” 

Harry spotted a large, black owl staring at him, its large eyes piercing Harry’s soul. 

“I’ll give it a go. I’m pretty good with animals.” Harry cautiously approached the haughty looking owl. 

“Yes, Hagrid’s told me all about it. Never misses a chance to praise you, that man.” 

“He’s just a very kind Professor.” Harry said, nearing the owl with his hand outstretched. “Whats your owls name?” 

“Aegis.” Replied Ms. Davies. 

“Well, Aegis. Would you be willing to deliver a letter for me?” 

The dark owl leaned forward towards Harrys hand, inspecting it. After a few moments, Aegis cooed and rubbed the side of his head against Harrys fingers. 

“Wow.” Said Ms. Davies. “He doesn’t like many people.” 

“Well, like I said. I’m just good with animals I guess.” 

“Harry, the last person who tried to touch him nearly lost an eye.” 

“Why didn’t you say something earlier?” Asked Harry, genuinely concerned, his eyes darting from Aegis to Ms. Davies. To his surprise, she was smiling. 

“I’m joking. He wouldn’t hurt you. Not too bad.” 

They both laughed as Harry scratched under Aegis’ chin. 

“Besides,” Continued Ms. Davies. “I’m certain that if I had told you that, you’d want to do it more.” 

“Fair enough.” Chuckled Harry, and he began to attach his letter. 

Harry really liked her as a teacher and wasn't surprised by how easy and enjoyable it was to talk with her. She was always really warm towards her students. He laughed as he imagined attempting to do the same with Snape. 

""Whats funny?"" She asked, smiling. 

""Nothing. I was just imagining trying to start a friendly chat with Professor Snape."" 

She let out a burst of laughter. ""That would be a sight.""

They both sat in silence for a minute, each gently stroking the others owl. 

""So, Potter."" She said, using a jokingly stern tone. ""What are your plans after Hogwarts?"" 

""I'd like to become an auror."" He said. 

""Really?"" She asked, intrigued. ""I guess with your history that would make a good fit."" 

""Yeah, I'm sort of an unofficial intern."" 

""Would you like a little extra help?"" She laughed, causing his spirits to soar. 

""Yeah, that would be great!"" He said, ecstatic. ""If it's not too much trouble.""

""None at all."" She said, happily. 

They continued to talk for a while longer, enjoying each others company. Once they parted ways Harry couldn't help but feel elated at the thought of having private lessons with the most beautiful woman in Hogwarts.

Michael postponed their next lesson a few days. Partly because he wanted to make her wait and build up her libido. The other was so that he could surprise her on her birthday. He got her a gift for being such a great teacher. As sweet as that sounds, the real gift was for himself. 

He knocked on her door mid-morning on Wednesday. She didn't have a class at the moment.

""Come in."" She called. 

He entered and she smiled, though she looked puzzled. 

""Michael?"" She said. ""Why aren't you in class?"" 

""I have a free period."" He said. ""And I wanted wish you a happy birthday."" 

He pulled out his gift and handed it to her. 

""Michael!"" She exclaimed. ""You didn't have to do that."" 

""I wanted to. You're the best teacher I've ever had and, I hope you don't mind me saying, I've come to think of you as a friend. You deserve it."" 

""What is it?"" She asked and shook the box. 

""It's... Not something you'll want to open in front of anyone. I hope you don't mind, but you said last week you were a bit stressed, so I thought this could help."" 

She looked at him curiously and opened her gift. It was a box of sex toys. 

She knew the gift was terribly inappropriate for a student to give their teacher, but because of their relationship she wasn't upset. She was delighted. 

""Wow!"" She said, grinning slyly at Michael. ""How did you know?"" She joked. 

She began rifling through the box, examining each item. 

Inside was a purple vibrator (7 inches long), a buttplug, a small vibrator for the clitoris, and vibrating underwear. 

""Wow, I'll be busy tonight."" She said, holding up the vibrator. ""Is that all?"" 

He smiled at her. 

""No, actually it's not."" 

""I was joking, Michael."" 

""I'm not."" 

She smiled and looked around the room uncertainly. 

""Where is it? I don't see another box."" 

""Well see, the fun in this gift isn't about taking it out of a box. It's about putting it in one."" He winked and stuck out his huge tongue. 

She grinned at him devilishly. Her panties were already wet, and despite her promise to herself, she was struggling to justify not doing it. 

""They didn't have a sex toy for breasts, so I figured my tongue would have to do."" 

""How unfortunate."" 

""Not really."" He said and he walked over and kissed her. 

He slipped his large tongue into her mouth and swirled it around, mixing his with hers. She tasted like mint. 

She was caught off guard and knew she shouldn’t allow it. Knew that she should break away from his lips, tell him off, and cancel all their future lessons, but she didn’t. She couldn’t. This, whatever it was, was the one exciting thing in her life. And damn if she wasn’t one of the best teachers to walk through the Hogwarts front entrance. She deserved this. 

He pulled his tongue out of hers and looked into her eyes. She had an animal look in her eyes as she looked into his. 

""Take my clothes off."" She said. 

She deserved all of it. 

He kissed her again as his fingers undid her blouse. She pulled it off as he kissed her neck, smelling her wonderful perfume. He then stuck his tongue back in her mouth and reached back and undid her bra. Kissing down her neck, she slid her bra off her shoulders. Her bra dropped just below her magnificent breasts. He pulled his head away and stared at them hungrily. 

""You have the best tits."" He said, earnestly. 

She smiled at him before he suckled her right nipple into his mouth, causing her to let out a soft moan. He grabbed her other breast in his hand and, looking into her eyes, he ran his tongue all over and around her nipple, sloppily. He lightly bit her erect nipple making her jump, and revelling in her squeal. 

""Fuck!"" She moaned, pushing her breasts into his face. 

As he suckled and squeezed on her breasts, he ran one of his hands down her side onto her leg. He slipped his hand beneath her skirt and panties and rubbed her wet pussy. His fingers rubbed over her slick folds, back and forth, over and over. He spread her warm lips and slipped part of his middle finger inside, feeling her constrict around his digit. 

""Oh, fuck."" She groaned as his thumb rubbed against her engorged clit. 

""Michael, that feels sooo good!"" She said as she looked into his big brown eyes. ""I've been wanting this for a long time."" 

Michael unwrapped his mouth from her breasts. 

""So have I."" He said as he stared at her big, wet, pink nipples. He really wanted to fuck them, but today was about her. ""I've been dreaming about eating your pussy out since our first lesson."" 

He began kissing down her stomach to her belly button. He grabbed her skirt and panties and pulled them down together, exposing her wet pussy. He soaked in his view as he dropped to his knees between her outstretched legs. This was a gift to him as much as it was to her. 

He kissed up her leg starting from her knee. He made his way up at a painfully slow pace. He got to her crotch and kissed all around her vagina, catching it with the corner of his mouth, the edge of his lips. Professor Davies was breathing heavily, awaiting the moment he buried his tongue inside her. 

""Just do it."" She pleaded, driven wild by his teasing. 

""Just do what?"" He asked, kissing the inside of her warm thighs.

""Eat my pussy, Michael!"" She said huskily. 

Michael grinned upon hearing the respectable proper Professor make such a dirty request. One that he was happy to oblige. He ran his hands under her and grabbed a chunk of her ass in each. 

""As you wish, birthday girl."" He said as he licked her pussy from her vagina up to her clit. He slowly licked, his big tongue covering every centimeter of her pussy. He savored her musky taste as he lapped at her amazing folds. 

""Oh Michael."" She said, her eyes closed in pleasure. ""That feels incredible. Unnhhhh!"" 

Michael had slid half his tongue into her pussy and wiggled it around. He licked her vaginal walls as his nose rubbed against her clit. His face was coated in her juices, while he tongue fucked her, hearing her moan his name. She was building up to an orgasm when she heard the classroom door close. She looked at Michael, horrified. She grabbed her clothes and threw them under her desk. She then put on a teachers robe that covered her entire body, relieving her of the need to put on anything else. 

""Under the desk."" She said to Michael as she heard footsteps coming up the stairs. 

There was a knock on the door. 

""Come in."" She said, red faced. 

Harry entered the room. 

""Hello Professor."" He said cheerfully. 

""Hello Harry."" She replied, hoping he didn't think too much of the smell of the room. 

Potter, thought Michael. He noticed the bastard getting close with the Professor and it deeply annoyed him. He would've loved for Harry to walk in on him tongue fucking Ms. Davies. He suddenly got an idea. He knew he shouldn't, but he didn't want to pass up the opportunity. He lifted Ms. Davies robes, giving him a tunnel view to her pussy. Then he rubbed his hands all over her thighs. 

Professor Davies jumped a bit. 

""Am I interrupting anything?"" Harry asked. 

""No, nothing."" She said, rather quickly. Michael's tongue was licking the inside of her thigh, working its way towards her delicious twat. 

""I just wanted to wish you a happy birthday, and give you this."" He said as he presented her with a gift. 

""Thank you, you didn't have to."" She replied, trying to remain calm. 

""I wanted to."" Said Harry, smiling at her. ""As a thank you."" 

She opened her gift and Michael licked her vagina. 

""Unnh wow!"" She said, trying to pull off excitement rather than her arousal. 

Harry looked at her strangely. The gift wasn't THAT great. 

""I love it, thank you."" She said as Michael continued to lick her pussy, causing her to breath a little heavily. 

She was squirming around in her chair, trying to manage her arousal. Her face was really red and she was perspiring lightly. Harry thought she looked incredibly sexy. 

""Anyways."" Harry said. ""I think I just heard your next class come in. I'll leave you to it. Bye."" 

""Bye Harry, and thank you."" She smiled at him, as Michael sucked on her lips. 

As soon as he left she lifted her wand and performed a silencing spell on the door and walls. It was good that she did, because Michael began licking her clit and she couldn't keep quiet any longer. 

His warm tongue continuously flicked against her love button, sending a jolt of pleasure each time. Wanting to give her a great orgasm, Michael slipped two fingers inside her hungry pussy, and began to finger her. He fingered her shallowly, only going in an inch or so, when he suddenly slipped them in as far as he could, rubbing against her g-spot. Michaels tongue on her clit, and his fingers pumping in and out against her g-spot, sent Ms. Davies over the edge. 

She let out her breath and began moaning rapidly. 

""Ooohhhh fuck!"" She screamed as she came all over Michaels face, coating him in her juices. She continued to breath heavily as Michael removed his head from between her legs, and his fingers out of her tight hole. She smiled down at him and he smiled back at her sweaty red face. She looked so fucking sexy. 

""That was unexpected."" She said. ""Thankfully Harry didn't stay long."" 

""Yeah, definitely."" Said Michael. ""Are you two close?"" 

""Do I detect a hint of jealousy?"" She asked, grinning. 

""He should be jealous of me."" He said as he leaned up and kissed her. His tongue coated in her tangy juices slipped past her lips, leaving her taste in her own mouth. 

""Wow."" She said, as they broke up the kiss. 

""Yeah, you taste really good."" He said. He chuckled as she playfully slapped his arm. 

""You're filthy."" She said, but she'd be lying if she said she didn't like the taste. 

""You have no idea."" He said. She took this as a joke, but it was anything but. 

""Well, thank you for the gifts Michael. I finally got one that I can use. Now, I have a class to teach, so you better go."" 

""Bye professor."" And Michael left, closing the door behind him, not caring that Ms. Davies class could see her pussy juice on his chin. "

So if you’re reading this just because you like Harry Potter, you’re going to have a bad time. Probably.  

I think the private lesson stuff is pretty hot, so I milked it again for this chapter. The next chapter will be different.) 


Hermione walked into the Gryffindor common room and looked around. She spotted Harry, Ron, Lavender, and Parvati sitting by the fire. She and Ron hadn't been on good terms for a while. She hated that he was dating Lavender, and was annoyed that he couldn't figure out why she didn’t like that. 

Scanning the room further she spotted Ginny sitting alone in the corner reading. There was an empty chair beside her so she took it. 

""Hey Ginny, mind if I sit?"" She asked. 

""Yeah, go ahead, I need a distraction anyways."" Said Ginny. 

Hermione sat down and they began talking. They talked for ten minutes before Hermione couldn't help but remember Ginny and Michael and everything she heard about them. She was burning to ask about it, and now she had her chance. Everyone except for the two of them had left the common room. 

""Ginny?"" She said tentatively. 

""Yes?"" 

""Why do you keep sleeping with Michael? He's a jerk and you can do better."" 

Ginny smiled at her innocent friend. 

""For a boyfriend: hell yes! I could do MUCH better. Just for sex? No, I couldn't."" 

""So you're not dating him? You're just having sex?"" Hermione asked curiously. 

""Yeah, why? Do you like him?"" Asked Ginny, teasing her friend. 

""Oh, God no. He's a pig, who only views women as trophy's an-"" 

""And sperm dumpsters, I know."" Said Ginny, finishing Hermione's sentence for her, but in a more crude manner. 

""Then why do you keep doing it?"" Asked Hermione incredulously. ""Is he really that good?"" 

""He's fucking amazing. Or should I say, amazing at fucking!"" Said Ginny enthusiastically. 

""Really?"" 

""You have no idea! The sex is honestly amazing.” 

""Is it just really large, or-"" 

""It?!"" Laughed Ginny. ""Hermione, we're alone. Just say cock."" 

Hermione laughed and blushed all at once. 

""Ok, ok! Does he have a big cock?"" 

""Yes. Yes he does. And he knows how to use it. And his hands. And his tongue. Anyways, why so curious?"" 

""No reason, just thought I'd ask."" 

""You can borrow him if you'd like."" 

Hermione snorted. 

""I'm serious. His cock would take all your stress away, you'd love it. You'd hate it, but you'd love it."" 

""Very funny."" 

""Do you hear me laughing? I mean why not? He's not that bad. He thinks the exact same way every other guy thinks, he's just more open about it."" 

""All guys are not like that."" 

""Yes, they are! Do you think McLaggen hasn't fantasized about fucking you? Or stared at your ass as you walked by? He does Hermione, they all do; and I don't blame them, you've got an amazing ass.""

""Harry doesn't."" 

""Oh yes he does. I guarantee he's checked you out before."" 

""You're being ridiculous."" 

""Hermione, the only person in this school who's not in tune with their sexuality is you."" 

“Thats ridiculous, I can’t be the only one. And again, not all boys are like that.” 

“Hermione, earlier today a couple of third graders asked me if I wanted more butter for my muffin... and no, we weren’t in the great hall. Face it, boys are disgusting. Wonderfully disgusting.""

Michael tried with all his might to keep the image of Professor Davies incredible tits fresh in his mind. 

He failed. However this wasn't a bad thing, it just increased his drive to get a better view. 

He entered their next lesson feeling more excited than he had in his entire life. So far each lesson had taken their relationship further and he was hoping today he'd get either a view of her pussy, or feel her tits. Hell, just getting to see them again would blow his mind. 

He walked in and saw her standing there wearing a dark blue blouse with a matching skirt and a scarf draped around her neck. She smiled as he walked in. 

""Only five minutes early today. Have you already seen all that you wanted to?"" She joked. 

""Definitely not."" He said. ""And even if I never got to see more, it'd still be the best experience of my life."" 

Before she came here tonight she made an important decision. She thought about their situation. She weighed the pros and cons of what she and Michael were doing and decided that she was ok with it. Or was going to be. This was the best way for him to learn, and she decided it was her duty as his teacher to ensure he gets his education.

This was all bullshit, but she didn't care. All she knew was that she was enjoying their lessons almost as much as him and she was excited to see where they'd go tonight. 

Her enjoyment aside, she never intended to take their lessons any further than his education. If he desired to learn about the female anatomy she'll gleefully oblige him. But she knew that thats where the line had to be drawn. She knew she shouldn't fuck him. 

""Well then, lets see if we can give you another."" She said, still smiling. ""So lets make this lesson simpler. For each properly performed spell, I'll remove one article of clothing. Just to be clear, that includes my shoes and scarf... I wouldn't want to make it too easy on you."" 

Michael smiled. 

""Of course not, Professor."" Said Michael. ""But what about if you run out of clothing?"" 

""You'll have to wait and see, won't you?"" She said, teasingly. ""So, lets get started. We'll begin with an easy one. A disarming spell."" 

""Ok."" Said Michael as he drew out his wand and took aim. 

He performed the spell on his second attempt. 

""Well done!"" Beamed Ms. Davies. ""You've definitely improved."" 

She removed her scarf from her neck, and Michael was delighted and surprised that the blouse she wore showed a fair bit of cleavage. 

She seemed to read his thoughts.

""I figured you've already seen my breasts, so a bit of cleavage wouldn't be considered inappropriate."" She said. 

""I consider it a treat."" Said Michael, not bothering to look away. 

Ms. Davies laughed. 

""Well, if you continue to perform like this then there'll be plenty more treats to come."" 

""Then lets continue."" Smiled Michael. 

""Lets see if you can replicate the spell."" Said Ms. Davies. 

Michael performed the spell a second time. 

""Very good."" Said Ms. Davies as she retrieved her wand. 

She kicked off one of her shoes to the side near her scarf. 

""How about once more?"" She asked. ""It's dreadfully uncomfortable standing on one shoe."" 

Smiling, Michael performed the spell for a third time. 

""There."" Said Ms. Davies, as she kicked off her other shoe. ""The sets complete."" 

""What now?"" Asked Michael. 

""I think a shield charm would be a good idea."" Said Ms. Davies as she demonstrated how. ""Now you."" 

Michael tried and deliberately failed. As badly as he wanted to see her naked, he knew he had to keep up appearances. He tried no less than thirty times, but he was still determined to draw out this performance. He was a thespian and this was his stage. 

Ms. Davies felt it was a good time to play up on his motivation. She began slowly walking towards him in a sultry, sexual manner. 

""Michael."" She said, fifteen feet away. ""I want you to keep in mind what you're missing out on and what you'll get if you perform it properly."" 

Ten feet away. 

""Think about my large breasts hidden beneath my blouse, begging to be released. You only saw them for a minute last session. You could see them for a hell of a lot longer tonight."" 

Five feet away. 

""Think of my big, stiff nipples and my bouncing breasts. Can you see them Michael?"" 

She was a foot in front of him. Far closer than she's ever been to him. Michael swallowed. 

""No, I'm afraid I can't."" He said, honestly. He was furious at his memory for failing him. 

She stared into his eyes for a minute before saying: ""Then perform the spell."" 

She stared up at him for a few seconds longer before turning around and walking back into position. 

He drew a deep breath, and then he performed the shield charm perfectly. This triggered a smile from both of them. 

""See?"" She said. ""That wasn't so hard."" 

Ms. Davies removed her blouse and tossed it on the floor. 

She was wearing a very sexy black bra. He stared at her wonderful bra covered breasts. He was so fucking horny. 

""Do it again."" She instructed. 

He performed the spell a second time. 

She turned around, facing away from Michael, taking away his view of her breasts. Then she grabbed hold of her skirt and started to slowly pull it down her legs, bending with it as she did. She stayed there for a few seconds, her beautiful ass sticking in the air. She was wearing a pair of black panties to compliment her bra. She slowly stood back up and turned around to face him. 

She was thoroughly enjoying this. Even the time spent in limbo, waiting for him to perform the spells correctly, was exciting to her. She was imagining what to reward him with once she was naked, and one idea after the other caused her vagina to become wet. She had been soaked for a while now, but this time the smell of her vagina didn't bother her. It excited her and she hoped Michael could smell it too. She hoped it made his big cock rock hard and ready to fuck, even though she had no intentions of doing that. But a girl can fantasize. 

""Ok, Michael. Next we'll do a stunning spell."" 

""Was it named after you?"" He asked, causing her to giggle. 

""Wow, that was terrible."" She smiled. ""For this one, lets practice on a dummy."" 

She whipped out her wand and made a dummy appear out of nowhere. She then went and stood right beside Michael. She glanced down at his cock. 

""Someone's excited."" She teased. 

""So is someone else."" Said Michael, as he audibly sniffed the air. 

She couldn't help but blush at this, even though she was happy he could smell her. She still couldn't help but laugh. 

""Touché. Now watch closely."" She said as she demonstrated the stunning spell. 

""I will."" He said, taking a step back and getting a great view of her panty clad ass. 

She smiled as she performed it again, enjoying the attention. 

""You're turn."" She said, stepping back. 

He stepped forward, and once again deliberately performed the spell wrong. He did this a little more than ten times before deciding it was ok to do it properly. 

""Terrifically done, Michael."" She praised him. Then she reached around and undid her bra. She slid it off and gave him his second view of her perfect breasts. 

They were better than he remembered. He stared at them, mesmerized, trying to carve the image into his brain. The size, the shape, the light pink colour of her nipples. 

""Wow."" He said. 

""I'm glad you like them."" Said Ms. Davies, giggling. 

""They're perfect."" He said, meaning every word. 

He stared at them for a minute longer before Ms. Davies broke the silence. 

""I think I have one or two more things to show you. If you're good to continue."" 

""Yes."" He said, excited. ""I am. 

""Ok, then. Perform it again."" 

He took aim, thought about her wet pussy and performed the spell. 

""Heres to you, Michael."" She said as she pulled down her panties and stood back up. 

He couldn't see much of her pussy because her legs were closed, but his mouth still watered at the sight of it. It was pink and glistening, with her pubes shaved into a triangle, guiding him to the most intimate part on her body. 

""As you can see, and smell, it's as excited to see you as you are to see it."" She said, staring down at his bulge. 

She turned around, giving him a full view of her ass. It was big, creamy, and very round. He just wanted to squeeze it so badly. 

She turned back around. 

""Now, I have one more spell."" She said, pausing to let him soak in the view of her naked body, as well as realize what that meant. ""Now, I can't let you touch my body, but that doesn't mean I cant touch it, or give you a better view. So... If you perform the full body bind, I'll sit on that chair and spread my legs for you. Would you like to see that?"" 

""I'd love to see that."" Said Michael, a bit disappointed he didn't get to touch her. 

He performed the spell in only 6 tries. He desperately wanted a good look at her pussy. 

""Great work today, Michael."" She said as she sat down. ""Now you can't touch me, but you can get as close as you'd like."" 

""Ok."" Said Michael, swallowing. 

She stared into his eyes as she slowly parted her legs, giving him a great view of her wet pussy. 

""You can get closer, don't be shy."" She said, loving the look on his face. 

He did just that. He got on his knees and kneeled between her open legs. He could heavily smell her pussy and it made him want to bury his face in her hot pink twat and lick away. She was so fucking beautiful. He couldn't believe his luck, as he was just a foot away from her pussy. He sat there for a little while before she figured she should end their session. 

""You should get to bed, Michael."" 

""Ok, thank you so much for this Professor."" He said, earnestly. 

""Anything for my favourite student."" She said, winking. 

He got up and walked towards the door, as he opened it he looked back at her. She had her hand between her legs and was rubbing her pussy. He watched for a couple seconds before she called to him.

""Goodnight, Michael."" She said, slightly breathless and inserting a finger in her twat. 

""Goodnight, and have fun."" Said Michael, and then he left the room taking one last look as he did.

Harry got up early one morning and went for a walk. Not for any particular reason, just to clear his head, and start the day right. After 20 minutes of aimlessly walking around, he decided he’d go see Hedwig. 

A few minutes later Harry opened the door to the owlery and saw that Hedwig already had some company. 

""Hello Harry."" Said Ms. Davies, warmly. 

""Hello, Professor."" Harry greeted back. ""How are you?"" 

""I'm good, thanks for asking."" She said. ""Is this your owl?” 

“Yeah, her names Hedwig.” 

“Shes a beautiful bird.”
Said Ms. Davies, gently stroking Hedwigs feathers. “Oh, I’m so sorry, do you need to send a letter?” 

“Yeah, kinda.” Said Harry, feeling a little bashful around his beautiful Professor. He had never been alone with her before. “But thats fine. She seems to like you.” 

Hedwig cooed in acknowledgment, and rubbed her head against Ms. Davies hand. 

“Well, since I’m keeping you from your owl, you’re welcome to use mine, but he’s not as friendly I’m afraid.” 

Harry spotted a large, black owl staring at him, its large eyes piercing Harry’s soul. 

“I’ll give it a go. I’m pretty good with animals.” Harry cautiously approached the haughty looking owl. 

“Yes, Hagrid’s told me all about it. Never misses a chance to praise you, that man.” 

“He’s just a very kind Professor.” Harry said, nearing the owl with his hand outstretched. “Whats your owls name?” 

“Aegis.” Replied Ms. Davies. 

“Well, Aegis. Would you be willing to deliver a letter for me?” 

The dark owl leaned forward towards Harrys hand, inspecting it. After a few moments, Aegis cooed and rubbed the side of his head against Harrys fingers. 

“Wow.” Said Ms. Davies. “He doesn’t like many people.” 

“Well, like I said. I’m just good with animals I guess.” 

“Harry, the last person who tried to touch him nearly lost an eye.” 

“Why didn’t you say something earlier?” Asked Harry, genuinely concerned, his eyes darting from Aegis to Ms. Davies. To his surprise, she was smiling. 

“I’m joking. He wouldn’t hurt you. Not too bad.” 

They both laughed as Harry scratched under Aegis’ chin. 

“Besides,” Continued Ms. Davies. “I’m certain that if I had told you that, you’d want to do it more.” 

“Fair enough.” Chuckled Harry, and he began to attach his letter. 

Harry really liked her as a teacher and wasn't surprised by how easy and enjoyable it was to talk with her. She was always really warm towards her students. He laughed as he imagined attempting to do the same with Snape. 

""Whats funny?"" She asked, smiling. 

""Nothing. I was just imagining trying to start a friendly chat with Professor Snape."" 

She let out a burst of laughter. ""That would be a sight.""

They both sat in silence for a minute, each gently stroking the others owl. 

""So, Potter."" She said, using a jokingly stern tone. ""What are your plans after Hogwarts?"" 

""I'd like to become an auror."" He said. 

""Really?"" She asked, intrigued. ""I guess with your history that would make a good fit."" 

""Yeah, I'm sort of an unofficial intern."" 

""Would you like a little extra help?"" She laughed, causing his spirits to soar. 

""Yeah, that would be great!"" He said, ecstatic. ""If it's not too much trouble.""

""None at all."" She said, happily. 

They continued to talk for a while longer, enjoying each others company. Once they parted ways Harry couldn't help but feel elated at the thought of having private lessons with the most beautiful woman in Hogwarts. 



-

Michael postponed their next lesson a few days. Partly because he wanted to make her wait and build up her libido. The other was so that he could surprise her on her birthday. He got her a gift for being such a great teacher. As sweet as that sounds, the real gift was for himself. 

He knocked on her door mid-morning on Wednesday. She didn't have a class at the moment.

""Come in."" She called. 

He entered and she smiled, though she looked puzzled. 

""Michael?"" She said. ""Why aren't you in class?"" 

""I have a free period."" He said. ""And I wanted wish you a happy birthday."" 

He pulled out his gift and handed it to her. 

""Michael!"" She exclaimed. ""You didn't have to do that."" 

""I wanted to. You're the best teacher I've ever had and, I hope you don't mind me saying, I've come to think of you as a friend. You deserve it."" 

""What is it?"" She asked and shook the box. 

""It's... Not something you'll want to open in front of anyone. I hope you don't mind, but you said last week you were a bit stressed, so I thought this could help."" 

She looked at him curiously and opened her gift. It was a box of sex toys. 

She knew the gift was terribly inappropriate for a student to give their teacher, but because of their relationship she wasn't upset. She was delighted. 

""Wow!"" She said, grinning slyly at Michael. ""How did you know?"" She joked. 

She began rifling through the box, examining each item. 

Inside was a purple vibrator (7 inches long), a buttplug, a small vibrator for the clitoris, and vibrating underwear. 

""Wow, I'll be busy tonight."" She said, holding up the vibrator. ""Is that all?"" 

He smiled at her. 

""No, actually it's not."" 

""I was joking, Michael."" 

""I'm not."" 

She smiled and looked around the room uncertainly. 

""Where is it? I don't see another box."" 

""Well see, the fun in this gift isn't about taking it out of a box. It's about putting it in one."" He winked and stuck out his huge tongue. 

She grinned at him devilishly. Her panties were already wet, and despite her promise to herself, she was struggling to justify not doing it. 

""They didn't have a sex toy for breasts, so I figured my tongue would have to do."" 

""How unfortunate."" 

""Not really."" He said and he walked over and kissed her. 

He slipped his large tongue into her mouth and swirled it around, mixing his with hers. She tasted like mint. 

She was caught off guard and knew she shouldn’t allow it. Knew that she should break away from his lips, tell him off, and cancel all their future lessons, but she didn’t. She couldn’t. This, whatever it was, was the one exciting thing in her life. And damn if she wasn’t one of the best teachers to walk through the Hogwarts front entrance. She deserved this. 

He pulled his tongue out of hers and looked into her eyes. She had an animal look in her eyes as she looked into his. 

""Take my clothes off."" She said. 

She deserved all of it. 

He kissed her again as his fingers undid her blouse. She pulled it off as he kissed her neck, smelling her wonderful perfume. He then stuck his tongue back in her mouth and reached back and undid her bra. Kissing down her neck, she slid her bra off her shoulders. Her bra dropped just below her magnificent breasts. He pulled his head away and stared at them hungrily. 

""You have the best tits."" He said, earnestly. 

She smiled at him before he suckled her right nipple into his mouth, causing her to let out a soft moan. He grabbed her other breast in his hand and, looking into her eyes, he ran his tongue all over and around her nipple, sloppily. He lightly bit her erect nipple making her jump, and revelling in her squeal. 

""Fuck!"" She moaned, pushing her breasts into his face. 

As he suckled and squeezed on her breasts, he ran one of his hands down her side onto her leg. He slipped his hand beneath her skirt and panties and rubbed her wet pussy. His fingers rubbed over her slick folds, back and forth, over and over. He spread her warm lips and slipped part of his middle finger inside, feeling her constrict around his digit. 

""Oh, fuck."" She groaned as his thumb rubbed against her engorged clit. 

""Michael, that feels sooo good!"" She said as she looked into his big brown eyes. ""I've been wanting this for a long time."" 

Michael unwrapped his mouth from her breasts. 

""So have I."" He said as he stared at her big, wet, pink nipples. He really wanted to fuck them, but today was about her. ""I've been dreaming about eating your pussy out since our first lesson."" 

He began kissing down her stomach to her belly button. He grabbed her skirt and panties and pulled them down together, exposing her wet pussy. He soaked in his view as he dropped to his knees between her outstretched legs. This was a gift to him as much as it was to her. 

He kissed up her leg starting from her knee. He made his way up at a painfully slow pace. He got to her crotch and kissed all around her vagina, catching it with the corner of his mouth, the edge of his lips. Professor Davies was breathing heavily, awaiting the moment he buried his tongue inside her. 

""Just do it."" She pleaded, driven wild by his teasing. 

""Just do what?"" He asked, kissing the inside of her warm thighs.

""Eat my pussy, Michael!"" She said huskily. 

Michael grinned upon hearing the respectable proper Professor make such a dirty request. One that he was happy to oblige. He ran his hands under her and grabbed a chunk of her ass in each. 

""As you wish, birthday girl."" He said as he licked her pussy from her vagina up to her clit. He slowly licked, his big tongue covering every centimeter of her pussy. He savored her musky taste as he lapped at her amazing folds. 

""Oh Michael."" She said, her eyes closed in pleasure. ""That feels incredible. Unnhhhh!"" 

Michael had slid half his tongue into her pussy and wiggled it around. He licked her vaginal walls as his nose rubbed against her clit. His face was coated in her juices, while he tongue fucked her, hearing her moan his name. She was building up to an orgasm when she heard the classroom door close. She looked at Michael, horrified. She grabbed her clothes and threw them under her desk. She then put on a teachers robe that covered her entire body, relieving her of the need to put on anything else. 

""Under the desk."" She said to Michael as she heard footsteps coming up the stairs. 

There was a knock on the door. 

""Come in."" She said, red faced. 

Harry entered the room. 

""Hello Professor."" He said cheerfully. 

""Hello Harry."" She replied, hoping he didn't think too much of the smell of the room. 

Potter, thought Michael. He noticed the bastard getting close with the Professor and it deeply annoyed him. He would've loved for Harry to walk in on him tongue fucking Ms. Davies. He suddenly got an idea. He knew he shouldn't, but he didn't want to pass up the opportunity. He lifted Ms. Davies robes, giving him a tunnel view to her pussy. Then he rubbed his hands all over her thighs. 

Professor Davies jumped a bit. 

""Am I interrupting anything?"" Harry asked. 

""No, nothing."" She said, rather quickly. Michael's tongue was licking the inside of her thigh, working its way towards her delicious twat. 

""I just wanted to wish you a happy birthday, and give you this."" He said as he presented her with a gift. 

""Thank you, you didn't have to."" She replied, trying to remain calm. 

""I wanted to."" Said Harry, smiling at her. ""As a thank you."" 

She opened her gift and Michael licked her vagina. 

""Unnh wow!"" She said, trying to pull off excitement rather than her arousal. 

Harry looked at her strangely. The gift wasn't THAT great. 

""I love it, thank you."" She said as Michael continued to lick her pussy, causing her to breath a little heavily. 

She was squirming around in her chair, trying to manage her arousal. Her face was really red and she was perspiring lightly. Harry thought she looked incredibly sexy. 

""Anyways."" Harry said. ""I think I just heard your next class come in. I'll leave you to it. Bye."" 

""Bye Harry, and thank you."" She smiled at him, as Michael sucked on her lips. 

As soon as he left she lifted her wand and performed a silencing spell on the door and walls. It was good that she did, because Michael began licking her clit and she couldn't keep quiet any longer. 

His warm tongue continuously flicked against her love button, sending a jolt of pleasure each time. Wanting to give her a great orgasm, Michael slipped two fingers inside her hungry pussy, and began to finger her. He fingered her shallowly, only going in an inch or so, when he suddenly slipped them in as far as he could, rubbing against her g-spot. Michaels tongue on her clit, and his fingers pumping in and out against her g-spot, sent Ms. Davies over the edge. 

She let out her breath and began moaning rapidly. 

""Ooohhhh fuck!"" She screamed as she came all over Michaels face, coating him in her juices. She continued to breath heavily as Michael removed his head from between her legs, and his fingers out of her tight hole. She smiled down at him and he smiled back at her sweaty red face. She looked so fucking sexy. 

""That was unexpected."" She said. ""Thankfully Harry didn't stay long."" 

""Yeah, definitely."" Said Michael. ""Are you two close?"" 

""Do I detect a hint of jealousy?"" She asked, grinning. 

""He should be jealous of me."" He said as he leaned up and kissed her. His tongue coated in her tangy juices slipped past her lips, leaving her taste in her own mouth. 

""Wow."" She said, as they broke up the kiss. 

""Yeah, you taste really good."" He said. He chuckled as she playfully slapped his arm. 

""You're filthy."" She said, but she'd be lying if she said she didn't like the taste. 

""You have no idea."" He said. She took this as a joke, but it was anything but. 

""Well, thank you for the gifts Michael. I finally got one that I can use. Now, I have a class to teach, so you better go."" 

""Bye professor."" And Michael left, closing the door behind him, not caring that Ms. Davies class could see her pussy juice on his chin. "

Disclaimer: A silly nostalgia. Avoid if you hate it. 

I was just under 18 when I moved away from home. I moved from a small town to a big city. It was weird at first to move away from family, staying all alone by myself and not knowing anyone in the city. Initial few months were spent exploring the city and admiring how different the lifestyle is from my town. I met a lot of new people from a lot of different places. We quickly became friends and hung out together. We became a group of people who hung out together throughout the day for classes, lunch, movies. I was loving the new lifestyle that the city had to offer. Also I started to get a lot of attention from the women. Honestly all of it was unexpected. I had never thought how life would be, I was clueless before moving nevertheless I was very happy how things turned out. Life was treating me nice. Fast forward to a year and half later, we all spilt up to different places for our internships. I moved to a even bigger city. Again the excitement was there.

But things were different in this city. First day at office and I entered into a 40+ story building, already giving me an inferiority complex. Everyone dressed uptight and behaved professional. I was nervous but still excited. However, the hang of it didn't last for long. I met new people but it was all a different situation this time. There were very few interns and others were employees who were quite elder to me. Made friends with few of them. Life out of office  was almost negligible because most of the time was spent in the office. Things started to become monotonous. No one really wanted to hangout on weekends for various reason. Meanwhile I was slowly losing contact with my old pals. All the excitement was gone by now and I became a little grumpy. I was clearly not happy with how things turned out. I was constantly looking for a way to be happy but I just couldn't. I turned arrogant, rude and very egoistic. I started to hate everyone around me. I started to hate my work as well and performed poorly. My internship was for 3 years (it's mandatory) and all this time I realised what it means to be a grown up. And not because I was growing up but because I saw people around me who lived a supposedly grown up life. They had responsibilities, a family to feed or a loan to repay, etc etc. I leanred to live with this and enjoy few moments of joy every now and then whenever possible.

I'm writing this now because today I saw a post from an old friend on FB about her engagement. She got engaged to her long time bf. Both were part of our friend circle. I immediately texted her to congratulate. Talking to her today reminded me of all the fun we did during our time together. We spoke for about half hour and decided to meet soon. 

I felt very different today after talking to her because she reminded me of my old life. When I was happy like a child. Lived every moment in the present, care free. I have so many vivid memories  from the past. I remember my first gf, the first time we kissed, the first time we had sex, the vacation we took, our friends with whom we hung out everyday. It all changed in a matter of no time.

I would trade anything to go back to that life. Growing up sucks man! I don't know if I would hit that level of happiness in my life ever again. 

If you have made this far, thank you stranger for reading. I hope you are having the best time of your life right now and I hope it stays that way as long as possible.

A company in Silicon Valley hired me for an internship last year. I had a fantastic time working for them, all of my co-workers were great, and the work was interesting. However, one thing all the full time staff was telling me was that the starting salary for this position and this team was ~$70K. I struggled with this because, as many people know, California and Silicon Valley in particular are very expensive places to live. I also had some previous experience under my belt and some expertise in some areas of the company which I believe made me more valuable to them. 

I got my first verbal offer from them shortly before leaving, and (as I expected) it was for the base of $70k. I explained to them that this was well below the standard for someone with my experience and the engineering degree that I would have upon graduation. They stated there was not much they could do with that, so I said I would get back to them but I was going to certainly explore other options. 

I applied to other jobs, some that I still have interviews scheduled for, and they began throwing around some preliminary offers of $90-100k. These other jobs are not necessarily exciting and I don’t know much about the company culture or management.

I decided to reach out to my manager from my previous job and explained to him I was very interested in seeing what an offer on paper would look like with my experience and education taken into account. He said he would get back to me.

The first offer I received from HR was for $80k with a signing bonus! Already a decent jump from the first verbal offer I got. However, since I received the offer from HR, I wanted to see if I could negotiate the base again. I explained in detail my experience, what I thought I could bring to the table, other offers and also brought up the fact that relocation was not being considered. 

Today, they got back to me with an additional $5k on the base salary and a relocation bonus! Needless to say, I ecstatic!

Many people coming out of school think that they can’t ask for more or don’t even think to ask. I was always told that you never accept the first offer and that surely worked out for me! I hope this pushes others out there to make sure you aren’t selling yourself short of your full potential!

TL;DR - Got a verbal offer from a company for $70k, shopped around for other offers between $90-100k. Went back to original company and wanted a written offer and gave evidence as to why I deserved more. Got written offer for $80k with sign on bonus. Pushed back and got another offer for $85k with sign on and relocation bonus. Today is a good day!"

&amp;#x200B;

I've been depressed for about 5 or 6 months after a breakup. I started seeing a psychiatrist and a therapist. The last time I felt like this was growing up in middle/high school and I never really felt like my life was too affected, but I definitely was living with it but just on a different scale and different circumstances. After getting in to college, I did a lot of stuff with my life and eventually felt like I cleared myself of anxiety and depression, so looking back I can definitely say I've probably been depressed before.

&amp;#x200B;

Nowadays it feels pretty extreme. The hardest part was the fact that everything I used to enjoy doing in my life I could no longer feel like doing. The pleasure is gone, the energy is lower, and the stress is higher. I've been slowly adjusting, but it still is like a push. I'm volunteering and working at an internship. Taking a break from school, I was in the middle of my degree but right now just have my sophomore year wrapped up with good grades and everything. I just didn't feel like I would be able to come back and even do remotely well in any of my classes, my concentration just wasn't there.

&amp;#x200B;

It feels a lot like rebuilding. At the same time, it feels like a lot of pressure. I've done a lot with my life like traveled, experienced my first relationship, involved myself in my community, gym, just a lot man in the last couple years. Now it kind of feels like I've got to prepare for the rest of my life and it feels super banal. I wasn't expecting to feel depressed like this ever and life doesn't feel exciting or very interesting. The only hope I hold on to is the fact that I have felt like I lived without anxiety and depression before, even though for a short period relative to my whole life. I just feel like this caught me at a weird time; it feels like I'm supposed to be transitioning to adult life but I don't feel like it will be easy at all. Part of me is scared of depression and how I feel like I might not ever feel good about life again like I used to.

The first big transition that I think there would be for me would either be going back to school and living on campus or living on my own in an apartment. I remember really being excited about college before (especially as a freshman), but now that's kinda gone. I don't really know how I'd will myself to work enough though to be able to live in one. Right now I live with my dad and work just close to 30 hours a week. That feels like a lot already. Currently my money goes towards medical expenses, gas, some food, and things I might pay for occasionally if going out or whatever.

&amp;#x200B;

The hardest part to admit is that it kind of feels like my youth is gone and I didn't even realize it would happen like that. I used to have energy, really enjoyed the gym, seemed to be able to motivate others and myself. My friends were the same way. Now I can't match that, and I feel like I'm living in my own world. I'm staying involved/busy but man things are definitely different. Everything feels forced/faked just so I can eek out whatever emotion I feel like used to be normal. It's terrible. I'm starting to forget how good being normal used to be though, so eh. I try to take pleasure in the little things."

_Bill Clinton with intern Monica Lewinsky_

### **How the mighty fall.**

### **Bill Clinton has gone radioactive as Democrat candidates have stopped asking him to campaign for them.**

The Democrats are keeping their distance from the Clintons as they scramble to redefine themselves in Trump’s America and adjust to the #MeToo era.

Clinton, the once popular “closer” on the campaign trail is seeing a big chill from fellow Democrats.

The former President’s abuse of power and extracurricular activities in the Oval Office have drawn sharp rebuke from Democrats in certain circles and the once Clinton-friendly media.

**The [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/02/us/politics/bill-clinton-elections-democrats.html) hit Bill Clinton in a scathing headline Friday, “No One Wants to Campaign With Bill Clinton Anymore”**

As Democrats search for their identity in the Trump era, one aspect has become strikingly clear: Mr. Clinton is not part of it. Just days before the midterm elections, Mr. Clinton finds himself in a kind of political purgatory, unable to overcome past personal and policy choices now considered anathema within the rising liberal wing of his party.

The former president, once such a popular political draw that he was nicknamed his party’s “explainer-in-chief,” has only appeared at a handful of private fund-raisers to benefit midterm candidates, according to people close to him.

**The Women’s March even rejected Slick Willie:**

“I’m not sure that with all the issues he has, he could really be that helpful to the candidates,” said Tamika D. Mallory, an organizer of the Women’s March, who’s now promoting female candidates across the country. “It would do the Democratic Party well to have Bill Clinton focus on his humanitarian efforts.”

**Veteran Democrat strategist Rebecca Kirszner Katz blasted Bill Clinton:**

“It was an abuse of power that shouldn’t have happened and if the Clintons can’t accept that fact 20 years later, it’s hard to see how they can be part of the future of the Democratic Party,”

Clinton’s wife and twice-failed presidential hopeful Hillary has also been branded the kiss of death by many after her toxic 2016 White House bid.

Hillary Clinton also bullied her husband Bill’s sex abuse victims and is still dogged by her private email scandal–both losing arguments for the left.

Of course the Clintons are working behind the scenes helping with fundraising, but it is very telling that Democrat candidates don’t want to be seen with them, especially Bill Clinton, in public.

I became curious in AGI safety research about 2 years ago. I was enrolled in IT minor at the time and decided to finish it, then go on a Computer Science major. I successfully did that and am currently enrolled in a computer science major.

I am really concerned about the problem of AGI safety research, but I have to test out if I'll like the day-to-day grind. According to 80,000 hours (and common sense), it is best that I test it out. So, my goal is to get an internship in an institution such as Future of Humanity Institute (primary institution) or OpenAI or some other institution this summer. To do that, I understand that I have to stand out from other talented individuals. Here are my questions:

* What will make me stand out in my GitHub profile?
* Will letters of recommendation from my academic mentors make me stand out?
* How important is it that I have straight A's in my GPA?
* When is it best to apply to these internships (time-wise - right now, after Christmas etc.)?
* To which institutions should I apply? (the more institutions I apply to, the greater the probability of the internship)
* Anything else?

I would really like to maximize my chances, so if you can and know how, do help me out!

Thank you in advance!

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

P.S. I was just scrolling through and noticed that /u/long_void and /u/gwern are independent researchers. I actually relish the idea of being independent, primarily because I could then work remotely (even though remote work for prominent AGI safety research organizations is possible). So for /u/long_void, /u/gwern and anyone else who is an independent researcher, I've got a few questions, if you don't mind:

* What does it mean that you are independent? You are not affiliated with any organization?
* How do you get funded?
* Are you a full-time researcher or do you research in your free time?
* How did you get into all of this? Any tips for someone such as me (just getting into this)?

Thanks in advance!"

9tn1s7,0,2018-11-02,I [29/m] was seeing [21/f] for 1.5 years. She eventually started preferring to meet up with other people in public settings.,socomkilla,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9tn1s7/i_29m_was_seeing_21f_for_15_years_she_eventually/,"Background:

We originally met on Tinder sharing very similar music interests. She didn't seem to be the standard person you'd meet from Tinder though, seemed like she lacked dating experience or was still a little shy with being romantic but otherwise very confident socially. We found a very large amount of things in common and could chat about them for hours. I really looked forward to spending time with her any chance we had. Our thing was going to live music together, very often (upwards of 17 shows together). Honestly, 2017 with her was one of the most fulfilling years going out with somebody, I really liked the vibe and the connection I was getting. We did everything together from tons of brunch/lunch/dinner dates, rollercoasters, movies outings, music fests, concerts, baseball game, foodie outings, movies at my place, etc.. 

Couple things to mention: We never talked about what we were doing even though most people believed we were dating. Every chance I brought up the topic seemed to shut her down and avoid it. Very early on her actions towards my subtle sexual advances made her clearly uncomfortable and that she wanted to take things slow, and so I did. We continued having really awesome times together even without the physical side of things. 

Fast forward to now:

The last 2 shows we were excited for and directly told me she was going to:

* 1. Showed up with another guy, never attempted to even say hello the entire night.
* 2. Said a very quick hello when randomly walking past me but proceeded to hang with the guy from the previous show and one of her girlfriends instead the entire night. 

A few days before show 1, we had a very standard lunch date. We spoke about a bunch of events we were looking forward to going to together. Everything seemed normal.

We haven't spoken in over a month since that first show, she hasn't attempted to reach out either. All signs are pointing to her seeing that other guy at this point. She mentioned this guy as a friend from her summer internship.

At this point, I know if we started chatting again, she will try to ""just be friends"" or whatever but it will honestly just be too awkward and uncomfortable after everything we've done together. Am I just being too nostalgic about our past? Should I even attempt to get closure at this point? I've definitely learned my lesson not figuring out what we were doing early on. It sure doesn't seem like she is being very considerate towards me with her actions at this point.

9tnqi5,4,2018-11-02,Help out a new Accountant,[deleted],Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/9tnqi5/help_out_a_new_accountant/,"Hi r/Accounting!

So I graduated last December with an Accounting (sort of) degree (B.S.) Allow me to sum it up briefly:

First 2 years in Computer Engineering, drove me insane, hated it, switched to Business Management and specialized in Accounting. Total time in college 4.5 years, with summer classes.

\---

So, why I need help:

After graduation I went up to full time at my then current job, while I searched for a career (didn't land any internships or have luck towards the end of school). The job search was tough, I sent out an ungodly amount of applications through LinkedIn, Indeed, Monster, Career Builder, Various Firm's websites, etc. Got not even 1 interview. My neighbor's accountant with whom my family is also good friends happened to know a guy at an Auditing firm who could get me an interview at least.

Saving all the B.S: This place is desperate for employees their turnover ratio is absurdly high, about 15 people have left in my 7/8 months here. Most of them not on good terms, lost the ability to handle the Partners. I got the job and took it.

This place exclusively does Medicare/Medicaid Compliance audits on the Cost Reports for providers all over the country. The Partners do absolutely no training, they just force their more senior staff to do it **Edit: Firm is 4 partners and roughly 25 ""staff accountants""**, the firm has been doing mandatory 60+ hour weeks for 10 out of 12 months this year, which is apparently very common here. Its gotten to the point where i wake up, come here, go home, eat and sleep. Like literally, I have next to no time to do anything else, 6 days a week. I understand there is busy seasons and long hours are to be expected but this seems outrageous to me and is destroying my mental health.

To go on any interview I need to use a sick day and then I am supposed to make up the day plus my overtime, so the more interviews that fall through, the more I have to work every month, above the already nearly impossible requirements.

So my question to you all is, are you happy where you are? Do you have somewhat of a work/life balance? How many places did you apply to before you got there? Any recommendations on getting more interviews/landing a job? Should I quit and be unemployed for a (hopefully) short period to help myself? (I have enough savings to survive for a short time) I'm at my wits end with this and I need advice.

If anyone needs more details please ask I will be happy to expand, I didn't want to ramble that much."

*No matter how hard they try, brain scientists and cognitive psychologists will never find a copy of Beethoven’s 5th Symphony in the brain – or copies of words, pictures, grammatical rules or any other kinds of environmental stimuli. The human brain isn’t really empty, of course. But it does not contain most of the things people think it does – not even simple things such as ‘memories’.*

Our shoddy thinking about the brain has deep historical roots, but the invention of computers in the 1940s got us especially confused. For more than half a century now, psychologists, linguists, neuroscientists and other experts on human behaviour have been asserting that the human brain works like a computer.

To see how vacuous this idea is, consider the brains of babies. Thanks to evolution, human neonates, like the newborns of all other mammalian species, enter the world prepared to interact with it effectively. A baby’s vision is blurry, but it pays special attention to faces, and is quickly able to identify its mother’s. It prefers the sound of voices to non-speech sounds, and can distinguish one basic speech sound from another. We are, without doubt, built to make social connections.

A healthy newborn is also equipped with more than a dozen reflexes – ready-made reactions to certain stimuli that are important for its survival. It turns its head in the direction of something that brushes its cheek and then sucks whatever enters its mouth. It holds its breath when submerged in water. It grasps things placed in its hands so strongly it can nearly support its own weight. Perhaps most important, newborns come equipped with powerful learning mechanisms that allow them to *change* rapidly so they can interact increasingly effectively with their world, even if that world is unlike the one their distant ancestors faced.

Senses, reflexes and learning mechanisms – this is what we start with, and it is quite a lot, when you think about it. If we lacked any of these capabilities at birth, we would probably have trouble surviving.

**But here is what we are** ***not*** **born with:** ***information, data, rules, software, knowledge, lexicons, representations, algorithms, programs, models, memories, images, processors, subroutines, encoders, decoders, symbols, or buffers*** **–** design elements that allow digital computers to behave somewhat intelligently. Not only are we not *born* with such things, we also don’t *develop* them – ever.

We don’t *store* words or the rules that tell us how to manipulate them. We don’t create *representations*of visual stimuli, *store* them in a short-term memory buffer, and then *transfer* the representation into a long-term memory device. We don’t *retrieve* information or images or words from memory registers. Computers do all of these things, but organisms do not.

Computers, quite literally, *process information* – numbers, letters, words, formulas, images. The information first has to be encoded into a format computers can use, which means patterns of ones and zeroes (‘bits’) organised into small chunks (‘bytes’). On my computer, each byte contains 8 bits, and a certain pattern of those bits stands for the letter *d*, another for the letter *o,* and another for the letter *g*. Side by side, those three bytes form the word *dog*. One single image – say, the photograph of my cat Henry on my desktop – is represented by a very specific pattern of a million of these bytes (‘one megabyte’), surrounded by some special characters that tell the computer to expect an image, not a word.

Computers, quite literally, move these patterns from place to place in different physical storage areas etched into electronic components. Sometimes they also copy the patterns, and sometimes they transform them in various ways – say, when we are correcting errors in a manuscript or when we are touching up a photograph. The rules computers follow for moving, copying and operating on these arrays of data are also stored inside the computer. Together, a set of rules is called a ‘program’ or an ‘algorithm’. A group of algorithms that work together to help us do something (like buy stocks or find a date online) is called an ‘application’ – what most people now call an ‘app’.

Forgive me for this introduction to computing, but I need to be clear: computers really do operate on *symbolic representations* of the world. They really *store* and *retrieve*. They really *process*. They really have physical *memories*. They really are guided in everything they do, without exception, by *algorithms*.

Humans, on the other hand, do not – never did, never will. Given this reality, why do so many scientists talk about our mental life as if we were computers?

In his book *In Our Own Image* (2015), the artificial intelligence expert George Zarkadakis describes six different metaphors people have employed over the past 2,000 years to try to explain human intelligence.

In the earliest one, eventually preserved in the Bible, humans were formed from clay or dirt, which an intelligent god then infused with its spirit. That spirit ‘explained’ our intelligence – grammatically, at least.

The invention of hydraulic engineering in the 3rd century BCE led to the popularity of a hydraulic model of human intelligence, the idea that the flow of different fluids in the body – the ‘humours’ – accounted for both our physical and mental functioning. The hydraulic metaphor persisted for more than 1,600 years, handicapping medical practice all the while.

By the 1500s, automata powered by springs and gears had been devised, eventually inspiring leading thinkers such as René Descartes to assert that humans are complex machines. In the 1600s, the British philosopher Thomas Hobbes suggested that thinking arose from small mechanical motions in the brain. By the 1700s, discoveries about electricity and chemistry led to new theories of human intelligence – again, largely metaphorical in nature. In the mid-1800s, inspired by recent advances in communications, the German physicist Hermann von Helmholtz compared the brain to a telegraph.

The mathematician **John von Neumann** stated flatly that the function of the human nervous system is ‘*prima facie* digital’, drawing parallel after parallel between the components of the computing machines of the day and the components of the human brain

Each metaphor reflected the most advanced thinking of the era that spawned it. Predictably, just a few years after the dawn of computer technology in the 1940s, the brain was said to operate like a computer, with the role of physical hardware played by the brain itself and our thoughts serving as software. The landmark event that launched what is now broadly called ‘cognitive science’ was the publication of *Language and Communication* (1951) by the psychologist George Miller. Miller proposed that the mental world could be studied rigorously using concepts from information theory, computation and linguistics.

This kind of thinking was taken to its ultimate expression in the short book *The Computer and the Brain*(1958), in which the mathematician John von Neumann stated flatly that the function of the human nervous system is ‘*prima facie* digital’. Although he acknowledged that little was actually known about the role the brain played in human reasoning and memory, he drew parallel after parallel between the components of the computing machines of the day and the components of the human brain.

Propelled by subsequent advances in both computer technology and brain research, an ambitious multidisciplinary effort to understand human intelligence gradually developed, firmly rooted in the idea that humans are, like computers, information processors. This effort now involves thousands of researchers, consumes billions of dollars in funding, and has generated a vast literature consisting of both technical and mainstream articles and books. Ray Kurzweil’s book *How to Create a Mind: The Secret of Human Thought Revealed* (2013), exemplifies this perspective, speculating about the ‘algorithms’ of the brain, how the brain ‘processes data’, and even how it superficially resembles integrated circuits in its structure.

The information processing (IP) metaphor of human intelligence now dominates human thinking, both on the street and in the sciences. There is virtually no form of discourse about intelligent human behaviour that proceeds without employing this metaphor, just as no form of discourse about intelligent human behaviour could proceed in certain eras and cultures without reference to a spirit or deity. The validity of the IP metaphor in today’s world is generally assumed without question.

[**Optogenetics: A New Technology To Control The Human Brain. Will People Prevent the Rise of A “New Totality”?**](https://www.globalresearch.ca/optogenetics-a-new-technology-to-control-the-human-brain-will-people-prevent-the-rise-of-a-new-totality/5647414)

But the IP metaphor is, after all, just another metaphor – a story we tell to make sense of something we don’t actually understand. And like all the metaphors that preceded it, it will certainly be cast aside at some point – either replaced by another metaphor or, in the end, replaced by actual knowledge.

Just over a year ago, on a visit to one of the world’s most prestigious research institutes, I challenged researchers there to account for intelligent human behaviour without reference to any aspect of the IP metaphor. *They couldn’t do it*, and when I politely raised the issue in subsequent email communications, they still had nothing to offer months later. They saw the problem. They didn’t dismiss the challenge as trivial. But they couldn’t offer an alternative. In other words, the IP metaphor is ‘sticky’. It encumbers our thinking with language and ideas that are so powerful we have trouble thinking around them.

The faulty logic of the IP metaphor is easy enough to state. It is based on a faulty syllogism – one with two reasonable premises and a faulty conclusion. *Reasonable premise #1:* all computers are capable of behaving intelligently. *Reasonable premise #2:* all computers are information processors. *Faulty conclusion:* all entities that are capable of behaving intelligently are information processors.

Setting aside the formal language, the idea that humans must be information processors just because *computers* are information processors is just plain silly, and when, some day, the IP metaphor is finally abandoned, it will almost certainly be seen that way by historians, just as we now view the hydraulic and mechanical metaphors to be silly.

If the IP metaphor is so silly, why is it so sticky? What is stopping us from brushing it aside, just as we might brush aside a branch that was blocking our path? Is there a way to understand human intelligence without leaning on a flimsy intellectual crutch? And what price have we paid for leaning so heavily on this particular crutch for so long? The IP metaphor, after all, has been guiding the writing and thinking of a large number of researchers in multiple fields for decades. *At what cost?*

In a classroom exercise I have conducted many times over the years, I begin by recruiting a student to draw a detailed picture of a dollar bill – ‘as detailed as possible’, I say – on the blackboard in front of the room. When the student has finished, I cover the drawing with a sheet of paper, remove a dollar bill from my wallet, tape it to the board, and ask the student to repeat the task. When he or she is done, I remove the cover from the first drawing, and the class comments on the differences.

Because you might never have seen a demonstration like this, or because you might have trouble imagining the outcome, I have asked Jinny Hyun, one of the student interns at the institute where I conduct my research, to make the two drawings. Here is her drawing ‘from memory’ (notice the metaphor):

📷

And here is the drawing she subsequently made with a dollar bill present:

📷

Jinny was as surprised by the outcome as you probably are, but it is typical. As you can see, the drawing made in the absence of the dollar bill is horrible compared with the drawing made from an exemplar, even though Jinny has seen a dollar bill thousands of times.

What is the problem? Don’t we have a ‘representation’ of the dollar bill ‘stored’ in a ‘memory register’ in our brains? Can’t we just ‘retrieve’ it and use it to make our drawing?

Obviously not, and a thousand years of neuroscience will never locate a representation of a dollar bill stored inside the human brain for the simple reason that it is not there to be found.

The idea that memories are stored in *individual neurons* is preposterous: how and where is the memory stored in the cell?

A wealth of brain studies tells us, in fact, that multiple and sometimes [large areas](http://cercor.oxfordjournals.org/content/14/11/1214.full) of the brain are often involved in even the most mundane memory tasks. When strong emotions are involved, millions of neurons can become more active. In a [2016 study](http://cpx.sagepub.com/content/4/2/312) of survivors of a plane crash by the University of Toronto neuropsychologist Brian Levine and others, recalling the crash increased neural activity in ‘the amygdala, medial temporal lobe, anterior and posterior midline, and visual cortex’ of the passengers.

The idea, advanced by several scientists, that specific memories are somehow stored in *individual neurons* is preposterous; if anything, that assertion just pushes the problem of memory to an even more challenging level: how and where, after all, is the memory stored in the cell?

So what is occurring when Jinny draws the dollar bill in its absence? If Jinny had *never* seen a dollar bill before, her first drawing would probably have not resembled the second drawing at all. Having seen dollar bills before, she was *changed* in some way. Specifically, her brain was changed in a way that allowed her to *visualise* a dollar bill – that is, to *re-experience* seeing a dollar bill, at least to some extent.

The difference between the two diagrams reminds us that visualising something (that is, seeing something in its absence) is far less accurate than seeing something in its presence. This is why we’re much better at recognising than recalling. When we *re-member* something (from the Latin *re*, ‘again’, and *memorari*, ‘be mindful of’), we have to try to relive an experience; but when we recognise something, we must merely be conscious of the fact that we have had this perceptual experience before.

Perhaps you will object to this demonstration. Jinny had seen dollar bills before, but she hadn’t made a deliberate effort to ‘memorise’ the details. Had she done so, you might argue, she could presumably have drawn the second image without the bill being present. Even in this case, though, *no image of the dollar bill has in any sense been ‘stored’ in Jinny’s brain*. She has simply become better prepared to draw it accurately, just as, through practice, a pianist becomes more skilled in playing a concerto without somehow inhaling a copy of the sheet music.

From this simple exercise, we can begin to build the framework of a metaphor-free theory of intelligent human behaviour – one in which the brain isn’t completely *empty*, but is at least empty of the baggage of the IP metaphor.

As we navigate through the world, we are changed by a variety of experiences. Of special note are experiences of three types: (1) we *observe*what is happening around us (other people behaving, sounds of music, instructions directed at us, words on pages, images on screens); (2) we are exposed to the *pairing* of unimportant stimuli (such as sirens) with important stimuli (such as the appearance of police cars); (3) we are *punished or rewarded* for behaving in certain ways.

We become more effective in our lives if we change in ways that are consistent with these experiences – if we can now recite a poem or sing a song, if we are able to follow the instructions we are given, if we respond to the unimportant stimuli more like we do to the important stimuli, if we refrain from behaving in ways that were punished, if we behave more frequently in ways that were rewarded.

Misleading headlines notwithstanding, no one really has the slightest idea how the brain changes after we have learned to sing a song or recite a poem. But neither the song nor the poem has been ‘stored’ in it. The brain has simply *changed* in an orderly way that now allows us to sing the song or recite the poem under certain conditions. When called on to perform, neither the song nor the poem is in any sense ‘retrieved’ from anywhere in the brain, any more than my finger movements are ‘retrieved’ when I tap my finger on my desk. We simply sing or recite – no retrieval necessary.

A few years ago, [I asked the neuroscientist](http://drrobertepstein.com/downloads/Epstein-BRUTH_TRUTHS_ABOUT_THE_AGING_BRAIN-DISCOVER-Oct_2012.pdf) Eric Kandel of Columbia University – winner of a Nobel Prize for identifying some of the chemical changes that take place in the neuronal synapses of the *Aplysia* (a marine snail) after it learns something – how long he thought it would take us to understand how human memory works. He quickly replied: ‘A hundred years.’ I didn’t think to ask him whether he thought the IP metaphor was slowing down neuroscience, but some neuroscientists are indeed beginning to think the unthinkable – that the metaphor is not indispensable.

A few cognitive scientists – notably Anthony Chemero of the University of Cincinnati, the author of *Radical Embodied Cognitive Science* (2009) – now completely reject the view that the human brain works like a computer. The mainstream view is that we, like computers, make sense of the world by performing computations on mental representations of it, but Chemero and others describe another way of understanding intelligent behaviour – as a *direct interaction* between organisms and their world.

My favourite example of the dramatic difference between the IP perspective and what some now call the ‘anti-representational’ view of human functioning involves two different ways of explaining how a baseball player manages to catch a fly ball – beautifully explicated by Michael McBeath, now at Arizona State University, and his colleagues in [a 1995 paper in Science](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7725104). The IP perspective requires the player to formulate an estimate of various initial conditions of the ball’s flight – the force of the impact, the angle of the trajectory, that kind of thing – then to create and analyse an internal model of the path along which the ball will likely move, then to use that model to guide and adjust motor movements continuously in time in order to intercept the ball.

That is all well and good *if* we functioned as computers do, but McBeath and his colleagues gave a simpler account: to catch the ball, the player simply needs to keep moving in a way that keeps the ball in a constant visual relationship with respect to home plate and the surrounding scenery (technically, in a ‘linear optical trajectory’). This might sound complicated, but it is actually incredibly simple, and completely free of computations, representations and algorithms.

We will never have to worry about a human mind going amok in cyberspace, and we will never achieve immortality through downloading

Two determined psychology professors at Leeds Beckett University in the UK – Andrew Wilson and Sabrina Golonka – include the baseball example among many others that can be looked at simply and sensibly outside the IP framework. They have been [blogging](http://psychsciencenotes.blogspot.com/p/about-us.html) for years about what they call a ‘more coherent, naturalised approach to the scientific study of human behaviour… at odds with the dominant cognitive neuroscience approach’. This is far from a movement, however; the mainstream cognitive sciences continue to wallow uncritically in the IP metaphor, and some of the world’s most influential thinkers have made grand predictions about humanity’s future that depend on the validity of the metaphor.

One prediction – made by the futurist Kurzweil, the physicist Stephen Hawking and the neuroscientist Randal Koene, among others – is that, because human consciousness is supposedly like computer software, it will soon be possible to download human minds to a computer, in the circuits of which we will become immensely powerful intellectually and, quite possibly, immortal. This concept drove the plot of the dystopian movie *Transcendence* (2014) starring Johnny Depp as the Kurzweil-like scientist whose mind was downloaded to the internet – with disastrous results for humanity.

Fortunately, because the IP metaphor is not even slightly valid, we will never have to worry about a human mind going amok in cyberspace; alas, we will also never achieve immortality through downloading. This is not only because of the absence of consciousness software in the brain; there is a deeper problem here – let’s call it the *uniqueness problem* – which is both inspirational and depressing.

Because neither ‘memory banks’ nor ‘representations’ of stimuli exist in the brain, and because all that is required for us to function in the world is for the brain to change in an orderly way as a result of our experiences, *there is no reason to believe that any two of us are changed the same way by the same experience*. If you and I attend the same concert, the changes that occur in my brain when I listen to Beethoven’s 5th will almost certainly be completely different from the changes that occur in your brain. Those changes, whatever they are, are built on the unique neural structure that already exists, each structure having developed over a lifetime of unique experiences.

This is why, as Sir Frederic Bartlett demonstrated in his book *Remembering*(1932), no two people will repeat a story they have heard the same way and why, over time, their recitations of the story will diverge more and more. No ‘copy’ of the story is ever made; rather, each individual, upon hearing the story, changes to some extent – enough so that when asked about the story later (in some cases, days, months or even years after Bartlett first read them the story) – they can *re-experience* hearing the story to some extent, although not very well (see the first drawing of the dollar bill, above).

This is inspirational, I suppose, because it means that each of us is truly unique, not just in our genetic makeup, but even in the way our brains change over time. It is also depressing, because it makes the task of the neuroscientist daunting almost beyond imagination. For any given experience, orderly change could involve a thousand neurons, a million neurons or even the entire brain, with the pattern of change different in every brain.

Worse still, even if we had the ability to take a snapshot of all of the brain’s 86 billion neurons and then to simulate the state of those neurons in a computer, *that vast pattern would mean nothing outside the body of the brain that produced it*. This is perhaps the most egregious way in which the IP metaphor has distorted our thinking about human functioning. Whereas computers do store exact copies of data – copies that can persist unchanged for long periods of time, even if the power has been turned off – the brain maintains our intellect only as long as it remains *alive*. There is no on-off switch. Either the brain keeps functioning, or we disappear. What’s more, as the neurobiologist Steven Rose pointed out in *The Future of the Brain* (2005), a snapshot of the brain’s current state might also be meaningless unless we knew the *entire life history* of that brain’s owner – perhaps even about the *social context* in which he or she was raised.

Think how difficult this problem is. To understand even the basics of how the brain maintains the human intellect, we might need to know not just the current state of all 86 billion neurons and their 100 trillion interconnections, not just the varying strengths with which they are connected, and not just the states of more than 1,000 proteins that exist at each connection point, but how the moment-to-moment *activity* of the brain contributes to the integrity of the system. Add to this the uniqueness of each brain, brought about in part because of the uniqueness of each person’s life history, and Kandel’s prediction starts to sound overly optimistic. (In a [recent op-ed](http://nyti.ms/1VLghZ4) in *The* *New York Times*, the neuroscientist Kenneth Miller suggested it will take ‘centuries’ just to figure out basic neuronal connectivity.)

Meanwhile, vast sums of money are being raised for brain research, based in some cases on faulty ideas and promises that cannot be kept. The most blatant instance of neuroscience gone awry, documented recently in [a report in *Scientific American*](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-the-human-brain-project-went-wrong-and-how-to-fix-it/), concerns the $1.3 billion Human Brain Project launched by the European Union in 2013. Convinced by the charismatic Henry Markram that he could create a simulation of the entire human brain on a supercomputer by the year 2023, and that such a model would revolutionise the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease and other disorders, EU officials funded his project with virtually no restrictions. Less than two years into it, the project turned into a ‘brain wreck’, and Markram was asked to step down.

We are organisms, not computers. *Get over it.* Let’s get on with the business of trying to understand ourselves, but without being encumbered by unnecessary intellectual baggage. The IP metaphor has had a half-century run, producing few, if any, insights along the way. The time has come to hit the DELETE key.

9tor9p,150,2018-11-02,"Went to an ""interview"" for a house-painting pyramid scheme in college",olliegee,antiMLM,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiMLM/comments/9tor9p/went_to_an_interview_for_a_housepainting_pyramid/,"TL;DR: Replied to a nondescript ad for a summer internship, ended up getting kicked out of an mlm interview for asking too many questions.

This was 6 years ago when I was a college sophomore. I had a  class in a giant lecture hall, and someone had left a bunch of flyers in the seats advertising a summer internship. There was no info about the internship other than ""Earn up to $17/hour! Call this number!"" I was looking for an excuse to avoid spending the summer with my parents, so took the bait and gave them a call, which turned into an impromptu phone interview.

The questions were all about running a business and managing people. I was an engineering major at the time, but I managed to BS my answers to make myself seem more business-minded than I actually was. When the interview was over, the woman told me that I would be moving on to an in-person interview. I was stoked and went to tell my roommate as soon as the call was over. She asked me what the name of the company was, and I realized that the flyer didn't say and the woman had never told me. This should have been the first red flag. I realized this was odd, but promised I would ask first chance I got at the in-person interview.

So the day of the interview comes, and I put on my best business casual clothes and showed up to the coffee shop where it was happening 30 minutes early. 10 minutes before the interview, I got a text from my interviewer telling me he was at a certain table. I picked up my stuff and went there to find a kid who couldn't have been more than a year or two older than me, wearing a t-shirt and jeans. Red flag number 2. I had been expecting someone in their late 20s wearing professional clothes, not some 20-year-old who looked like he had just rolled out of bed. But I hid my surprise and greeted him. We sat down and made small talk for a little bit before I mentioned that I hadn't caught the name of the company. He said, ""We'll discuss that after the other interviewees arrive."" Giant red flags number 3 and 4. Nobody had told me this was going to be a group interview, and why couldn't he just tell me the name of the company. What the fuck was going on here?

The other 2 interviewees arrived, and the interviewer had us sign in to a book filled with tons of other names and dates. Weird, but whatever. I pulled out a pen and paper to take notes. The interviewer began telling us that the company would allow us to run a business and be our own bosses with employees underneath us. He went on about how great it is to be a boss and set your own hours. And how we'd get so much leadership experience with this job. And then he finally gave us some pamphlets that said the name of the company was College Works and that the service they provide is.....painting houses. What the fuck? Red flags number 5 through 100. He asked us a bunch of questions about managing people, handling with stress, blah blah blah interview stuff. The 2 guys were getting really competitive with each other, but I was way more interested in asking questions than answering them. And the more questions I asked, then more annoyed my interviewer got.

&gt;Would College Works provide a painting crew for us?

&gt;No, I would have to recruit them myself, preferably from my own friend group or by putting out an ad.

&gt;Did College Works provide the paint and materials?

&gt;No, I would have to pay for materials out of my own pocket. And also decide what rate to pay the workers.

&gt;Would College Works provide me with ad material?

&gt;No, I would have to pay for and create any ads myself.

&gt;Would I be allowed to decide what city my ""business"" would be located in?

&gt;No, College Works would assign me to a city to prevent market saturation, but most ""business owners"" were assigned to their hometowns so they could stay with their parents rent-free over the summer.

&gt;If I recruited painters from outside my friend group, how would I get a bunch of adults to respect a 19-year-old girl with literally 0 experience and 0 knowledge of house painting? Did the company even provide any training??? How does College Works make money off this? Do they take a cut for each house that I paint?

The interviewer waffled for a bit about and then announced that the interview was over. I was ok with this since I had already decided I was out at ""house painting."" The only thing keeping me there at that point was morbid curiosity about how the hell this was supposed to be a viable business model. He asked me to sign out of his log book, but then kept talking to the guys and never asked them to sign out. I took my sweet fucking time packing away my things until he was very pointedly looking at me waiting for me to leave. As I walked away, I heard him say, ""Ok, now that's she's gone...."" and the guys chuckled.

As soon as I got home, I googled ""college works scam"" and discovered what mlms were. The kid interviewing would have been my upline. I was relieved that I didn't fall for it, but annoyed that I woke up 2 hours early to go to this interview.

This story is already longer than any paper I ever wrote in college, but there's one last part to it. The next semester, I had another class in the same lecture hall, and one day the same flyers showed up on seats again. I told everyone that I could that it was a scam and that the company was called College Works and that the internship was painting houses. Hopefully, I saved some kids from wasting their time."
9toxfr,12,2018-11-02,IT CAN HAPPEN. Coming up on a year,libra_here,recovery,https://www.reddit.com/r/recovery/comments/9toxfr/it_can_happen_coming_up_on_a_year/,"On Nov. 4th (Monday) I'll have been sober for a year.

Almost a year to the day right now I was homeless, hopeless, and ready to die. It took one more overdose on Nov. 3rd, 2017 before I was ready. Now I am in school getting ready to graduate, have completed two internships, have a job, have a relationship with my family, plans to travel, an apartment, and am in shape. My life is amazing.

I just wanted to share the things that worked for me:

1. TAKE IT ONE DAY AT A TIME. I still have to remind myself of this all the time, and I wish I had understood this more from the beginning.
2. GET CONNECTED. Going to meetings, making friends whether there or at work or school, and building a social life was key.
3. PLAN AND SCHEDULE. I plan everyday of my life, sometimes by the hour i.e. ""7-8: workout, 8-9: shower, dress, eat..."" After years of abusing drugs and alcohol, making new habits takes time and requires discipline.
4. FIND A HOBBY. Workout, art, write, surf, hell, I have a friend who started creating content on YouTube. Boredom will fuck you up.

but the biggest one...

5) DONT BEAT YOURSELF UP. The longer I stay clean, the more my standards go up: now I am in school, now I have an internship, now I want to be the best at my job, get the best grades, be in the best shape, be there for my family whenever they need it because I was absent so long...But I do burn out, and when I fail is when I beat myself up for it, instead of just taking it as a lesson and let it reset.

Remember, everything and anything can go wrong or good in your life: DON'T USE NO MATTER WHAT "

I don’t think the problem is this arc alone, but Horikoshi having issues with plot progression. IMO when it comes to characterization and character interactions, I think he is a fabulous writer, but his ability to write a good plot is not bad, but I think could be much better.

So with this arc is not much different in terms of importance than the final exams arc, in fact this would have been a much better replacement. I always found it weird that they paired the students against teachers after only one semester of school. If this arc was in the final exams timeslot it would have worked out much better because we had just been introduced to Class B in the Sports Festival Arc. With that said, I think Horikoshi should have **NEVER** created a Class B in the first place and I have had this opinion since the sports festival arc. Why is something like the Sports Festival, an event as grand as the Olympics in Japan, only with ONE school and has non-hero students competing too; this never made sense to me. He should have just stuck to one class of hero students and had the sports festival with other schools. Then the other schools could pop up for say the licensing exam and internships.

But in all honestly, the biggest problem has been his writing for a post-All Might Japan. Ever since The Hideout Raid Arc happened things have been getting a bit meh. The arc everyone seems to praise, The Internship Arc…. I personally do not think should have existed. By calling it ""The Internship Arc"", its like he is alluding too this will be the only time we see internships, and the other problems were that he introduced too many new characters when there were already so many undeveloped characters, and there wasn't enough build up to the arc. Before you begin screaming in the comments, continue reading below.

It would have been cooler to see some arcs where we start seeing the problems with a post-All Might Japan. All students with their licenses and whom have contacts from the Sports Festival, are on internships. The interns are gaining experience fighting groups of villains, but while they are gaining real world experience, the pros are gaining experience doing something new; fighting more organized groups of villains. We could see pros struggling with this and having to work together with other pros, possibly causing friction between some as they all want the media attention, fame and prestige for themselves, thus beginning to prove to the public what Stain was saying was right. The people not feeling as protected and starting to see problems with heroes, become more hostile and some even turning to the villains side. And who is on top in charge of this huge mess…. Endeavor. This could leave us as the readers being able to **SEE** Endeavor’s change as he begins to notice the chaos around him, pros struggling, and the invisible thing All Might built up over the years begin to crumble before his very eyes. Him being in charge of this mess is causing his tunnel vision to disappear and is beginning to care about everything happening around him, and the people he is in charge of protecting, but even worse is that he can’t do anything about it. Then on top of all this, is the guilt from having done what he did all those years, treating his family as if they were tools rather than human beings. Like in the series, this would lead him to trying to reach out to Shoto, attending his remedial course exam and while there, asking All Might for advice. While this is happening in the forefront, in the background the villains could be amassing to the LoV and the Yakuza. Eventually things boil up and the LoV and Yakuza start either working together similar to the Internship arc, but this would happen closer to where we are now in the series(Decemeber) rather than right after All Might being gone(September)."

I'm just so. Sad. I don't know what else to say. I want to kill myself. I don't want to tell my friends because even though they're supportive they don't understand depression and I constantly feel like I'm a bore and a downer.

I accepted an internship in Costa Mesa for Summer 2019 and I have a few questions about moving out to California. I've only ever lived in the north east, so I don't know the area at all. 

1)Where should I live? I'm looking to spend $1,000/month on rent if I can. But I realize I might have to pay closer to $1,500. I'm looking for a place that's biking distance from work and the beach. From my initial look, this seems like Huntington Beach or Costa Mesa. I'm looking for a place were I can enjoy my summer, so accessible nightlife is a plus. I'm not a big nightclub guy though, more of someone looking for a cool bar to get drinks and chat with people, or listen to live music. 

In addition, are there problem areas that I should look out for while I search? 



2) How bike-able is the area? I've been a bike commuter in Philadelphia and in my college town. My current plan is to save some money by buying a bike for the summer to handle my day-to-day needs like shopping and going to work. Is this something I'll regret doing in the summer due to heat? Are the roads bike friendly? 

3) What should I take advantage of while I'm here? I want to make the most of the summer, so are there any events or places that you'd prioritize? I love live music, hiking/camping and am really looking to utilize the beach. 

Thank you for any help you can offer me. I don't know anything about the area at all, but I'm beyond psyched to be moving out there. Living in California has been a dream of mine, and I'm really looking forward to it. "
9trrnt,1,2018-11-03,Never in a million years did I think I would ever say this. But school just gave me hope.,purple-cucumber61,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/9trrnt/never_in_a_million_years_did_i_think_i_would_ever/,"A year ago during this time I was hopeful and dedicated. I was involved in clubs, classes, and had goals and was reaching them.

I got an amazing semester internship, but the last 6 months have been the most emotional roller coaster, lowest and depressed point in my entire 22 years of life. 

I was so use to being busy all the time in school. Once I got into the 9-5 routine I got bored the first month. I realized all the hard work I did in school was unnecessary. I realized my own mortality. And ultimately I was alone. 

Living with my mom(I love her very much) didn’t help either and I got depressed thinking I’m missing out on other opportunities with my friends and felt like a loser. 

So To fill the void, I put myself out there and found a girl. She was amazing. She was the first girl I fell in love with. No other girl has ever made me feel the way she did. 

Life was amazing for a lil while. But then it ended, I experienced my first true heart break. God damn it hurt, still hurting. There were times were I didn’t want to get out of bed in the morning. I took mental health days off from work and cried in my car In Walmart parking lots. 

I’m such a different person than I was a year ago. It’s insane how much I’ve changed. My views on life are different. My confidence is higher mainly because I give less fucks about almost everything. I feel like an adult now more than ever. 

My heart still hurts. Every day it hurts, everyday I think about her. Some days I think what’s the point, and don’t want to continue. My heart is still an open wound.

But Today I registered for classes for next semester. For some reason it gave me hope. I remembered the good times I had with my friends, and remembered all the optimism a new semester granted.

This time, I’m gonna take what I learned from these last 6 dark months. I’m gonna loosen up, I’m gonna enjoy my time with my friends and meet new people. I’m gonna forgot about the beautiful girl that broke my heart. I’m gonna move on, and live a fantastic life because I will it so. 

This was just a chapter of your life, and like all things it must end. I’m proud of myself, that I had the courage and did things I’ve never done before. Instead of thinking my life is over, I’m forcing myself to think that it’s just beginning. It’s better have loved and lost, than to have never loved at all.

I still remember that cafe I went to with Rene on a cold and quiet morning, I was waiting for coffee while staring at the droplets on the glass wall overlayed on top of the green shrubs outside. Further back, countless people were moving along with their lives, some in tailored suits and carrying leather briefcases, some pushing carts of street food. There was a lingering aroma of freshly baked pastries and coffee and Rene was quietly reading with that gentle look in his lovely eyes,  I propped my chin in one hand, wishing to myself to never leave. 

I still remember the way Medo face looked in the dim lights of the passing cars on the highway, and he held out his arms, and I just ran into him for a hug and buried my face in his chest, holding back tears. He was always afraid of being seen in public affectionately with another man, but he did it anyway, for me. Cars honked at us, but we didn't let go of each other. He looked a lot older since I first saw him three years ago, he must had a rough life, but that face, still so beautiful, yet it brought so much pain to me, that impermanence. 

I still remember the ten-minute walk to the college campus, under the canopy of trees, sunlight piercing through and dappling everything. If it's cold, I would put on a linen jacket. If it's early, the birds would perch and sing. 

Sadly, no matter how hard I look, there is not much beauty in the factory. 

Everything is gritty. From the infrastructure to the roads, and to the faces I see every day, to the uniform I wear, which I have gotten altered but still doesn't look quite right and always comes out fuzzy from the washing machine.

I am an artist at heart. I draw, paint, take photographs. At first, this environment was visually exciting. I loved the assembly lines and the metal railings and stairs and the way everyone bore stories as lines on their faces and stains on their uniforms and bump caps. But after four long months, nothing seems to change, and I can't seem to get inspired anymore. What was once charmingly rustic and quaint, is now just old and worn. 

These men, with their rough and sagging skin, in their round and large bump caps -- all look like ugly turtles. 

I can't recall how many times I have been harassed by the operators for no good reason. When I walk by, they would insult me or stare at me or get really close to me. A few of them spat on the ground when they saw me or make faces. 

I understand that interns are easy power-grabs, maybe it makes them feel good to gut me with no repercussions during a long day, but in the long run, what is the point?

If what happens to me instead happened to their own son or brother, I'm sure they would be angry, but they would never consider that. Well, to be fair, such hypocrisy and anger are to be expected from an abused and exploited class. 

I know there are nice operators, but it's like the Malay saying, one drop of indigo can ruin a barrel of milk. 

I'm just a visitor or a passenger, I never came here to stay and integrate or to make changes, I'm here simply to experience, and soon, I'll move on to better and bigger places. So if they like this place so much and want to protect it from me, then they can keep it. 

They can continue on smoking while group-squatting near that toilet drain, they can continue pushing each other while lining up for food like small children, and they can continue harassing any interns coming after me.

I am definitely not the last intern of my specific kind, that is a promise, that is a curse, that is also a blessing if you make it to be. "

I guess both of us weren’t expecting much when we started chatting on that godforsaken dating app. All you did was send me music recommendations and I listened to all of them during my internship. I was crazy enough to listen to Daft Punk’s whole discography in one sitting, huh? I still can’t believe I’m the only person you ended up talking to for a while. You were fun, interesting, sexy, and all that - I swear, it’s impossible for others not to see that. But then, you also weren’t my type in the first place and it took me a while to realize all of those.

Our friendship is shallow. I understand that you’re private as hell or maybe you think I don’t deserve some other personal information (yet). Maybe you also think I wouldn’t understand because there is just so much in the context and it’s hard when I’m on the other side of the world. You continued sending music and I still listened. We got to the point of sending sexts and all but nothing too much. Sent audio files and rarely called to hear each other’s voices. You streamed Jojo with me in a Rabbit room. I was so clingy that I didn’t even ask why you would stream Jojo again despite not actively watching it with me or knowing I can just watch it alone online.

At some point, we lost whatever spark we had but remained as friends. We’re still talking to each other almost everyday and it fucking hurt. In the first place, I know we can’t be together anyway and you didn’t want a long distance relationship. I also understand that we’re too different. I don’t really understand all the references you would make. I tried to stop talking to you for a week but I gave up after Day 2. I cannot resist talking to you. I got so attached but my consolation is knowing that even you would try to initiate the online interactions we have. I’m not the only one who wants the company of the other. Or at least I hope.

I’m back on dating apps and was asking how to be as charming as you are. You said no, you don’t want to be a cuck or whatever. Knowing how sexual and flirty you are, I am pretty sure you’re in touch with girls who are actually near your location. But boy do I wish that you really liked me that way. I know our distance and differences are a huge obstacle for our potential to be something intimately special to each other but I am still so infatuated for you.

I don’t want to say I’m in love. Attached, maybe but not in love. I don’t want to compare you to other people I meet in person or on dating apps but you’re so different. You’re the one I want the most. It’s impossible and in reality, you don’t feel the same way as I do but I can’t help having the feelings I have for you now. It’s been four months of constantly chatting and I just don’t want to lose you. You are not the one replaceable - it’s me. I hope I don’t lose you anytime soon.

I love you, at the very least as a friend. That seems unrealistic, unreasonable, or just too cheesy for you to hear but it’s true. I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you so much. You’re a piece of shit and I love you anyway. 

I hope I find the courage to let you go as much as you do if it were the way around. Or am I putting myself down so much? I can’t ask because I don’t want to annoy you on your birthday lmao. Maybe I shouldn’t ask at all. Anyway, I love you, Charlie. I’m always wishing you the best. Happy birthday.

Please, forgive my english, it isn't my native language.

I Just need an advice on my situation. During my summer internship, I met this girl (who was also an intern) and we quickly became friends and started hanging out outside of the company. She was kinda flirty but in a playful way an we used to tease (romantically) each other quite a lot. At the end of my internship, I moved out to another city for my studies but we kept contact through texting and snapchat.

I came back today, just to see a few friends and why not, see her again and she eagerly accepted to take a drink with me. I accompanied her to the train station after that, since she takes the train every evening after work to get home. After a bit of the usual teasing on the station platform, I finally confessed my feelings for her, trying very hard not to sound too intense and dramatic (casual ""I like you""). Her behaviour changed radically anyway, like she suddenly couldn't hold eye contact with me, and she was playing with a pebble on the ground with the tip of her feet to evade my gaze. She reciprocated (I think ?) but in a very ambiguous way like : ""I like you too, you know my feelings for you bla bla but I like to take things slow and besides it's a bit complicated with my ex"". And with that we said good evening to each other and she hopped on her train.

Question is : how to proceed from now ? She phrased her response in such a way that i'm not sure whether she's timidly open to dating or if it is a very soft rejection. I don't want to insist too much as I don't want to pressure her and kill the vibe. Should I wait for her to come back to me or should I be more proactive ? I'm really inexperienced with this kind of stuff and any advice will be welcome."

We've always been struggling financially and has been under the CA Medi-Cal and Section 8 Housing assistance program for a couple of years now.  My dad's job does not offer any health benefits.  I am not completely informed in terms of the policy and requirements of the Medi-Cal &amp; Section 8 Housing.  I did contact the agencies that are in charge of the program but received some relatively mediocre answers regarding my situation.

My question: I will be temporarily interning part-time soon for 4 months and should make around $8-12k for the whole duration depending on how many hours I put in.  My main concern is losing my Medi-Cal insurance.  I'm worried that my income will affect my parents Medi-Cal eligibility because I am under their plan and that they will not be able to receive assistance because of this temporary change.  I have considered purchasing insurance but considering that my internship is part-time I will not be able to afford it once it ends.  Plus the coverage for my parents is not as great as Medi-Cal's.  Their health is not the best so I do not wish to risk having mediocre coverage and ending up with a hefty bill if something were to happen.

I am also uncertain as to how the change will affect our Section 8 Housing assistance program.  Considering the high rent price in my area, I don't think my family can afford the rent if our Section 8 Housing Assistance ended.  Plus, my internship is temporary.  I have consulted to my parents about this but they're not too sure either since we're immigrants and have only been here for so long and English is not their forte.  If you have any information regarding this, please let me know.  Thank you in advance.

This happened during the last year of my high school stay. Had my elementary in a private school, high school a public one, and college a semi. High school was 100% scholarship and college at 50%. High school was considered like a state university wherein students are public scholars. Very few passed the admission test and I was very lucky to be included from the list. If I would say the required average grade per subject for admission, it would be very east to find which school I was in and ofcourse my identity. But comparing this with the American grading system, we were required to have a B average and thus should be maintained throughout the year. Failure to meet this requirement would lead to termination of scholarship. This is one of the reasons why I was able to be accepted to this well-respected school. A lot of higher students had failed that opened the opportunity for a larger number of freshman to be admitted that year. The school also only accepts freshman. Average graduated student count would be 1 class(30 students). Our batch was not one of the lucky ones since we started with 5classes and graduated with 2. When we were in freshman, 1class consists of 40students. Our school was poor nevertheless, poor environment condition and school facilities, poor students and professors. School has even accepted internship for the professors. Those last days, we were just enjoying the company of our classmates. Stayed late, even when we were not required for practices to prepare for the big day. Our batch was so dedicated, I was proud the song we made was of quality. And with those last days, the experiences did not end.

I guess only 5students stayed, still waiting for the professor. She was still computing our grades from the last periodical exam. This would be crucial since we may still fail and not graduate from this school. The other students took a break and we were only 2 altogether. I was with my classmate, let's call her M. Don't worry much if I was always with girls because I'm also one. And so maybe, she was not that comfortable if she became alone so she follows me anywhere I go. I was just wondering around, lusting for the little remaining time we could still stay there. Something caught my eye. We were at the fourth floor since we're in the fourth year and there was a room we never used. It was a laboratory and I've only seen it open once. The strange thing was, a very mild object was moving. I cannot see what it was since I forgot my glasses inside the room. I got closer to the door together with M. We were confused. Nobody than us were at the building and the padlock at the door was swinging. It was swinging like a pendulum, there is friction and the motion ofcourse as expected should weaken the swinging. But it didn't. We looked at each other and waited for a minute. Nobody was talking. We just stayed their confused and observing as to what would happen next. Then I got bored. Am I really seeing this with someone? I looked at her again, she's real and we were both awake. Then I got an idea. I held the padlock for a good 15secs. I looked at her, asking for her to witness and confirm this event was happening. Just wanted to put it to rest. And when I released the padlock, I didn't want to believe it anymore. It moved like the distance it covered when we first saw it. We run for our lives and whenever I saw her again during our friends birthday party, I would ask her if she remembered. And she did. I wouldn't ask any further. The thing that stayed with me is, if it was a ghost or any paranormal it was not aggressive. It was constantly moving, no other force was affecting it. I think that was a Saturday and when Monday came, I checked it was no longer moving. It didn't move anytime for the rest of my stay there."

- - -

Nobody really *expects* the unexpected. No matter what your daily routine is, the terms always seem to change on you. Wether it be finding a winning lottery ticket on the ground, meeting someone new for the first time, getting robbed in an alleyway... or getting caught up in a museum robbery between two international superheroes and a couple of terrorists. That’s always fun, right?

Totally not what I was expecting when I brought my little brother to the museum. Poor kid broke his arm on the school playground and wanted to go outside after mom practically jailed the kid in his room. Told him he needed to rest or it would never heal, and as inclined as I was to agree with her... well, the poor kid was miserable. What was I supposed to do, ditch him at home? Poor kid couldn’t even pick up a game controller to pass the time. It was horrible.

That’s why, on a sunny Autumn morning, I decided to take little Timmy to the Overwatch Memorial Museum. I figured he’d get his fill, run around, get yelled at for climbing on Rocketman’s rusty armor again, and we’d go home, right? Except, yeah. That whole thing about the unexpected and what-not. Glass shattered, bullets flew all over the place (except for the gorilla, who mostly swung his fists), and... well, that’s all I remember of the actual fight. I kinda spent the majority of it staring at purple and gold latex-clad butts, and then one of those butts started coming towards my hiding place, and *then* I panicked. Next thing I know, I’m putting on some antique mechanical fist and telling knockoff Spider-Girl to eat shit.

Well, I guess the one in the gold spandex (Tracer, I learned her name was, then Lena later on) kinda figured out where my eyes were the entire time, because when I emptied my pockets a week later for laundry day I found an interesting surprise in my pockets... and when I say *interesting,* I’m more or less saying *earth-shattering, rock-my-world, mind-blowing development,* because apparently during the fight— yes, *during,* I can see Winston in the background— she found time to duck into cover, take a picture of her bare tits, write down her number, and sneak it into my pocket. Of course I called right away. Or... well, right after a handful of panic attacks and acting out a couple of worst-case scenarios in my head. But I did call!

I wish I could tell you the exact conversation. Word for word, each breathy, teasing syllable. Unfortunately, I was too busy trying to keep myself from falling apart to focus on much of the conversation. In all fairness, I probably sounded like a complete tool. Just a lot of bubbly-sounding ‘uh-huh’ and ‘yep’ noises. But out of the entire conversation, I remember two things: the address she told me to meet her at, and the cutesy kissing noise she made at the end. And, no, you don’t get the address.

After that, the next nine months kind of blur. We fucked on a regular basis, sometimes as equal, sometimes as a sub and dom. A couple months after that, we started going on actual dates. I learned she was in town on a terror watch, and that Lena had a girlfriend back in London (who she swore up and down was cool with her having another boyfriend). She learned a lot about... well, school. I don’t think I’m super interesting, but she very *passionately* disagreed.

Just as fast as she came, she left. That’s the one thing I really remember the clearest. March sixteenth, Lena said she had important business and would get in touch soon. I figured that would mean a few days, or maybe weeks. By the time the last week of school rolled around, I was starting to panic. Did she find someone else? She certainly didn’t seem super loyal to her girl in London. Was I just tripping balls or something the whole time? *Was my life naught but a lie, plugged in to the matrix as my body was drained to power a mechanized race?*

Apparently not. Just as I was about to spiral into tinfoil hat conspiracies in my school desk, I got an email from an address I’d never seen before. “oxtonfree69@overwatch.net.” Of course I opened it in a heartbeat, and I closed it just as fast when tits flashed across my screen. Once I got over that scare and made it to the bathroom, I opened it a second time. Inside were three things: A picture of Lena, knuckles deep in her cunt, a two way ticket to Switzerland, and a long letter that began, “Congratulations on your acceptance into the Overwatch Internship Program...”

- - -

So, just shy of ten paragraphs condensed into a small synopsis: Lena gave Brian (the kid in the blue hoodie) her phone number. Booty calls turned into an actual relationship between the fifteen year old kid and the twenty-six year old woman. After dropping off the map for a couple months, she resurfaces in Switzerland for the reformation of OW, offering Brian an internship for the summer where he builds up a harem of Overwatch women.

I would play Brian in this game. He’s fifteen years old (we can go younger if you want), neck-deep in horny teenager hormones, and can’t believe his luck. You would play the various women of Overwatch, as well as the world around them.

I have no limits, but I’ll respect yours.

9tumhd,3,2018-11-03,Best extracurriculars to do in November and December?,Shapwan,GetIntoStanford,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetIntoStanford/comments/9tumhd/best_extracurriculars_to_do_in_november_and/,"  

Hello everyone, 

As the title states, what kinds of ECs could I do this November and December to boost my application? 

For a little background on my past extracurriculars - I'm an international student currently in my senior year of high school. I spent my junior year in the USA as an exchange student, as part of a high school scholarship sponsored by the US Department of State - 29 students got selected for this program from my country, out of over 800 applicants. I got placed in Oakland, California, and during my exchange year I was able to take part in things such as:

Civic Education Workshop: Week-long program in Washington DC, again sponsored by the Dept. of State - 100 students got selected out of 400 current exchange students that applied - we toured the national mall, met with state representatives, etc,

Tech Hive: 10 week-long STEM internship at Lawrence Hall of Science, UC Berkeley,

... amongst other activities, including volunteering, high school soccer team (champions), etc., but the ones mentioned above would be the most notable.

I wanted use these 2 months to further boost my extracurriculars because I feel like on the academic side of things, I did well but not AMAZING – nothing that stands out too much. My high school here doesn’t have AP classes, and the high school I attended in the US was a small charter school – other than AP Stats, I didn’t have other options.

Thanks and any help would be appreciated!"

### Andrew Gillum staffer Shelby Shoup was arrested and charged with battery after going on a profanity-laced tirade, throwing chocolate milk on Florida State University College Republicans, and kicking over the sign of Republican Florida gubernatorial candidate Ron DeSantis.

**Shoup is a Communist and Andrew Gillum supporter.**

**The video is very disturbing — These people are ignorant and unhinged and want to lead this country.**

**The violence of these Democrats is just insane.**
   
[FOX News](https://www.foxnews.com/us/gillum-intern-arrested-in-florida-for-throwing-chocolate-milk-at-college-republicans) reported:

An intern for Democratic Florida gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum has been arrested and charged with battery for throwing chocolate milk on College Republicans tabling on campus before she kicked Gillum’s opponent Republican Ron DeSantis’ sign out of the ground.

The far-left student activist who had the profanity-laced meltdown, Shelby Shoup, is listed as an intern for the Andrew Gillum for Florida Governor Campaign on LinkedIn and a member of FSU Students for Justice in Palestine. Gillum’s campaign did not return a Fox News request for comment.

A portion of the profane exchange with the College Republicans on campus was caught on camera.

Shoup threw her drink on SFU College Republicans Vice-Membership Chair, Daisy Judge, and when another student passing by tried to de-escalate the situation, she threw the remainder of her drink on him, according to a statement released by the College Republicans at FSU.

“You are supporting Nazis,” Shoup said in the video posted online. “Do you understand that?”

&amp;#x200B;

**PART 1 -WCW MONDAY NITRO 12/11/1995**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

1: EDDIE GUERRERO VS MR JL

&amp;#x200B;

Well... This is how you make an opening match feel important. Neither man gets entrances, and the match just randomly starts as BACKGROUND NOISE during commentary's pre-amble. I HOPE THIS HELPS YOU THINK THE CRUISERWEIGHTS ARE A VITAL PART OF WCW! Jerry Lynn vs Eddie Guerrero is one of those matches that GWF fans in the early 90's would have been salivating at the mouth over if they could have seen it (much like they did Lynn's incredible matches against the Lightning Kid, aka Shawn “1-2-3 Kid/Xpac” Waltman were back in the day), but how does it play out in 1995? Pretty damn good, it turns out! It lacks the intensity of an Eddie/Benoit match, or the technical exhibition of a Malenko vs Anybody match, but this is still two guys who can \*\*\*\*ing GO, giving us a fast paced match where both guys are combining lucha and American wrestling to create something custom built to hype up the crowd. It's also during this match where commentary delves into the cool thing with Japanese wrestlers I've been hinting at over the past few weeks: at Starrcade, a huge chunk of the PPV will be dedicated to the WORLD CUP OF WRESTLING! Unlike the WWE's version of the World Cup, this isn't 8 Americans competing in a tournament over in (NAME OF COUNTRY REDACTED), but rather a series of 7 matches featuring WCW wrestlers vs New Japan talent! Sadly it's one of those things that sounds better on paper than it does in practice due to the poor execution of several of the matches, because WCW, but still, it's awesome that they even paid off something as random as “a bunch of Japanese guys sitting at a table like a month and a half ago” at all, and it was definitely beyond awesome to see old school NJPW talent featured on a mainstream North American wrestling PPV. Anyhow, back to the match, the finish is one of those things that feels anticlimactic, but is also awesome in that it helps make it look like a wrestler can win a match without hitting their finishing move. If you've seen any Eddie match, you're probably familiar with those sequences where he and his opponent will trade pinfall attempts, right? Well, this finish here comes in the MIDDLE of one of those. Eddie just counts a jacknife pin by flipping JL over and pinning him Sitout Powerbomb style. Pro wrestling honestly needs more finishes like this, so we're conditioned to expect that ANY pin could be the win, and might actually start buying into false finishes again.

&amp;#x200B;

**RESULTS**: Guerrero def. JL via pinfall

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\-Lex Luger and Jimmy Hart join Mean Gene at the entrance ramp for an interview, largely centered around Hart and Luger claiming that Lex is the uncrowned World champion. You see, he's beaten Savage once, and might have beaten him last week if it wasn't for Hogan coming in and pushing a \*\*\*\*ing referee over, and he's kinda got a point here. He also puts over the Triangle Match at Starrcade, his friendship with Sting, and most importantly, he refers to Ric Flair as an “eleven time Wubbleyou CW Champion”. NAILED IT!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

2: DISCO INFERNO VS “MR WONDERFUL” PAUL ORNDORFF

&amp;#x200B;

Talk about an old school kinda match! Here we have a guy who was a big star in the early 80's against a guy who's fashion sensibility and music are out of the 70's! Ahem... Not much of a match here sadly, even though both guys are probably quite underrated in their own ways (Orndorff could still work well for a guy at his age, and Disco is honestly a much better worker than he ever gets credit for), they barely get more than a couple of minutes, and while I can't say this is the case for certain, I get the feeling that it might be for some sad reasons. You see, we didn't know it at the time, but Paul was on the tail end of his career here, and this would actually be his last match until 2000. And THAT match ended by ref stoppage when he injured his neck throwing a Piledriver, and was pretty much the end of his career as a worker aside from a random 6 man tag he worked in 2017. But yeah, essentially, during his time in the WWF in the 80s, while he was feuding with Hogan, he injured his neck, that led to some... I believe nerve damage, and by the end of 1995, the muscles on the right side of his body were beginning to atrophy. For what it's worth, although this is a sad bit of wrestling history, there are still three small, silver linings to the dark cloud to be found: (1) WCW didn't mercilessly fire him, as they did to both British Bulldog and Waltman when they were injured, but rather kept him on as a trainer and agent, a role he stayed in right until the end; (2) For all intents and purposes, this was to be Orndorff's retirement match, so he made damn sure to have fun with it, going for the most RIDICULOUS long winded dance before landing an elbow drop. That sh\*t made the People's Elbow look like Big Show's punch in terms of efficiency! (3) Despite the pro wrestling tradition of jobbing someone out when they were on their way out, not only does Mr Wonderful pick up the win here, he does so with authority, dropping Disco right on his \*\*\*\*ing head with an All Japan style Backdrop Driver. Bonus points to Orndorff for putting one foot up on the ropes for cheaty leverage, even though he probably could have pinned DI with one \*\*\*\*ing finger after that!

&amp;#x200B;

**RESULTS**: Orndorff def. Disco via pinfall

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\-Another Mean Gene interview segment follows this, with the Four Horsemen this time. Well, Benoit's not with them, so... with the Non-Shoot Murderers of the Four Horsemen I guess? This is actually a pretty important interview in many ways, even though it didn't seem it at the time, for two reasons: (1) as we'll see in a moment, this serves as the angle that would write Orndorff off of tv and really put the Horsemen over as a devastating unit in the process; (2) this is also where we see the genesis of the Loose Cannon gimmick that Pillman would adopt for the rest of his career/life. This is mostly just Pillman rambling in very stream of consciousness style, until he has some not so nice things to say about Orndorff, how Paul was Horseman material, but decided to ride with Gary Spivey and the Psychic Companion's Network instead, which was pretty hilarious. Orndorff comes out to run Pillman down for not being Horsemen material, Pillman slaps Orndorff, and both Arn and Flair make the save when things get physical. This culminates with Flair and Anderson planting Orndorff with a SPIKE PILEDRIVER ON THE \*\*\*\*ING CONCRETE FLOOR, because “the Horseman might have broken a guy's neck” is probably a better reason for writing him off of tv than “the muscles in my right arm and leg are shrinking because of an injury from the 80's”. Awesome, awesome stuff here though, even if it's happening for pretty sad reasons. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

3: LEX LUGER (W/ JIMMY HART) VS HACKSAW JIM DUGGAN

&amp;#x200B;

Speaking of “pretty sad”, this match! The legit highlight of this one was seriously every moment they cut away from the match to show EMT's dealing with Orndorff and his selling of a possibly broken neck. Lots of bad 80's WWF style punches, and... Yeah, just that. This is also the genesis of Duggan's long term gimmick of SUPER CHEATER! Okay, so remember how he had that Taped Fist Match with Big Bubba at World War 3? Here, he's beating Luger pretty handily (bonus points to Luger for bumping his ass off, by the way, I swear, he's a better worker than he ever gets credit for as well), and then randomly reaches into his tights to pull out a ROLL OF TAPE! How?!?!?! Why?!?!?! Where?!?!?!?! Why?!?!?!?! Seriously, Duggan's wrestling in short speedos, where the \*\*\*\* does he even fit a roll of tape in there? Is his d\*ck some kind of office supply holder? Anyhow, cheating ass Duggan wraps tape (which gives him SUPER PUNCH POWERS remember) around his fist in the middle of the match, so Hart gets up on the apron with Jim's own 2x4 to try and distract him. Jim is essentially Charlie from Flowers For Algernon (before the experiment to make him a genius, the version that had an IQ of 68) trapped in the body of Ray Jackson from Bloodsport, so he falls for it, forgets he's in a wrestling match, and goes over to deal with the scrawny non-wrestle guy. This allows Luger to sneak up behind him, forearm him in the back of the head, driving his forehead into the 2x4 (which the ref sees but does nothing about, because WCW), and Torture Rack him for the win. Who else but The Intern would use a hybrid of classic American literature and cheesy 80's martial arts movie to describe a pro wrestler?

&amp;#x200B;

**RESULTS**: Luger def. Duggan via submission

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\-Oh hey, World champion Randy Savage gets to show up without Hogan running in to demand a title shot because he is the most screwed wrestler of our era! Savage has quite a busy itinerary over the next few weeks, as he has two matches at Starrcade - a World Cup match against Hiroyoshi Tenzan, and then a World title match against whoever wins the Triangle Match - as WELL as a title defense against The Giant next week. The latter match is where his mind remains focused for now, and he's pretty confident in his ability to get the win. Even though one Chokeslam put him into a \*\*\*\*ing coma last week.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

4: ***MAIN EVENT*** \- RIC FLAIR AND ARN ANDERSON VS HULK HOGAN AND STING

&amp;#x200B;

Hooboy... Okay, so this match is set up by commentary as a real “BUT CAN THEY CO-EXIST?!?!?!” thing like this were the modern day WWE, and go into FULL ON DISMAY MODE over Sting and Hogan coming out separately. CLEARLY THIS MEANS THEY CAN'T TRUST EACH OTHER! The funny thing is, they actually work pretty well as a team here, so commentary is largely just pulling this storyline out of their asses! Hogan is about as infuriating as you'd expect here, in that he'll sell for Flair, but is ABSOLUTELY willing to let Arn look like a \*\*\*\*ing chump by not selling anything he does, because creating match drama and making your opponent look credible is for p\*ssies, amirite?!?!?! Thank Gawd that Sting winds up working a huge chunk of the match, it makes this much more enjoyable both from a workrate perspective AND a “willing to make his opponents look good” standpoint! And then randomly, Jimmy Hart and Luger comes out, and despite the sounds of fighting happening on the floor AND Hart yelling a lot, the ref doesn't notice Luger attacking Hulk AND putting him in the Torture Rack. Apparently the ref saw Hart get up on the apron, and even though Jimmy has nothing to do with the Horsemen, decided “THIS IS ON THE LEVEL, I BETTER GO TALK TO THE SCRAWNY GUY INSTEAD OF SEEING IF THE DUNGEON OF DOOM GET INVOLVED!” Naturally, he's back at 100% HP by the time the hot tag attempt is made, but OH GAWD, is this one of the funniest hot tags I've seen in some time! After working the knee a bunch, Flair traps Sting in the Figure Four. And in the Horsemen's corner at that, so Arn can pull his arms for leverage. Unfortunately he makes the same mistake that he made at World War 3 - slapping Sting in the face and sending him into a no sell berzerker frenzy. Sting somehow damages Flair's leg by thrusting his own hips up, which... is absolutely not how a Figure 4 works, and then makes his way towards his own corner to make the tag by SCOOTING ON HIS ASS BACKWARDS LIKE A DOG! HAHAHAHAHA, love it! The best part? THE REF DIDN'T EVEN SEE THE TAG because Arn came in and distracted the ref! Love that even more! Sting goes into another no sell frenzy once Flair starts chopping his chest, but he's such a pro that it's not a COMPLETE no sell. He acts like Flair's chops aren't hurting him, sure, but he still remembers to sell the leg as he advances. I've been saying this about a lot of wrestlers tonight but man, even though I don't think anyone says Sting was a bad worker, I think even HE is better than he gets credit for. Compare that to Hogan, who finally gets in after Sting basically tags in by diving into him (which the commentary team puts over as some kind of miscommunication that'll cost them, because of COURSE THEY DO), gets Spinebuster'd by Arn (right onto the back that was injured by a Torture Rack), “sells” is by having one small spasm on the mat, and then SPRINGING RIGHT BACK TO HIS \*\*\*\*ING FEET, AS IF HE TOOK 0 DAMAGE, AND WHY THE \*\*\*\* DID ANY OF US EVER LIKE THIS ORANGE D\*CKBAG?!?!?! Anyhow, you know how it goes. Big Boot for Arn, Big Boot for Flair, Big Leg Drop for Arn, and Hogan wins in 3 \*\*\*\*ing moves. And I guess proves that he and Sting CAN co-exist, despite the narrative laid out by the announce team.

&amp;#x200B;

**RESULTS**: Hogan and Sting def. Flair and Anderson (Hogan pinned Anderson)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\-Post-match, Pillman hits the ring and takes Sting out, allowing a Damned Numbers Game assault to occur. Luger comes out and saves Sting from a Pillman assault, but chooses NOT to help Hogan. Savage comes out, and I don't know if he missed his cue or what, because by the time he hits the ring, it's empty besides Sting, he spins Sting around to... I don't know what he was going to do, Sting just stares at him for like 2 seconds then PUNCHES Savage FOR NO \*\*\*\*ING REASON! He acts dismayed about it, like “OH SH\*T, I DIDN'T MEAN TO PUNCH THAT GUY”, which makes me think that Savage was supposed to be in the ring earlier, while Sting was punching people, but nope, this just makes it look like Sting INTENTIONALLY punched Savage and randomly feels bad for it, because reasons? Mean Gene gets into the ring to try to sort this out, and Sting's explanation was basically “I was fighting people, and hit you on accident, sorry”, but THAT IS ABSOLUTELY NOT WHAT HAPPENED, which again, makes me think Savage was supposed to be in the ring when Sting was actually throwing punches at people. Still, for the first time in what feels like ever, all three guys let cooler heads prevail, and logically decide “Hey, we're all friends, we shouldn't be fighting”, and if the WWE let their babyfaces come to these kind of conclusions, I mightn't be so much of a heel homer when watching modern wrestling. Though based on what I know of Hogan the character AND the words he said, I am 99% sure that he only wants peace because he's on probation and knows he'll punch another ref if officials have to come out and break up a fight.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**PART 2 -WWE MONDAY NIGHT RAW 12/11/1995**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\-Note: this is the go home show for In Your House 5, I thought I'd mention it here because if you look at the matches we're getting tonight, you'd never \*\*\*\*ing know that this was the last push for a PPV.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

1: OWEN HART (W/JIM CORNETTE, YOKOZUNA, AND MR FUJI) VS JEFF HARDY

&amp;#x200B;

And yes, this is indeed THE Jeff Hardy! Here not only is he a jobber, but he looks like a 17 year old because... well, because he WAS a 17 year old; he had gotten his original gig jobbing for the WWF in May of 1994, when he was 16, as a stand in for a dude who backed out last minute, and lied about his age in order to get the job. Anyhow, as far as jobber squashes go, this is pretty fantastic. Hardy gets to showcase basic pro wrestling competence, and does so at a crisp pace that probably had Vince thinking “he's working too fast, where are the slow punches and chinlocks damnit?”, and Owen looks like he's \*\*\*\*ing MURDERING him with every bit of offense he delivers. This might be one of the most inhumane things I've ever typed, but there's something about watching established stars brutalizing guys they probably won't ever see again (or at least not for a long time) and who often don't even belong in the same ring as them that I sorely miss about the modern product. It's pretty much why one of my favorite matches ever on 205 Live was just 3 moves long, but Drew Gulak looked like he was BRUTALIZING his jobber foe with each of those. The finish is pretty awesome too, as it's basically just “Owen being a cocky d\*ck”. After hitting a Lariat that lands so hard, it makes Hardy do a Shooting Star Press to nothing, and then a big Missile Dropkick, Owen teases the Sharpshooter, realizes that he's got the match anyway, and just condescendingly flips into a Jacknife Pin to finish him instead. How tremendous is that, basically being “This guy isn't even worth using my finisher on”?!?!?! 

&amp;#x200B;

**RESULTS**: Owen def. Hardy via pinfall

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\-Post-match, Yokozuna comes into the ring and \*\*\*\*ing CRUSHES Hardy's Everything bones with a Bonzai Drop. And THEN Owen decides hey, maybe I WILL lock in the Sharpshooter now. However, Diesel, who had been watching the match backstage, HAS HAD ENOUGH, because he's a GOOD GUY damnit! Even though the last time we saw him he was... you know... cutting a heel promo... Diesel somehow manages to run from backstage all the way to the ring without tearing his quads, Owen takes off, and Diesel takes Yokozuna off of his feet and out of the ring with a Big Boot, and we end the segment with a guy who wasn't in the match's music playing, because WWF. Bonus points to Nash for consistency though, as he makes his way back to the entrance ramp, he proves he's a man of his word and only slaps hands with fans that purchased WWF Diesel Black Gloves and were wearing them. Who knew that this was just an early, less tongue and cheek version of “BUY THE SHIRT!” from one of the earlier nWo vignettes?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

2: CHAPARITA ASARI VS AJA KONG

&amp;#x200B;

Hey, it's two of those Joshi ladies from Survivor Series! Much like the first match, this is a jobber squash but HOLY SH\*T is it awesome! Asari starts out with a small bit of offense but apparently thinks she's on the 21st century indies scene, it's the most flippy sh\*t possible just to land two moves. The rest of the match is just Kong BEATING THE LIVING P\*SS, SH\*T, AND POSSIBLY OTHER bodily fluids out of her with extreme prejudice, and refusing to win the match at her earliest convenience. Like seriously, she winds up planting Asari into the mat with a Kevin Steen style Package Piledriver (IN 1995!!!!), gets two, then goes “NOPE” and pulls Asari's shoulder up so she could deliver more punishment. Asari gets the chance to mount a comeback after a whiffed Diving Headbutt, opts to try the FASTEST looking Sky Twister Press I think I've ever seen, but oops, she ALSO whiffs, and Kong finally picks her up, and figuratively takes her head off with the Uraken (which looks like it might have broken Asari's nose; it was definitely bleeding after the match) for the win. Holy sh\*t, I've always really liked Aja Kong, but I might have to go back and watch a bunch more of her matches now. She's no Bull Nakano, but she's up there. Note: this match still managed to be great despite the fact that both Vince AND Lawler spent the whole thing basically going “LOL Kong is fat and/or ugly” throughout it. \*\*\*\*ing wow.

&amp;#x200B;

**RESULTS**: Kong def. Asari via pinfall

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\-Well, it's time to yet again try to dump a sh\*t ton of sympathy on Shawn Michaels, as Todd Petengill interviews him about his current health issues and status. Note: the reason this is a sympathy dump isn't because it's Shawn saying “Man, I want to be back to the ring, but the doctors say I'm not ready”, it's a sympathy dump because he has to talk to \*\*\*\*ing Petengill. He also kinda kills a lot of the sympathy this segment is supposed to be building by being a COMPLETE COCKY DOUCHE about it. “The doctors say my brain isn't well, but I don't care about that because \*\*\*\* authority!” Not his exact words of course, but holy sh\*t... It's no wonder that so many of us only started liking the guy when he stopped being Mr “THE BOYHOOD DREAM!”, and started channeling his real life attitude, showing his asshole and pantomiming blowjobs on tv, and humping Canadian flags in the middle of the ring.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

3: AHMED JOHNSON VS SOME JOBBER

&amp;#x200B;

Jobber squash #3 in a row, holy \*\*\*\*! The first two were kind of hidden gems, matches that were way better than they had any rights to be, and squashes I would actually recommend to anyone over most of what we saw on Nitro this week. This match is... Well, it was too short to be memorable, but was also super brutal (in a good way) and kinda fun to watch as a result. It's basically just Ahmed letting the jobber get a few free shots on him, no selling the blows, firing back with some SUPER stiff shots of his own, before hitting two of the least graceful Spinebusters you'll ever see, and the Pearl River Plunge. I'm pretty sure that the pre-recorded Dean Douglas “I'm going to beat you at IYH” promo that played during the intro was longer than this match.

&amp;#x200B;

**RESULTS**: Johnson def. Jobber via pinfall

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\-Okay, this next segment features two things I love on a super ironic level; (1) for some reason, the WWE Network version includes commercials for 1995 toys in it, including KARATE FIGHTERS, and Wrestlemania The Arcade Game. AKA: That game that was basically Mortal Kombat without blood that had pro wrestlers in it. (2) Jerry Lawler trying to get a word with Johnson! “Douglas told me that the toughest four years of your life were the 3rd grade” was a pretty choice burn on Jerry's part, I'm not even going to front. Also choice was Ahmed saying what I THINK was “I'm not a man of words”, because holy sh\*t, that is ABSOLUTELY the truth, and him being unable to pronounce his foe's name, calling him DING DOUGLAS! DING! HAHAHAHAHA! Ahmed with a microphone is the gift that keeps on giving. I love The Room on an ironic level but holy sh\*t, Ahmed makes Tommy Wiseau sound like Patrick Stewart by comparison!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\-Now it's Vince's turn to conduct an in ring interview, with Ted DiBiase, Sycho Sid (please let Sid talk, please let Sid talk...), and the 1-2-3 Kid. All three guys pretty much just cut promos straight up putting over their upcoming match at IYH, and run down their opponents (Razor Ramon and Marty Jannetty), but it involves Sid screaming incoherently and stumbling over his words a lot, so I give it an overall thumbs up for that alone. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

4: ***MAIN EVENT***: BOB BACKLUND VS BRET HART

&amp;#x200B;

On a night featuring Owen Hart, stiff squash matches, and Joshi wrestling, we cap things off with a technical masterclass. Did I \*\*\*\*ing write this show and wasn't aware of it?!?!?! The only gripe I have about this one is that early on, we go picture in picture so Lawler can go interview Bret's sister/Bulldog's wife Diana about the Hart/Bulldog match, and woof, what a waste of time! Gawd bless her, she tries to answer simple questions, but her ability to talk on the mic makes 1995 Bret sound like 1997 Bret by comparison. Or the insensitive version of that joke is, she makes 21st century stroked out Bret sound like 1997 Bret by comparison. Luckily, the match is a good 10+ minutes long, so this cutaway is only such a minute part of it, and we still get to watch most of a real technical masterclass built around Backlund trying to setup the Crossface Chicken Wing every chance he gets, and Bret being savvy enough to avoid it every time. Okay, actually I lied, I have a second gripe with this one and it's the stupid overbooked finish, with some possible mistiming. After a lot of slow, grinding holds being applied to him, Hart is able to mount a comeback, hit his Five Moves of Doom, and start to lock in the Sharpshooter, but the British Bulldog runs into the ring. Hart forgets he's in a wrestling match (like so much modern WWE) and runs over to have a staredown with his brother-in-law, which allows Backlund the chance to FINALLY sneak in his Crossface Chicken Wing, and then... the bell rings? The \*\*\*\*? The match is called off as a DQ, and sure, Bulldog DID start kicking Hart while he was locked in the hold, but the bell went off before Bulldog even touched Bret, so yeah. WWE babyface bias at its finest, I guess. We go off the air with Bret being stuck in that CCW for way longer than I ever would, because no kidding, that moves hurts for real, a fact that Bret griped about in his book.

&amp;#x200B;

**RESULTS**: Bret def. Backlund via sh\*tty DQ

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

***TV RATINGS:*** Nitro def. Raw 2.6 - 2.5. Very close race here, despite the fact that both shows were very different in content. Raw had very little of consequence or importance happen, but holy sh\*t, the wrestling on it was WAY above their usual average standards. It made for a pretty sh\*tty go home show, but a fun hour all around. Nitro, on the other hand, basically peaked at the opening bout as far as match quality goes, but loaded the show with some pretty big angles as well. Looking at the numbers objectively, I guess I can extrapolate two things from this: (1) as much as we of the IWC love to extol match quality over all else (hell, I try not to be too IWC about what I do and yet even I base my highlights and lowlights solely on the matches), unless it's something exceptional or well built up, matches don't draw ratings like a good angle does; (2) As someone who preferred this week's Raw over Nitro, once again my perspective lands opposite of popular opinion, apparently. Which I am A-okay with.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

***HIGHLIGHT OF THE WEEK:*** Man, how weird is it that Raw was so loaded with enjoyable matches that an EDDIE GUERRERO match was only my 3rd or 4th favorite of the night? As much as I would love to give this to either of the Hart brothers' matches (because Bret/Backlund was the kind of technical bout I enjoy, and Owen Hart is the best, period), and as much as I hate to sound like I'm going Meltzer levels of jerking off over Japanese wrestling, yeah, I gotta give it to Kong/Asari because holy sh\*t... That was like watching a sanctioned mugging, filmed for public enjoyment. Plus, how many matches could you see in 1995 that feature both a Package Piledriver AND a Sky Twister Press? Hell, you can't even see that in 2018 outside of a PWG show, let ALONE in 1995!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

***LOWLIGHT OF THE WEEK:*** If you ever wanted to hear me say something actually nice about Duggan, this is your opportunity right now: his match with Luger was so bad that it made me NOT give a Hogan match the lowlight. Wait, did I say “something nice”? I think I meant “backhanded compliment”. The kind of backhanded compliment so stiff that I think it gave Asari another busted up nose.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

***NEXT WEEK:*** It's WWF In Your House 5! A night where a zombie mortician and a fat rapper who is also royalty try to put each other into a casket! A night where brother-in-laws square off for the World title! A night where exactly one match gets more than a \*1/2 rating! #PrayForIntern folks!

I am from a chinese family in the Philippines.
Dad, really proud person, a kind of person where if he cant enjoy, will try and ruin peoples day around him too. Super overprotective and evenjf i am  just gonna go with my friends to a nearby beach and drink, always says no no matter what. Every king of event leading me to go far from the city, simple outcome. no 
currently 20, never had a girlfriend until august 2018. Girlfriend is a filipino.

So ive known this girl since my medical internship july last year, I started approaching her and courting her then finally answered me.

A little about myself first
I am very concious and insecure. I tend to mentally panic and overthink a lot of shit going through my head, every possibility of something bad, I think it. And now i seriously dont know what to do and I keep thinking about what kinds of events that can happen if i go or no. 

So problem is

My gf is gonna graduate this month, I told my parents im gonna attend graduation. 
Dad says ""how about the dinner? You attending too?"" 
Me ""idk yet, probably since she already met mom and i havent met her parents"" 
Dad ""its still too early, dont go"" 
So this is where it starts, he starts saying too early for you to meet, you are showing to the mom you are planning on marrying her already, then if you get into a problem, you're gonna ask me for help? Im not. What happens when you dont like her already? Then the mom is gonna hate you, then what you gonna do? Anyways ill stop caring, do whatever you want. 

Then mom butts in ""too early, did you know when the girls relatives who are not financially stable know that you have money, they will not stop asking you for it. 


So I need opinions
For me though, I'm just speechless and now I cant stop my head from thinking every bad outcome if I go with the dinner or not.

I've known of trp for about 6 months now and decided to swallow the pill about 3 months ago after getting destroyed by my cheating oneitis that I dated for two years (From age 19 to 21). My life and what i'm doing has always been of high value. I'm an engineering student with an internship with one of the largest automotive companies. My oneitis had many shared hobbies that I dumped when the ltr to shit. Now that i'm single i've picked up lifting. I also hope to start bjj to gain some confidence and the ability to remain calm during confrontation. I've been lifting hard trying to lose weight and gain muscle. I'm 6'1, I started at 240lbs, i'm the same height but now i'm 220lbs. I've upped my bench from a laughable weight to semi-respectable amount that is 85lbs more. I also ditched a hair style I had for 10 years for something shorter to show off my face that is slowly getting thinner. 

Now that i'm starting to get the ground work in on building up my smv i'm wondering what else I can do to go from the level i'm at (4.5 to 5 depending on the day) and make it up to being a good 7 or 8. Anyone have any tips? I'd also like to hear from you guys and your pill swallowing stories as motivation, Thanks!"

The biggest problem I have is that they never stay in place. I'll give a department a boss, it'll give the employees the mood modifiers, but every time I check back the modifiers are gone. Shouldn't they be permanent?

The other thing is that not all people I put in the role give the 'has boss' modifier. Some will even give the 'good boss' modifier but not the 'has boss' modifier.

The final thing I'm confused about is that who the best boss is seems to be random. I assumed it would be staff with the most experience/qualifications and definitely those with the 'good boss' trait, but... no? They don't seem to have any reliable impact. When I noticed once that the person who gave the biggest mood boost was a random intern who didn't have the good boss trait I stopped trying to guess entirely and just started picking the boss by cycling through each person and comparing the mood changes on the staff list.

Is anyone else having any problems or know anything about this to help explain how it works?"

9tygm2,2,2018-11-03,Should I take internship offer with fed agency if I eventually want to do nonprofit work?,AnnualEmu,LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/9tygm2/should_i_take_internship_offer_with_fed_agency_if/,"I need some help deciding whether to accept a 2L internship with a federal agency. My dream job would be to work for an environmental nonprofit law firm such as NRDC, Earthjustice, or a similar organization. I want to work for an organization that aims for strong environmental protections because that is a cause I care about and I would like to use my career to advance it. 

1L summer I interned at an environmental clinic at another law school, so I got a foothold into environmental law and wanted to continue doing something similar as a 2L. I go to a T50 school and am at the twenty fifth percentile in my class. I don't do law review or moot court. I applied to several nonprofits I would love to work for. I got a few interviews, some of which went well, but no offers so far.

 I did get an offer to work for EPA though. The crux of my issue is that this job seems to put me on a track that doesn't lead directly to nonprofit work. It seems to put me on a track where if I take this job and do well, I may get an offer to work at the agency post-graduation. This thought is comforting (a path to a job!) but also seems not to be really what I set out to do, exactly. I am fine with changing my goals slightly -- I mean, I would be fine working for the gov't. I am wondering if working for a federal agency would be a place that could transition to nonprofit work later on in my career? 

Working for the government seems much less radical than working for a nonprofit and I'm not sure if this experience would help me on that path... I am posting here to see if anyone can help me. 

It is hard to talk to anyone about my career path because I feel like no one really understands what I want to do. Career services at my school says take the job I have and be happy about it -- I feel like none of the people in the office really understands my goal. At my school it feels like if you say you want to do public interest, they assume you want to work in legal services... Anyway, that's my situation. Thanks for any advice."

I intern for a local station in a Michigan city. Today, a photographer and I covered a rally for republican candidates. Now, I know what a lot of you may be thinking, *well, what did you expect?* 

I of course expected some sort of tension there, being that the crowds there are not so fond of the news. However, the fact that we were not only felt unwelcome, we were approached by a woman after the rally in the parking lot asking us “are you honest?” 

Before either one of us could say anything, she continued, “oh, of course you’re not. Fake news! Fake news!” The photographer that was with me said “we are always honest” and then quickly hopped into our news van. I couldn’t say anything in return out of anger and fear I might lose my internship. 

This rhetoric cuts deep, *real deep.* It isn’t some political gimmick anymore, it is seriously starting to affect all levels of journalism —even local. 

Even though I am angry, frustrated and sad, what happened today is only motivating me to be better and smarter. This country needs us now more than ever guys.

9tzc03,1,2018-11-03,I [19F] don't want my boyfriend [24M] to be professionally held back by our relationship,throwaway____48,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9tzc03/i_19f_dont_want_my_boyfriend_24m_to_be/,"My boyfriend and I are both still in university — He's finishing his master's thesis and I'm on the second year of my five year long integrated master's degree. 

We're both engineering majors in a field that lacks professionals in our country, so he's already got a couple job and internship offers from companies and professors alike.  The city we live in is a small University town without much of a local job market, so naturally all the offers are for work in cities at least two hours away. 

The only local thing he was offered so far was an internship with his advisor, which in all honesty is not the best he could go for by a far margin.

We ignored the topic of finding jobs after we were done with university for the first few months of our relationship. We simply didn't want to think about it as it seemed far away for both of us (he had barely started his thesis then) and we were just taking things one day at a time to see where our relationship would go. 

Now we've been together for almost a year, and his thesis defense is just looming around the corner. I know he'll do great and we're both excited about it, but it has rightfully brought up some talks about the future of our relationship. 

He says he wants to wait for me in the town we live in. I say that's outrageous and he shouldn't feel like he owes me anything like that. I'm still 3 and a half years away from finishing my course, I don't want him to be stuck in a place with a stagnant market for so long just so we can live in the same city. 

I've thought about trying to get my course transferred to a university in a larger city, but I'm an immigrant with a student visa and that entire process is much harder than it should be for someone like me. 

I would be fine with him living in a city a couple hours away because the train network in this country is great and I could definitely see ourselves taking trains every other Friday to spend the weekend at the other's town, but I haven't brought it up yet. 

I personally think he might be afraid of getting out of the town he was born in, leaving behind his family and stability, without someone by his side. Or maybe he wants to save up some money of his own before leaving so things will be easier when he finally does — he currently lives with his parents, which is way easier on one's finances than paying rent at a large city (it's very common to do that around here when you go to school in the same town you were born in). I'll definitely try to talk to him about it tomorrow.

He's already accepted a one year long internship that'll start right after he's done with his thesis, which is the reason I haven't yet brought up the train plan. I want to be excited about it with him, but I can't help but feel like I'm holding him back.

I also think our relationship is too young for him to be making these kinds of decisions with it in mind, as we've only been formally dating for the past 10 months. Although I appreciate the fact that he values our future together, I also feel it might be very naive of him to do so to that extent (or maybe I'm selfish for thinking that way).

I'm planning to try to encourage him to look for jobs in other cities next year, but I'm not sure how to (or if I should) go about it. Maybe after our relationship is over an year old he'll feel more comfortable about living away. 

Also, it might be relevant: he's in no way acting like him staying in this city is a favor to me, he just states that he wants to be by my side. 

I'm not entirely sure what advice I'm even asking for here. I don't want to hold him back, but he's willing to do it for our sake. 

I've always thought we had a healthy relationship, with great communication and independence from both parties, which is also another reason why I really don't want him to sacrifice the very beginning of his career for me — it feels like a sign of codependency, but perhaps I'm just being paranoid. 

Is it weird that he'd want to stay here? Am I wrong for feeling like he shouldn't be doing it for my sake? Should I be more emphatic that I'd fully support him if he were to move away?

I'd actually feel better if he said ""it's not because of our relationship, it's just that I don't want to pay rent yet"" or something along those lines. 

-------------

TL;DR:
I'm 3 years away from finishing my master's, bf is going to finish his master's thesis in a couple months. He wants to stay in the city we live in despite getting better job offers elsewhere because he wants to stay with me. I don't want to hold him back on his career. I'd consider a LDR. Any advice?

There is no TL;DR for this post, is ranty, as I wanted to get it out of my chest.   

Why do you play this game?    

My brother asked me this a while ago. He used to be a fellow keeper for abt 2 years but then quit a year back.    

And I am deeply conflicted by this question.   

For background, I started August 2015, F2P except once when Dena intern messed things up for our benefit, once I received Sentinel Grimoire way back then cleared ALL content. Still clearing all content including 5* magicites that are released so far, Sub-30 abt half D-280 neo torments and cleared the rest. Waiting out powercreep to attempt D-whales since I wish for them to be fun and not an exercise of frustration. Some might disagree with my approach to D-whale but to each his/her own...     

Now, why do I play, or more specifically: why do I STILL play?    

... I don’t really know.    

Let me explain myself if you allow me.    

First, let us address the elephant in the room: If you are playing as long as I have, chances are you are swimming in resources that you don’t immediately need, have a sizable and decent set of relics, and bar 5* magicites and neo torments, you LITERALLY STOMP ALL OTHER CONTENT. Most probably, like me, you Auto through EVERYTHING except maybe D-160 and above if not even higher. You monotonously farm power-up dungeons, motes, magicites more out of habit at this stage with no real “End goal” in mind.    

THIS IS NOT FUN. Period.    

My fun right now boils down to the release of the next batch of magicites which is the only content (for me) that can bring about challenging entertaining content. At this point in the game, again to me, only magicites bring that fun experiences of trying out different combinations, teams, tactics, look up clear posts here in this sub, try to see if you can replicate or modify strategies with what you have,etc... You know, like the “good, old days”. So, except for Endgame content, nothing else stokes those early fires.     

Which brings us to the second point and the other elephant here: End game content and powercreep are becoming progressively absurd. Really, REALLY! Have you seen JP videos of Deathgaze for example?! It is absurd!!!!! I theorize more and more endgame content will become like D-whale neo torment and deathgaze: Future-proofed for powercreep purposes. I get it; I know; and I understand: For a game running this long and till who knows when, this is par the course.  IT IS UNAVOIDABLE.     

So why do I play this game?    

I don’t know, I don’t know...The drama from earlier today opened up a festering wound. It was also the straw that broke the camel’s back for me. In that thread, the OP said that their “bad luck” with relics prevented them from clearing “Mote dungeons”. Disregarding the validity of their “cry for help”; I always lived with this feeling: I am a few “bad pulls” away from being locked out of the only remaining fun content for me until the next wave of powercreep brings me back on track. There was another fellow keeper from a while back who loved Kain and quit in what he described as: “fearing falling out of the treadmill”. That is how I feel, CONSTANTLY. The slew of veterans who quit a while back also spooked me: they do not feel about the game the same way they did starting out. I also feel that.    

So, why do I play this game?    

I still look forward to the upcoming “fun” content. I want to push RNG and my luck to see the maximum that I can reach with end game bosses. I honestly look forward to this sub’s ingenuity in finding creative ways of clearing them. I look forward to fourth anniversary. I contemplated “quitting while ahead” but waited till the next fest. Then the next fest came and the one after it and the one after that and am still playing. I play out of habit. I play to keep up with this sub (really!).    

So, why am I posting this? To vent, to hear from other, to know if I am by myself in this boat or if other feel the same.    

If you read till here, thank you for listening and I apologize for any disturbance. "
9u3bqp,67,2018-11-04,Trying to figure out when to stop trying to pass the bar exam and only pursue alternative careers,patriotlawyer00,LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/9u3bqp/trying_to_figure_out_when_to_stop_trying_to_pass/,"Thank you in advance for reading this long post, but I have no support living in a broken home and figured I'd just get some input on here. I Entered law school through a conditional program that's ranked around 100 in the U.S. News World Report which I assume is a T3 or not that great although they put out great successful alumni. 

My LSAT was poor and so were my college grades (148, 2.6 GPA), I enjoyed going out a bit too much at my college and didn't need any meds or antidepressants during my time in college before, I was very happy interning for political offices as an undergraduate etc. 

I worked for a pretty big law firm coming out of college as a paralegal and billed good work and hours, this led to a conditional acceptance program to a full-time seat which required me to pass two senior level courses with the grade of a B+ over 6 weeks and I passed and gained admission.

My most unhealthy and miserable year of my life was my 1L year and my doctor had me prescribed so much adderall for adhd to get through my 1L year. I ended up not even making the median out if my class, yet still managed to land a 1L SA position due to my close relationship with the old managing equity partner. Although I was happy to be back at my old law firm my first summer with my own office getting paid decently, i was very miserable trying to meet the higher billable hour quota, struggling to do quality legal work with assisting drafting memos and research etc. and my relationships at the firm were not healthy anymore. I was given a recommendation by the managing equity partner at the end of the summer for billing over the quota and because we were close, but I know it was probably audited and knocked down by clients or at least that's how miserable I felt.

I continued to force myself through law school, battling anxiety, major depression, and couldn't find an area of law that fit me. I landed a huge internship in Washington, D.C. my second summer that actually led me to being on front page website of my law school and scholarship money for my 3L year. My ex gf broke up with me day of my first bar sitting for not proposing before time (she had major issues I ignored because she looked great so it was my fault), and havent passed the bar exam after many attempts.

Most recently, I took a prep course for the first time Themis and noticed an increase to 240 but need a 266. I was on heavy antidepressants everytime I took the bar exam and now I'm finally weaned off them, but struggling to find the motivation to register again for February because i dont know if it's something i truly dont want and if i did manage to pass and was miserable as a 1L SA in Midlaw with decent hours how do I know I wouldn't be more miserable doing same thing after practicing and being barred.

I never got to see the DA or State Prosecution work but the memos research and billable hour structure was draining. I always had a passion for sports and politics which is why I entered law school and noticed many of them had JDs so I went for it. I have a pending offer to move across the country for a professional sports team as a scout but it's just enough to survive on with full benefits, I wont be wealthy by any means I was told during the interview but I can survive on it. I'm very excited about flying out there following the season for the final meeting and signing a contract but I'm not sure what to do unemployed right now at the moment in my current city.

I've applied to a ton of jobs and even went for my Executive MBA that I'm almost finished obtaining to try and cast a wider net, but I've struggled to find alternative careers. One recruiting agency was going to help me obtain a junior aml position but it didnt work out and now I'm waiting to hear back after a final interview for a compliance officer position for a non-profit but if I dont get this position, I'm still unemployed here at the moment.

I'm struggling going back in the bar exam for February a 6th time, not sure if it's the lack of motivation or being burnt out trying so many times and not being as close as I need to be. I graduated in 2016 and started my MBA right after that but only held a 3 week doc review temp job this past summer for JDs without a license and that's been it. 

Anyone in a similar situation or wants to provide some guidance, I'd sincerely appreciate it. I stopped looking for so many answers in antidepressants and more at the actual circumstances of my life. Wish you all the best of luck! Thank you "
9u3kpq,0,2018-11-04,Telling my FWB that I'm actually a virgin,QuietFollowing,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9u3kpq/telling_my_fwb_that_im_actually_a_virgin/,"Background story: Over the summer, I matched with this guy on tinder. He was in the area for an internship and we casually talked because we both attend the same university. I dont really think anything of it and we just snapchat here and there. Fast forward to August and we're both in college and he asks me to hang out so we meet for the first time and we do everything except sex. We then keep this going for about 3 more times and the last time he asked me if I wanted to have sex. I was too embarrassed to admit I haven't had sex yet because he thinks im more experienced than I actually am. I just said another time. I feel like he suspects I am because he always comments on how tight I am. I feel like I am going to catch him by surprise when I do tell him because I'm experienced when we do foreplay.

Now, I honestly wouldn't mind losing my virginity to him because I dont really have feelings for him and I could say with confidence that I wouldn't get attached but I dont know if I should tell him during foreplay or when he asks me again. Sex isn't too big of a deal to me right now (I know its an issue but I literally only use him for physical stuff). I want to give him enough time to think about it but then again, I'm not opposed to losing my virginity to him.

Another issue, I had a 2 year boyfriend but we never had sex we just did everything else. the reason being, every time he would try it would hurt me so bad so we never really went all the way so I don't want my FWB to freak out and to be honest, I just want to get it over with so we can fuck regularly without issues. I'm trying to put myself in his shoes but I don't know when to tell him.

\---  \*\*TL;DR;\*\* : When should you tell a guy you're hooking up with that you're a virgin?"

9u3ubt,109,2018-11-04,Recruiting Season Timeline,Strokemykaktus,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/9u3ubt/recruiting_season_timeline/,"Hi guys.  Probably like a lot of other Juniors/Seniors going through recruiting season the last couple weeks, I have been obsessively checking this subreddit trying to find tips for interviews and to understand the whole recruiting process.  Thankfully, it has finally come to an end and I just wanted to outline my whole recruiting season experience as it might be helpful for people down the road that check this subreddit.

The whole process was very rewarding for myself.  It was very discouraging at times due to the sheer amount of rejection you receive, but in the end it was all worth it. 

For a little bit of context I go to a target school in the northeast that is about ten minutes away from a largish city.  I'm currently a senior with a 3.42 GPA who did a Corporate internship last summer with a F500 company.  I basically had no leadership experience besides some volunteering I did earlier in college that I tried my best to exaggerate in interviews.  All of the interviews I got were through my school's job board website.  My goal was to land a big 4 job in audit.  


**9/14 - My School's Business Career Fair**

Pretty much your typical college career fair.  Long lines with the big 4, small lines with smaller firms.  The big 4 booths were all staffed with interns that worked at the firm from the summer.  I sort of felt like even talking to them was a waste of time so instead I focused on speaking with firms like GT, BDO, Baker Tilly, and smaller regional firms.  Nothing too exciting happened here besides getting some business card and just introducing yourself to recruiters and staff.  After the fair, I followed up with everyone I had spoken to and let them know that I had applied to jobs they had available.  

Over the next few weeks, I found myself with several on campus interviews that I did nothing to get besides applying to the firm's online posting on my school's job site.

**9/28 - Interview #1** 

**Firm:** Small Regional

**Position:** Audit Associate

First public accounting interview... Def bombed it lol.  I knew I came across as super awkward and nervous.  I'm a pretty quiet/shy/introverted person and let my nerves get the best of me.  Have never heard back from this firm.



     

**9/30 - Interview #2** 

**Firm:** EY

**Position:** FSO Assurance Associate

EY's first round of interviews this year were all prerecorded video interview questions and I knew right away that I had bombed them lol.  I thought the questions they asked were pretty difficult and there's just something awkward about looking at yourself in your webcam.  Heard back a few days later that i got rejected. 
 

**10/2 - Interview #3** 

**Firm:** Deloitte

**Position:** Risk and Financial Advisory Associate

Deloitte consisted of two 30 min on campus interviews back to back for the first round.  Was very conversational and the two interviewers did the large majority of the talking.  It felt as if they were just trying to sell Deloitte to me the whole time.  Thought the interview went ok and was sort of expecting to get an invite to the second round.  Nope.  Rejected about a week and a half later. 

 **10/4 - Interview #4** 

**Firm:** KPMG

**Position:** Audit Associate

Like Deloitte it consisted of two back to back 30 min on campus interviews with a partner and senior manager.  Definitely what I thought was my best interview yet and was told at the end of the interview that they would be making decisions that same day.  Three weeks went by and I still did not hear back from KPMG until I got a rejection email.  However we'll be revisiting KPMG later.


**10/5 - Interview #5** 

**Firm:** Regional firm with large presence in my city (~200 total staff)

**Position:** Tax Associate

I had been in regular contact with this firm ever since the career fair and I thought that it was my best shot yet.  All the staff people I had spoken to seemed to like me and I could tell that I was making the best effort out of all the other candidates to get to know everyone at the preinterview social.  Interview with a tax partner who came across like a super villain.  He was super cold and really turned me off from the firm.  Didn't matter in the end because a few days later my candidacy was rejected.

**10/5 - Interview #6** 

**Firm:** CohnReznick

**Position:** Audit Associate  

Second on campus interview of the day.  I honestly loved my interviewer.  We talked a ton about the NFL and college sports and he seemed like a really cool guy.  Interview went well and I got my first invitation to the second round of interviews.  However the closest office the firm had to me was about 4 hours away, so I ultimately rescinded that offer.  Not sure why I even interviewed with them in the first place.  

**10/9 - Interview #7** 

**Firm:** PwC

**Position:** Risk Assurance Associate   

Interview with a partner from the local office.  First time I thought like I genuinely killed it in an interview.  By the 7th one, I felt like I was finally getting the hang of interviews.  Got called back two days later saying that I would be invited to the final round of interviews which would be conducted with a partner from another city via Google Hangouts.  I got to meet with a lot of the staff at my city's office and they were all super kind and from what they were saying it seemed like they had several positions that needed filled.  Thought this was a lock and I was super excited.  More on PwC later... 

**10/10 - Interview #8** 

**Firm:** BDO

**Position:** Audit Associate

On campus interview which was all conversational and resume based.  The recruiter was very impressed with my questions I had for her.  Once again I thought I killed it.  Found out the same day that I would be invited to an office visit the following week.  More on BDO later.

**10/10 - Interview #9** 

**Firm:** BKD

**Position:** Audit Associate

After my previous interviews this week, I came in to this one super confident.  The recruiter I interviewed with on campus seemed like a great guy and we talked about the NFL pretty much the whole interview.  Found out the next day that I would be invited to an office visit that would take place the following week.  

**10/15 - Interview #10** 

**Firm:** BKD Part II; Office Visit

**Position:** Audit Associate

Myself and about 10 other kids were there for the office visit.  About half of them were interviewing for internships.  Thought the interviews with the two partners went very well.  Both were thirty minutes and conversational where I seemed like I was asking most of the questions.  After the interviews, we all went to lunch with some of the staff.  Overall, a pleasant experience but I did not walk away super confident.  Heard back about a week later with a rejection email.  

**10/18 - Interview #11** 

**Firm:** PwC Part II; Google Hangout

**Position:** Risk Assurance Associate

Interviewed with a partner for about 30 mins via Google Hangout.  Thought it was my best interview yet.  I walked away from it thinking I had to got a job offer from PwC and I couldn't have been happier.  At the end of the interview, the partner had said that this went very well and he looked forward in being in touch with me.  I followed up with a thank you email that same day and he replied back in about 5 mins thanking me for my time saying that I had a bright future ahead of me.  A few days later, I got the rejection email.  I was honestly devastated at this point and thought my chances of finding a public accounting job were 0.  At this point, I only had one more opportunity with BDO.

**10/22 - Interview #12** 

**Firm:** BDO Part II; Office Interview

**Position:** Audit Associate

Myself and about 25 other kids were at the office for two back to back 15 minute interviews that all took place in the same room.  It was kinda odd as I could hardly hear my interviewer with all the noise in the room.  Thought my first interview went very well.  Once again we talked about football the whole time and from my resume we found out we had a mutual acquaintance that we talked about.  Second interview was kinda weird.  The interviewer did not speak english very well and was very cold.  Walked away from this experience feeling ok about it.  As of **11/4**, I still have yet to hear back so I'm assuming that's not a good sign.  
     

Now at this point in the recruiting process, my morale is at an all time low.  I've gotten rejected 9 times and I felt like my chances at working in public accounting were non existent.  I went home to visit my family because I felt so sad about not being able to find a job, especially when I thought I had one guaranteed with PwC.  I didn't know what to do and was basically banking on either getting good news from BDO, or hoping some opportunities would reappear during Spring recruiting.  That's until I got an email from a recruiter on **10/29**.  The email said that they could not offer me a position in audit, but if I were interested I could come in for an interview for either Tax or Advisory, as they still needed to fill some positions.  I said I would like to interview for Tax and the interview was scheduled for **10/31**.

**10/31- Interview #13** 

**Firm:** Big 4 Part II; Office Interview

**Position:** Tax Associate

Back to back 30 minute interviews with a partner and senior manager.  Overall, they were pretty behavioral and I got the chance to ask a lot of questions.  I thought the interviews went pretty well, but not my best.  Did not feel all that great walking out because I felt like I squandered my last chance.  A few hours after the interview the partner called me and told me I would be receiving an offer.  I probably sounded like an idiot over the phone because of how excited I was.  Recruiting was finally over, and although it was not my first choice, I couldn't be happier to be able to work for a Big 4 firm (at least for now lol). 

Overall, the recruiting takes a lot out of you and the rejection sucks.  However, it's very rewarding in the end even if you just improve your interviewing skills for the next time around.  Wish everyone the best as they go throughout the process.

9u3uwu,3,2018-11-04,should I stop insisting with my INFJ Crush? HELP and ENFP fellow,aj_2991,infj,https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/9u3uwu/should_i_stop_insisting_with_my_infj_crush_help/,"Hello everybody, some at the INFJ chat for sure already know me. Given my story is a little bit long I decided to finally write this post to ask for your help and suggestions.   


I met this girl 3 months ago in my workplace. After hanging together 3 of 4 times, she asked me if we were just friends. I told her that I would like to have something more but she told that she was not looking for a  relationship at the moment, but she would like to keep hanging out with me.   


After that, the meetings just were longer and longer passing from 2 hours to full days of doing multiple things from morning to past midnight. By that point, I pampered her hair while we watched Netflix,  hug her from behind time to time.   


One of those days she felt nervous (as she confessed to me later on ) and while we were drinking a coffee told me that she has been trying to put some order in her head and that she was not interested in having a full serious relationship now because we work together and that would be complicated, even though she is doing an internship only.   


I just accepted her feelings and went home to mourn and try to feel better about it. While I was at it I realize that for some reason I didn't feel completely rejected, I feel like she liked me as more than friends so after thinking about it and receiving some advice from one of my ENFP friends and getting some courage I decided to talk with her once more ask her how she felt about about me. I discovered INFJ are not the best talking straight in this kind of situations (at least her),  but to make a summary she said between mumbles things take time and she didn't know yet  but she didn't see herself into something serious but she knew we weren't just friends etc... after one hour we just put it behind us and cheered over ""better be confused and happy that clear and sad""(she told me also that after the time we talked she felt really sad and even thought of not going to the office because hard to meet each other and she was afraid that if this was only a couple of months what will happen if this was to end later on).  


After that last chain of facts, it has been more Netflix, coffees and long conversation together, though we have been playing the game we are not close at the office and don't talk at each other unless is necessary. Now she expects me to say goodbye while I kiss her cheek for a couple of seconds while pampering her other cheek with my hand while she always answers me with blush cheeks a big smile and the typical let me know you arrive home safely.  


For yesterday she planned a day trip to the mountains for both of us as I planned the last day trip before that one. We had a beautiful day together that ended up having some pizza and Netflix at her place. Getting ready to go home I just hug her from behind and try to kiss her. She moved her head apart and fastly went to the kitchen for tea. We chit-chatted a little bit more and I told her to not feel weird about it gave a kiss her in her forehead and leave while she told me to let her know when I arrived home as always.  


Right now feel hurt and sad that she doesn't want to kiss me and I'm really confused about insisting or desisting about the idea to keep trying. she is friend zoning me? needs more time? should I take some time away so she organizes her ideas? any ideas or thoughts are a high value for me so thanks a lot in advance.  


Some additional facts that might be relevant.  


1. I have had long relationships before but never this connection feeling and frustration at the same time that things don't advance in the physical sense and in the relationship regard.
2. I don't feel in the friend zone as she has never tried to match me with someone, ask me or tell me anything about my or her dating life, there is tension when I touch her hand or her hips 
3. Once we hang out with her roommate friends and she was cool that everyone thought we were into a relationship, actually, she specified we were in the grey zone
4. Even I don't feel friend zoned I can't be falling so hard that I'm blind so don't trust me completely   

5. Fortunately or unfortunately I'm kind of cheesy so I have written poems to her or sung some songs to her as well, so yes I really like her and I'm no good like many ENFPs in ONS. We are kind of all or nothing so is hard for us to be in this middle ground.  


Thank you very much in advance for your thoughts and opinions.  


Your friendly ENFP neighbor

Right now, I’n an intern at a local Ford dealer. Im graduating in December and will start selling. 

They told me I can choose which manager I want to work under, which department I work with and that I could have a guaranteed salary for the first three months. 

I really like internet because I prefer working with the current staff in that department. I know it’s not the same, but I also buy and sell a lot of stuff online so I’m used to working with people through e-mail and text. 

But I’ve heard you want to sell on the floor first so you learn how to sell well. 

Another local dealer is offering college grads 60K / year for the first year and other dealers are offering 3K - 4K / month for the first three months. 

I was planning on asking for 5K / month for 3 months, start on the floor and in 3 months, have a choice to switch to internet or stay on the floor. 

What are your thoughts?

9u4fzi,2,2018-11-04,Update: Wife (27F) and I (28M) are separated and planning on divorce,Dangerous_Reporter,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9u4fzi/update_wife_27f_and_i_28m_are_separated_and/,"Update from original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/8wfqfz/wife\_27f\_and\_i\_28m\_considering\_divorce\_after/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8wfqfz/wife_27f_and_i_28m_considering_divorce_after/)

TLDR: Military wife (27F, dentist in military) and I (28M, medical resident) married 1.5 years before wife had emotional affair and later hooked up (not sure what extent) with married male coworker, problems with drinking, lying, mother in law, and not caring about our marriage. Wife later tells me she thought we were going to be friends and divorce would never happen. We are currently separated and living in different states (2 hours away) and planning on divorce but I have to wait 6 months before I can file divorce paperwork (can file in 2 months). I'm feeling like I want to reach out to her and see how she is doing and I'm not sure where to go from here (other than continue with planned divorce). Any advice and thoughts are greatly appreciated.

First off I want to say thank you for all of the advice and comments left by everyone (most), they have been insightful.

So to recap, wife and I were married 1 year before I noticed emotional affair with married male coworker (found out she hooked up with him), problems with drinking, her gaslighting me, lying (issues with snapchat/instagram - sounds so childish), crappy mother in law, and general uncaring behavior about our marriage and myself. 4 months ago I moved to a different state for residency and she was relocated to a new base for the military that was about 2 hours away from me (planned before all this went down so we could be close). Wife later tells me she thought we would never get a divorce but has yet to really put herself out there about our marriage so divorce is still the plan.

To make the timeline easier:

\- Married almost 2 years ago, moved to a new state 1.5 years ago for my medical internship and her 1 year military dental residency. Never had problems before moving - we were best friends, happy, and excited to start our lives together.

\- 11 months ago noticed above issues: started talking becoming uncaring, drinking more, and being unsupportive. I spend what little time I have trying to be with her and make things work.

\- 10 months ago tried to go to counseling for myself (did twice). Helped a little but not a lot, and I didn't have a lot of time due my medical internship (working 26 days/month, 12-14 hour days, with 1.5 hours of driving a day).

\- 5 months ago went to marriage counseling once. Found out she didn't think that marriage was important.

\- 4 months ago moved and I asked for a break because she was being uncaring and I was starting my residency. We had a few talks that were highly emotional with a lot of anger on her side. I had poured myself out saying how I wanted to work on our marriage but I never got the same type of desire to try to work on our marriage in return.

\- 3.5 months ago decided that I couldn't stand seeing all of the stuff on facebook/instagram, etc so I deleted and untagged myself from almost all of it. She was mad and essentially blocked me. After a month of talking a couple times realizing she wasn't putting the effort in I told her I wanted a divorce.

\- 3 months ago she moved to her new base and I visited to get the rest of my furniture/clothing/etc. We had an oddly good time talking like old friends. We talked about our marriage and I told her how much I cared and would be willing to work on it but received lukewarm answers in response. Just before I left after getting my stuff she broke down crying telling me how much she cared and thought we would be friends and that the divorce would never happen. She cried and the last thing I told her was that I love her and then left.

\- 2-3 months ago a few texts but not a lot about wanting to work on things. We're both busy, me with residency and she at her new base.

\- 2 months ago, sparse texts asking how I'm doing but she still says she feels nothing about our marriage.

\- 1 month ago I find out from mutual friends she got very drunk shortly after I moved to new state (4 months ago) and was all over her married male coworker (that now lives 4,000 miles away) and admitted to having feelings for him. She apparently kept disappearing with him all night. This almost caused a divorce on male coworker's side but no one told me. I talked to male coworker's wife and my wife blows up on me but I remain cool and don't respond to wife's calls/texts. I'm fairly certain my wife doesn't know that I know what happened that night. Eventually leads to wife telling me to send the divorce papers whenever I'm ready. Things cool down and I get a few random texts from wife asking how I'm doing but I don't respond.

\- Last week - No communication for a month. A close mutual friend (wife's maid of honor) gets married and wife is in bridal party. I did not go, but feel am feeling left out. I still love and care about my wife and I'm sure she had a hard weekend at the wedding.

\- Present time - I want to reach out to my wife to see how she is doing but think this might be a mistake. I talked to an attending that told me she's had a lot of friends go through similar (and worse) things and they made it out ok. This really messed with my head because I was certain I was making the right choice. I'm finding that my wife and I had a lot in common and it's depressing to think that I would have to go through all of this again with someone new. I wouldn't even consider trying to work on my marriage unless my wife told me she would go to counseling and showed she wanted to make this work with a passion. I'm feeling lost and did not realize how much of a journey this whole thing would be and unsure on where to go from here (other than to file for divorce as planned). Any advice or thoughts are greatly appreciated."

I so appreciate it. You guys have made my day. I still think about the crap he put me through all these years later and am just glad that RB taught him how it felt!

Just discovered this sub and thought I’d share! I’ve been separated from the awful SO (let’s call him JF for jerk face. It makes it easier to type) for about 4 years now, but sometimes I’ll have a random thought that makes me so angry that I put myself through 3 years of hell before leaving.

JF was my high school sweetheart. We dated for a couple years in high school, but my senior year he broke up with me in front of all our friends and had said some slanderous things about me going off to college to get laid and that I was just desperate. Everyone I knew sided with him. It was rough, and I went into college with no one. Fast forward three years, I get a random text from JF’s best friend while I was at a wedding in another state. I had just gotten out of a relationship, and I wasn’t ready for anything. JF’s best friend said that JF wanted to talk with me when I got back into town because “he missed me” and “wanted to apologize”. I didn’t know how he could have apologized but I agreed to meet with him. 

We met, he talked, he was sweet, and he apologized. We decided to be friends, and talked daily. That turned into him asking me out on July 4 under the fireworks that we watched at his house. The first few months were great...and then reality broke in.

While I was in college working towards my bachelors, he was a pizza delivery driver. From what I hear, he still is. He had no ambition to get a career, he just planned on staying at that job forever, and younger me was somehow okay with that?

I went to school full time and I worked full time at Starbucks, some weeks with overtime. Yet I ended up paying for every date because JF spent his cash on video games, booze, or cigarettes.

Oh, I ended up having to help with his rent a few times, since he decided the above mentioned things were more important than rent. 

He got me hooked on cigarettes to deal with the stress of the relationship, and then I ended up buying his cigarettes.

Here’s the start of the downfall - JF forgot my birthday completely one year when he promised to get it off of work. So after his work shift, he showed up to my birth mom’s house as I was leaving and proposed with a ring I specifically told him I did not want. I somehow said yes to his “I’m sorry I forgot your birthday, will you marry me” speech.

Months after the proposal I start asking him for dates that he wanted to get married. He kept shrugging it off. I was almost done with college and was doing a full time internship (student teaching for high school English classes) while working full time, so I forgot about it. The day after I graduated (which he didn’t even stay long enough to see me walk), I left on vacation with my parents and his car broke down. He called me to borrow my graduation money. I told him no, that the extra money he had this month that we budgeted together should have covered the repairs. He spent that money hours before on a PlayStation and refused to return it.

Since JF still lived with his dad, I texted his dad and told him the situation. That was an awakening on all sides. His dad kept telling me after that moment that I could do better, but “I loved JF”. So I stayed. 

JF’s car didn’t get fixed while I was gone for a week, so he borrowed his grandma’s car. He wouldn’t search for a new car himself, so I found him a new car. And then, the big moment happened.

He became a shift lead at the pizza joint, but still was mostly doing deliveries. This corporate chain hires a lot of high schoolers to work the night shift. This one girl (we’ll call her Rebecca Black, cause she looked and sounded like RB in the Friday video) worked with JF a lot for closing shift. During the day when I was at my new corporate America job, they would play games together on that expensive PlayStation he bought instead of the car repairs. A couple months of this go by, and I initially confront him about cheating. He pauses longer than he should have, says no, and tells me to get over myself. He made me feel horrible about asking a question, and I turned to alcohol. And JF encouraged it.

On Valentines Day, JF calls me to tell me RB moved into the spare bedroom across the hall while I was at work. He never asked me about it first. She just did. I talked to his dad, and his dad said that he was told I had cleared everything with her moving in.

The next day, he told me he was cheating on me. He had been for months. He wanted the cake and wanted to eat it, too. 

I was 23 when he told me this. JF was 23, as well. Rebecca Black was 17 and still in high school.

RB ended up getting transferred to a different store. Apparently they stayed together for a couple years before she cheated on him and left.

Never thought at the time I’d say that JF cheating would be the best thing ever, but it kind of was. I escaped what would have been a horrible marriage and now have been in a healthier relationship for 3 1/2 years. "

I've been meaning to write about it for a long time so I decided I should do it from the perspective of my character.  Enjoy (WARNING: **long post**).

(An account from an Unturned, *dramatized events from an RP server around 2 years ago.*)

&amp;#x200B;

**The Rise and Fall of the Tomato Empire**

*“Liberté, égalité, tomate,” these were the words we lived by, and the words we died by.*

&amp;#x200B;

**The Seed**

It was a cool day in Washington when me and my friend Blancaflor found ourselves running from *them;* the zombies, we were the *unturned.* Despite the cool day we were sweating and panting, and had nothing to defend ourselves with. I could feel my heart racing, the smell of their rotting flesh and dried blood from previous meals permeated in the open air. I wasn’t too familiar with this place but the river was south of us and we were surrounded by trees. As we ran up the road we spotted a small farm land and a large red barnhouse. We looked behind us and they had given up chase. We caught our breath for a bit and gathered ourselves. We needed the same thing the zombies craved, food.

We slowly made our way to the outskirts of the farm making sure it was all clear. We had passed this place a few times before on our trips to Seattle. This was Shelton Farm. There had to be food here, and perhaps other survivors. It was only bad news as we got closer. The place was infested with zombie farmers. They weren’t farming, but they were definitely dressed the part. We had to decide now whether it was better we take our chances looking for food elsewhere or we try to grab and run. Our stomachs grumble as we discussed this, we wouldn’t make it far without sustenance. We had to try. We thought it was our best chance to check inside the house for any supplies, their cupboards, refrigerator, dining room, anything left behind. Blancaflor would run distraction to pull them away from the house and I would dash in and grab as many things as I could. The plan was set.

Blancaflor ran out from the thick trees we were hiding behind shouting and waving his hands pulling the undead’s attention from inside the house. Slowly but surely they shuffled outside towards him. From the back door I snuck in as quickly and quietly as I could checking if there were any stragglers. None so far I was safe. I checked the cupboards, found some canned food. There were also old cans of soda lying around. In the kitchen I had found a tomato seed, and I didn’t know it then but it was this seed that all our dreams, hopes, power, weapons, alliances, friendships, enemies, and our community would be built on. I grabbed and we escaped. We looked behind us as the farmers chased us off their land. I was going to be like them soon enough, consumed by a singular unfaltering goal.

Blancaflor and I headed North towards Everett.

&amp;#x200B;

**Sanctuary**

By the time we got to Everett we had finished all of our food. The only thing I had on me were the clothes on my back and the tomato seed I retrieved from the farm. We didn’t want to walk directly into Everett. The streets were littered with zombies. We walked closer to the trees to try and spot any houses or buildings that were clear from any of them. Before we could mark anything for the picking we heard gunshots coming from inside the town. It had to be somewhere in the streets since we heard the bullets ring out all the way from the tree line. Then we saw the zombies from the roads and inside the buildings start marching towards the source of all the noise. We thought for a moment that this was our chance to grab some supplies. Though I began to think otherwise. There were survivors with guns out there. They were confident enough to attract the zombies which probably means they were packing some serious heat. I advised Blancaflor we should probably leave and try our luck somewhere else. Everett was too dangerous with pistol-packing people and flesh eating mouths all looking for blood. We came to an agreement and headed west. We followed the road.

The path was filled with wrecked vehicles, some looked like they were caught in accidents, probably drove in a panic. Other cars looked abandoned and stripped down for parts. My best guess is they decided to continue on by foot when the traffic got too bad. Walking on foward we got to a bridge that went over the water. It was wide and from where we were standing it was pretty clear so we continued on.

At the end of the bridge we were welcomed to a lovely sight of large and old trees by the water and they surrounded several small cabins. This was Camano Campground. By the cabins we saw there were a few zombies. In their past lives they were probably counselors that worked here or those who got lost on their way out of the city. My friend and I were tired. We needed our rest so we decided what our next plan was. To go into Seattle for supplies would be too risky, too many zombies and probably more people with guns. We would rather risk it here in these grounds.

We cleared them out with what weapons we found around. There was an axe and a bow with very few arrows lying around. We dispatched of them carefully and safely. This was where we were going to make our new home. Blancaflor was a builder and we were surrounded by natural materials. He suggested he could make us a house and gather the wood with the axe he found. I wasn’t sure how I was going to contribute at this point. I checked my bag and realized the tomato seed was still there. I decided I was going to be a farmer.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Rise**

Blancaflor was making good progress on our house and I was growing tomatoes outside the building site. From the single seed I was able to grow a tomato and from those seeds I grew more and more and more of them. Before I knew it we had a very stable source of food and we never got hungry. While Blancaflor was tired from his long days of work I was there to supply us with the sustenance we needed. With the river nearby we had an endless source of water. With our hunger and thirst problem sorted out what was next?

One day a traveler passed by the campground as I was farming. I saw he was covered in weapons, large guns, and knives. He wore protective gear and night goggles. He looked very dangerous, but he approached me in a friendly manner without raising his gun. I decided to extend a helping hand, perhaps this traveler was hungry. I offered him some tomatoes. He happily accepted them and what he said next surprised and confused me, “How much?” I then asked what do you mean how much, and he said how much for the tomatoes. He slowly began to realize we were new survivors around these parts and he proceeded to explain to us that there has been a community of survivors established here in Washington and people traded in credits. I had no idea that I could sell these tomatoes and no inkling of how much they costed. The traveler gave me 60 credits, I later found out the market price was 50 credits. Before the man left I asked him what he did in this community. The traveler said he was a bandit as he waved goodbye tomato in hand taking a bite from it as he walked off. I ecstatically told Blancaflor of this new revelation. The tomatoes could be our ticket to building a better and safer home.

After the encounter with the travelling bandit I sold tomatoes with anyone passing by. It was a good spot since it was on the way to Seattle. I made good money, but what was even better was that word was spreading around about the tomatoes from Camano. Blancaflor and I were making a name for ourselves. With the money I saved up I was able to buy more building supplies for him to make our quaint home even larger, and our farm even wider. Things were starting to look up for us.

Time passed and most people of the community knew us. It was hard to miss the farm of only tomatoes. All types of people from the community ventured by our home. Even the Leader of the community graced us with a visit. He recognized the work we were doing and complimented us on our stellar farm. As a gift I was given a farmer’s shotgun signifying I was officially a farmer in the community. Policemen and bandits alike passed by, occasionally at the same time. It did not matter who you were, Camano became a safe place for everyone. But the richer you got, and the bigger your house became the more likely you were to become a target. There was no mistaking that there was a community in this place and credits flowed everywhere, but not for a second should you think that this was the civilized world we onced lived in. People openly walked with all manners of weapons strapped to themselves, ready to fight for their lives.

The first time Camano was attacked by terrorists it was a bloody mess. We were severely outgunned, and completely unprepared. It was a clear day when Blancaflor and I saw the colored smoke grenades thrown from the treeline to the west. It was to distract us and mask their approach. We couldn’t see who was attacking us and how many they were. We were only a builder and a farmer with had no real means of defending ourselves from what seemed to be highly trained soldiers. Before we knew it they blew down the door to our home. Blancaflor was on the first floor and closest to the entrance, armed with a measly handgun he was quickly knocked out by them. I was on the second floor scrambling for a gun or a place to hide. I heard their footsteps as they ascended. They were covered in bullet proof vests and masks, one of the assailants shot me in the gut. I ran into my room a trail of blood followed me. I desperately dug into my storage checking if there was anything I could use. I found the farmer’s shotgun. I had never used it up to this point. I hid in the corner of the room away from the door ready to pounce. I was hoping they would underestimate me. I was right. The first one peaked his head into the room, I blew his brains out. The second one shouted seeing his friend painted all over the walls he carelessly came through the doorway as well, but I was quicker than him. One hand kept pressure on my wound and I used the other to pull the trigger. Another swift death as his body fell limp on top of his friend. I heard a third one that scrambled outside the doorway. I was hoping he was the last. I ran out the room jumping over the bodies hoping to catch the third assailant off guard. He did not expect my bravado. He could not react in time to me bringing the shotgun point blank to his face. I ended the life of the last attacker. Three bodies splayed out under me I dropped the gun and rushed to Blancaflor downstairs to check if he was alive. Thankfully they did not finish the job on him. We looted the bodies of their belongings and cleaned up the house. When we got everything settled and put up a new door I told my friend, “Never again.”

&amp;#x200B;

**Tomate**

Camano was not the same after that first attack. I had realized how open and weak we were against terrorists threats. They were well armed and only three. We were lucky they were cocky and that I was a good shot. From the tomatoes I farmed I sold them in bulk in the open market. I gave Blancaflor what he needed to make our home a fortress; doors of steel, reinforced fences and walls. On the outside we looked like the same safe haven with the largest tomato farm in all of Washington, inside I had been stockpiling weapons on the third floor. Sniper rifles, assault rifles, machine guns and handguns, anything to defend ourselves with. We never used our weapons to attack anyone, only to defend ourselves. There were a few attempts to take our farm after that. We picked them easily off from our windows slits, and defensible roofs. No one was going to take our home from us.

Eventually our home grew to house more people. The first to board with us was a stranger by the name of Doomdeath. He was a very young fellow who admired our home and our business. After a brief internship we agreed to give him a room on our first floor. He went to Blancaflor for building advice and he came to me with ideas on expanding our business, selling set meals that he could cook from the fish in the river. He was an energetic boy. Doomdeath brought a new side to Camano that Blancaflor and I really appreciated.

Our friends heard about our farm and we took them in as well. We gave them rooms,  supplies, weapons, and informed them of the community. MisterSir, Bruvarian, and Mifs lived quite well with us in Camano. MisterSir became a policeman. We even had a jail cell built close to our house for temporary detention of unruly travelers. Our community was growing and we were not naive to think that caution was not needed with so many people hanging by our place at any given time. Gatherings, celebrations, and parties were often held in the campgrounds. Everyone would lay down their differences and bask in the sun and breathe in the fresh scent of the old barks and clean water that outlined our home. Bruvarian put up a sign outside the porch that became our brotherhood’s motto, “liberté, égalité, tomate,” these were the words we lived by, and the words we died by.

It got to a point where Blancaflor had built a public farmhouse for me to plant food in. It was our way of giving back to the community. We put up a message saying that any hungry travelers should feel free to come and take their fill. We had more than we could consume. Inside our home there was a small plot of land where I still farmed tomatoes to sell in bulk. The credits were intoxicating. The extra credits came in handy later on.

We were untouchable, or so I thought.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Fall**

We grew complacent. Everyone knew of the Camano Campground. The size of our home and the way we lived in leisure. Of course there would be devious eyes. We became the biggest target in the community. The household had gone on vacation together. We didn’t think we needed to be on guard. The farm had the community’s respect so we felt no one would ever dare attack us. We could not have been more wrong.

When we came back home there was no home. Only the rubble of what was once our supposedly indestructible metal fortress. Our belongings were taken, and our farm was desecrated. Not a tomato was left spared. We stared at the ruins of what was once a haven. I felt crushed and defeated. Who could have done this? We asked around and they said no one saw who attacked the farm. I did not believe them. They probably did not want to admit they were too cowardly to defend the farm. Or they were jealous of us and were finally happy to see us fall. I felt like the community had turned on us, on me. The community I fed, the travelers and outlaws I kept alive had betrayed us all. Some did not even show sympathy in our loss. Maybe there were those who had a hand in covering it all up. No guns or grenades could do this kind of damage to what Blancaflor built. This was the work of C4 and RPG’s. This was the labor of terrorists. Blancaflor was distraught, the once great structure that symbolized our empire was now gone. He built it with his own two hands. The trees our original home were built from towered above us, silent sentinels of the land. Camano Campground was no longer sanctuary. We had nowhere to go and were unsure of what to do. A fire raged inside me. I stared down at the iron and steel that I thought would keep us safe. If we could not have a home then no one else would. Iron and steel was our next path. I approached our comrades and told them, “we’re going to be terrorists.”

I had enough money to supply me, Blancaflor, MisterSir, Mifs, and Bruvarian with weapons, ammunition, protective gear, and explosives to tear down all the other great homes that mocked us. We left Camano for the last time never to return, but only in ashes for fertilizer of whatever tomatoes were left behind. We headed north towards Clearwater campground and laid siege to a well-guarded home. We had enough RPG’s to blow their high walls from a distance. We picked an elevated position to pick them off as they ran out of their homes. We looted what we could. If you drew a circle counterclockwise around the map of Washington, that’s the path of destruction we took on our mission of vengeance. Every home we saw we buried. The more massive and more defensible each residence was then the sweeter the feeling when we erased it from the ground up. We hit the Bellevue Golf Course then the Kennewick Farm, we passed Seattle on the way to Rainbridge Island. We hit all the extravagant houses in the community. Everyone was deathly afraid of us, the remnants of the tomato empire.

As fate would have it the credits ran out. I no longer had a farm to sell. I desperately tried to farm a few tomatoes on a small patch of land in the middle of a forest we were hiding in. It was pathetic. I had fallen so low. There wasn’t enough money to cover all the explosives we wanted. We just settled for picking off travelers on the highway. Then we made our way back to Seattle. With our sniper rifles we set ourselves prone on a hill overlooking the city. Then we just shot people. Clean bullets through the head, they were zombie food. There were others we wounded or crippled. A handful would manage to run and hobble away. We didn’t chase them or loot the dead bodies. We lost our spirit. We lost ourselves. We were once respected members of the community. On that hill we shot and killed people for sport, trying to feel something. There was nothing but numbness. We became as empty and the campground we left.

In time we were hunted down. We did not put up much of a fight. We ran and cried as are the instincts of any survivor. I cannot say much for my comrades but I embraced the sweet release of death warmly. I could taste the blood in my mouth, it tasted of the first tomato I ever grew."

Back here again with another post on preparing for residency interviews. This time I am tackling the most dreaded part of the interview, where they ask you if you have any questions for them. I consider this an underutilized part of the interview both in terms of impressing the interviewer and for actually getting useful information for yourself. This is extracted from my website [EM Insider](https://www.eminsider.com/), which is meant to provide a in-depth guide for applicants applying to Emergency Medicine, from the standpoint of someone who had to do it themselves. However this particular post is applicable for all specialties so feel free to chime in. 

The last bit of self-advertising I will do is that this is part one of a two-parter on developing these interview questions. I won't be including the second part here as it will likely be more EM oriented, so if you are intersteded in reading it, subscribe to the rss feed or email list to be updated when that comes out. I'll be around so ask any questions you want and I welcome any criticisms or disagreements you may have. I think that having two-sided discussions is integral to learning and will help me to better develop the content I am creating.


&amp;nbsp;

---------------

&amp;nbsp;

I read a book some time ago about interviewee etiquette and one of the points made was that you should avoid starting questions with ""Why do you..."". This is because it comes across as accusatory and implies that you are judging their decisions. Rather than asking, ""Why do you do a medicine wards rotation?"", ask ""Have you seen any benefits from your medicine wards rotation?"". If you think there's potential for a question that doesn't have a good answer, try to pad the question to allow for some explanation. If a program doesn't offer a integrated pediatrics experience throughout the year, don't ask ""Aren't residents missing out if they can't work with pediatric patients in all seasons?"", but instead add some wiggle room: ""How do you feel about residents not working in the pediatric ED throughout the year?"" They still might not give you a good answer to the second question but the difference is that you have more information about a program's weak point and they don't feel like you verbally attacked them.

&amp;nbsp;
 
 
Before I started my interview season, I sat down and wrote out a long list of non-specific questions I could ask at any program. You can see a longer list of these in the Interviewing section of the Application Guide, but a few I wanted to highlight are: ""What kind of resident do you think does best at this program?"", ""What changes have you made in the past few years?"". I like these questions because they are safe, usually not answered through the program's website or their presentation, and they give you very good information. Just as good answers require some forethought and preparation, good questions also should be thoughtful and insightful. You certainly can ask ""How's your peds experience here?"" to everyone as your go-to, but it's a fairly shallow question and doesn't reflect well on your ability to prepare or your level of interest in the program.


&amp;nbsp;


Try to come up with at least 5 questions that are of similar quality and won't be something you'd expect to be answered through the PD's presentation, such as what rotations are included in the intern year, where residents live, or if the program attends any annual conferences. It's not a bad idea to throw in these questions to pad out your list to 10-15, but don't rely on these. I like asking about what changes have been made to the program in the past few years because it is sort of the inverse of the classic ""What changes do you see happening in the next 4 years?"". Rather than asking about what their plans are for the direction of the program, you can ask about where they've already been and can discuss actual events and concrete information instead of more vague timelines and vision. It gives you roughly similar information but with more solid discussion topics.

&amp;nbsp;
 
Asking questions that will help you decide how to rank the program will in turn improve the impression you make on your interviewer. It makes you look like a go-getter who takes initiative and is focused on making good decisions. Rather than asking about annual patient numbers or the specific details of rotations which people ask because they think they're supposed to try and look serious, it is better to ask about things that you actually want to know about. You'll look more professional, be more engaged in the discussion, and most importantly, leave with a better ability to eventually formulate your rank list.

 
&amp;nbsp;
 

Hopefully your other questions should have that degree of lead-off discussion potential as well as provide you with legitimately useful information for evaluating the program. Recognize as well that certain questions are more appropriate to ask different people. Questions regarding the vision and direction of the program should be directed towards the Program Director, whereas those regarding the general clinical workflow are better used for attendings that don't have leadership positions. You may be interviewed by residents at some programs, so feel free to develop questions that make more sense to ask a fellow resident. Ultimately, you are developing fallback questions you can ask in any situation if you blank out on more specific questions. You shouldn't feel obligated to ask these questions at every interview though you may find you like the discussion generated by certain questions. The goal here is to avoid the dead time if you ever get caught off guard in an interview."
9u6q7r,1,2018-11-04,Unique Position,FireBlaze999,cad,https://www.reddit.com/r/cad/comments/9u6q7r/unique_position/,"Hey all, I'll make this a long story short. 

&amp;#x200B;

I took intro to CAD a few semesters ago in college and liked it a lot, I've always been interested in it. This was just a side class for me to take so I wasn't so bored on days off. However, I am currently an Accounting major wanting to change to getting my 2 year degree and certificate in CAD (accounting isn't turning out to be what I thought it would be). I also have completed my Associates of Science of Business Administration. 

&amp;#x200B;

My question to you all is this, is the job market in California good for CAD Drafters? I'm tight with the lead professor of the program and she gets people internships all the time. I haven't researched the job market so much just yet so I'd like to hear your opinions!

&amp;#x200B;

I'm almost halfway through my Bachelor's degree (B.A., M.I.S. concentration) and was offered a full time I.T. position this summer. I'm at $50,000/yr with health and dental benefits. $690/wk net income after all taxes + healthcare and dental (health insurance $43/week, dental $5/week).

I started as an intern in 2017 and through some full-time and part-time work in the department, they decided to offer me a job after the previous person in the position retired in July.

I lived on campus my first two years of college and racked up about 25K in student loans. \~$14K at 5.9% and \~11K at 4%. I was very, very immature with my spending. I am just now understanding the concept of delayed gratification, but this came too late. I have $12K in credit card debt with varying interest rates, most around 21% APR. About $3K of that came out of a gambling problem I have overcome entirely.

I love my job and am fortunate and grateful to live with my mom and brother in the house we grew up in, there is no pressure to move out. I am commuting to school now two nights a week, looking to to finish my degree in about 4 years. I pay my mom $320/month for all expenses. I bought my car last year and do not have a car payment. 

My monthly credit card minimums between all my cards are around $340/month. I do not have any savings. My credit score is in the mid 600's as I haven't missed any payments since 2016.

My questions are:

1. I know I should tackle my debt first. I am going to build an emergency fund of a couple grand before I do that. Should I attack the highest interest cards first?
2. My job has a 401K but I cannot contribute until I am 21 next summer, my company offers a 3% match. Should I look into investing into a Roth IRA for now or attack all my debt before any investing? Should I wipe my CC debt then do my Roth as I start my student loan repayments in a couple years?

&amp;#x200B;

So in my last year of my undergraduate, I had just gotten over a break up, but thanks to the friend network I had built and my routines I quickly got out there and met a very good girl. We dated for 5 months before sleeping together, because she was very religious and I not so much. We were visiting each other every weekend since we lived 4 hours away from each other, and the more I saw her the more I was falling in love with her, her family, her values and aspirations. Problem came 3 months later when, almost everyone I knew was planning on leaving the city after their undergrad, she didn't know where she would end up after finishing her masters, and was panicking and considering how problematic it would be me not being religious. It came to a point where I was extremely burnt out and we had a discussion where we almost broke up, gave it some time and a week later we decided since we didn't know where we would end up to not continue (which I really didn't want to do, but at that point I kind of gave up and didn't say that). That combined with prolonging my undergrad by a year due to problems with the accelerator I was doing my thesis on collapsed me. Instead of looking for internships and new roommates (as mine would be moving out) I was moving out, and thinking there would be no english speaking company in this city (I am an international in Germany). A few months later I find out a friend of mine found exactly such an internship, and my now ex would be coming to my city. We talked, eventually met up, kissed, all the feelings were there but when she asked me what happens after she finishes her internship in the city (because last time she was really hurt) I didn't muster the will to tell her that we would find something and that what I really wanted was to stay together. We didn't continue and I tried to focus on my own things but I was extremely down, I shut myself in and ended up in a masters program in another city. However, now almost a year later I still really regret not continuing things with her, and doing what I knew I had to do to keep myself in that city. I feel like I had everything going for me, and I just let it go to waste and now I constantly think about the lost experiences and where I might be in my life. I don't know what to do. 

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: I basically went against my better judgement due to very chaotic circumstances and broke up with a very good partner, who at the time was a bit long distance. A few months later she moves to my city but I wasn't thinking straight and we didn't date again. I focus only on graduation and moving out and a year goes by, I end up in a different city, but I can't shake the feeling that it was a mistake not continuing the relationship with her and regret not trying to find work in that city. I don't know how to deal with the feeling of regret, if I should somehow move on or try and get back.

\-----

TL;DR: Socialism is government manipulation on the economy for the purported purpose of the public good by means of a targeted abolition of private property. Ownership of a good is possessing the means to determine how a good is used, thus Socialism claims ownership of people and their property. Socialism is immoral, as it is akin to slavery and theft, and is destructive and wasteful for society. Thus, Socialism hurts the public good instead of helping it by reducing the wealth for all individuals, rich and poor both.

\-----

Socialism is an economic system where the Government owns the means of production (that is, that the Government owns/operates all large business ventures). This end is achieved by means of a targeted abolition of private property. The level of private property that is forbidden is arbitrary, and varies by individual country, unique to their own particular ""flavor."" Communism is one such flavor, but even that flavor varies by country. In particular, Socialism as a label tends to refer to flavors of economic systems derived from the ideas of Karl Marx, or that claim a special dedication to the poor or distribution of forced financial equality. Such distinctions between what is and is not ""Socialism"" are arbitrary, I argue, as the underpinning authority and means for many flavors remain the same.

A significant number of people who argue about the definition of Socialism are doing so because of an underlying disagreement with what it means to ""own"" or ""operate"" production. For example, the Nazi party in Germany called themselves ""National Socialists,"" even though private property was allowed even at the highest levels of production. But note, my definition was that the means was a ""targeted"" abolition of private property. Different countries draw that line in different arbitrary locations; some merely by amount of wealth or type of wealth, but the Nazi party shows us a different distinction: the scope of property. You see, in Nazi Germany, businesses still ""owned"" themselves, but that ownership was conditioned on the premise that the Government reserved the exclusive right to be able to step in and mandate certain decisions or requirements at will.

At the heart, ""ownership"" of X means having the sovereign right to determine how X is used. Ownership is not merely the possession of the good, but it is the means to do whatever with that good that one pleases. Some would argue that flavors such at the Nazi's (or modern western governments, for that matter) do not qualify as Socialist because the businesses are still private in control. But ""operated by"" is not the definition of ownership; ownership is conditioned on sovereign say.

For example, take the case of Slavery. I imagine that you would agree it is absurd to say a Slave owns himself. After all, the Slave gets to make whatever decisions he wishes, no? Surely, a Slave cannot choose to leave his estate, and the Slave is not entitled to appeal the decisions of his Master, but the Slave still maintains volition in all matters that his Master does not stipulate, does he not? A Master may give an extraordinary amount of leeway in regards to: the spending money the Slave is allowed to have; the particular means of achieving a task; the use of the Slave's free time; and more. But no, the burden of the Slave's definition of ""free"" is not contingent on having literally zero initiative. The thing that makes the Slave a Slave is the fact that, in the case that the Master does give an order, the Slave is required to follow it, and the Master reserves the right to decide what the Slave does in any matter of his life. Ultimate control is the test for ownership; it is who gets to have the final say.

Surely, if the label ""Slave"" was removed, and the label ""Free"" was put in its place, the label would remain incorrect so long as the Slave does not maintain sole and sovereign control over his own life, body, and liberty, and not merely that level of liberty ""willed"" or ""allowed"" by his superior. A true Free man would maintain the right to leave his Master, and seek employment elsewhere; to establish his own terms of service; to enter into arrangements by will and consent. It is not merely the fact that Slaves often lack compensation that makes them Slaves; it is the fact that Slaves do not possess the means to alter the terms of their own service. Both Slaves and Interns are unpaid; what makes one Free and one a Slave? The right to abolish service; the right to consent.

Under this understanding, even the most loose colloquial usage of ""Socialist"" has merit; because ""Socialist"" is a sliding scale between less government say in an individual's or business' free decisions and property and more. The more ""Socialist"" a country is, the less private property is observed and the more ownership and mediation of property is held by the collective or State. The more Socialist a country is, the more it treats its citizens and businesses like Slaves and the State as their owners.

Many other substantive differences unique to the label ""Socialist"" exist, but they are still founded on Authoritarian principle. What makes a King with absolute power qualitatively different than an elite class of bureaucrats with the same power? The fact that Socialists have the pretext of the ""public good"" is the pretext that every political leader in history has claimed. This is no qualitative difference; only a difference of context and flavor.

\--

As far as what makes Socialism bad, I have a 3 reasons: it is immoral, it is destructive, it is wasteful.

First, it is immoral because it is massively increased institutional theft and slavery. Theft from an individual's property is still theft, even if it is done for a ""good cause."" The mere fact that you think you can use that persons resources better than they are using them yourself does not change the fact that taking that property by force is still theft. Self-titled Socialists either claim that the ends justifies the means, and that the good cause outweighs the moral cost of the theft, or they simply claim that private property is illegitimate, and that theft is not actually immoral. Theft is forceful acquisition of another's possessions. It is my claim that this is immoral, even if this the cause is ""good."" Surely, every Government engages in this theft to various degrees, otherwise taxes would not exist. It is my view that even minimal taxes amount to theft, but that the justification of this theft is that they are necessary to avoid the potential of even greater harm, or the threat of that harm. But even in that case, taxes are still a ""necessary evil,"" and are subject to a cost-benefit analysis. Even if you believe the ends justify the means, the act is still immoral if the benefits do not outweigh the costs.

Which brings me to my second point: Socialism is destructive. Since it is destructive, it does not pass a cost/benefit test. It would be one thing if the touted virtue of Socialist policies - the benefit of the poor or the common man - were actually achieved. But they are not achieved, because Socialist policies inherently destroy wealth, and thus make the poor even worse off. For one, taking wealth away from those individuals and groups that produce the most reduces the incentive for them to produce at all, thus limiting the amount of wealth that is available for redistribution. Even when redistribution is not being employed, the act of limiting liberty or personal control often has the same economically destructive effect of allocating resources ineffectively, but more on that later. Second, since Socialism seeks to allocate resources in the economy more effectively for the good of the poor or the common man by taking or imposing on the wealthy, it ignores the greed and incentive of political actors to allocate those resources to themselves. Socialist policies are often touted to combat the greed of the wealthy, arguing that their freedom oppresses the poor. But if greed is a problem, then why does greed cease to exist for those who wield the political authority to take resources by force? If the wealthy Capitalists acquire their wealth by engaging in self-interested exchanges with the masses, thus leveraging wealth into their own possession, then surely this exploitation is limited by the consensual nature of those exchanges. So why would we assume that political autocrats will obey their mandate to be interested in the public good and that greed no longer applies when the requirement for voluntary exchange is removed? Even if the intended consequence of Socialist policies is to benefit the public good, this good intention is weak in comparison to the even greater potential for exploitation enabled by the power necessary to put those policies in action.

Lastly, Socialism is destructive because it is wasteful. The wealth building properties of economies lie in the ability of individuals to produce products and services with their labor that add to the cumulative wealth of the society. As an example, take a farmer who can either grow corn or wheat. The farmer could take any number of factors into consideration, almost too many to even be numbered. But at the end of the day, the farmer will act in the manner that he perceives to be in his own best interest. Perhaps the price of wheat is higher, or his field is better suited to grow one crop rather than another, or the farmer is more familiar with one crop than the other, or the one crop's seeds are more limited in supply than the other. In any case, the farmer will make the decision that he sees as being the best option that balances the amount of work he is capable of doing and the amount of crop that he is able to sell. What if he could grow more corn, but people aren't willing to buy corn? At the end of the day, the options, prices, and monetary values of the farmers inputs and outputs affect the decision.

Perhaps it may not be intuitive, but when the farmer acts in his own best interest through interaction with his options and free exchange, the farmer ends up producing what society needed the most. Suppose a massive drought occurred in an area that largely grew wheat; this would cause the price of wheat to go up. If that increased price was appealing to the farmer, since he could make a higher profit, it causes the farmer to adjust his behavior to suit the need that arose in his society. Or suppose the availability of seeds for a particular crop suddenly became scarce; the farmer may have normally chosen to plant that crop, but the higher cost or scarcity of the seeds cause him to plant something else, which then reduces the amount of that crop that is produced, thus signally to the rest of society a higher price for that crop.

In this way, the prices and needs of every good and service in the entire society are coordinated. This enables all self-directed decisions in the economy to be focused toward the highest need and use in the society. As resources are allocated more efficiently, it allows for a more efficient use of those resources, increasing the effective amount of usable resources in the economy, and thus increasing effective wealth. When combined with a profit motive and human ingenuity, this allows for innovation and creative solutions to the production of more profitable goods to be appealing to people. If people own the product of their labor, then they have an incentive to produce more. This gives a boon to innovation, technological advancement, and the discovery of new and unseen methods of allocating resources.

Now suppose that a government mandate is put in place, and the farmer is now required to grow corn. The farmer may come into contact with a situation, perhaps even one that I mentioned, that gives the farmer a reason to think that wheat would actually be a better decision. The farmer may appeal the decision from his government superior, but unless the farmer is able to convince the entire bureaucratic structure behind the rule, the farmer will be forced to make the worse decision. The farmer may try and explain the unique circumstances of his situation, and give an argument, but government workers he interacts with may more may not listen. Or perhaps they would want to listen, but they themselves are bound to the ""law,"" ""rule,"" or ultimately, whim of the higher political authority. There is no guarantee that the political authority will care about the farmer's situation, or that they will be flexible to having their authority questioned.

The fact is that the political class does not have access to the same information that individuals do. How is a political official supposed to know the specific circumstances that affect each individual under his jurisdiction? They can't. When the official makes a decision, he is doing so with limited information; he makes decisions on behalf of other people without knowing the effects of those decisions. The individual who makes his own decisions is far more likely to actually understand the consequences of those decisions.

As a consequence, these governmental mandates often lead to wasteful, or outright stupid decisions to be made. One need not look far to see examples of this. As a notable example, I would point towards Maoist China that ordered farmer peasants to meld down metal farm tools to make industrial products (even though the farmers did not possess the means to do this correctly, and thus the metal products they made were brittle and useless). This, in addition to the farmers being forced to work ""industrial"" jobs instead of farming, led to terrible resources being allocated in the economy, including a massive shortage of food and massive starvation that killed millions.

The highest level of totalitarian control gives us the starkest example, but even gentler controls in the economy lead to the same wasteful effects, albeit to a proportionally reduced degree from the reduced scope of the interventions. The degree to which private property and liberty of individuals are ignored will reduce an economy's wealth. Thus, the highest arrangement of society that allows for the greatest wealth of all is that which allows private economic interactions to be consensual, effectual, and meaningfully free.

Critics claim that this arrangement allows for a large amount of wealth to accumulate in the hands of the wealthy, but it also allows for the accumulation into everyone's hands. Even if the ""percent"" of wealth that you hold when compared to your neighbor's diminishes, that is a moot point if everyone benefited. Suppose your wealth doubled, but your neighbor's doubled and a half, and economic freedom caused this. Did economic freedom steal 20% from you and give it to your neighbor? Certainly not. Not if it was this very economic freedom that allowed you to double your wealth as well. Socialists are so concerned with comparing the wealth of others that they fail to see when enacting policies to correct these inequalities will just lead to both parties becoming poorer. It is the absolute level of poverty that I am concerned about; not the relative level of poverty. Who cares if you own one car, but your neighbor owns five? Would you prefer a system where both of you owned none? That is greed and envy in purest form. That is the result that more and more aggressive Socialist policies leads to: it is equality through shared destruction. Ironically, it doesn't even eliminate inequality at the highest levels, either, as power is transferred from the wealthy business owners to the politically powerful autocrats.

People motivated to rise to the highest level of society aren't concerned with absolute levels of well-being or success. After a certain level of monetary wealth, additional levels of work and possessions do not increase standard of living more than stress deprives it. This is not what motivates the powerful. What motivates a rise to power is status and the ability to dominate others. Thus, the powerful do not have an incentive to increase the standard of living of all, but instead have an incentive to care more about relative power and possessions. In a system of economic freedom, power must be accumulated by giving consumers what they desire and leveraging your skills in exchange. But in a system of political power, favors, control, wealth, and status can be taken by force, not by exchange.

If you were rich and powerful, which system would you prefer?"
9u9va1,0,2018-11-04,My girlfriend (22F) broke up and blocked me (21M) on everything,ThePersianDiversion,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9u9va1/my_girlfriend_22f_broke_up_and_blocked_me_21m_on/,"So my girlfriend and I had been dating for 8 months. We are both college students, graduating in December 2019. We have been in classes together and share a school club, so we will probably see each-other semi-frequently before we graduate.

Lets call her Amy for the sake of the story  
The relationship started off on the wrong foot. This was because my ex before Amy had a problem with drinking that she would mix alcohol with her depression/anxiety meds and we had a nasty breakup because of it, and around the same time Amy was breaking up with her boyfriend and we ended up at a party together and Amy was trying to make-out with me while she was still dating him. This all happened while Amy was super drunk so she doesn't remember this, but it made me feel uneasy when we started dating. I think because of this it made me distrusting and be very emotionally disconnected at the beginning of the relationship.   
I addressed to her the whole getting drunk and flirty made me really upset, and she says that kind of stuff never happens with her and not to worry about it, but it still kinda stuck with me. Unfortunately I went into a mode of staying mostly disconnected from Amy, so I wasn't taking the relationship seriously at all and would threaten to breakup at very small things and was very unfair when it came to settling an argument (Saying I wasn't okay with her going out and getting drunk, and I don't like her friends, etc.). I was a monster to her, and I regret it. This happened for about 3 months.   


This had a turning point when the summer started and she had to go live at her internship which was 2 hours away. It was a governmental job, so the description was very vague when she got hired and was NOT doing the work she expected. She was living in a cabin with bed-bugs, mice, hated her job, was away from family/friends/pets. She started noticing signs of depression, because of all that combined with our relationship issues made her miserable. After talking with me and her parents, Amy decided that she would leave the job after the 2 weeks and come back to our college-town and work a lab job. This way, she would be able to stay with her cat, and I would be around too. At this point, Amy and I were best friends, I unknowingly got very attached and knew that I love her, and she said she loved me too. When she got back to town, our problems became smaller, but much more frequent which drove us both insane. 

We both latched too hard when we should've just taken a break or gave each-other space. I kept trying to ""fix"" issues and ""fix"" her, while she said that there shouldn't be this many issues in a relationship anyways. I was asking for a lot of emotional energy from her, and had a hard time being patient with her depression so I had unrealistic expectations that set her up to fail (not on purpose). I think we were both very fed up with these fights, because each time they would get louder and angrier. We came very close to breaking up a couple times this summer, but I was the one who talked her out of it.   


After about 2 months (in August), school was starting again and we came to the conclusion that things have to change. Fortunately she was starting to feel back to herself again, and wasn't so down all the tie. We can either fix these issues and try to progress towards being happy together, or we should break up. We decided to gradually try and make things better. While this gave us hope, it was easier said that done. I was still a picky person about some things, and I think she subconsciously harbored a bit of resentment towards me for being a jerk to her for the first 3 months(she kept bringing them up). Amy would keep saying she was fed up with my issues, and she wants to be able to go party with her friends every once in a while if she wants to (which is completely reasonable! I knew it was dumb for me to be upset about it). But we found a good middle-ground and things were finally starting to gradually get better. We'd still bicker every once in a while, but the problems became more infrequent and we were handling them calmer.   


Finally sometime in October, we made tentative plans to hang out one day, and she made plans with her friends to go to a pumpkin patch earlier that day while I was at work. She ended up being late and she didn't want to ask them how long it would take, so I got kinda heated and called her and told her to ask. Without realizing it, I totally called her and bitched her out in front of her friends. She reluctantly broke up with me. She didn't want to take it anymore. I couldn't resist messaging her every day and she would mostly ignore me. We came to the conclusion that theres alot of room for personal growth for the two of us. Theres always a chance we might get back together, but we should focus on ourselves for a while. We were both VERY torn up about it.   


About 4 days after the breakup, she called me at midnight crying and sobbing wanting to give things a shot, so we talked alot for a few days, and decided to get back together (Oct 14th). We decided that we can try to make these individual improvements, TOGETHER as a couple. It felt like the right thing to do. Finally at this point, it seemed like we had some solid ground to build on. We both had hope, and we were both falling in love all over again. We went back to being best friends and we were so happy, and all the problems seemed like they vanished.  


We bickered a little about a small issue on Oct. 31st which was resolved that night(it ended up being a miscommunication that got outta control), and then on Nov. 1st she was having a ladies night for her birthday and went downtown with her friends. At first everything was fine and we were snap-chatting back and forth and being very affectionate and loving. I decided I wanted to go give her one of her birthday gifts early (and over-sized soft hoodie because it was cold and rainy that night). I guess my jealousy and insecurity that she would want to get flirty and make out with another guy really got the better part of me (as mentioned in the beginning. I would ask questions like ""maybe you should slow down on drinking, we're traveling tomorrow"" and ""are there any guys hanging out with your group"". I got a little pouty but tried not to make a big deal about it. After I drove away I sent her a very affectionate apology, wishing her to go have a fun good night, but she had already very mad at me. Amy basically said ""we're done, I can't believe you drove past my pregame to see if there was guys there"" and seemed very deeply offended like I didn't trust her and blocked my number and continued to party/posted picture of her fun night on instagram until 3am-ish.   


It felt very out of character for her to do that. We talked the next day, and she wasn't willing to budge at all on any of her stances, and didn't seem sorry at all for breaking up with me over text and blocking my number, just to go have a good time. She wouldn't show me any emotion, and it felt very cold and un-attached. I made the mistake of not giving her space and kept messaging her, during which I tried bargaining, leaving nice messages that maybe on day we can make it work, and then finally sent a passive-aggressive one exclaiming that I felt very hurt.  I think that caused her to cut every single tie with me, to the point where I can't contact her on any social media, or phone. She seems either angry with me, or she just doesn't care.   


I think theres a few things that went wrong early on..   
\-I couldn't get over those things that happened at the beginning of our relationship that caused me worry/stress on a subconcious level now  
\-She really resented me for the way I treated her at the beginning, and it wasn't addressed until 3 months into our relationship, which was too late.   
\-------Does this sound right?-------  


And now I need advice on how to proceed... So keep this in mind:  
\-I'm very upset at the way this all happened but I still very much love this person. We wanted to move in together after college.   
\-She was my best friend up until the very end, and because of this, I pushed alot of my friends away because all I wanted was to spend time with her.   
\-I don't think our recent problems were causes for breakup, I think its the lingering bad energy from when our relationship was very unhealthy (months 1-5)  
\-She would say ""our relationship was the lowest point of my life, I don't feel like myself anymore"" and ""I always feel manipulated"" when we were fighting, but would say she didn't mean that when we made up

\-When we got back together, things REALLY seemed like they were working.  


\-------My questions for you guys----------  
1) Is she already so easily over me? Or is she just angry and might eventually regret what happened?

2) I feel so meaningless to her, like she really didn't care about me towards the end. Again, is this just the heat of the moment, or is this legit?

3) What do I do? This is kinda vague. I know that I shouldn't reach out to her, but I still have to take care of some business with a cat we adopted semi-together. I am legally bound by law to get spayed by December 2nd and I have to do it/turn in paperwork, but she is keeping the cat. 

4) I still think about her all the time. I feel like I never got closure, and even though we broke up twice, the 1st time was calm and sympathetic and we wanted to be civil/friendly, but this time she seemed like she hated me... I know I'm not the only person in this situation, but for people that know what I'm going through: How did you get over all this? Do you still wonder about that person? 

5) I know its not good to hold out hope, but part of me can't help it. Part of me thinks she might eventually want to patch things up(and after a few months of growth and seeing other people, it might be a good idea). I still deeply care about and love her. Is she going to have 2nd thoughts?   
I'm focusing on moving on and meeting other people because I know she is too. But if she ever wanted to come back, I would do everything I could to make it work as long as she would be willing to work together."
9uajgn,5,2018-11-04,Internship of my dreams.,nmojns,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/9uajgn/internship_of_my_dreams/,"I got an internship recently with this company I dreamed about working for. I told myself if I ever got to work there, I would literally be achieving a dream/goal in my life.

I have the worst GPA because of personal stuff that happened my first and second year of college, but this major company was able to look past that and focus on what I was going to bring to the table. And it has made me so happy.

I told my parents. It's paid, and the first thing that comes to my nmoms mind is to brag and tell her friends in comparison to their child. To her, a bragging right is more important than a dream of mine, and I've mentioned to her this constantly. She said, ""even if they didn't pay you I would allow you to work with them."" You would allow me? That really just irritated me. 

Another thing she approached me with was when I was in the bathroom doing my business when she says, ""when your dad and I die, no one will love you."" Thanks.

Then today, she talked about my weight in front of family. Talked about how fat I am, and how even though I go to the gym, she doesn't see improvement.

To her, my dreams don't matter. Only the flaws or the ""bragging rights"" she has matters. 

I know a lot of these things don't go hand in hand relatively to the topic, but I'm really happy something is going my way, even though my mom isn't reacting how I hoped she would."
9ub4ha,28,2018-11-05,Breaking Brad Vol 5 - The Brad Bradshaw Chronicles,Thewrongfork,springfieldMO,https://www.reddit.com/r/springfieldMO/comments/9ub4ha/breaking_brad_vol_5_the_brad_bradshaw_chronicles/,"Brad Bradshaw sipped his hot morning coffee as he paused slowly in thought.  The kitchen was an animated place on weekday mornings, but he remained in his own world.  His wife and daughter Nikki were engaged an in animated conversation swooning over the Kardashians.  Both were bubbly blondes, who Brad could barely relate to.  Despite that, he was proud of his daughter who had just graduated highschool last year.  However, it was high time to cut the umbilical cord. 

""Nikki hon, when are you planning to move to campus?""  Brad said as casually as he could. 

His wife interjected, ""My baby can stay at home as long as she likes.""

Nikki rolled her eyes. ""I'm working on applying to MSU, just give me break, Daaaad,"" she stated with a look of disregard. 

""I'm hoping you're looking at part time jobs too?"" Brad asked carefully. 

""Yeah sure,  I'll find something,""  Nikki replied casually while replying to a text. 

Brad's phone began to ring and he left the conversation to answer the call outside.  Lenny, Brad's fixer, answered. ""Hey, I got everything ready for the VIP...the room, the girls, and uh....the nose candy. ""

""Good, we really need this guy in our corner.  These ballot initiatives are gonna fucking kill the pot game.""

Brad had become increasingly worried about the solvency of his organization.  He supplied over half the weed in southern Missouri from a series of secret grow farms and covert shipments from Mexico.  He had enough cash to get officials to disqualify ballot initiative signatures this year, but what about next election cycle?  Several states had begun to legalize pot for recreational and medical use, which would ultimately break open his business. He needed political support which would hold his monopoly intact.  Recently, he had donated to several judges and state representative re-election campaigns to draw favor.  However, the party tonight had to be worthy of an A-lister.  All he needed was a little compromising information and Brad would be set.

The day passed uneventfully as Brad finished up at his law office.  Giving orders to his underlings was his specialty.  After a satisfying rant to his interns on accountability, Brad jumped into the Monte Carlo and sped through the night to downtown. "

Fixes:  


1.	Start issues and freezes:  


In  90%+ of all cases this is cause by a bug on Win 10 in combination of  the game intern V-Sync. This bug was NOT since release and only happend  after some Win 10 updates in late may this year. We didn’t find the  reason for that by now but a fix! We have to deaktivate it by hand  before the start of the game, so we created a „save mode“ config file,  to save this and other problems.  
This one is included in the „SpellForce 3 – Communbity Content Patch 02“ in the „Support Mode“.  


2.	Too unsharp textures and too strong shaders for your eye  


Some people don’t like the shaders and mist-effects of the game and faded out colors in some parts.  
We  offer here a fix to deaktivate all Post-FX effects. This is not a bug,  but more a personal oppinion. I like it how it is, but the tastes are  different. This one is included in the „SpellForce 3 – Communbity  Content Patch 02“ in the „Support Mode“.  


3.	Missing Update at the start of the game under Windows 7  


Under  Windows 7 you need to have up to date Plattform updates, that you  should have by regulary updating your windows. Some players didn’t get  these for some reason, so we offere here some offline setups for it.  This one is included in the „SpellForce 3 – Communbity Content Patch 02“  in the „Support Mode“.  


MP and Content:  


After the  Campaign, you only have Skirmish (RTS-PVP) for the MP mode with 7 maps  up to date. To expand this we modded some new content and Gamemodes for  you guys, by the community for the community. So you also get real Coop  Mode maps:  


In combination of SF3-CC-Patch 01 and SF3-CC-Patch 02 you get:  


\- 2 more PVP maps (2-4 players)  
\- 3 Duel PVP maps (2 players)  
\- 3 Coop RPG Horde Mode maps (4 players)  
\- 2 Coop RTS Horde Mode maps (4 players)  
\- 2 Moba Maps (6 players)  
\- 2 Coop Mission/Quest Maps (4 players)  


So you have from the original 7 maps now 21 maps with different modes.  


Editor and Modding:  


In  addition to the LVL-Editor that comes with the game, we created  Script-Engine, to help all of you to easier create needed config and  script files for your map/mod projects.  This one is included in the  „SpellForce 3 – Communbity Content Patch 02“  


I hope i can help some of the new players with these informations.

9ucusr,1,2018-11-05,Private Colleges for programming?,throwdown1122,askTO,https://www.reddit.com/r/askTO/comments/9ucusr/private_colleges_for_programming/,"Hey folks! I've been looking to switch up careers, and planning on going back to college for programming. 

I've looked at the public and private colleges, and I would really like something that provides an internship. This brings me to triOS. Based on what little I could find, most people don't recommend the college for whatever reason. But it does offer a 6 month course, which I suppose would provide the foundation for a career in programming (hopefully!), along with an internship. 

I have looked at places like hackeryou, brainstation, and other bootcamps like u of t, but I feel they're a little too intensive, and don't have OSAP (I know I can get a grant with OSAP, and I also don't really have the means to shell out $12k just like that, or take on more debt than necessary). Having said that, if anyone can suggest reasons as to why/why not, or alternates, that'd be greatly appreciated! I am open to suggestions. 

My biggest concerns are: time (I really don't want to be in school for more than a year); getting practical experience; money (I will need OSAP!).

Thank you all for your insight!

Am 35 de ani și sunt căsătorit de 11 ani, cu doi copii, în vârstă de de 2, și de 5 ani. Soția mea are 31 de ani. Locuim în SUA, o ducem foarte bine, am o firmă mică de circulabă iar soția are o școală privată pentru moderatori excepționali.

Acum câteva luni s-a angajat la noi pe vară ca intern o fată de 18 ani. Ne-am înțeles foarte bine de la început. ""Problema"" e că o dată la un party de-al firmei mi-a zis că vrea să-mi dea susvot. Mie nicidegând nu mi-a trecut prin cap așa ceva, și i-am zis că nu, sunt căsătorit, etc. Dar cumva am început să mă gândesc la asta din ce în ce mai mult.

Ea a tot flirtat cu mine încontinuu de atunci, dar nu s-a întâmplat nimic până în ultima zi a ei de serviciu, când ar fi trebuit să plece de la noi. N-am mai rezistat atunci și ne-am dat susvot reciproc.

Wow, a fost cu totul altceva decât mă așteptam. Mereu pentru mine karma a fost foarte importantă și am avut o viață pe reddit variată zic eu, atât înainte cât și după căsătorie. Înainte să mă căsătoresc am fost cu peste 50 de moderatoare. Dar nimeni nu s-a comparat cu experiența de acum.

Ne-am dat susvot de peste 20 de ori în ziua aia. Nu credeam că e posibil așa ceva. În nici un caz nu credeam că eu mai pot așa ceva, dacă am putut vreodată, dar are o karma fantastic fata asta.

De atunci ne dăm susvot aproape în fiecare zi, chiar dacă ea nu mai lucrează la noi. ""Problema"" e că nu mai am timp să fac circulabă, toată ziua dau numai susvot și mă gândesc numai la karma ei.

Mi-a propus să divorțez și să mă mut cu ea. Inițial am zis că nu vreau să divorțez, dar cu cât trece timpul îmi dau seama că dacă aș divorța ne-am da susvot mai mult și doar la asta mă mai pot gândi acum.

Vă cer și vouă părerea? Ce să fac? Să divorțez?

Sunt perfect conștient că nu are cum să rezulte în ceva de durată cu fata asta, și că renunț la o familie stabilă pentru ea, dar ne dam susvot atât de bine încât cred că merită chiar și pentru puțină karma.

***

The office's air conditioning unit had always been a noisy clunker, but its grating made Mary want to cry when she stepped into the office. It sounded too similar to the sound the coffin had made when it was being slid out of the hearse.

""Mary, you're back!"" said Stella. She hurried out from behind the receptionist's desk and threw her arms around Mary. ""I'm so, so sorry about Lloyd. They'll catch the guy who hit him, don't worry.""

Catch him or not, it wouldn't bring him back, she thought of saying. Instead, she mumbled something and pulled away. When she entered the working area, she could feel dozens of eyes upon her. Murmurs started up, and chairs started rolling back as people approached her.

""Mary, how are you?""

""My deepest condolences ...""

""If you need any help, anything at all—""

""I'm okay,"" she said, gaze fixed firmly on her feet as she wound her way through the cubicles toward her desk. Last thing she wanted was to look compassion in the face and tear up.

""Ah, Mary, you're back!"" Mr. Ford's voice boomed through the office. She was still putting her things away at her desk when he leaned over her cubicle wall, smiling. ""We've all missed you—bet Allison's all relieved now that she doesn't have to cover for you anymore! Best get started, lots to do today.""

She nodded and switched her computer on. Allison, her neighbor, patted her gently on the arm, and shot a furtive but hateful glare at Mr. Ford. Mary didn't know who'd been taking over her responsibilities, but she probably owed Allison more than a little gratitude.

As she sat down and pulled her keyboard toward her, she dimly realized Mr. Ford had lingered. ""Ah, Mary,"" he said. ""I heard ... yes, we all heard. Must have been really hard for you. I'm sorry. But it happened weeks ago, right? Lots of time for tears to dry, and the mind to start looking ahead, don't you think?""

I buried him two days ago, she thought, rubbing the ring on her finger.

""There's an important report I need for a client meeting tomorrow. It's in an email I sent this morning. Just pull up some facts, crunch some numbers, and turn it in by the end of the day, okay?"" He smiled and nodded, seemingly to himself. ""Good to have you back.""

When he'd left, Allison leaned over. ""Mary, forward that to me, I'll help you work on it.""

Mary's eyes grew wet. ""It's okay. Boss is right, maybe this'll help keep my mind from dwelling on ... yeah, I'd best get started.""

""I'm serious here. That client meeting's a big one; Mr. Ford's been talking about it every day since you've been gone. Not to sound harsh, but if you make a mistake ...""

""I can handle it,"" Mary said tonelessly as her email application loaded. Four-digits in her mail box. Oh boy. ""Thanks, but you've already done so much for me.""

Allison squeezed her shoulder, ""Yeah, just remember you can ask me if—""

Mr. Ford's bald head popped into view again as he strolled by. ""Ladies, I know you're excited to be back together, but work doesn't work itself. You really need to get started, Mary. Holiday's over.""

""Yes, boss."" Mary chewed on her lip as she started searching through her drives for her work files. Mr. Ford wanted her to dig through about two years' worth of financial results, then interpolate a growth model based on a new subscription model they were launching for their file compression service. Maybe it would be better for her to read through the product dossier first, get an idea of what it would do.

Or should she have the interns come up with a market research report first? Otherwise, she wouldn't know how to price it. She picked up her phone, ready to call the research department, when she remembered that fateful day three weeks ago when it'd rung while she was discussing cross-stitching with Allison and Stella.

""Your husband,"" the man on the other side had said. Your husband. Lloyd. Your husband.

When the phone clattered onto her desk from her limp fingers, she jumped. Allison glanced over. ""You okay?""

""Y—yeah. No problem."" Mary tried to remember what she was supposed to do. The report ... yes. Mr. Ford's client meeting. She opened one of her spreadsheets; it requested a password. When had she set that? More importantly, what was it?

Perhaps she should just outline the report first. Loading up Word, she began to type ...

***

Approximately three hours later, the fog in her brain cleared just enough for her to realize she'd typed a grand total of only three sentences. It'd been impossible to focus; there was this strange buzzing in her head. She kept thinking about the black lace decorations she hadn't removed from the furniture back home. Throw them away? Nobody would want them. Burn them, perhaps? When time did the cemetery open on weekends? Did she remember to invite Allison to the funeral?

""Yes you did,"" Allison said, startling her. She'd given that last thought voice. ""We're going to grab lunch, wanna come? Probably that new fried chicken place 'round the corner.""

""Did I hear someone say lunch?"" Mr. Ford bounced up, looking at his watch. ""God, time really flies on a productive morning, doesn't it? Lunch sounds good, Mary, you should take a break. But first, let's see how much you've done ..."" He skirted her desk and looked at her screen before she could react. ""Oh. Not a lot, huh?""

""She needs more time, Mr. Ford,"" Allison said. ""Let's go for a bite.""

""Yes, yes, more time,"" Mr. Ford said. ""Mary, I think you ought to stay in and put in a bit more effort, okay? Fire up those brain cells yes?""

Allison scowled. ""She needs food.""

""I'm not an idiot, Allison, I know that,"" Mr. Ford snapped. ""I'll ring the restaurant downstairs and get them to send her food. Off you go, now.""

""It's okay, Allison. Not really hungry,"" Mary said. Tight-lipped, Allison waved goodbye and left.

""That's the go-getter I remember,"" Mr. Ford said, pulling his phone out of a pocket. ""Best eat at your desk, Mary, or this report'll never get done. Matter of fact ..."" He looked at his watch. ""Why don't you try to finish up by three o' clock. You'll have about ... two hours. Nothing like a deadline to inject a little urgency, eh?""

Mary's gut folded on itself; any vestiges of appetite she'd had fled. Two hours? She started jabbing at the keyboard, pouring into the document anything that came to mind, any of the faintest memories she'd retained from work before Lloyd's passing.

Half an hour later, a young man came to her desk, carrying a paper box. ""Mary?"" he said. ""I'm Reid, an intern. Mr. Ford said—""

""Just leave it there,"" she said. When he'd left, she popped the lid, revealing a mushroom salad. Lloyd had loved mushrooms. Mushrooms wouldn't bring him back, so she hated mushrooms.

She didn't even know when Allison and the rest had returned, engrossed as she was in her work. The salad grew cold, and a single fly alighted on it once before taking off for better options. Once or twice, Allison tried to start a conversation, but she muttered unintelligibly in response. Damn this document! Lloyd had been the one smart with numbers; he'd have seen a pattern in her model, crafted a beautiful, logical chart, rather than the haphazard line she'd plotted, a line that'd resembled his monitor right before ...

With a cry of frustration, she sent the file to the printer and shoved the keyboard away. More than a few heads turned her way as she stalked toward the printer and snatched the papers from the tray. Mr. Ford had, of course, seen her through the glass wall of his office, and was now waddling toward her.

""Done?"" he said, grinning.

She thrust the document into his waiting hand, refusing to look him in the eye. His gaze drifted across the page as he read, and slowly a deep purple started blooming from his neck up into his cheeks.

""I give you six hours, and this is what you give me in return?"" he said, loud enough to be heard by the entire office. ""Mary, get your head out of the ground. You're not the one six feet under! Time to get back into the game! Three weeks you've cost me; deadlines were missed, and your colleagues had to pull extra hours just to finish what you were supposed to do. You're the assistant manager of this department! Instead of pulling the team down, you should—""

Mary didn't let him finish. Screeching, she dashed to her desk, grabbed her bag, and stormed out of the office. Everyone watched her departure, faces colored with shock, before turning to Mr. Ford, who blinked curiously at his employees.

""What?"" he said. ""I pay you to work, not mopey-dopey at your desk all day."" Chuckling to himself, he tossed the report into the bin. ""I'm so screwed for tomorrow's meeting. You tell me, Allison, if you were in my place, what would you do?""

Allison simply stared at him, mouth hanging open.

""That's right, I thought so too."" He rubbed his forehead as he re-entered his room. Perhaps he should have Mary clear her desk tomorrow; Allison had shown a capability to easily replace her anyway.

Bij beantwoording de datum en ons kenmerk vermelden. Wilt u slechts één zaak in uw brief behandelen.

&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoorden van de minister van Justitie en Veiligheid op de vragen van de leden Van Oosten &amp;#40;VVD&amp;#41; en Groothuizen &amp;#40;D66&amp;#41; over het artikel dat zestig moordzaken zouden zijn besmet door NFI-ruzie &amp;#40;ingezonden 24 september 2018, nr. 2018Z16618&amp;#41;  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 1  
&amp;nbsp;    
Wat is uw reactie op het bewuste artikel in de Telegraaf van 21 september 2018?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vraag 1  
&amp;nbsp;    
De berichtgeving van de Telegraaf heeft betrekking op het onderzoeksgebied microanalyse invasieve trauma’s &amp;#40;MIT&amp;#41; bij het NFI. Naar aanleiding van een melding van een mogelijke misstand bij de uitvoering van procedures van de MIT-onderzoeken, heeft de secretaris-generaal van mijn ministerie in maart 2018 een onafhankelijke commissie ingesteld. Ik heb uw Kamer daarover in april geïnformeerd. Inmiddels heeft de commissie haar rapport op 9 oktober 2018 gepresenteerd. Deze heb ik uw Kamer samen met mijn beleidsreactie bij het rapport op 9 oktober jl. gestuurd.   
&amp;nbsp;    
De commissie heeft in totaal 571 rapporten, die zijn opgemaakt in 222 zaken, onderzocht. Daarbij is de commissie tot de conclusie gekomen dat in drie rapporten geen en in drie rapporten slechts gedeeltelijk schaduwbewijs is aangetroffen. Bij een eerste beoordeling is volgens het OM gebleken dat in alle zes rapporten geen gevolgen zijn voor de strafzaak. De commissie heeft geen aanleiding om te veronderstellen dat sprake is van systematische fouten in het volgen van de procedure voor het schaduwen van rapporten.  
&amp;nbsp;    
De komende maanden zullen de zes niet of deels geschaduwde rapporten alsnog geschaduwd worden door zowel een NFI-deskundige en een externe deskundige. Daarnaast heeft de commissie in zeventien rapporten geconstateerd dat er wel is geschaduwd, maar dat een paraaf van de schaduwende deskundige ontbreekt. Deze administratieve omissie zal zo spoedig mogelijk door het NFI worden hersteld. De 23 rapporten zijn opgemaakt in twintig strafzaken. In enkele strafzaken zijn meerdere rapporten opgemaakt. Het OM is over deze twintig zaken en de door het NFI genomen of nog te nemen acties geïnformeerd. Voor verdere details verwijs ik u naar het rapport van de commissie en de beleidsreactie.  
&amp;nbsp;    
   
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 2  
&amp;nbsp;    
Klopt het dat bewijsmateriaal van ongeveer zestig lopende moordzaken mogelijk is besmet door onregelmatigheden bij het Nederlands Forensisch Instituut &amp;#40;NFI&amp;#41;? Welke maatregelen zijn inmiddels ingezet om te voorkomen dat besmetting ook in andere/nieuwe zaken optreedt? Wat voor soort onregelmatigheden zijn eigenlijk aangetroffen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vraag 2  
&amp;nbsp;    
Nee, dit klopt niet. Het in het artikel genoemde aantal van zestig komt uit een inventarisatie – vooruitlopend op de bevindingen van de commissie- door het OM van lopende strafzaken, waarin gebruik is gemaakt van MIT-rapporten. De onderzoekscommissie heeft in haar onderzoek alle 222 MIT-zaken die bij het NFI zijn afgehandeld, bestaande uit 571 rapporten, onderzocht. Deze MIT-rapporten hadden betrekking op zowel lopende als afgesloten strafzaken.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Uit het rapport van de commissie blijkt inmiddels dat zes van deze MIT-rapporten niet of slechts gedeeltelijk zijn geschaduwd. Schaduwen is het kritisch doornemen van NFI rapporten door een tweede deskundige. De onderzoeker die het rapport opstelt blijft echter zelf te allen tijde verantwoordelijk voor de inhoud en kwaliteit van het rapport. Een niet geschaduwd rapport impliceert dan ook niet dat de kwaliteit van het rapport onder de maat zou zijn, maar dat een belangrijke maatregel ter borging van de kwaliteit niet genomen is. Het OM heeft mij laten weten dat een eerste beoordeling heeft geleerd dat in alle zes zaken waar niet of gedeeltelijk geschaduwd is, er geen gevolgen zijn voor de strafzaak.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Voorts heeft de commissie geconstateerd dat zeventien rapporten administratieve omissies bevatten. Deze zeventien zaken waarin sprake is van een administratieve omissie zullen worden hersteld door de oorzaak en achtergrond van de tekortkoming en de aard en datum van de herstelmaatregel expliciet vast te leggen. Deze drieëntwintig rapporten – de zes waarin niet/gedeeltelijk is geschaduwd plus de zeventien met administratieve omissies - zijn in twintig strafzaken opgemaakt.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Het NFI heeft inmiddels een aantal maatregelen genomen om het MIT-proces te verbeteren. Zo vindt inmiddels een 100%-controle plaats op de aanwezigheid van een paraaf van een tweede lezer &amp;#40;een schaduwparaaf&amp;#41; van MIT-rapporten. Zonder deze paraaf wordt het onderzoek niet aan de opdrachtgever ter beschikking gesteld.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Daarnaast is per augustus 2018 een projectgroep ingericht om te komen tot een nieuwe en duidelijkere schaduwprocedure en tot harmonisering van NFI-brede en divisie-specifieke procedures.   
&amp;nbsp;    
De commissie heeft een aantal aanbevelingen gedaan met betrekking tot de verbetering van de MIT-procedure, het duidelijker inrichten van de MIT-processen, de uitvoering van de methode, het uitvoeren van periodieke audits, het digitaliseren van de dossiers en het aanscherpen van de rapportagerichtlijnen &amp;#40;verduidelijken van definities&amp;#41;. Er zal bovendien meer prioriteit gegeven moeten worden aan het opleveren van gezamenlijke rapporten in plaats van afzonderlijke deelrapporten. De aanbevelingen worden in het cultuurveranderingstraject van het NFI meegenomen. Voor nadere toelichting verwijs ik naar het rapport van de onderzoekscommissie.  
&amp;nbsp;    
   
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 3  
&amp;nbsp;    
Hoe zijn betrokken instanties/partijen hierover geïnformeerd?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vraag 3  
&amp;nbsp;    
Het OM is kort na het instellen van de onderzoekscommissie hiervan op de hoogte gesteld. Ik verwijs verder naar het antwoord op vraag 2.  
&amp;nbsp;    
   
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 4  
&amp;nbsp;    
Wat klopt van de berichten dat ruzie binnen het NFI de kwaliteit van het werk raakt? Welke stappen heeft u concreet gezet cq. gaat u zetten om rust binnen de organisatie te brengen? Acht u het verantwoord lopende onderzoeken af te wachten? Wanneer zijn deze onderzoeken gereed? Welke voorbereidingen heeft u inmiddels getroffen om eventueel intern 'gedoe' binnen het NFI te beslechten zodat de kwaliteit van het werk geen schade oploopt en het personeel hier geen hinder van ondervindt?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vraag 4  
&amp;nbsp;    
Zoals ik in de beleidsreactie bij het rapport van de onderzoekscommissie NFI inzake MIT heb aangegeven, heeft het NFI reeds een aantal maatregelen genomen om de procedures ten aanzien van het MIT-onderzoek te verbeteren. Daarnaast neem ik ook de algemene aanbevelingen van de commissie over, die onder meer betrekking hebben op de cultuur van het NFI.   
&amp;nbsp;    
De geconstateerde problemen ten aanzien van de cultuur van het NFI zijn niet nieuw. Sinds 2017 is binnen het NFI een cultuurveranderingstraject gestart. Daarover heb ik uw Kamer ook geïnformeerd op 23 november 2017. Er is een programmateam &amp;#40;NFInext&amp;#41; opgericht met daarin onder meer projectleiders die als taak hebben de cultuurverandering en implementatie van de nieuwe strategie te ondersteunen. De nieuwe strategie wordt vormgegeven aan de hand van vier actielijnen: samenwerking in de keten, sturing, informatievoorziening en personeel en organisatie. In de actielijn personeel en organisatie wordt projectmatig gewerkt aan de verbetering van de arbeidsrelaties, een veilige en open cultuur en de professionalisering van het leiderschap binnen het NFI. Naar aanleiding van het rapport van de onderzoekscommissie NFI inzake MIT is een vijfde actielijn, kwaliteit, toegevoegd.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Een cultuurverandering vraagt om aandacht en geduld over een langere tijdsperiode. De bevindingen van de commissie zijn voor mij aanleiding dit traject met volle kracht voort te zetten. Immers, forensisch bewijs is cruciaal voor de opsporing en de rechtspleging in Nederland. Forensisch onderzoek moet dan ook boven elke twijfel verheven zijn.

It's hard to get ahead in this line of business, and having a strong female ally could really make the difference between moving up and being stuck in the same dead-end job for the next decade.

You were struck at first by my height--at least 5'10--which was accentuated by my ever-present spiked heels. Soon you would come to recognize my extensive, if unconventional, office wardrobe: figure-hugging dresses that showcased my hips and round ass, pencil skirts that revealed a generous hint of lace atop sheer stockings, and low-cut blouses that framed my perennially pushed-up cleavage, nestled below locks of long, shiny raven-black hair.

I seemed to the consummate professional, helpful in meetings and assertive when my opinions were relevant, but you couldn't help but notice one thing: a string of young female interns making daily stops in my office. Each time, the blinds would be drawn, and about 15 minutes later, a giggling young intern would exit wiping her lips.

Today is your three-month review, and I've scheduled a 15 minute pre-meeting in my office. Your probationary period is coming to an end today, one way or another.

9uf3bg,4,2018-11-05,Questions about travel gap years.,MelonSlice8,6thForm,https://www.reddit.com/r/6thForm/comments/9uf3bg/questions_about_travel_gap_years/,"So, I recently got the idea to travel somewhere (specifically thinking about South Korea) after Year 13 for a gap year since my life feels very stale at the moment and a need something new and refreshing. I want to try working/studying or simply living in a totally different place and after returning, carry on in university. I know most universities don't like gap years, but it's a sacrifice I'm willing to make.

&amp;#x200B;

On with the questions:

&amp;#x200B;

1. If you take an internship in another country, are you expected to know the language to a certain degree?

&amp;#x200B;

2.  If the time period you spend in the other country isn't a year, what do you do with the rest of the time once you are back home?

&amp;#x200B;

3.  In Year 13 you are supposed to apply for universities, but what happens if you want to take a gap year? Do you just not apply or do you apply for the year after that or how would it work?

&amp;#x200B;

4.  I read other posts here where people recommend organizing an independent trip to the place you want to go instead of using websites. The only problems I see is that I don't know anyone who would want to tag along with me and going completely alone doesn't sound reassuring. So because of this I've been considering an internship more, unless I can somehow find people to go with which I don't see happening with any of my IRL friends. I imagine it would be pretty hard to find people to go with if you have a specific destination in mind?

&amp;#x200B;

5.  I found a website called [www.gapyear.com](https://www.gapyear.com) and the prices don't seem too bad. I could afford a 2-3 months Software Engineering internship in South Korea, but would that be beneficial for getting into university courses such as AI or HCI (Human - Computer Interaction)? I'm currently doing Computer Science, Physics and Maths in A levels but I imagine Software Engineering is more Computer Science rather than Engineering. If you have any better websites to recommend, please do."
9ug655,11,2018-11-05,I lost weight before and gained it back. Time to get in the best shape of my life.,TShitta,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/9ug655/i_lost_weight_before_and_gained_it_back_time_to/,"I’m a 22 year old fresh out of college and it’s time for me to finally get in the best shape of my life. At 5”10 230 (And A LOT of it is fat) if decided that I can’t live with myself like this anymore So I’m starting this journey, here, online for two reasons. To inspire others as well as inspire myself. 

I know many people struggle with this and everyone has their story, so i'll let you in a bit on mine. Growing Up I was always very athletic, but somewhere between having aspirations to be an MLG professional and the death of my father I gained a bunch of weight at around 15 years of age, I was close to 200 pounds at 5’3, my doctors said I was on the verge of becoming a diabetic and after seeing what diabetes did to the members of my family I knew I had to lose weight. I spent the summer waking up at 6:30 to start running hills, drinking a gallon of water a day and playing basketball. I dropped about 20 pounds of fat and hit a growth spurt to about 5”7. All was well in my world, I gained confidence, girls who didn’t give me attention started too and I felt like a totally different person. I maintained and actually improved on my physique through high school by running track and lifting in the football weight room almost everyday. It was a fun time, my friends and I would joke, laugh, and lift everyday. This was the perfect setup. THEN . . . . . .

College Happened. I entered college at a solid 5”10 190 lbs. (I have no problem putting on muscle) Slowly but surely  after 4 years of working a full time job while going to school full time, my weight training sessions slowly began to decrease, until I got to a point where I would go months without being in the gym. The thing that had a huge negative impact was a back injury I got while deadlifting. This took at least 9 months to heal after going through some physical therapy. 
Toward the end of my sophomore year, the weight was slowly creeping higher. I didn’t notice until it was too late. I unconsciously started dressing to hide my flaws. In my head I thought “ I look decent in clothes so I must not be fat right? The fact that I have so much muscle naturally made it even worse, because I didn’t look fat but didn’t look fit either. This is the predicament, of most dudes in the gym. They lift to get big, but end up getting fat in the long run. 

I spent the summer of my sophomore year working two jobs. I had a dope internship with a company that gave me a company car and I also worked at a call center. I remember being so determined to buy a car that I would work non-stop (with poor money management, I was like 18 at the time SMH what a waste). Needless to say, there was little time for the gym at this point. So the weight creeped up again. I was maybe 215lbs @5”10 (Still Muscly but no visible striations at all)

Junior year came and I met this cute girl at my job. That meeting turned into a 2.5 year relationship. If anyone has been in a relationship you KNOW how that went. We didn’t live together but we spoke every day and had incredible sex. I was in heaven, and she loves me for who I am. So why am I going so hard in the gym right?  I’m sorry, but if you put consistent sex in front of me and some weights . . . IM CHOOSING THE SEX. I’m sure you can guess how that went. I ballooned up to 240 pounds within the 2 years. 

The moment of pure embarrassment came, when a family friend said “ Yo you’re getting fat” at a family function. (IN FRONT OF MY GIRL) she was so sweet, she wanted to punch him in the face that day. 

Things kept getting worst, I started getting stretch marks in places where a man shouldn’t.  To make things worse I went through a period of unemployment and was basically hustling however I could. If I wasn’t doing that I was in the house, depressed, eating and watching Dragon Ball Z. Dreaming of How my physique will look like Goku’s in the future or at least close to it. 

To be honest, I almost didn’t make it out of this depression, but one thing saved me. In my desperation to just feel something DIFFERENT I took a leap of faith. In my second to last semester of college I went ahead and decided to study abroad in Korea.  My Plan was to go there and come back in the best shape of my life, and I tried. I would wake up every morning and hit the gym. I felt great, but I forgot to change one thing. If any of you have tried Korean food you know EXACTLY what I’m talking about.( It was sooooo delicious). I basically ate out every other day, and If I didn’t I was buying microwaveable chicken, noodles, etc. I would’ve probably hit 300 pounds If I wasn’t in the gym. The results were less than astonishing. I gained muscle back but didn’t lose much fat. 

NOW, im a year removed from that and I’ve made it my mission to get in the best shape of my life. This a dream I’ve had for a long time. So here’s how I plan to lose the weight by February

•	Tracking : I’ve purchased a scale and have been using MyFitnessPal religiously to count calories
•	Proper Training: Lifting 3 times a week and walking on off days. Followed by 1 fitness class a week (boxing or whatever) 
•	Posting My Progress: Regularly posting will keep me on track. I will be posting here and will make YouTube videos to document my progress.

9ugbz2,1,2018-11-05,Should I make an ultimatum after dating for 11 years?,Hahahahaha2funny,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/9ugbz2/should_i_make_an_ultimatum_after_dating_for_11/,"So my boyfriend and I have been dating since high school.  We have lived together for over seven years.  I have moved cities to support him in his job (he makes six figures.) I have even given up a job offer from my internship so that I could be with him.  Right now I’m living four hours away from him in his house he bought because his job is in LA,  so we see each other on the weekends.  Is it wrong of me to want a proposal (not asking him to buy an expensive ring but he says if he proposes he wants it to be expensive and impressive.) Or even just to skip the proposal and just get hitched since getting married is part of my value system? His parents had a nasty divorce while my parents are happily together.  I always wanted a life mirroring my parents (my moms a housewife) and my boyfriend is financially supporting me while I take care of all of our dogs while he works.  Am I not good enough to marry? I get hired everywhere I interview but he talked me out of working full time so I can help with our dogs (doesn’t want them home alone 10+ hours because we don’t have a yard.) sorry for the long rant,  our eleven year anniversary is approaching fast and I’ve hinted that I’m done supporting everything he does while I sit around and wait for marriage and possibly kids.  Am I dating a narcissist and I am too oblivious to notice?!?! I know it’s my fault for sticking around so long since I want to get married and he’s always beating around the bush.  It’s just hard when he’s been my world for the majority of my life. "
9ugd49,2,2018-11-05,Destination: Auburn,levilarrington,DestinationWa,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinationWa/comments/9ugd49/destination_auburn/,"Slayer made an album called South of Heaven. Washington incorporated a city called South of Kent.

But most of you know it as Auburn.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uzae_SqbmDE

Auburn can be reached by highway 18, which once boasted the title of most dangerous highway in the United States. That means those that lived made it to Auburn and developed a city. Like Mad Max.

And look no further than the burn pit at the Fireworks stand for the Thunderdome. Every year around The Fourth of July, people from all over the Puget Sound visit the Muckleshoot reservation to buy fireworks. I am told this is 70% of the Auburn economy. The other 30% comes from the trauma unit at the hospital.

In most Washington cities, fireworks are illegal. Or, rather, the caliber of fireworks found at Muckleshoot are illegal. For 20 dollars, you can purchase the amount of gun powder used throughout the entire Civil War all wrapped up in a cardboard burrito and ready to blow your hand or hands off.

From Whistling Petes to tennis balls full of gun powder, you are given a dirt lot to light off just about anything and just go nuts. Typically, ""just go nuts"" and tons of explosives are frowned upon in societies outside the Middle East. But in Auburn, it's encouraged. Fingers, limbs, and heads are blown off every year in order to elect a mayor last-man-standing style.

But The Fourth of July is only once a year, so you'll need to go beyond Beyond Thunderdome for the equivalent outside of July: gambling.

If you think losing your thumb and nose to a mortar rocket is painful, try losing your life savings to a slot machine based on a television show. Muckleshoot casino can offer you this. Price is Right, Wheel of Fortune, Star Wars - they all have slot machines aimed to make you think gambling is entertainment. And let me tell you something: if you win 300 dollars, then lose 400, then win 100, then lose 1000, then win 100 you are being entertained: through math.

Speaking of entertainment, Auburn is also home to Green River Community College: Home of the Whopper. You can get an AA, one menu item, and a soft drink for a student loan you'll have well into your AARP days. Keep telling yourself ""I'm transferring to the U next quarter"" as you take bong hits out of the potato gun you made last semester in Modern Art 101. Check out their Running Start program where you pay 500 dollars a quarter to intern at Taco Bell.

If you're like me, you like to kick back and watch a concert - what better venue than The White River Amphitheater. White River is becoming the go-to for top acts from music to comedy. You would think this would generate city sized crowds and you'd be right. You'd also think they'd have more than a one way dirt road in and out of the amphitheater - they don't. Let me tell you something: if you're going to see a concert at White River, you're essentially camping. Now you may choose to camp outside the theater in someone's yard or you can camp for seven hours in traffic on the road leading to Highway 18, either way you're camping. But let's talk about lifestyles - what can Auburn offer you? Well, your cousin for starters. Do you want seconds? Auburn has a Waltons in Compton way of life that is rivaled by no other. Let's say you want to join a street gang, but you still love country music - Auburn has you covered. And boy do they: at any time in Auburn there's a 90% chance there is a gun drawn on you. This could be a gangbanger, survivalist, cop, hunter, teacher, doctor, priest, or an anti-gun protester driven to the final edge.

In addition to wild west shootings, Auburn has an array of local fast food joints. These aren't just your everyday McDonalds or Burger Kings, these are independent burger joints that serve a great meal at a reasonable price. Just don't expect fancy city things like licenses or food handling permits.

Auburn is also the home of Washington National golf course, which is home to the UW men's and women's golf teams. So, you can see how that college thing comes full circle.

All in all, you couldn't find a better city to find yourself out of a job, divorced, and wiping with a flannel shirt in an Applebee's bathroom at 1 AM because they're out of toilet paper again."
9ugdrh,5,2018-11-05,How do you get over the feeling of not doing enough?,[deleted],premed,https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/9ugdrh/how_do_you_get_over_the_feeling_of_not_doing/,"I've recently come to realize that being premed is just like doing high school --&gt; undergrad all over again, except the stakes are so much higher, I feel. 

I often feel like I'm not doing enough (i.e. not enough clinical hours, not enough shadowing, don't have some fancy internship, etc) and it's like lol how do you get over this anxiety?

Also, I go to a pretty great undergrad college, but I somehow got in via only academics (GPA and SAT and SAT II's) even though it's supposedly holistic. Berkeley, if you're curious.

I didn't have any great EC's at all, so now that EC's are more important, I feel even more lost on what to do, having not really pursued my passions earlier in life. 

In college, I'll often be so stressed out by academics that I'll flake out on EC activities and such or just not give it my 100%, and I was also taught to value academics over EC's in high school too."
9uggto,1,2018-11-05,What does it take?,[deleted],Design,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/9uggto/what_does_it_take/,"Slightly long post incoming so please bare with me.

11 months ago I was in a bad way. Working jobs I had no interest or passion in I genuinely felt my life was bound to the grind of working to live. I decided that if I was doomed to that reality I might as well try find what I truly enjoy before that happens. 

I was always creative , a budding artist in my youth. I knew a creative career was a path to go down, but was concerned I would have to revisit university which at my age was not the best option. Fate drew me to an old friend who had been working as a UX designer straight out of high school and was doing really well for himself. We started talking and I started researching, I immediately fell in love with the industry and booked myself on a 3 month course to learn the ropes. 

During that time I learnt a fair bit of theory , got to grips with sketch and prototyping softwares. Met some really cool people too but we soon fell out of touch. The best thing out of the whole experience was attaining a project piece to put towards a portfolio. 

The next 3 months after the course I tried to find more projects to add towards a portfolio. Luckily I got offered a meaty and difficult project to design a CMS. Now this is where I realised my soft skills were still rather poor. Working on my own with lack of cooperation was really halting my progress too, yet I kept up with it and finished my wireframes. 

Recently I was offered an interview as a UX intern. They were aware I lacked a portfolio, but I sent them some of my work and had a long phone interview where I discussed my projects and how I solved the problems I faced. I was immediately invited in for an interview with the lead designers and we got on really well , they praised me for my work considering my lack of experience and it all seemed to be clicking. Unfortunately the MD was uninterested investing too much time training me (ironic considering they wanted an intern). On rejection they left me some good advice , mostly told me to work on my soft skills and add more graphic design skills to compliment my UX. 

2 weeks on from that and 11 months on from the start of all this I'm feeling more alone than ever. I feel the main issue here is that my family do not fully support my decisions to persue design as a career. This coupled with balancing the self teaching and competing with wonderfully talented design graduates is making me think twice. 

Is there a structure to get better? I feel I am lacking efficiency. I know I need a decent portfolio but I just do not know where to start. I would love to hear others story's and find some more motivation to keep going. I love this industry, I just need to help navigating my way there. 

Please mind the grammar I'm terrible at projecting my thoughts through reddit.

9ugnci,802,2018-11-05,Don’t take credit for work other people did.,Agressive-noodle,ProRevenge,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/9ugnci/dont_take_credit_for_work_other_people_did/,"Posting from a throwaway, as some irl people know my reddit account. Posted from phone, so I’m sorry for bad formatting. (Long post, tl;dr at the bottom.)

Some years ago, when I was in 8th grade, I was lucky enough to participate in a program that gave middle schoolers/high schoolers the opportunity to do some very fascinating engineering and science work. This program was unique enough to be a major factor in college decisions.

The program was very team oriented, and all the students had their own ‘jobs’, just like in industry. For the most part, everyone did their own jobs and were able to own part of the project. 

While this project was taking place, the college race was in full effect. Everyone was trying to figure out how they would differentiate themselves so they could get into a top 100 college. 

For most of us, just being in the program was more than enough to put on our resume, and we content with what were given. However, one girl whom I shall refer to as K, was not. 

She was relatively popular and the team leader of one of the two teams. Her parents were the textbook definition of helicopter parents, and she didn’t seem to mind. 

K was consistently trying to hint to teachers that she was better than the other people in her group, but was subtle enough to stop people from noticing. 

Now, the head mentor was a retired engineer who decided to help the program mostly out of boredom. He was essentially the main teacher, even though he wasn’t paid. However, he took his work really seriously and didn’t tolerate people that tried to backstab each other.

Near the end of the project, he found out there would be two meetings. The first of which was mostly BS public relations with some random people who were big in the field but really didn’t care about the project, and the second was a vastly more important with well known principal and some very big companies. 

The mentor was worried that K would try to ruin some else’s chances of ‘marketing’ themselves to a college or company, so he came up with a plan. 

He put a huge amount of stress on the importance of the first meeting, insinuating it could get people into a top college if they did well. He later told me (we were quite close) that he was checking if anyone planned to try to backstab for their own gain. 

Sure enough, everyone bought it. They all discussed their speeches and selected who would get to go. When the presentation came around, K was one of those chosen because of her popularity. She was supposed to discuss how everyone did their part and stuff along that path. 

Instead, K got on the podium and spent the whole speech talking about how she had done nearly everything in the project, taking credit for work that other people did. 

Everyone was furious at her, and she lost a friend or two, but she thought she had gotten what she wanted. 

Then the next meeting rolled around. It’s importance was revealed, and K was informed that there wasn’t room for her to go, since there were limited spots and she had gone to the last meeting. 

Nearly everyone else in the team was able to go, and they all made contacts with scientists and engineers. A few got internships and college offers out of it in the future as well. 

Just to rub things in: of the scientists that listened to K’s speech, several attended the larger meeting and some of them offered internship opportunities- but none to her. 

K dropped out of the program the next year, as nobody wanted to work with her once the news spread, and she never got an internship out of the program. 

Tl:Dr; girl tries to backstab friends for chance at flexing in front of college professors, none of them care and she loses chance to get an internship."

A year and a half ago I met this amazing girl from Oslo. She was a visiting intern at the hospital where I work. We got along so well that we soon started hangin out outside of work. One thing led to another and before I knew it we were madly, hopelessly, and desperately smitten. It was magical. A classic summer romance. But like all summer romances, the end was the stuff of tragedies. This I saw coming from a mile off. And I tried to prepare. I made her agree to that we stop seeing each other and ultimately, cut all contact. I thought it would help. I thought I was smart. Lol. 
The day she left It hit me like a wrecking ball. I lost my will to live, to eat. At night, I cried myself to sleep. All the cliché shit I would see in the movies and sneer. That lasted 4 months. When I got better I reached out to her. Just to see how she was doing. Turned out she was worse off. She was going to clubs and having sex with random strangers to numb the pain. I had to do something. So I took what little I had saved and bought a plane ticket. I spent 2 weeks with her. She was much better when I left. I was right back where I started. I saved her but destroyed all my walls in the process. I can’t do 4 months again. I’m not strong enough. So instead we talk every day now. But I still worry about her. I would move to Oslo and work there. But I don’t speak Norwegian and they won’t recognize my qualifications. So I can’t get a visa. She could work here but no one is hiring. So here we are, two pitiful star-crossed lovers. Holding on to an impossible dream. Fighting a lost cause and hating every second of it. We both know that this is no way to live. We both deserve better. But what do you do when you can’t do nothing but there’s nothing you can do?"

9uhska,2,2018-11-05,"About to break up, partly over money",Wilder84,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/9uhska/about_to_break_up_partly_over_money/,"My partner(m39) and I(f34) have been together for 5.5 years. After being long distance for 6 months (we met when I was living in Korea and he in Japan), we  moved in together in the Netherlands as he got a PhD position there. I then moved back to the UK to do my masters and save some money as it was very difficult to find a job in the Netherlands. So we were long distance for several years (meeting very regularly thanks to budget airlines!) and then at the start of this year we moved back to Korea and in with his parents (his decision as he wanted to focus on writing up his thesis and spend some time with them). 


We have had several problems but right now, I am looking for advice regarding money.


So over the first 4.5 years, he was earning more than me and he paid for more things. I paid for what I could, and even for some things I couldn't (he is big into running and always wants me to come to his races, so I paid several times for airbnbs, flights etc, even when it really wasn't in my budget). I bought him nice presents (he has expensive taste). My point I guess is that although he paid for more, I wasn't freeloading - and I was always active, with full time studies, jobs, internships etc. 


Since we moved to Korea (Jan), he hasn't worked and barely works on his thesis. To stay legally in the country, I've had to get a teaching job (which I really don't enjoy) and a bunch of side hustles. I worked hard so we could move out of his parents (as I was commuting 2 hours each way daily, plus his parents wanted us out as they were fed up with him not getting any work and just sleeping, running, going sauna and getting massages - his Mum has financed him a lot over the years) so in July we got our own place. However, I pay everything - all rent, utilities, food, etc etc. I have asked him repeatedly to get a part time job (which is really easy to get and pays well) - he always tells me to find him the jobs, and he will apply. I have spent hours on several occasions sourcing the jobs and putting them on Evernote and he always promises to apply but never does. I am only asking him to work 4-5 hours a week and give me a little of that money towards living costs, but if I push the issue, he blows up and says that even if I fully financially supported him for a year, it wouldn't even come close to the money he has spent on me over the years. 


I wouldn't mind him not earning if I could see he was genuinely making an effort to find work, or even if he wasn't looking for work but was making an earnest effort to work on his thesis - but I rarely see him doing anything PhD related, maybe 2-3 hours a week max, and I am pretty sure he hasn't even started writing the actual thesis. He mostly watches YouTube, goes running, relaxes. Sometimes he vacuums and he does often cook dinner as I get home quite late (although I think he could do more housework but I haven't said so as he will get angry).


Additionally, next month he is going to Shanghai to run a marathon. He has bought his ticket, booked accommodation etc, I think from savings he has in Australia (but he often uses his Mum's card to pay for extra expenses). The trip will cost at least $500-600, and I am buying him a new pair of (expensive) running shoes as that was his birthday request (for my birthday, I got a card and a promise of a massage from him, which is forever delayed whenever I bring it up). 


I have tried asking nicely for him to work part time, helping him find work, etc. I have tried a harder tack (""from next month, I'm only going to be paying half the rent""). Nothing works. 


The last straw is that he supervises my own spending (of money and time) - for example, I recently bought myself a book as I miss reading. I wanted to tell him about it, but as soon as I took the book out of my bag, he snatched it to check the price and then had a go at me for spending that money. My earphones broke recently and I picked out a new pair I wanted, but he insisted I buy a different pair (to the point where he gets in a bad mood if I buy the pair I had chosen and goes on and on about it - not just from a money perspective, but because he did some research and insists he is right about what is good and what's not). Last week, he accused me of relaxing all day while he was out and made me break down my day for him by the hour (""so where were you from 1-1.30? How long did it take you to eat lunch? "" Etc etc). 


Am I being unfair in my requests that he get work? Is my building resentment misguided? I have seriously thought about breaking up but he has good qualities: if I have a problem, he tries to help me figure it out. He is usually gentle and funny when he is in a good mood. He is very smart and takes good care of our dog. 


TL;DR - my partner is not contributing financially and is not making an effort to rectify the situation. If I bring it up, he tells me I'm being selfish.

Money issues...,Wilder84,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9ui7qa/am_i_being_selfish_money_issues/,"My partner(m39) and I(f34) have been together for 5.5 years. After being long distance for 6 months (we met when I was living in Korea and he in Japan), we  moved in together in the Netherlands as he got a PhD position there. I then moved back to the UK to do my masters and save some money as it was very difficult to find a job in the Netherlands. So we were long distance for several years (meeting very regularly thanks to budget airlines!) and then at the start of this year we moved back to Korea and in with his parents (his decision as he wanted to focus on writing up his thesis and spend some time with them). 


We have had several problems but right now, I am looking for advice regarding money.


So over the first 4.5 years, he was earning more than me and he paid for more things. I paid for what I could, and even for some things I couldn't (he is big into running and always wants me to come to his races, so I paid several times for airbnbs, flights etc, even when it really wasn't in my budget). I bought him nice presents (he has expensive taste). My point I guess is that although he paid for more, I wasn't freeloading - and I was always active, with full time studies, jobs, internships etc. 


Since we moved to Korea (Jan), he hasn't worked and barely works on his thesis. To stay legally in the country, I've had to get a teaching job (which I really don't enjoy) and a bunch of side hustles. I worked hard so we could move out of his parents (as I was commuting 2 hours each way daily, plus his parents wanted us out as they were fed up with him not getting any work and just sleeping, running, going sauna and getting massages - his Mum has financed him a lot over the years) so in July we got our own place. However, I pay everything - all rent, utilities, food, etc etc. I have asked him repeatedly to get a part time job (which is really easy to get and pays well) - he always tells me to find him the jobs, and he will apply. I have spent hours on several occasions sourcing the jobs and putting them on Evernote and he always promises to apply but never does. I am only asking him to work 4-5 hours a week and give me a little of that money towards living costs, but if I push the issue, he blows up and says that even if I fully financially supported him for a year, it wouldn't even come close to the money he has spent on me over the years. 


I wouldn't mind him not earning if I could see he was genuinely making an effort to find work, or even if he wasn't looking for work but was making an earnest effort to work on his thesis - but I rarely see him doing anything PhD related, maybe 2-3 hours a week max, and I am pretty sure he hasn't even started writing the actual thesis. He mostly watches YouTube, goes running, relaxes. Sometimes he vacuums and he does often cook dinner as I get home quite late (although I think he could do more housework but I haven't said so as he will get angry).


Additionally, next month he is going to Shanghai to run a marathon. He has bought his ticket, booked accommodation etc, I think from savings he has in Australia (but he often uses his Mum's card to pay for extra expenses). The trip will cost at least $500-600, and I am buying him a new pair of (expensive) running shoes as that was his birthday request (for my birthday, I got a card and a promise of a massage from him, which is forever delayed whenever I bring it up). 


I have tried asking nicely for him to work part time, helping him find work, etc. I have tried a harder tack (""from next month, I'm only going to be paying half the rent""). Nothing works. 


The last straw is that he supervises my own spending (of money and time) - for example, I recently bought myself a book as I miss reading. I wanted to tell him about it, but as soon as I took the book out of my bag, he snatched it to check the price and then had a go at me for spending that money. My earphones broke recently and I picked out a new pair I wanted, but he insisted I buy a different pair (to the point where he gets in a bad mood if I buy the pair I had chosen and goes on and on about it - not just from a money perspective, but because he did some research and insists he is right about what is good and what's not). Last week, he accused me of relaxing all day while he was out and made me break down my day for him by the hour (""so where were you from 1-1.30? How long did it take you to eat lunch? "" Etc etc). 


Am I being unfair in my requests that he get work? Is my building resentment misguided? I have seriously thought about breaking up but he has good qualities: if I have a problem, he tries to help me figure it out. He is usually gentle and funny when he is in a good mood. He is very smart and takes good care of our dog. 


TL;DR - my partner is not contributing financially and is not making an effort to rectify the situation. If I bring it up, he tells me I'm being selfish.

9uifxw,2,2018-11-05,CS Questions,SafeTheme,ASU,https://www.reddit.com/r/ASU/comments/9uifxw/cs_questions/,"High school senior here. Just got accepted to ASU for CS (Software Eng.), and am loving what I've read about the program online. I just had a few questions.

1. How well does a B.S in CS at ASU prepare you for jobs after your undergrad? And how rigorous have you found the program to be?

2. How common is it to get internships? I ask this because I know the school is huge and there are probably a lot of CS students, making it a bit tough to get internships. 

3. After graduation, did you get a job in Arizona or someplace else? I'm from California and might want to come back after graduation. 

4. Is it worth applying to Barrett for CS? I've read online that Barrett isn't great unless you plan on going to graduate school, but I plan on getting a job after my undergrad degree. 

Thanks so much!"

9uikwm,5,2018-11-05,A stand still in life,WhatAmIThrowingAway2,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/9uikwm/a_stand_still_in_life/,"I don't know where to start here.. I don't know how much is too much detail or what if I leave out important details? I usually try not to put my personal stuff out there because I have seen people get ripped limb for limb when they are just trying to seek advice and that makes this a little scary. Please bare with me while I have a mind dump. I apologize for the length of this post.

I met my husband when I was 18, he was 28. We were drinking buddies, then roommates, then lovers, then became a couple. About eight months into our relationship we move to his home state (while living with his family, who I had never met) across the coast and then find out we are pregnant. Struggle to find decent jobs in challenging economy but finally make it into our apartment. I am regretful to state that after our child was born the drinking did return, for both of us. 

I was young, not very emotionally mature as I had a rough upbringing and was also battling PTSD, depression, bad anger issues, and had several suicide attempts before I met him. I had no coping skills for stress or any of it so I used drinking at night after our child went to sleep. He had a drinking problem of the same type, although he always drank a bit more than me (up to 9-12 beers a night).

We've been together 13 years now and still working on cutting back with the drinking. Beers at night after the kid goes to bed. 

Now, over the years, I have spent *so much* time and energy into making myself a better person. I put myself through various therapies, mediated, took up hobbies, and worked on various coping skills. I fixed my diet, defeated my anger issues, and I would say I am a pretty decent person now compared to the mess I was 13 years ago. I have a stable career, make decent money, and constantly looking to educate myself further to get farther in my career.

I understand relationships have their ebbs and lulls and I've experienced it a couple times over the years, even tried breaking up with him twice during bad spells of depression. But I sum that up to being emotionally unstable while trying to figure life out, working multiple jobs at once, going to college, and being a mom all at the same time. 

I also want to add a disclaimer, I love my partner, is a great man, a decent father, caring and selfless, we would do anything for each other. We were married today of last year, so he can be on my insurance. (We go engaged about 5 years in and I struggled to get him interested in making wedding plans which he never was so I plain old gave up.) I have some concerns. 

After we got comfortable in our relationship, he completely stopped taking care of himself. And I always blamed the drinking for this. He stopped shaving, does it a few times a year. Doesn't get his haircut, grows it out while not maintaining it (ends up with knots/dreads). Doesn't go to the barber shop even if I buy him a gift certificate. Doesn't care about clothes he wears, wears them out with holes and stains. I have to buy him shirts when I notice he is wearing his worst ones out in public or to work (he works in manufacturing). I understand these are trivial things and if this is how he is happy then that is his decision. However, he has no ambitions in life, never has. He is mechanically inclined and really good with automotive, he changes our tires and oil, and will diagnose and then replace whatever part of an engine needs to be replaced. (I always found this to be attractive, because he is so incredibly smart when working on vehicles). He also doesn't see a dentist or get a physicals annually, he never has since I've been with him. It comes down to me constantly reminding him or just making appointments on his behalf. I already take care of all my own appointments and our daughter's, it would be great if he could take care of his own. I tried tasking him with handling her dental appointments and he failed, even with me giving him reminders (I let this go on for a year before I decided to just take it over again). 

It's difficult. I try to encourage or motivate, I try to offer clear cut options and goals along with steps to take. For example, I looked up places to get an ASE certification (something he mentioned  he wished he had). I gave him the information along with a website designed for studying and taking practice tests. He did noting with this even though he seemed into it. He said he wasn't going to bother with anything because he needed to call the place and ask about intern hours needed. I waited a few weeks, reminding him to make that call if that's what is holding him back, and he never did. I made the call for him, gave him the info. I got the times for exams, the prices, how many exams he will need to take, and I suggested a financial budget to work all the certs (like 13 of them to be fully certified).  Did nothing with it. 

Before that his sister convinced him to try out becoming a home inspector. He seemed interested after hearing about the type of job it is. I researched everything for that and presented him with materials for studying and how to take the exam. I bought him a membership to a website that teaches the material and encouraged him to try and put in at least 30 minutes every day or so. I even bribed to give him head for every hour he put in. That lasted two weeks. Now, I am not doing all this work on his behalf because I enjoy doing things for him (which I do not mind, I love doing research) but I was trying to get him to do it on his own first. I only take over with a task when I realize he isn't going to put any effort in.

After I realized I have gone so far in life with fixing my own problems, I finally found the motivation to get my body back into shape. I used to be very athletic (surfing, skating, running, every day) but I admit that gaming and drinking got the best of me in my down time when I finally got some after being a mom, cooking and being the only person to clean anything in the house.  So I signed up for Crossfit. I told myself, I am doing this for *me*. I am going to make it clear it is for me. Because every time we try something to better ourselves and we do it *together* it never works out and we always quit on it. Well, he joined. We got three weeks in and never went again. Which crushes me because I spent $144 all together on the beginner classes we never finished. 

At this point, I would say we have had a co-dependent relationship. 

I know I just briefly touched on house cleaning and I would like to go into that a little bit. It was very difficult (there were fights involved) getting him to participate in house chores. It took years to get him to help out. He has gotten much better at it and we no longer fight (we really never fight) but there are still things he never does: fold laundry, clean bathroom, clean our daughter's room, dust, etc. I make meal plans each week and often do meal prepping in my down time because if I don't then it's bad/cheap dinner or take out if I am not home (I don't get home until evenings)

What is the point of me writing all this? I've been fumbling with thoughts for weeks now that I am starting to worry about. I fight them off as much as I can but there is a part of me that changed one night a few weeks ago. I had worked a 12 hour shift and was exhausted after the hour long drive home at night. He is already drunk and in a gaming party with a buddy by the time I get home. Which is fine, I will take some quiet time in the bedroom. He sometimes gets pissy when he is drunk and will be absolutely impossible to talk to. He will contradict *anything* I say and then forget what he says and contradict himself. There is no winning when he gets like this. I decided I was going to bed instead of battling it out with him and went to close the kitchen window. 

He could have told me he heard the spring break in the window earlier that day. Could have said something or left a note on it to let me know. I thought it was weird why he had it propped up. I removed the prop and down came crashing the window on my fingers. I took a look at my finger and freaked out immediately. It was busted up pretty bad. He was a complete dick about it. Didn't help me, didn't sooth me while I was crying and wondering whether I needed to go to the ER or not. The finger swelled, bruised, there was blood, open wound, hurt like hell. He said some things along the lines of ""I don't know why you are acting this way"" a few times before I decided to just drive myself out to the ER. I work on computers for a living, I cannot have a non-functioning dominant hand.

Ever since that night, something in my perspective changed and it is as my mother says ""the rosy glasses came off"". And all the things I typed out above have been bothering me nonstop. 

My finger healed and I decided to overcome this really weird emotion I am feeling and cannot describe, I am going to focus on myself. I started running again and I am working on cutting back on drinking, making a lot of happy progress. I still love him. I love him so much. But he wont do anything with his life. He won't make goals for himself and try to achieve them. He is 41 years old and nothing accomplished aside from a healthy and happy daughter who he rarely played with or entertained while growing up. I taught her to love books and enjoy creative writing. I have always made sure she was ahead in her education and has a balanced healthy diet. I pay attention to school events and homework. I've tried to let him take the lead but then things get neglected. Like I said, he is a good person/father, but I have to push sad feelings away of how our girl missed out on some quality daddy/daughter bonding outside of watching TV.

He may sound slightly depressed and that may be true. He needs to quit drinking as he is very overweight and never exercises (I do encourage him to do so a few times a week). I try to plan sober nights, movies, snacks in bed, but the cruel monster of alcoholism comes creeping back and I am left watching netflix in bed alone while he consumes more TV and beer in the living room. I've tried many things over the years from various apps and books, couples counseling, suggested solo counseling (he never bit on that) and AA. 

Anyway, this is my situation and I don't know if anyone will read it or comment on it. But I had to get my thoughts out there at least, so I can kind of organize things better in my head. I just wish he could try a little hard at life. I don't want this to be my life forever. I want someone that can push me back when I need pushing and let me push them when they need motivation too. Sorry about the length of this post. Not even sure what I am asking for here

9ujfm0,4,2018-11-05,"Experience with QUIP outside of Kingston? How did you manage to find housing, what did you do about transportation, etc. ?",GlycoSENS,queensuniversity,https://www.reddit.com/r/queensuniversity/comments/9ujfm0/experience_with_quip_outside_of_kingston_how_did/,"Other than the work itself, which can obviously vary depending on the topic, I'm wondering about the overall lifestyle and how you made things work during your 12/16 months doing QUIP in a foreign city.

I don't have a car, and even if I did I don't know if it's a good idea to have it shipped to a different city/province just for a year, especially since I'm already going to be busy with many other things and car maintenance can be costly both money and timewise. So one of my questions is: how do you manage to get to where you need to be? Did you just learn the bus routes and timings ASAP, and use that? Was transportation a big hurdle to overcome?

And what was finding housing like? Is it difficult to find an affordable and good place to live that isn't too far from your workplace?

Lastly, a bit of a naive question, but was the salary from QUIP enough to live off of? I think the average is around 30k, but obviously it depends on what field you're in. In general are you still heavily reliant on student loans (or other sources of funding) to survive? Or is the salary from the internship actually relatively high compared to how much you need to live? No need to answer this question if it's too intrusive

If it makes a huge difference, I'm in my 3rd year of Biomed Computing and am aiming for a Biotech job, but I realize how important experience is for both industry and grad school so I'll take whatever I can get. 

**TLDR**: What did you do about transportation and housing? Were there any other major hurdles you can think of? Does the salary let you take a break from another year of student loans, or not really? How much free time did you have, and how stressful was it overall? And any other advice you could possibly have.

I'm pretty nervous about living in a foreign city while also having to adapt to my first real work experience, it seems stressful and it sounds like I will be extremely busy and have no free time at all. Doesn't even have to be QUIP specifically, any experiences or advice at all are very welcome and appreciated.

The links are at the bottom.  Here's what I found

&amp;#x200B;

1.  Note that the CNN article gets to the root of the problem that a voter notified the Democrats who notified a Cyber security firm that notified Kemp's office. 
2. The fox news article left out the important about the Voter and the Laywer and that they reported the issue to the GDP but they 
3. Fox threw in info about about a Dem intern who was arrested in Oct because he leaked some Kavanaugh info in the last paragraph because all you have to say is Kavanaugh or Caravan to an R voter and that will get them to the polls.
4.  To CNN's credit, they also mentioned that the Lawyer (and presumably the voter) have filed lawsuits against the SOS before so he's probably not just some random voter.  So CNN prints this even though it cuts against any possible narrative that it was just some nonpartisan voter and lawyer that came across this.  Clearly fox is showing they will not do this in reverse. 
5.  As of this moment, this is the latest article from each outlet and this kind of reporting is disgusting and designed to check the box that they reported about it while leaving the details a mystery for fox news readers to assume something fishy is going on. 
6. I wonder if Fox will update the story AFTER the election when it no longer matters

***
The humans have a saying – two heads are better than one. And so it was I sat at the council, surrounded by two men and a woman in uniform around a table. I knew the War, I could read every heart and mind, but still, there was something I could’ve missed, some pattern I might not have seen, and while they were not War, these humans were my war council, and even I had to admit – they were damn good. In a way, just as I had been shaped and empowered by was in all of history – and mostly through human history – these people had studied in books what I had lived, what I’d *been.*

“Talk to me,” I said, putting my hands on the table between us and leaning forward. 

General Roberts, a slim dark-skinned man with an intense gaze turned to me. “Our supply lines are intact, Madam President. You were right, we had…complications at the portal.”

“Elaborate.” 

“There were demons, the muscular ones who breathe fire.”

General Dunwells, a severe looking blonde with startlingly blue eyes, cut in. “We should’ve been able to deal with that, the hellfire weaponry can take them out in a single blast.”

General Roberts looked uncomfortable. “That’s the issue…they had help from inside our ranks.”

I leaned back and massaged my temples. Humans were great for the most part, but some were…just so irrational. How could they side with beings who slaughtered their own for no real benefit except to appease some idiotic religious complex. “Why the hell are we still dealing with these people?” I said, putting steel into my voice. “Are we not running background checks? Are we dealing with sleeper cells or something?”

General Intilli, an old man with pale skin and silver hair, who had remained quite so far, interrupted. “With all due respect Madam President, we cannot just bar everyone with a religious past from entering, our numbers would collapse.”

“And draft dodgers could use it as an excuse,” Dunwells added. 

I bit my lip in an amateurish show of pressure, but it comforted the generals. They probably wouldn’t like to see their leader as a cold blooded killer. “So…what *can* we do then, lady and gentlemen?”

The generals exchanged glances before Roberts spoke up. “Frankly…nothing. We gave to take it as an acceptable loss. It’s borderline impossible and too costly to check.”

I nodded, my mind racing. I could of course possess them one by one, but the odds of me finding one of those fanatics was next to none, since I could only possess people while they were fighting. “Fine,” I said at last. “The battle for heaven?”

“It’s going…well,” General Intilli said. 

I raised an eyebrow. 

Dunwells cut in. “We are winning, and if we can continue like this, we will eradicate them, but the losses would be,” she paused, considering her words. “…Catastrophic.”

Roberts nodded. “This will become a war of slow erosion, morale will falter and people will stop supporting it. Right now, there’s a fervor of pushing into heaven and of course, your considerable charisma in actually leading,” Dunwells and Intilli nodded and I could see the respect in their eyes. “But we will lose support if we continue like this.”

A silence settled over the room as 2 men, a woman, and I decided the fate of the three realms. Roberts sipped a cup of coffee. 

“What’s the reason we’re not completely demolishing them? Are the hellfire weapons…?”

“Oh, they’re quite effective,” Roberts said, “but there’s just so many of them. Billions.”

“Have we considered the nuclear option?” 

Silence settled over the room again. I waited. 

“There’s…uncertainty,” Intilli said. “We don’t know how it will react in this alien environment. We could all be killing ourselves as well if the whole environment ignites.”

I nodded. “I want our best people on this, Generals, is that clear?” 

Dunwells opened her mouth but I raised my hand. 

“I understand your concern. You don't want to take such a risk no matter the odds, and rest assured I will not risk it unless we need to. But I would like to keep it as an option just in case. Thoughts?”

The generals nodded and Roberts spoke. “I’ll focus R&amp;D on it, Madam President.”

“Good,” I said. “Any other issues?”

At that exact moment what sounded like an alarm went off near General Dunwells. Roberts and Intilli flinched, but Dunwells calmly took out a communication device and held it to her ear. I watched her expression harden even further. Damnation. Bad news. “Thank you, lieutenant,” she said put the device away. 

“The horsemen, Madam President,” she sighed. “They show up on our critical fronts and disrupt them.”

“And both the demons and angels rally around them,” Roberts said. “We don’t know it it’s a psychological thing or literally something in their aura.”

“There’s your solution, or well, part of it, Madam President,” Intilli said. “Take out the horsemen and we may just break them.”

“And how do we do that?” Dunwells shot back. “Bullets don’t work, we’ve even had pilots drop bombs on them, and no avail. I don’t think they can be killed.”

I got up, and immediately all eyes swiveled to me. “Well,” I said, “let me think about this, we shall reconvene in a few hours.”

The generals looked confused, and Intilli seemed a bit offended at my abruptness. I let an embarrassed smile creep up on my face. “I apologize, just, I need to go to the bathroom right now.”

They blinked, and I cursed myself for that lapse in judgement. It was so much easier discussing war tactics, but strange as it were they got up and walked out, while I made my way to my bathroom. We weren't in tents any longer, a permanent structure 2 stories high and 10 stories underground served as the HQ of our army. Still as I passed the humans gave me deep nods, and the younger ones, interns I believe, just stared at me in awe as I passed. 

I wondered what they would think when they found out who I was. 

***

I closed the bathroom door, set the lid down, and sat on it. Not exactly dignified, but I couldn’t have anyone sneaking in. I closed my eyes and reached out, searching. The war still raged a few miles off the camp, and I jumped from soul to soul. 

An incoming blade. A fireball. Shooting an angel. Flying above the plains. Trying to revive a fallen comrade. Staring blankly at the oncoming rush of demons. Crying over some ashes. Cradling a dead body. A horde angels with wings ripped off, lying dead in the blood.

Ah, the beauty of it all. I savored in it, reveled in it. This, this was life. Humans pursued peace, and even Heaven and Hell wanted stability, the status quo, but this strife, this *War* brought change. It was the only time we truly lived, humans, demons, angels. When we fought for change. When we weren't static. 

A flash of gold light. A beautiful blonde woman with golden armor. A dark-haired angel. And there! A figure on a horse, bones sticking out against the skin. I focused. Not just possession, but *me* in all of my entirety. 

***
**Private Farland**

I saw the horse and I knew I was dead. The horse was awful enough, green skin, flies buzzing around its head. Everything turned red and the world shifted. It took me a moment to realize I was on the ground, convulsing. I touched my eyes, and they came away red with blood. I realized what I was looking at. Pestilence. Sickness incarnate. 

I wanted to reach out, shoot, do *something,* but the damn horseman was turning away already. Sophie’s face flashed before me. Again I saw my sister’s broken body from when the angels and demons had first attacked Rome. I’d signed up, I’d sliced and shot through hell and this is how I died? To some being I couldn’t do anything to? I gritted my teeth. No. Hell no. 

*Hello.*

The voice boomed in my head. It was a woman’s voice yes, but it commanded power, respect. There was a steel to it, and it was commanding. Not superior or proud, like some rich noble, no this was the voice of a general. 

*Would you like to fight back?* the voice asked. 

I tried to open my mouth to say yes but found I couldn’t move my lips, and my tongue was too heavy to lift. 

*Don’t worry, I hear you. I will need your permission to arrive through you.*

I didn’t even bother thinking. Was I going crazy? At that I managed a mental laugh. Here I was fighting angels and demons, facing a Horseman of the Apocalypse. How was a voice in my head crazy? What will happen to me? I asked the voice.

*You’ll die* the voice said, and I could just picture the shrug. *It won’t hurt, but it’ll be death.*

I didn’t want a quick death, I didn’t need the favor. Sophie had died slowly, the least I could do is do the same. 

*I am not offering you a quick death,* the voice said, amused. *I have no desire to bestow favors. I need an anchor close to Pestilence so I can kill that asshole.*

Oh, well she should’ve said that from the start.

____
I had spent years chasing my dream. Ever since I was a little girl, the intelligence community appealed to me as a future career. The intrigue and excitement I had seen in the movies as a child had always captivated me. The real world was not as fun, however. I had just completed what seemed like an endless amount of studies. A double major in macroeconomics and political science. I had gotten perfect grades at the cost of graduating a virgin. Receiving a masters in international business with a thesis on organized crime in the US. (I even defended it in Russian that I had learned on the side.) Internships with law enforcement every summer and a sterling record with each, every cop begging to write my recommendations letters to apply to the CIA. Maybe it was to try to butter me up so I might let them fuck me in the back of their cop car, but I didn't care.

I had been called back for the first round of interviews and could hardly sleep. Just because I was incredibly educated and a virgin didn't mean I hadn't learned how the world works. A nice pair of ass and tits walking through the door with my resume would never be turned down. This wasn't the time to play it safe. My interview outfit was a pencil skirt that seemed to threaten to rip it was so tight on my ass and ending just halfway down my thighs. Both nicely toned from the years I spent preparing for the physical requirements of the job. When I bought the blouse I wore, I knew exactly when I would wear it. In the most professional tone, it screamed, ""these perky tits are way bigger than my slender frame would suggest.""

I about screamed when I got the call that I had gotten accepted into a field office in Chicago. I showed up 30 minutes early to my first day and my excitement quickly wore off. My dreams of undercover roles and stakeouts were buried under the mountain of paperwork I was to file. They said it took years of this before I'd even be considered for anything more. This was not what I signed up for.

One Tuesday, 6 weeks in to the job, as I was taking the senior agents their coffee during a briefing, I heard them discussing a new covert operation. It was dangerous, exciting, and would require a female agent to act as a hussy to a local coke running group for as long as it took to get the information. (Please include the work ""pink"" in your message so I know you read this) They suggested it might be a couple of days of solo work, mostly just hanging around trying to overhear something good. However, the 2 female agents balked at the idea of being involved with one of the most dangerous groups in the country. I didn't even remember speaking up, just the looks I was given after I did, the male officers looking at each other and then back at me (well my body at least) and nodding. ""You've got the job...err...what was your name again?""

""Agent Allison, sir.""
____

So, the premise is that I am sent undercover to dig up dirt on a crime lord. The mission should be fairly safe and innocuous sounding in the prep. It's supposed to be a short-term in and out, but when the crime lord won't give up the information and start pushing me, I have no choice but to drop to their level of incivility.

Open to guys or girls playing anything. I think ideally we could start as the senior agents ""prep"" me for my role (in a realistic way though), then move to the crime lord. I would ask you play both.

I would ask that this try and stay in the realm of realistic, no threesomes on a desk with two agents in the middle of the day. However they might help me dress up to find the right look for my role, etc. With the crime boss, I am desperate to keep things professional but my safety is put in jeopardy if I don't learn to bend the rules.

The main kink for this is the idea that I am ""forced"" to do things for my dream job that I don't want to, but have only myself to blame."

i've visited both offices and found the people at both firms to be friendly. my questions are, which one would you pick and why, given your knowledge of these firms (particularly in boston)? does pwc's 3 years to senior matter if i want to stay in public for 3-4 years max? what exit opps are there if i stay in fs/are there better opps elsewhere? thanks in advance."

Then I'm taking 401/480 over the summer. 
Then I take 4 in fall and 4 In spring and I'm done.

Would you guys reccomend taking an extra semester and graduating in fall 2020, by just taking 3 cs classes per semester where I'll potentially get an internship over summer 2020 while in 2019 I'll just be takin classes and no internship?

I can only get As or Bs in these 15 classes. 8 Bs and 7 As since I'm trying to get into grad school. So I'm trying to figure out if I should just take 3 classes and have a higher chance of getting the A or B instead of doing bad by taking more.

Basically is there any benefit of graduating earlier like in my specific situations where I may get worst grades and no internship."
9ulmic,78,2018-11-06,Dynamic PU names/flags in the next expansion (Because castile/spanish flag)?,Jeredriq,eu4,https://www.reddit.com/r/eu4/comments/9ulmic/dynamic_pu_namesflags_in_the_next_expansion/,"Castile-Leon flag, Spanish flag contains this so maybe we can have this too?

Flags can easily be done as Castile's flag, which contains castile and leons flag. And england's ofc. They've already used this ""algorithm"" back in the day. There's only implementation left to be done.

And for more than 3 pu country flags, leader of pu can be centred and others squared. Lets say A is leader:

B.........C


.....A.....


C.........B


Well, they should do this. Like this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Arms_of_the_Protectorate_(1653%E2%80%931659).svg


Or just keeping the squares more and more


https://eu4.paradoxwikis.com/File:Spain.png


Or side by side


https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/Flag_of_Austria-Hungary_%281869-1918%29.svg/648px-Flag_of_Austria-Hungary_%281869-1918%29.svg.png


And the name can be changed by player if wanted. TAG will stay the same so It wont cause any problems background. And maybe also a radiobuttons how the player wants to merge the flags.


And for examples sake if Spain is pu'd by Austria Hungary side by side flag and wanted player them to be centered, it will be the first example (Arms of the Protectorate but with Austria-Hungary on the middle)


It shouldnt be that hard. Taking flags, creating new flags according to rules and saving them as client state flags in game save files. I mean, an intern can do it in his internship. So please paradox, do this.

I landed a winter internship at a public firm and I'm happy about that, but I'm currently trying to secure a summer internship as well.

One firm I interviewed with simply didn't respond. I reached out to the recruiter and she never emailed me back, which is fine. I didn't care for the office environment.

The second firm I interviewed with, I really enjoyed meeting everyone. I went to their tailgate for my college, secured the interview immediately after, and thought the interview went really well. In fact, one of the three people I interviewed with said he was impressed by how well I interviewed. Even so, I haven't heard back yet. They said that everyone would know by this week, but I've had a couple friends already receive phone calls securing their internships for busy season and summer internships at this firm last week.   


Is recruiting for summer slots completely done after the fall? Or will there be more opportunities in the spring? Thanks!"
9uo3ke,1,2018-11-06,National November Writing Month [Day 6] - The Book,FrigersTheWriter,FrigersTheWriter,https://www.reddit.com/r/FrigersTheWriter/comments/9uo3ke/national_november_writing_month_day_6_the_book/,"""Hello? Yeah, hi. This is Jake Roberto calling. I'd like to make an appointment to see Dr. Culmer.""

Jake rocked back and forth in his office chair as he peered through the large windows that stood behind him. There was a massive congestion of cars in the streets, blocking any feasible passage for those trying their hardest to obtain food during the lunch rush. In the distance, Jake saw a pigeon ram headfirst into the side of an all-glass skyscraper, falling limply towards the ground before exploding into a mangeled mess of feathers, blood and beak. Jake winced and shook his head as he tried his best to focus on what the secretary of the phone was saying to him.

""The next available date would be great,"" he spoke into the microphone, ""I recently got into an accident and received a bit of head trama as a result of some rather bellicose airbags.""

Laughter rang out from the phone's earpiece before returning to inadible whimpers.

""Mhmm. Mhmm. Sure, next week Tuesday works for me,"" he replied. He twirled a pencil between the grove of his fingers as the secretary typed away on the other end of the line. He heard her call for someone in the background, asking a question about the location of client information.

""Oh great, sound like she just started,"" Jake thought to himself. Thoughts of some bright-eyed intern accidentlly mixing up his files and precribing him to a uneccessary life of heavy medecation and expensive surgery swirled around in his mind. He leaned his head and tapped the side of it with his hand a few times, as if to knock the thoughts out of his head like water trapped in your ears after a morning shower. It appeared to work as he regained his clarity and focused on the secretary. She had found what she wsa loooking for and was repeating everything to ensure there were no errors.

""Uhh, I thought it was next week Tuesday right?"" Jake asked in a puzzling tone.

""Right, right. My mistake."" could be heard squeaking through the earpiece.

Jake held his face in his free hand as he shook his head. ""I'm doomed,"" he thought.

The secretary, full of pep and unphased by her mistake, continued to read of the remaining details.

""Mhmm. Mhmm. Yup, sounds good to me,"" Jake said with little enthusiasm. ""OK, see you next Tuesday.""

He hung up the phone, placed it on the desk and ran his fingers through his hair. Usually he would have a wonderful and fulling day walking through homes that people had recently called their own; the memories of being happy and secure still fresh in their minds. However, as all of the company vehicles had been commandered for their quaterly repair and Jake wasn't on the hook for his own car until tomorrow, he was instead instructed to stay inside and do ""boring office work"". Jake liked boring office work. His stomach gave a loud and ferocious roar and he remembered that the only thing he had eaten for the entire day was a measly banana.

""Dammit!"" Jake exclaimed as he slammed his fist on the table, causing a pen to roll and plummet off the edge. He had forgotten his leftovers at home. His stomach growled once again as he grasped it in an attempt to provide some sort of comfort. While he didn't want to venture out into the midday city madness in order to buy some food, sitting in that office starving for another 4 hours would be torture. Jake picked up the pen that had dropped, placing it into a cup home to 10 others, and tapped him fingers on the desk as he pondered what to do about his dilemma. He was about to give up hope and accept his fate, before he remembered that there was a vending machine downstairs on the first floor. In it various candy bars, half-empty chip bags and terrible tasting gum tried their best to attract the impulsive attention of those who walked by. Today, they wouldn't have to try very hard as Jake could already taste the delicious caramel-covered peanuts and rich dark chocolate that made up the Snickers he so desperatly craved. He reached for his wallet, opened the zipper where he kept all of his loose change and dumped it's entire contents onto his desk. They spilled across it like a pack of wolfs spreading out to surround their prey. A few rolled off the edge of the desk, landing on the floor with a high-pitch clatter. He ignore them and began to sift through the coins that lay across his desk, looking for the familar gold coloring that indicated a one or two dollar coin. He caught a glimpse out the corner of his eye; it lay hidden between a sheet of paper and a auto magazine previously dropped on his desk by a college.

""Yiss!"" Jake screamed, no one around to share in his excitement. He picked up a few more of the coins to ensure he wouldn't have to make a return trip and made his way to the elevator. Moments later he emerged on the first floor, eyes darting around as he hunted for his prey. His nose caught a whiff of something salty in the upwind, a hint of vinegar follwing shortly behind.

""Chips!"" Jake and his stomach thought in unison as he lasered in on the location of the vending machine. About 20 degrees due South; approexmatly 75 feet away; weather a bit on the chilly side. He made his way over to the vending machine and peered through the glass at it's many calorie-packed options. Regular chips. BBQ chips. Salt &amp; Vinegar chips. Onion rings. Cheap gum. Cheap gum in a different flavor. His eyes zipped back and forth across the items, stopping momentarliy only to gawk at how ridiculosly expensive everything had become. After a few seconds and a moment of doubt, Jake's eyes finally landed on it's familiar brown wrapping.

""Come to papa, Snickers,"" Jake thought to himself as he rubbed his hands together and punched in the coresponding code. E-7 he typed, as the screen displaying the information lit up.

""E7 - Snicker's Bar - $2.75"" it flashed.

""Two seventy five! Are you kidding me?"" Jake said loud enough for only himself to hear. ""Like, 5 years ago I could buy a Snickers for $1.25, tax included!""


He continued fuming as he rummaged around in his pocket looking for change. He pulled out everything he had and began counting.

""35. 40. 45. 55.""

He finished counting up all the change he had and let out a heavy sigh. He was short by 5 cents.

""Ughhh,"" he let out a groan and turned around. ""Today just isn't a day for eating food I guess,"" he thought to himself as he made his way back to the elevator. He was about to reach for the elevator button when he once again heard a familair voice.

""Yoo, Jakey, waddup my man?"" came a friendly tone.

Jake turned around to see Jerome fiddling with a large bundle of keys, noisily clanking together as he shoved a particularly large one into the door in front of him. It locked shut with a loud clink and Jerome made his way over to the elevators.

""This feels familair,"" Jake thought as he walked over, bumping fists with Jerome. 

""I'm good,"" he replied, a thought popping into his head as he continued. ""Yo, Jerome?"" he asked.

""Yeah?""

""You got five cents?""

Jerome laughed. ""Nah, man. I don't carry crack change on me anymore after my college days.""

Jake laughed.

""Wait,"" Jerome said pointing his index finger in the air as gears clocked away in his head, ""Maybe there's some change behind the security desk.""

He made his way over to the large counter stationed in one of the corners. One top of it sat an outdated-looking phone plugged into the wall, a phonebook covered in an undisturbed layer of dust and a clipboard for visitors to sign in. Walking behind the counter, his large frame disappeared from view as he foraged around in various drawers and small cracks. He pushed aside a monitor sitting on a lower part of the desk. He pulled a dingy rolling chair from under the desk. He lifted up the phone book.

""Listen, Jerome, don't worry about it,"" Jake said as the blood began to fill the complex network of viens and capilliries across his face, causing it to turn a vivid shade of cherry red.

""Here we go!"" Jerome's voice boomed as he triumphantly strutted over, holding a dime. ""There was one under the phone book this whole time. Crazy huh?""

""Yeah. Crazy.""

Jake gave a weak chuckle, took the dime from Jerome and made his way over to the vending machine, hastily prodding at the keypad as his stomach slowly digested iteself. His eyes lit up, brain filled with a fresh influx of dopamine in response to the log of sugar, caramel and peanuts that dropped into the bottom tray. He grabbed the Snickers bar, ripped the wrapper open and tore off a chunk of chocolate with his teeth, crushing and grinding it's content with his teeth is blissful satisfaction. Jerome looked on in disgust momentarily before decided that there was probably more appealing things he could be doing.

""Later, Jake,"" he said, heading towards the front doors.

""Murr, mum Jeoom,"" Jake garbled through mouthfuls of partially chewed peanuts, a few spilling out of his mouth and onto the floor.

""Jesus that's disgusting,"" Jerome thought as he made his way outside. After having been in the chilling grasp of the A/C for so long, the harsh and humid summer heat slapped Jerome in the face. His eyes collapsed to a squint as he adjusted to the thermal changes. A big sigh escaped Jerome's lips as he knew it was time to make the brutal treck around the outskits of the property.

The rest of the day was rather dull for Jake and went by significantly quicker with the additonal calories he had procurred during is lunch excursion. Properties organized and emails mainly ignored, Jake packed up for the night and made his way to his car. On his way, he spotted Jerome walking by the edge of a nearby parking lot, giving a weridly-parked car the stink eye. He was drenched in sweat and exhaling deeply, straining to draw from his last reserves of energy. Jake felt bad, as he knew that Jerome would have diffulty getting home. In the past Jake would provide him with a lift home, the two chatting about their past childhood, their dreams and failure to obtain them or their exagerated college sex lives. A 30 minute change in Jake's schedule after his promotion to ""Grand Sage"" derailed that daily routine, however. He hopped into his vehicle; sadness, anger and guilt swilred around in his head. A push of a button caused loud music to stream through Jake's car speakers as he figeted with the volume. Once the volume had been reduced to a moderate level he pulled out of the parking lot, giving Jerome a small wave as he passed by, and allowed himself to be swallowed by the upbeat rhythm of Electronic Dance Music.

Lucy could hear the blaring music long before she could see it's source. The rythmic timing of it's guitar samples and deep bass was a dead giveaway that her husband was nearing the premises. It's volume was a sign that he was probably in a foul mood. Sadly, she was in a rather foul mood herself.

Jake barged through the door and slammed it behind him, dropping his briefcase on the floor and allowing the entire weight of his body to fall in to the couch in a mangled heap.

""I told you to stop doing that before you break the couch, Jake,"" Lucy snapped. Jake immediatly noticed that her voice seemed raspier than usual.

""It's fineeee,"" he replied, stretching out and twisting his body, ""These things are built to last. Also, do you have a cold or something?""

He looked up as he asked, quickly sitting up in shock as his face curled into that of deep, espressive concern. He stared into Lucy's face, which had become slightly thinner causing her cheekbones to slightly protrude like an overfilled grocery bag. Her eyes were bloodshot and red; under them, sagging skin casted a dark shadow reminicent of when Jake witnessed her stay up for 3 days straight speed writing a novel during a ""writers retreat"". There was no completed novel here, however. Just a woman that looked as if the tires on which her entire life drove had been flattened.

""Baby, what happened to you?"" Jake asked anxiously, ""You look terrible.""

""Yeah, thanks. That's exactly what I needed to hear,"" she replied gruffly.

""C'mon you know what I mean,"" he pleaded, ""It's just that-well you look as if you're exhausted. Did you not sleep well last night?""

""I slept fine.""

""Well are you stressing over a new character or something? I remember you were sick for 2 days while trying to figure out what that albino lizard was gonna look like. After deciding on green and white you were so happ-""

""I'm not stressing over some stupid character!"" she barked in a voice more dark and henious than Jake had ever expereinced before. The hair on the back of his neck stood erect.

""This life is too weak and fragile to worry about such pitiful trifles,"" she continued calmly, making direct eye contact with Jake the entire time. Jake sat on the couch, stunned and dumbfounded at what he was hearing. The person that sat in front of him looked like the woman that he had promised to spend the rest of his life together with during a wedding ceremony in Jamaica. Long blond hair. Beautiful green eyes. A smile that stopped his heart mid-beat. They had all the appeances of the person that he knew as the love of his life and almost-mother of his first child; Lucy Roberto. However, the Lucy he knew never displayed any obvious disdain towards life, or anyone else for that matter. She was a kind and loving person, almost to a fault, and while she would ocasionally be pushed far enough to raise her voice it never stemmed from a place of hatred. She was also a passionate writer; the Lucy he knew certainly wouldn't refer to her characters as ""stupid"".

""OK, Lucy, whatever you say,"" Jake said as he made his way into the kitchen. Whatever was happening with Lucy, it was probably going to be easier to deal with after he had some food. Thoughts of plunging a fork deep into his leftovers filled his mind as he licked his lips, opening the fridge door. His eyes focused in on where he had previously left the container, only to be greeted by a half-empty bottle of ketchup. He looked up, down, in the door, back up again. It was nowhere to be found.

""Hey babe, do you know where my leftovers are?"" Jake called out, ""It wa the bacon thing we got yesterday. You didn't throw it out did you?""

""No. I ate it."" came Lucy's reply, still filled with as much eeire calm as before.

""Babe, stop joking around. Where'd you put it?"" Jake asked as he gave a laugh. ""Is it in the microwave?""

He checked the microwave. It wasn't there.

""She didn't actually-""

Jake stopped mid-thought and walked over to the garbage bin, stepping on the little plastic tab and opening the lid. Inside the gargbade he saw the empty container looking back up at him.

""What. The. Fuck?!"" Jake exclaimed as he ran into the living room. Lucy had barely moved from her initial position.

""What happened? You haven't touched any meat for 17 years, now all of a sudden you decide to casually munch on some bacon? What about animal cruelty or growth hormones or any of the other things you've stood out in the rain protesting for?""

Lucy sat there in silence, staring off into the distance. Her face showed no change in emotion, no response to Jake's verbal stimuli. Jake felt very uneasy but continued his prodding.

""Well?"" he asked.

""I was hungry,"" Lucy finally replied still facing forward, ""I required something with a bit more...life.""

There was something about the way she said ""life"" that caused shivers to run down the length of Jake's spine. He couldn't tell exactly what it was, but he definitely felt there was something wrong with Lucy.

""OK, sure. So you needed something with more 'life' in it. But you haven't eaten meat in years-you have no idea what effects it'll have on your body. If you really want meat then I'll buy some fresh from the market and cook you something good OK?""

For the first time, Lucy looked up at Jake. He could barely see the hint of a soul in her eyes.

""OK, baby,"" she replied before returning her gaze to it's previous position. Jake stood in silence beside her for a few moments, before walking over and giving her a huge hug.

""I love you baby,"" he said as he squeezed her tightly between his arms.

""I love you too Jake,"" she replied. Her voice was cold and rigid.

He released her and walked back into the kitchen, a series of fierce growls indicating that his stomach still demanded sustenance. He rummaged around in the cupboard and stumbled on a collection of instant noodle packages. Snaging a couple that he thought looked delicious based on their color, he dumped them into a pot of water and cranked the stove to max. As he did, he heard the sound of movement in the living room, followed by the den door being closed. Jake tried his best to ignore the feelings of unease he had expereinced earlier while talking to Lucy and dumped the tiny packages of flavoring into the water, as it had already begun boiling. The noodles were done not long after and Jake poured it into a bowl, twirling it around and blowing as hard as he could to help it cool down. He wolfed the meal down as quick as he could, washed everything up and made his way to the bedroom upstairs. Walking into the dimly lit bedroom, it was immedatly obvious to Jake that Lucy has done some heavy cleaning. The bed was made, the computer desk was de-cluttered and the hardwood floor glittened with a renewed sheen. He glanced over in the corner to where the garbage was; the book and other trash was nowhere to be seen, replaced white a fresh, white bag.

""Huh, guess she really felt like cleaning today,"" Jake thought to himself as he prepared himself for bed. Freshened up and clothes changed, Jake sandwiched himself between the blanket and the mattress. He slowly started drifted into the land of dreams, but not before replaying his earlier conversation with Lucy in his head.

""Sure,"" he thought on the brink of losing conciousness, ""Maybe she spent all day reluctnatly cleaning and felt pissed about it, so she's giving me the silent treatment. But to eat meat?!""

He thought back to when he had first met Lucy. A young, beautiful girl recently starting college and passionatly against the treatment and mass-production of meat. Jake, having been in college for 2 years already, could care less about how the delicious meat he was eating was treated before it ended up on his dinner plate. Bacon from an abused pig tasted the same, after all. However, he did know that this girl made him feel something special everytime he saw her jumping in excitement as someone complimented her hand-made sign. If it took betraying his deep love for everything delicious when grilled, it was worth it. Jake's eyes were heavy and a thick fog clouded his vision as he fell into a deep slumber.

Sun poured through a small gap in the curtains, caressing Jake's grizzed face with it's radiant embrace. He stirred in the sheets attmepting to avoid the sun's harsh rays but was ineveitably met with defeat. He pryed his eyelids open and rose himself up, frankenstein-esque, stretching his body around like an artist stretchinng and molding their clay. He looked over and was surprised to see Lucy still lying in bed, fast asleep.

""Werid. She's usually up earlier than me."" Jake thought as he hoisted himself out of bed. 

""I'll let her sleep. Must be tired from all the cleaning.""

Jake finished getting ready, gave Lucy a kiss on the forehead and made his way downstairs. He grabbed a banana and walked off, before turning around and grabbing two more bananas. Thermostat calibrated. Check. Lights off. Check. Door locked. Checked.

Everything seemingly passing Jake's internal checklist he hopped into his car and turned it on. The needle for the gas meter made a weak attempt at pushing beyond the first 3 strokes before giving up and settling right above a giant, glowing ""E"".

""Great. Gotta go get gas,"" Jake complained as he pulled up Google Maps on his phone. ""G-A-S"" he typed as a list of nearby gas stations popped up on his screen. He loaded up the directions for one known for having slightly lower prices and a free windshield cleaning. Jackpot.

It only took 7 mintues before Jake was pulling into the gas station. The letters ""ESSO"" were brandished across all of the gas pumps. Another 10 minutes and Jake was pulling out of the gas station, his car filled with gas and his car windows only slightly covered in streaks. He drove for a few mintues before turning off the main road into a parking lot. He grabbed the bundles of papers that lie in the passenger seat and started to sift through, reading what information he could on the various houses and properties he was supposed to scout that day. It was quite the variety; everything from large mansions in upper-class neighbourhoods to 2-bedroom apartments in the middle of nowhere were potential victims to the cruel and heartless cycle of economics."

Standstill.,jobdone01,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/9uozmk/descicion_fatigue_can_you_give_me_you_opinion_it/,"should I buy a new pen and a new mouse? or a macbook pro or an Imac?

back in 2014 I bought a surface pro 3. charger broke. I bought a new. its only here in 2018 that I bought an actual type cover. some keybinds don't work, the touchpad is a it stubborn on the two finger right click.  but its sleek as hell. most days I don't even need to bring a charger.just the pen, mouse and tablet. Not even a backpack.

&amp;#x200B;

However I know this can't continue. eventually I'll have to buy 3-6 books plus extra each semester.  and I'll need to carry them myself.

&amp;#x200B;

I bought the surface pro because I thought I would need it for my degree in molecular biology. I would be drawing organic chemistry formulas on it. it did work but not well. you see, the real pro org-chems, they use coding ona a Latex- add-on to type rings and stuff.  and there are dedicated programs for writing chemical reaction formulas. if word hasn't become more intuitive yet.

&amp;#x200B;

that didn't matter. I dropped out half a year in. I started workign on a ranch. for my father. not much and not it related.

&amp;#x200B;

now I am trying to get back into real life, and I am considering something finance related. at the two day internship at an investment firm all other oyung interns had macbook pros. but I had previously noticed that the speaker ( I have seen him before) used a surface pro. so I thought It would go okay even if I didn't buy a macbook pro. I could just bring my surface pro.  and it kind of worked. all  perosnell in the small company had a surface pro 4 or 5 each.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I own a surface pro 3 I7, 256 Gb.

surface type cover, danish qwerty.

one surface pen which works, but the back has some very faulty drivers. so I can't erase. I am in no rush to buy a 200$ surface pen. but I will need to buy something at some point. the wacoom bamboo Ink supports Surface, but doesn't have tils, unlike the newest sruface pen. its like 90$ here in Denmark.

I also had a Surface Modern mouse. I really like it. cheap. won't get stolen. cordless. BUT the scroll wheel half broke. I can still click, but the inner mechanics broke off.

the new charger still hasn't broken but  I probably need to buy a spare one sooner rather than later. my current one doens't show wear.

&amp;#x200B;

also I jsut changed the screen on the surface. because of my being particularily uncautious, the touch only works on half of the screen. and I have to touchwith the pen on one side to get it to work on the other side. with the stylus ofr the stylus.

I could go out and buy a new mouse and a new pen. and a new screen and a spare charger. It is a good processor and a nice hdd. and because the charger broke, I still have two years where I didn't use it. meaning it is in some sense not 4 but 2 years old.

I am just tried  of buying additional shit.

&amp;#x200B;

I never had a macbook.  every richkdi I know owns one and here in Denmark it really IS the standard. at uni its 80-95% apple. vs 0,5% surface. and the rest is  all other.

&amp;#x200B;

there is a real signaling value in the macbook.

I used to think I wanted a macbook air. the former danish prime minister Helle Thornign was seen using one in a photo of a biography of her I bought. IDk about politics. but it is ONE role model. just like the surface pro at an investment firm is one.

&amp;#x200B;

the old macbook air, frankly, while I could get used to the keys, I feel they are bad. I own three other keyboards for various shitty reasons. its not the worst on the old Air, but its not designerquality.

then there are the macbook pros. thye have 13"" like the air. but they doesn't have the backlit logo on the back. the keyboard is probably better than my surface.  it's certainly sleeker. and its signal value may mean a lot to me if I aim to become rich.  Just like some guys buy Hermes belts for $800.  there is a certain expectation behind it.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

however right now, I don't even go to university, or any school. I might start a 2½ year AP graduate as ""financial economist"" just because I need to do something. or use it as a springboard to get into university.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Yes I have $17k savins. but I feel really bad wasting it all on tech. I could aslso buy a roomba and soem phillips lights, but I don't like to buy things when I do not have a meaningful  income.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

on on hand I'd need to learn how to use mac before education starts in January. on the other I should probably focuse more on keeping using my windows stuff and try to copy the investment firm by learning excel, taxes, and stock programs. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

idk.. what do you think would be the wiesest?

&amp;#x200B;

spare charger 24$

new surface pen ( 2 buttons) 105$

new screen replacement ( spare, and since the touch doesn't work properly)  114$

new mouse 45 $

 that's 288$ for maintaining my surface pro 3. 

&amp;#x200B;

compare that to a macbook pro 13"" at 1520$ ( included toll/tax and danish keyboard layout)

or a demo 15"" with some core I5 and that dark grey look.  2280$

&amp;#x200B;

But since both macbooks don't bend backwards enough they akind of are a hassl.e I am a tall kuy at 6'3"" and I do not intedn to be a hunched over vulture when I am 80. I can avoid this with the surface Pro as it can kick back donw. 

I could buy an Imac. 27"", doens't need to be dark grey and suer duber fast. stil. it'd be 3500$ to 4300$ for an Imac.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

but if I don't even know that I can earn money by sitting in front of a computer, amd I jsut stupid for considering this? 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

please reread then comment. thank you for your input. I need wisdom. and frugality is not neccesarily that.

My entire career is built on a lie.,GnomeErcy,confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/9up0m5/i_forged_my_transcripts_to_get_an_internship_my/,"I'm out of college 8 years now, but still feel a little guilty over how I've gotten to where I am.

&amp;#x200B;

When I was a junior in college I wanted an internship at a company that had a large presence in our college town. It was a great place to work, and I had several friends who also worked there. There was just one catch: they screened out all applicants who didn't meet their minimum GPA of 3.25.

&amp;#x200B;

I had around a 3.0. I never considered myself a great student, but do consider myself reasonably intelligent. Definitely enough for the job they were posting. I knew that the position I was applying for could be managed even if I didn't have the GPA to get through the door.

&amp;#x200B;

I got my transcripts, and changed a few lower grades (I'd failed a programming class in part because the professor refused to help any students who were not Computer Science majors) to be a bit higher. I made sure to make them reasonable, and re-calculated my weighted GPA and my straight GPA, and photoshopped those grades, too. Why they didn't ask for official, sealed transcripts, I don't know...

&amp;#x200B;

I ended up landing the interview and was offered the position the same day. I was great at my job. I trained one of the full time employees who had been in the role for three months prior to me starting. When I was graduating, they offered me a full time position. I declined, because I'd already had another (much higher paying) job lined up, where they cited my great internship experience as the main reason I landed that job.

&amp;#x200B;

Every job since, for the past eight years, has been built off of that lie.

&amp;#x200B;

Part of me feels terrible. I cheated the system, denying someone else - someone honest - the chance at this job. My entire career is predicated on deception, and nobody except my wife knows. At the end of the day I'm extremely happy with my work but a part of me feels bad that if I had been honest, I wouldn't be where I am."

I'm currently an undergrad, but I'm hoping to get into a Masters program to get a Masters in Sports Management/Economics. I would *LOVE* an internship with the Canes. I was wondering if anyone had heard of any opportunities or have an internship with the club in the past? Anyone specifically I should ask to see if there are any opportunities available?

9uqmmv,1,2018-11-06,One of the most frustrating mornings in a while,0ldS0ul,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/9uqmmv/one_of_the_most_frustrating_mornings_in_a_while/,"I just spent the entire morning trying to work on my laptop.  My keyboard has been messed up for probably a year and a half, possibly longer.  My trackpad has been messed up for a solid 8 months or so.  I got the replacement trackpad on the 18th, and my replacement keyboard arrived yesterday.

&amp;#x200B;

Replacing the keyboard on a Thinkpad T440s is relatively simple in all honesty.  Replacing the trackpad is another story.  You have to unscrew the keyboard, pop open the back, take out the internal battery, the hard drive, and unscrew the motherboard.  I'm always worried delving into the inner workings of my laptop that I'll mess something up and my laptop won't work anymore.  My laptop is my livelihood.  My internship is all remote so on my laptop.  My masters courses are online so again, on my laptop.  My life is on this laptop.  I watched at least 4 tutorial videos this morning preparing to change out the trackpad.  I finally replace it, put everything back in place, fire it up, and the trackpad isn't working.  It isn't even registering. I went to Google to try to find a solution but no answers for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

After once again cracking everything back open, I find the issue is one of the ribbon cable ends wasn't inserted properly.  So, I fix it, and get things back in place.  Went to start it up and realise I'd forgotten to screw my new keyboard back in.  I messed it up and scratched my brand new keyboard trying to get it put back in properly.  I got so frustrated at one point I quite literally screamed.  (Not that it mattered, I'm in an empty house, no one even close to hear me.)  I get it put back in, fire it up again, and everything is working.  All of this took me 4 and a half hours.

&amp;#x200B;

As a congratulations to myself for doing this on my own, I decided to smoke my last cigarette.  I've had this last cigarette in my wallet for over 8 months.  I went to get it, and it was broken, 1/4 of an inch above the filter.  Luckily, I had some rolling papers from 2 years ago and repaired it and just had my first cigarette in 9 months or so.  

&amp;#x200B;

It feels awesome to be typing this on a fully functional keyboard.  But the frustration is still very strong.  Half a damn day on something so many people can do in under 20 minutes.  But I fucking did it.  And now I have to really start my day, 4 hours behind schedule.  But finally, with a fully functioning laptop.  Fuck."

I have been interning with a tech company since May 2017, full-time during the summer and part-time during the school year. I will be graduating with my MS in Computer Science in May 2019. I was told a few months ago that my current team doesn’t have the space to hire me full-time after graduation, so I applied for, interviewed for, and accepted a position with another team at the same company starting in early June 2019. This position is at the same location, and I will continue to work part-time (with my current team) and take online classes full-time until graduation.

Here’s the problem: I just found out I’m pregnant, and due in early July 2019. Normally this would not be a problem, since this company is known for its work-life balance and offers 8 weeks of paid parental leave starting the first day of the month after the conversion to full-time. However, the position I have accepted is for a totally different job than my current one, and requires 16 weeks of (full pay, full benefits) on-the-job training. It is a cohort-based training, with only one 16 week session offered every year. So I probably could not do the training ahead of time (while I am still an intern), nor could I return to it after maternity leave.

I don’t know what to do. I haven’t told my employer yet. I don’t know if they can legally rescind the job offer if I tell them I’m pregnant, since having a baby in early July would stop me from attending the full 16 weeks of training. If they do rescind the job offer, then I will have to search for another job while pregnant, and I have read horror stories about that.

Please give me some suggestions of what to do, if you have any."

Evan shifted forward from his place on the floor, just under Ms. Walsh's desk. He moved carefully so as not to get a run in his hosiery, something Ms. Walsh would chastise him for. His panty-encased bum was still sore from the spanking she had doled out yesterday. 

""*Shhh, honey, it's fine,*"" she said from her chair. 

""*Someone could walk in!*"" Evan protested.

""*If they do, you just scoot that cute little tush of yours under my desk and keep going.*""

""*Miss--!*""

He stopped, saw the stern look in her eyes and knew better than to question any further. Whatever [Audrey Walsh](https://i.imgur.com/JnD2yU0.jpg) wanted, she got. Evan was learning that the hard way. He stared upwards as she uncrossed her legs. There was a slight whiff of perfume and suddenly Evan was very lightheaded. He crawled forward, his head moving slowly under her skirt, darkness enveloping him. He inhaled, felt his mouth go dry, and he swallowed hard.

""*That's it, honey,*"" Ms. Walsh cooed from above. ""*We've had a long day. Let's relieve a little stress, shall we?*""

Evan closed his eyes as he felt Ms. Walsh's hand press on the back of his head...

**-One Year Earlier | March, 31-**

Evan Donahue was a senior at Georgetown University in Washington, DC. For as long as he could remember he'd been starry-eyed for DC and the federal government. Other boys idolized football players and movie stars, but for Evan it was politicians. The Donahue's were from a long line of Republican's in West Virginia and Evan had grown up around passionate debates over dinner and during the holiday's. Now that he was in Washington, he was ready to get involved with the glitz and glamour of government.

So, when Evan decided to get an internship on Capitol Hill, there was only one choice, his hero, Republican Senator Richard Martell. Charismatic and charming. Tall, with an imposing figure, mega-watt smile, a man's man. A guy who could wield his power and get the job done. Evan reveled in it. He couldn't imagine working for anyone else.

Little did Evan know that all is not what it seems in DC. Despite his idealistic visions, Congress is not full of people fighting tooth and nail for what they believe in. It’s a club for the rich and powerful who care only about amusing themselves and *remaining* rich and powerful. Interns are usually hired as potential mistress material, or sometimes as future trophy wives, which is why they're normally ultra-feminine, young blonde girls (like Evan's girlfriend, Madison) who gets chosen to be Martell's intern over him.

Evan is devastated and hurt. Madison doesn't even *like* politics. She just needed the credits. So does Evan and since he thought he was such a shoe-in for Martell there's very few candidates left. Desperate, he calls in a few favors and learns that there's one opening left with a Miss Audrey Walsh who just announced her candidacy for the United States Senate seat.

A woman. A democrat. God, what would his father think??

What other choice did he have?

I tend to keep my partner's character's backstory open, but felt it was important to add a jumping off point here for the character of Evan. Feel free to get in touch if you'd like to work together on this. I should point out and make this super clear, while I hope that you went out and voted today, your actual political affiliation is not important to this story. It's for fun and to put the character of Evan in a very uncomfortable (and later, rewarding) position as possible. I will do my best to respond.

9uratq,13,2018-11-06,I would strongly recommend the military for re-setting your life financially and professionally.,halildindarol,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/9uratq/i_would_strongly_recommend_the_military_for/," 

Basically what the title says.

Once upon a time, I had a BA in a social science field that was getting me nothing but low-paid jobs, and I would have needed to go to grad school to ever have a real chance of landing a salaried position. I paid my own way through college and was not willing to take on additional debt for a graduate degree in an already very competitive (and low-paying) field. I wanted to go in a different direction.

I had worked part-time at a law firm during college, and I decided working in a support position (i.e. paralegal/legal assistant) was something I was very interested in. I applied for positions at every law firm in my general area and received nothing but rejection and one invitation to intern for free. No thanks, I had bills to pay.

The military had always been something I'd considered and I did a lot of research on the different branches and what they offered. Turns out the Army offers an enlisted position that was exactly what I was looking for--Paralegal Specialist, and since I had a degree I would enter the military as an E-4. The Army also guarantees that the specific job you select is written into your contract.

It's now a little over four years since I raised my right hand-- I now work for the Department of Justice. My military service counts towards my federal retirement and also put me in a higher leave bracket. The high-ranking connections I made in the Army JAG Corps combined with the job experience I received are what landed me this position. I have thousands of dollars in the bank that I saved because I didn't need to pay for housing, food, or health insurance while I served. I'll be able to use a VA-backed loan to buy a house when I choose to, and if I want to go back to school I can do so for free using the GI Bill.

I write all this because I read this sub regularly and there are so many posts by people who don't make a living wage, or majored in something unmarketable (like me) and don't know what the next step should be, or who have student loan debt, or are just kind of lost in life. And I think military service could benefit a lot of those people.

Of course this comes with a large caveat: the military comes with risks. You could deploy, you could be in combat, you could die, you could be involved in a freak training accident, etc. You could also get stuck in a terrible unit with toxic leadership. It's all luck of the draw really. I was incredibly fortunate in having a positive experience but I know many aren't so fortunate. It's the ultimate 'your experience may vary' scenario.

But at least for me it was a great way to kickstart my career in the direction I wanted to go and set myself up financially. I just wanted to share my experience in case it helps anyone who may be considering the service.

We are both college students, 2 years apart. I'm 20, she's 22. If you don't want to read too much, skip around.

How it began: (before dating)

We were friends for 8 months before. We were in a semi dating type thing, where we would go to nice dinners, dance together, talk more intimately than I would or she would with any other friends. It was a connection, just not romantic. Almost like I was friendzoned into the nth dimension, but at the same time, not. She stopped talking to her guy friends when we began hanging out, and I did similar with my girl(space)friends. I made moves many times on her, got rejected hard. I could tell she was torn to shreds every time she rejected me, which made me keep at it, like a true young and dumb guy. Eventually I couldn't do anymore so we didn't talk for a few months. We could not stay apart, however, and reconnected. Things were even closer, but still I tried one more time and got rejected. I had spent almost a year chasing and getting torn up. It was too much. I told her I could either date her, or unfortunately would have to leave. Harsh, but fair, as it was keeping us both locked from potential dating oplurtunities and hurt like hell. Out of nowhere, 3 days later she asked me out, and clarified that it was a date with romantic intention. So I bragged to my guy friends that I totally meant to do that, and went. 

The relationship: (a year plus a few months)

Things were amazing, and a relief from the limbo there was before. We were both engineering students, loved the outdoors. We had a very fast connection, and planned to move in together if we transferred to the same 4 year school (we went to a CC in Colorado). We did everything together from working through emotional hangups to camping trips, and even building a spacecraft together as part of our school's research team. Not a single fight for almost 8 months, it was pure awesome. So good that it was almost wierd. Then Summer came. I got busy, real busy. Was literally out of state multiple weeks on projects, getting 5 hours of sleep a night while managing 3 classes online. She had an empty summer on the other hand. She began showing severe anxieties and insecurities; if I went 2 days without texting her, it would be a 3 hour fight over the phone. Things deteriorated, but I simply thought it was a rough patch. She began fighting about everything she possibly could, to the point where friends would give her strange looks. When the schedules calmed down, we spent about a week together. It was nice other than the fighting. We relaxed, eased off from the stress, with her acting up occasionally. Then the final day came. She woke up next to me. Instead of the usual good morning kisses and such, she acted allergic to me. Towards the evening she acted somewhat nicer, we went to a nice dinner date, and were much closer together for a few hours. She held me on the couch for a while, didn't realize at the time that that was her goodbye. Next day she calls me, fights with me for hours, and tells me she has been considering breakup for months, and offs the relationship. Great friends almost a year, pure bliss for 8 months, normal relationship stuff for the next few, then rough for the last month, and then almost all the final fallout within a week. 

The breakup until now: (3 months, counting)

We had some back and forth for 2 weeks on calls. Some ugly, some not. At least the final call was very, very calm and almost sweet. I realized on these calls my mistakes of becoming complacent with her, as I did stop taking care of myself and became semi depressed because of my stress level. I also admit to neglecting her. Thinking on it now, I did change a lot, and not for the better. She even pointed it out along the way, but I didn't take it seriously enough to work on myself. She gave many chances but I didn't see it as a priority. No cheating, lying, or anything like that was involved. We haven't talked for a while. She's not doing well, but I can't concern myself with that at the moment. I do know from her past that she does re visit exes sometimes (not saying she has tons of them or anything). And right now she's just very very angry at the world, and knowing her when she comes off that anger it will be a hard fall. I'm mainly just down still. I'm past the anger, much more positive, and finally convinced myself to follow this mentality: I won't try to get her back or wait for her. I'll do my own thing and if a new person comes along, I'll go for it. At the same time, the door is open, and she is welcome back. But that won't last forever, of course. 

So, what do you all think will happen? Will she reach out or not? Next, just sharing what I've learned:

A) First thing, when you are in absolute shock, don't overload yourself and no, don't install tinder. Try to accomplish small tasks at regular intervals. 5 days after, it can be hard to do anything, so start small. I'm talking folding a single shirt or taking a 10 minute walk. Small things, but at regular intervals, to keep some structure in the day. Increase your efforts as you heal. 

B) Work out! It really does help you stay focused, relieve depression, and improves your health. Eat well. You'll notice it will melt away depression at least for a short while, and you can use that temporary break from being down to get in that extra math assignment or essay that you'd be normally to depressed to start. I personally got into hiking and lifting. I like to hike as many miles as I can sun up to sun down once a week, and the fitness gain is amazing! It also lifted my spirits as a new hobby. Find something like this for yourself. Started at 10 miles in one day, and last week did 25 in one go.

B2) We all know working out takes time, as far as results go. You are off the dating market now, but in a few/several months you won't be. Either you'll meet someone new, or reconnect with the ex on some slim chance, but whatever it is, you want to be ready for ANYTHING. If you meet the next person looking amazing, you will thank yourself for being strong in your dark moments. If not, you will find yourself having little luck with dating, which can relapse your depression. And if he/She does come back out of no where, would you rather they return to a needy, weak and disgusting mess, or a strong, disiplined person who looks better than ever? Your choice. 

C) Get your academics/career in line. Most of us here reading are typically college age from what I've seen. This is the age where people begin to look for those who can at least take care of themselves, and have future potential for a stable life. Statistically, many meet their spouse in college. The other advantage is many college students don't think to put themselves together this way, so being ""that put together person"" who seems years ahead for their age will give you a MASSIVE advantage with feeling great, having a better future, and yes, dating. For me, this was an internship I landed at my dream company, literally a day after breakup, but as always it depends on your life goals. Just do something that will be useful in 10 years from now, and that you are proud of. 

D) don't reach out for a while if at all. I heard from mutual friends that she described me as the best boyfriend she ever had. I got excited, and reached out. It was responded to by 2 sentences of ""yes I'm doing fine how about you"" and such, then my next message was ignored for 3 weeks now. This was 2 months after, so no, ""30 day no contact"" does not work. She didn't shut me out or be mean, meaning she didn't open the door to reconnect, but also didn't close it. Point is, I did my part, any further comms is up to her. Even if you feel like me where they left the door not closed, not open, but cracked open an inch, if they broke up with you they must be the one to open it, not you. It if it happens it's going to be closer to several months, not 30 days, later. 

E) Make new friends. Fix any and all social anxieties you may have. A few months after, you are ready to date but not quite a relationship. Finding someone who mutually agrees to just casually go on a few dates is great. You get back out there, remind yourself that people find you interesting, and learn a bit more about what your type is. Be more outgoing, less shy. Just talk to people and have light hearted fun. Big point: become a master of light hearted, harmless humor. 

F) Mentally forgive them if you think they wronged you. You both messed up, stewing over it is healthy but not for too long. Forgive but don't forget - forgetting that lesson will leave you open to the same wrongdoings in future ventures. 

G) this one is about getting back together. You should never expect this, but my philosophy is that if there is even a single percent chance of it happening, be ready for it. You must progress to your best self before trying again if it comes up. You shouldn't do this unless you are mostly over it, and view it as a new relationship with corrections on the past one's problems. Think, what would work better? Trying again as a calm, collected and stronger individual, or as an emotional wreck still recovering?

H) Finally, ignore the ""an ex is an ex for a reason"" type advice, or anything else that is generalized. It might be true, but everyone is different. That being said, those stupid online quizzes are poison. Every person in this earth is different, and there are more variables at play then there are grains of sand on earth. If anyone made an accurate quiz that actually works, they would win a Nobel prize for inventing the most advanced AI known to man kind. Coaching websites, quizzes, they all suck. Stay away. 

To those of you who wonder if you should get back together:

Be friends for a bit first. It's better to risk the friendzone then to jump into a doomed relationship. This lets you see if they are faking their good changes and growth or not. If they show that they have fixed their ways, and remain this new person for a few months, it's more likely to be real then if they just acted that way for a week or two. Also the corniness of their initial texts tells a lot; If it's a sappy script like something out of the new titanic movie or some crap like that, they are acting out of pure emotion and may be unstable. Be careful. If it seems more calm, slow, and logical, it is more likely to be real.

Tldr; It hurts, yes, and I'm not just saying get over it. But you must bring every lesson you learned to bear and be tough, and become ready for anything that comes. During breakups random things come up at unexpected times. It's ok to feel hurt, but be strong and equipped for whatever comes next. As far as the breakup competition goes, if you come out a better person then when you went in, you win. The other person's progress doesn't matter.  

If you read every word, thanks, and wow

I'm a 20 y/o guy from The Netherlands and I study to become an English Teacher. I'm a first years and I had my first exam today. It was a CAE test for reading and listening and it didn't go to that well. I'm just really, really afraid at the moment that I might not pass my first year eventhough it is only my first exam. 

My father passed away a year and a half ago and I feel like it's taking its toll now. My father had been sick since I was 4 years old. 4 times a brain tumor and he also had a new hip because of his job. Basically my mom had to take care for him, my sister and me. 

As I said, the first time he was in surgery was when I was four years old. I didn't think too much of it a the time but I obviously knew something was up. I mentally grew up very fast because of what I had seen at such an early age. 

I'll skip ahead to a few years later, to when I was 13. The tumor in my fathers head grew back. He went back into surgery but there we're some complications. He had to stay in the hospital for a month or so because of these complications. 

Basically what happened to me was that I got depressed. That's how I felt at least but I did not go to a doctor for it or anything. I lost all my friends back then except for a few, these guys are still my friends and I thank them for that.

My dad had to go into surgery again when I was 16 years of age. Another brain tumor. The complications afterwards were much more severe. His bloodpressure got so high up to the point where he went blind temporarily. He almost died because of this. He also had meningitis at a point which didn't help either. 

He never really made it through any revalidation, another year and a half later, when I was at my internship for vet-assistant, I got a call from my mom that my father had to go to the hospital because he had been having stomaches. I made a prediction that it was stomach cancer. I have a thing for knowing whatsup and I was right. However, it could not be treated and my father had only a mere 6 months to live. This really took its toll on me.

The cancer spread out through his body making him unable to eat. He was weighing about 90 kilos in pure muscle in his prime and passed away with 54 kilos. He chose to be euthanized in the end to end his pain. Which I thought was a wise choice and I immediately accepted that. 

After 2 years, it is finally taking its toll on me. I don't really want to go to a psychologist or anything. I just do not feel like that even though it might be better for me. Idk if this adds any information but I am an extremely empathatic extrovert that always does his best to help as many people as possible. I also have a condition that is called dysphasia, basically my motor skills work a little bit different than others but also my understanding of the emotions of people is enhanced by a lot. I don't know why but it is whatever.

My mother is depressed, we are financially unstable since my mom works as just a secretary for a company. My sister is studying phsychology and does not live at home anymore so I don't see her that much. I just genuinely do not know how to feel at the moment and also just wanted to get all this bullshit of my chest for some reason. I always try to stay possitive, maybe it is because it is 1AM right now.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I want to thank you all for reading this if you do. I probably left out a shit ton of information sorry.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you,

I am currently an analyst at a pretty large tech company (~$100B Revenue, 250,000+ employees).  I have been with the company for a little over 4 years (6 months intern, 3.5 years analyst).  I have an opportunity to change career paths a bit into for a much smaller company.  The position is 50% sales / 50% pricing analytics (selling of finished product + futures and forecasting for raw materials), so half of my new job would be learning and the other half will be a little more in my comfort zone.  What I do right now is safe and boring, I could easily do it forever and we would be more than fine financially.  I'm tempted by this offer because it 1) is new and exciting, who doesn't like a shiny object right?, 2) it would let me interact with people more which I enjoy, and 3) the company offers incentives based on how well you do (meritocracy), my current company treats everyone the same.  You just move up the ladder the longer you stay.

**The Facts:**

* Married - we are in our late 20s - wife makes ~$85K/year 
* No kids or pets but would like to have a few when we finish paying off our student loans
* Own both of our cars, no car payments, 11 and 13 year old cars with ~120K miles on each of them
* Student loans ~$35K remaining between the two of us, the worst of it is about $6K at 5.7%, most loans are between 3-4%.  We've been paying these aggressively.  No other form of debt
* $15K emergency fund
* No mortgage, currently renting in high COL area due to job - rent is $1700/month for 1BD 1BA

**Current Work Situation:**

* $90K Salary, 3 weeks PTO, company puts 5% of my salary into 401(k), decent insurance, ~3% cost of living raise each year is pretty much guaranteed. 
* Opportunity to move laterally a few times, and ultimately vertically so long as I stick around for awhile (company culture, no one just ""gets promoted"".  Years of experience always trumps quality of experience here)
* I'm good at what I do, but it is dreadfully boring and I don't enjoy working at a massive company covered with red tape.  It feels impossible to accomplish anything which can be disheartening at times.
* I sit at a desk in an office building about 15minutes away from home, occasionally permitted to work at home (convenient for needing to let a repairman in, sign for a package, or days you just feel a tad crummy)

**New Potential Work Situation:**

* $115K salary, 3 weeks PTO, no company retirement match, decent insurance, 1-5% raises based on performance, potential to earn 100% of salary based on sales/analysis goals and targets (extra $115K)
* Probably less opportunity for promotions/inner company movement due to smaller size
* Opportunity to learn new skills/new industry, might love it, might hate it.
* No cooperate office, work from home everyday except when traveling to sales clients.  US travel only, roughly 4 trips a month lasting 2-3 days.
	
My biggest fear is the travel to other states, currently I don't travel other than my ~15minute commute.  I'm worried about losing quality time with my wife (and potential kids).  Does the flexibility of working from home out weigh the time lost travelling?  Any parents/future parents/spouses out there with travelling jobs? "

Unfortunately (or maybe luckily) I'm not a rich person and I must work really hard to pay my bills and rental, so I don't have much free time or financial conditions to risk a lot about my future. I love programming, it's like my purpose in life! I study it every single day when I have some free time at work (I've been working more with system analysis and never really worked with REAL development), during the weekends or whenever I have some spare time to do so. 

Lately I've been trying to find a job (or even an internship) to learn more about software development and finally put all my knowledge in practice, but a question came to my mind. In the city I'm living right now people tend to use more ""older"" or ""traditional"" languages to build and maintain their softwares like Java and PHP instead of modern ones like Javascript (Node.Js, React, React Native, etc), Python... 

I never really give too much attention to those traditional languages because in my mind I wouldn't find a **good** job or internship in places that use those ""older"" technologies, because of their traditional work system, so I study Python/Javascript and its libraries/frameworks a lot. 

However, I cannot find a proper job or internship using modern technologies like those because I can't find vacancies or companies that work with it so often.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:** Should I render myself to those ""older"" languages, to learn them and finally find a job so I could enter the development world once for all?

Or maybe I should stick with those modern languages/stacks to find a better job in the future? (for ""better job"" consider places with modern and good environments, instead of those traditional office jobs)"

____

I had spent years chasing my dream. Ever since I was a little girl, the intelligence community appealed to me as a future career. The intrigue and excitement I had seen in the movies as a child had always captivated me. The real world was not as fun, however. I had just completed what seemed like an endless amount of studies. A double major in macroeconomics and political science. I had gotten perfect grades at the cost of graduating a virgin. Receiving a masters in international business with a thesis on organized crime in the US. (I even defended it in Russian that I had learned on the side.) Internships with law enforcement every summer and a sterling record with each, every cop begging to write my recommendations letters to apply to the CIA. Maybe it was to try to butter me up so I might let them fuck me in the back of their cop car, but I didn't care.

I had been called back for the first round of interviews and could hardly sleep. Just because I was incredibly educated and a virgin didn't mean I hadn't learned how the world works. A nice pair of ass and tits walking through the door with my resume would never be turned down. This wasn't the time to play it safe. My interview outfit was a pencil skirt that seemed to threaten to rip it was so tight on my ass and ending just halfway down my thighs. Both nicely toned from the years I spent preparing for the physical requirements of the job. When I bought the blouse I wore, I knew exactly when I would wear it. In the most professional tone, it screamed, ""these perky tits are way bigger than my slender frame would suggest.""

I about screamed when I got the call that I had gotten accepted into a field office in Chicago. I showed up 30 minutes early to my first day and my excitement quickly wore off. My dreams of undercover roles and stakeouts were buried under the mountain of paperwork I was to file. They said it took years of this before I'd even be considered for anything more. This was not what I signed up for.

One Tuesday, 6 weeks in to the job, as I was taking the senior agents their coffee during a briefing, I heard them discussing a new covert operation. It was dangerous, exciting, and would require a female agent to act as a hussy to a local coke running group for as long as it took to get the information. (Please include the work ""pink"" in your message so I know you read this) They suggested it might be a couple of days of solo work, mostly just hanging around trying to overhear something good. However, the 2 female agents balked at the idea of being involved with one of the most dangerous groups in the country. I didn't even remember speaking up, just the looks I was given after I did, the male officers looking at each other and then back at me (well my body at least) and nodding. ""You've got the job...err...what was your name again?""

""Agent Allison, sir.""
____

So, the premise is that I am sent undercover to dig up dirt on a crime lord. The mission should be fairly safe and innocuous sounding in the prep. It's supposed to be a short-term in and out, but when the crime lord won't give up the information and start pushing me, I have no choice but to drop to their level of incivility.

I think ideally we could start as the senior agents ""prep"" me for my role (in a realistic way though), then move to the crime lord. I would ask you play both.

I would ask that this try and stay in the realm of realistic, no threesomes on a desk with two agents in the middle of the day. However they might help me dress up to find the right look for my role, etc. With the crime boss, I am desperate to keep things professional but my safety is put in jeopardy if I don't learn to bend the rules.

The main kink for this is the idea that I am ""forced"" to do things for my dream job that I don't want to, but have only myself to blame."
9uxcql,5,2018-11-07,I [21F] thought my boyfriend [24M] and I were in a good place but apparently not and idk how to go forward...,TUSM_or_bust,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9uxcql/i_21f_thought_my_boyfriend_24m_and_i_were_in_a/,"We met while both in college (different universities but mutual friends) and instantly hit it off. We joke that we started dating as soon as we met since we started seeing each other exclusively from the weekend we met. Because we decided to commit pretty much immediately, I attribute that to why we’ve worked to get through some difficult situations. 

I was sexually and physically assaulted several times during end of high school and beginning of college. It wasn’t the start of my mental health struggle but it definitely exacerbated my depression and anxiety. My family isn’t fully aware but I have recently been more open to speaking to them about it and have sought counseling periodically. Overall he’s been very supportive and patient with me allowing me to talk about the trauma, being understanding about that factor in our sex life, and we have very open communication about those traumas and both of our mental health states. 

But His mother is a narcissist (not saying it to be insulting but very seriously.) She had a rough upbringing and the whole family walks on eggshells around her excessive drinking, emotionally and sometimes physically abusive outbursts and emotional volatility. His parents are getting divorced and his father isn’t in the picture. There was a time after he had shoulder surgery that his mom didn’t permit anyone not even his sister and brother to come see him at home and she was withholding his pain medication from him. Up to that point I had a cordial relationship with her until she tried to use me and my ability to see him to manipulate him (even calling me all hours of the night and day to berate him and even went as far as to accuse him of abusing me). I told her the things she said are untrue and I don’t accept her behavior towards me. She became belligerent with me and many boundaries were crossed. He always stood up for me and tried his best to shield me from the drama and we worked to find him an apartment for the end of his last year of college. It was a big stress in our relationship but we worked through it as a team. 

Finances were also something we had to strengthen communication about in the past. He was making really good money, at an internship and side business he started, when I met him. I never asked him for anything but he would bring me flowers, buy me really beautiful dresses and shoes and take me to dinner at nice places. I always expressed how much I appreciated and also that it was NOT necessary. When his internship ended he continued to pay for a lot of things (more like paying for our chic fil a instead of a 4 star meal which are both yummy to me!) but one day he just snapped about how much it’s a stress to him and how he thinks I’m just using him for his money and I’m inconsiderate. Yes, I should have offered to pay more and I shouldn’t have been comfortable just letting him pay. I acknowledged that and once I started my part time job we always split the bill or just cooked together. 

I went through a really bad period of depression after graduation in May and my anxiety became so crippling I didn’t leave my apartment for weeks at a time. During that time he was going through issues with his mom and he wasn’t really supportive of me though I had been there for him through his conflicts even with my own problems going on. I felt that I didn’t have support from him and I voiced that to him and he said he would make more of an effort to be mindful of that. Which he did. 

Things have been fine for months now (or so I thought) and as little things come up we talk about it and nip it in the butt....but all of a sudden one simple back and forth about carpooling to a friends house led to him telling me that he doesn’t think I’m considerate of him: he drives most places we go, he ASSUMED I would need him to pay for all my drinks and food, and says he feels like my caretaker. Even though since we talked about finances a YEAR ago we split every meal apart from the anniversary dinner he bought.

I don’t have my license because living in the city for college didn’t require me to get one so I just put it off. I admit I’m not making as strong of an effort as I should to get my license now that I moved back home and that puts a strain on him (picking me up, driving me home or paying for uber because I’m looking for work and he has a job). I need to change that not only for our relationship but just for my own independence....

But where I’m stuck is the delivery of that complaint. I feel like it was almost issued as an ultimatum because he said he doesn’t know if he can go on with the relationship because I don’t have a license (no pressure). Also I’m caught between a rock and a hard place: if I tell him about the steps I’ve done to be proactive (got my physical done for my permit app, will be getting my permit this week) then he’ll say I’m just doing it for him not because I actually want to. If I say nothing he’ll think I’m once again blowing off his complaint about not being able to drive. 

I also am starting to feel like he he has a very negative perception of me as a person on the whole. When I talked to him about my assualt he’ll say “oh we just need to get you stronger so you can actually defend yourself” “if you were stronger or did A,B,C that maybe wouldn’t have happened” (I’m 5’2 and my attackers were 6’+ and large build) he makes that remark really often as if I was assaulted because im weak but there were many other factors. I also try to explain my depression to him and my anxiety and he says “what do you have to be depressed about” with a counter point to every insecurity or reason I give him while mentioning how his circumstances have been worse with his mother. I have Crohns and I am still trying to find foods that don’t make me sick. He’ll make comments about how he appreciates fine dining and doesn’t know if he can be with someone “who isn’t willing/doesn’t appreciate good food” I WISH I could eat anything without a care BUT I CANT. He don’t feel like he criticizes a HABIT he criticizes my CHARACTER “

I think one of the things he said that hurt me the most is that he is irritated by me when I mentioned anything about a future wedding. Which is not often, it has been about 3-4x VERY casually, seriously: a funny quip between my friends about how I dislike pear shaped rings, a joke about the price of two weddings (I’m Kenyan he’s American so a traditional wedding and western one) and I told him I have a fun Pinterest board of dresses/decorations and other things (also have one for holiday parties but I don’t host, it’s just shits and gigs). I also have plans to apply to Med school next year and have made it VERY clear I’m not getting married for another 4-6 years so it’s not a serious thing but the fact that he called me “childish, annoying and immature” and that “talking about a wedding means I don’t care about trying in our relationship anymore” is such a harsh sweeping statement to make. Especially when he’ll talk about having kids one day, ask me when we are moving in together etc. 

I thought things were going well but I feel blindsided by his sudden cynicism. I feel like whatever I do is wrong and I don’t know what I should do to move forward. I love him immensely and he’s a great guy, he also he has some very valid complaints and I’m willing to improve....but he also really hurt my feelings and I feel like I forgive his shortcomings and give him the benefit of the doubt when it’s not fully reciprocated. 

If you’ve read up to this point thank you for reading. If you have any insight to offer I would really appreciate it. Xoxo

tl;dr we've been through some ups and down that we've gotten through as a team and with great communication. But he has recently expressed all this dissatisfaction and cynicism seemingly out of nowhere and now I feel like any choice I make will be seen negatively and won't improve the breakdown. What'd you think???"

&gt; [REQ] ($3,000) - (#Chicago, Illinois, USA), ($5,000 by Feb. 28th, $1,000 monthly payments), (Paypal)

# Post contents

Hey guys, I want to start this off by saying I know that this is an excessive amount for a first time inquiry, but I intend for this to be the first and last time I rely on these services. The reason I need these emergency funds is because I've just been informed that my car is suffering from transmission failure due to ""low fluid levels"", and I'll need a full transmission replacement for me to safely go anywhere, or really go anywhere at all. Regularly this wouldn't be a problem &amp; I'd handle the costs myself if not for the horrible timing. One of my best friends recently passed away from ovarian cancer, and I have to attend her funeral on the 6th. On top of this, I also have an urgent meeting with my internship supervisor on the 11th. All of my current in-hand spending cash is held up as of now, and I don't get paid until the 18th of each month, so I need an emergency deposit to fix my transmission and be able to handle my responsibilities for the meantime. 


I'm willing to make payments of $1,000 each on the 30th of every month, ending on the 28th of February for a total repayment amount of $5,000. Most likely will be repaid $5,000 before Feb. 28th, but I named the final date the 28th just to be safe. I'm offering such a high interest rate because I absolutely NEED this problem fixed so that I can attend my best friends funeral, and also because cost isn't an issue, as I said I'd handle the problem myself if it weren't for the horrid timing. Thank you guys again for giving me the time of day, until next time! (which hopefully won't exist haha).

Context for my situation: https://www.reddit.com/r/borrow/comments/9ke8dr/req_3000_chicago_illinois_usa_5000_by_feb_28th/


I still need to attend my internship meeting (along with some other events), but I've convinced my supervisor to postpone it for the meantime (until the 17th). I've tried every other possible means to remedy the situation but to no avail, so I'm coming back here to ask for the amount to fix my car one more time. 

It's the same repayment plan as before ($1,000 monthly payments) but with a few changes. This time I'm requesting $3,500 with a repay of $6,000 instead of $3,000 with a repay of $5,000, and the final repayment date will be April 16th instead of Feb. 28th (And again, likely to repay in full a fair while before the final repayment date). Open to negotiating the terms of the loan if truly needed, I.E sooner repayment date, slightly lower loan amount, etc. &amp; willing to provide any required documents for verification. Please let me know if you guys are willing to give me a moment of your time! Thank you.

9uxl7p,1,2018-11-07,Should I go to a doctor to see if there are any ways to make my depression hurt less?,BeneficialJuice5,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/9uxl7p/should_i_go_to_a_doctor_to_see_if_there_are_any/,"I am not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I was unsure where I would post this instead. As the topic suggests, I am looking for options to alleviate my depression. But there are a few things that are making me hesitate in following through with this: financial, privacy, and whether or not this was the right way of curing my depression. For a long time, I suffered under immense depression and anxiety, which almost resulted in an attempted suicide. I decided to give therapy a shot before I did this, and so I went to my university for counselling (which was provided for free). After 2 and a half months, I made significant improvements and was able to embark on an overseas internship. I only had suicidal thoughts a few times during this trip, however, they were mostly due to anxieties about presentations and expectations. , I enjoyed my time overseas and came back a happier person. During the first half of my college semester, I regressed to my previous state for a brief period, but I got a lot better during my second half of the semester. After I graduated, I became a recluse for a month before embarking on a graduation trip with my brother. Afterwards, I studied overseas for about 2 months in a language program. When I came back, I started looking for jobs for about 2 months before I got a full-time position. I'm sorry if I'm not making much sense, but basically, depression has been quite persistent even after my therapy and numerous little successes. Even as I write this, I can barely formulate sentences without having to pause and having my mind wander. I constantly remember small offences, take things way too personally, and ruminate about my past. I tried meditation, however, my demons always seemed to win. I always seem to feel angry, sad, bloated, and slow. Like the world is out to get me, and the only way to defend against the world is to be completely negative. I am not as suicidal as I was before, but there are times where I might just get tunnel visions and I fear that I might actually go on this dark path.   
At any rate, my question is whether or not I should go to a doctor for some solutions. I am afraid that he will judge me harshly, or that the fee will be too high. I live in Canada, so I am not sure if our medical care covers this or not. I saw prices of therapists, and they are extremely high (Ironically, this made me even more depressed). I was thinking that the possible solutions that he would recommend would be these therapists, or antidepressants (which I have never tried). I also do not want to consult my family doctor, as she is a family friend of ours. So I would have to go to a walk-in clinic or something like that. If you guys know any solutions, please feel free to contact me. "
9uxnkv,8,2018-11-07,Huurcamper gaat tweemaal kapot en afgesproken pechhulp geeft niet thuis. Recht op vergoeding gederfd reisgenot?,rikvanoostende,juridischadvies,https://www.reddit.com/r/juridischadvies/comments/9uxnkv/huurcamper_gaat_tweemaal_kapot_en_afgesproken/,"Afgelopen zomer hebben we in Nederland een camper gehuurd voor een rondreis naaar en door Noorwegen van drie weken. Vooraf is aangegeven dat voor ieder defect (lekke band, wat dan ook) de pechhulp dient te worden ingeschakeld omdat hij daarvoor verzekerd is.

Na een paar dagen blijkt de handrem niet goed te functioneren. We kunnen de bergen niet in en bellen de verhuurder en de pechhulpservice. De pechhulpverlener claimt eerst dat de verhuurder niet verzekerd is en de dagen daarna komen ze hierop terug en proberen ze er alles aan te doen om ons te helpen. Wij wachten vier dagen tot er letterlijk door de pechhulpverlener wordt aangegeven dat we aan ons lot zijn overgeleverd. We besluiten zelf op zoek te gaan naar hulp en vinden een garage die ons wilt helpen: binnen een halfuur is de handrem gerepareerd en we spreken met de verhuurder af dat we de rekening bij thuiskomst bij hem indienen.

De rondreis moet een stuk worden ingekort. De vrijdag daarop later gaat de startmotor kapot. We bellen opnieuw de verhuurder en de pechhulp die met ons afspreken een sleepdienst te regelen. Na een halve dag bellen we waar die blijft en nu blijkt dat we door hen zijn vergeten. 's Avonds komt deze dan eindelijk en we worden voor het weekend bij een garage op een industrieterrein geparkeerd. In overleg met de verzekeraar mogen we in een hotelkamer verblijven maar het bedrag waarvoor we zijn verzekerd is niet toereikend om van te eten dus we lopen iedere avond terug naar de camper om eten klaar te maken.

Maandag gaat de garage open. Een startmotor kan besteld worden maar na een gesprek met de verzekeraar wilt deze eerst intern overleggen of de camper niet beter ongerepareerd gerepatriëerd kan worden. We wachten af en dinsdag is er nog geen duidelijkheid, maar vervangend vervoer wordt in ieder geval niet geregeld, onder andere omdat Hertz in het dorp waar we vastzitten, geen auto's beschikbaar heeft.

We controleren dit door zelf met Hertz te bellen. Ze zeggen gewoon auto's van elke klasse voorhanden te hebben en we weten nu dat we de verzekeraar van de verhuurder niet langer kunnen vertrouwen. We overleggen met de verhuurder dat hij gaat heel Zuid-Noorwegen rondbellen naar garages die een startmotor hebben. Wij vullen de dieseltank van de camper bij met jerrycans en laten ons aanslepen door de garagehouder. 

Ons plan werkt en we rijden in een ruk (270 km) door naar Oslo waar bij de door de verhuurder gevonden garage in een uur de nieuwe startmotor erin zit. We rijden zo snel mogelijk naar de boot en naar huis.

---

Onze vakantie is een enorme teleurstelling geweest door het ontbreken van de afgesproken pechhulp. We hebben negen dagen letterlijk stilgestaan, maar zouden voor de korte vakantie die overbleef natuurlijk nooit helemaal naar Noorwegen zijn gereden en alle bijkomende kosten hebben gemaakt.

De verhuurder zegt net zo teleurgesteld te zijn in zijn verzekeraar als wij en wilt het initiatief nemen om eerst zelf met zijn verzekeraar om de tafel te zitten en ons daarna van een tegemoetkoming te voorzien. We spreken af dat wij hem daarvoor enige tijd gunnen maar verlangen dat hij ons op de hoogte houdt. Inmiddels krijgen we geen reactie meer van hem. We sturen een e-mail waarin we aangeven zonder tegenreactie zelf het initiatief te zullen nemen via onze rechtsbijstandsverzekering. We zetten de schadeposten alvast voor onszelf op een rijtje.

De voornaamste vraag die we hebben is of en wat we redelijkerwijs kunnen claimen voor de niet nagekomen pechhulp. Kunnen we een deel van het bedrag wat we aan camperhuur betaald hebben claimen? En hebben we recht op een vergoeding voor gederfd reisgenot?"

When I leave the house, when I'm at work, when I'm doing anything. I'm always on edge and always afraid. 

The only time I am at peace is when I am alone in a room by myself, preferably with the door locked. 

I don't know how the hell I've gotten as far as I have living like this. It's hell. I managed to graduate and get accepted into a computer engineering program and I'm 3 years through. I'm at work at an internship right now. I was able to act my way through the job interview despite being on the verge of a panic attack before and after. I'm always acting. Every day I put on a show for whoever is in front of me. It's the only way I know how. I'm socially awkward and people don't like me very much, but I have to bear it and keep going through it like I always have. My boss is a bully who has stopped giving me work and talks shit about me behind my back, my coworkers have followed his lead and now I'm isolated completely at work. I have nothing to do and I sit at a desk in the corner by myself. I can't keep up the front all of the time and I look just as depressed as I really am. People avoid me like I'm some kind of leper. I often wonder if they knew the hell I came from and the struggle I have just to get out of bed in the morning would they treat me any differently. 

I've always been treated with hostility. The worst part is that I don't know how to fix it. I don't know what I'm doing so wrong. It hurts so much but I've just become numb from it all. I have lived all of my life forcing myself to do things I hate. Forcing myself to get out of bed when all I want to do is lie there and stare at the ceiling. Force myself to go to the store because I'm so hungry that I'll starve if I don't. Forcing myself to go to college, get a degree and a job because I'll starve if I don't. Forcing myself to do everything. Every day is a struggle.

9uy8ii,2,2018-11-07,FortiGate and Azure difficulties,Shootmeplx,fortinet,https://www.reddit.com/r/fortinet/comments/9uy8ii/fortigate_and_azure_difficulties/,"Hey everyone.

I’m currently doing an internship for a company and they’re having me investigate how FortiGate and Azure work.

I appear to be having some difficulties on what’s supposed to be something really basic and I hope someone can help me out here..

I’m new to both FortiGate and Azure so bear with me.

I followed the cookbook guide to install it on Azure and that works fine. Both the External interface and the Internal interface can communicatie and they have internet access.

However, when I deploy a new Ubuntu Server, and place it in the same internal subnet, this machine does not have internet access at all. It gets his internal IP correctly, and I can ping both the external and internal interface, but my ping to the internet gets lost.

When I run a packet sniffer on FortiGate I can see the echo request being directed to the external interface correctly, but it never gets a reply.

I checked the UDRs for the internal subnet, and these are default all pointing to the external subnet.

The UDR on the external subnet I find confusing though. It’s a default route that says 10.0.1.0/24 -&gt; 10.0.0.4. The first being the internal subnet.

Anyway, apart from the default installation, I noticed that in FortiGate, I have two ports. One is the 10.0.0.4 external interface, and port2 is defaulted to 0.0.0.0/0. I found that odd so I changed the settings to DHCP and it’s now correctly at 10.0.1.4. 

For troubleshooting I only made two policies, port1 -&gt; port2 allow everything and vice versa. Ofcourse just for testing.

On the Azure side I made sure that the new ubuntu server had port forwarding enabled in its’ IP settings.

But that’s basically where I’m lost and I don’t know where to look.

Does anyone here perhaps see the obvious thing that I’m missing?

Kind regards

EDIT: I fixed my exact issue. It was indeed a routing issue in Azure. I managed to mainly spot it by following a guide sent to me by the FortiGate official support. I can't share the file since they asked it, but if you run into any issues I recommend contacting their support and asking for this specific use case."

Me and a fellow intern (/u/prenkbeer) have been given a task revolving around Craft CMS and Twig, and for the life of me we can't figure out how it works. I've read through the entire documentation and stack overflow but it seems like we want things that dont exist.

&amp;#x200B;

**What we want to accomplish:**

We currently have 4 websites all running on PHP with bootstrap (Will become \~60 in the near future). All of them have the same content aside from images and titles. We've got a section within these pages, ""About Us"" which is also the same on every page.

&amp;#x200B;

The whole task we've received revolves around this specific section, the end goal would be that you would edit the ""About Us"" section **once** within Craft CMS and that would edit all of the \~60 pages automatically.

&amp;#x200B;

As far as we know, we need to do this with global variables within Craft CMS.

**Our Understanding:**

We go to the globals tab in the Craft dashboard and we create a global called ""About Us"" with the handle ""aboutUs"".

We assign 2 fields to this global, called ""About us Title"" &amp; ""About us Body"" with the handles ""aboutUsTitle"" &amp; ""aboutUsbody"".

Now we go to the site, and replace the current title within the &lt;h1&gt; tags with ""{{ aboutUs.aboutUsTitle }}.

Same deal with the body, replace contents of &lt;p&gt; tags with {{ aboutUs.aboutUsBody }}.

&amp;#x200B;

The result we get is just the page printing out the whole {{ whatever }}.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope someone can be some help, if anyone needs some more info I'm happy to deliver.

9uzbqw,1,2018-11-07,I (20m) don’t know what to do about my best friend (20f),Nutjob3526,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9uzbqw/i_20m_dont_know_what_to_do_about_my_best_friend/,"So this is a long story and I’m going to try and be objective. Any advice/thoughts are would be AMAZING. 

I’m 20m in college and I’ve been friends with this girl since last year when I met her through my major. I had a girlfriend at the time, and both girls knew about each other, but never brought each other up. I broke up with my girlfriend to start this semester, so 3ish months ago. 

Since we broke up, my friend and I have started walking to class together and she offers to drive me sometimes because my house is on her way to our classes. We have 2 classes together, so we see each other at least 4 times a week. We never really hung out on weekends unless we ran into each other while out. 

2 weeks ago I invited her to a date party has a friend, and we ended up having sex afterwards. (Best sex I’ve ever had and I felt something special)

Since then we’ve gotten lunch/dinner after class at the campus cafe around 4 times. Today she offered to pick me up and go grocery shopping. We’ve also hung out twice on the weekends since the hookup, and I ended up getting sloppy drunk because of my nerves so I have no idea if anything would’ve happened anyway. She recently mapped out my class schedule for next semester so we could take all the same classes. She also has encouraged me to get an internship at the same company she is interning at. I am going to start working with her professionally in a few weeks. 

Looking at these facts, I feel like any reasonable person would say she’s into me. I just don’t know though. 

She’s told me that she made it around with a lot of guys the first two years of college, and I know of one hookup for sure this year before me. She also is very bad at texting/Snapchat. I realize that social media like that isn’t a huge deal, but sometimes it’s straight ignoring me, like texts being left “read or opened” and not answered for hours, sometimes a day. 

My struggle is that when we’re together, I feel like she’s totally into me and I know that I’m starting to get feels. But when she’s not around, I feel like I’m an afterthought. The idea of being an afterthought combined with her track record of getting around are starting to make me feel very insecure about myself. It’s kinda driving me crazy and making me obsessive about this girl to the point where I’m always wondering what she’s doing. 

I guess my fear is that I am just a friend out of convenience and that the sex and all the other good stuff doesn’t mean anything because I’m just another guy for her. 

tl;dr I can’t tell if my best friend is into me or not and I am starting to get the feels. I can’t tell if she’s actually into me or not and it’s driving me crazy"
9uzrup,7,2018-11-07,Civil Partnership,Nimriell,Prague,https://www.reddit.com/r/Prague/comments/9uzrup/civil_partnership/,"Hello everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I thought for a long time before posting here about my issue. I am not very comfortable doing so as it is a bit awkward, but I am at a point that I feel completely desperate. That's why I highly appreciate any input which might help my case.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a 27 year old guy who has been living in Prague for 2 years to study master's degree on International Management in a foreign institution. I studied Civil Engineering for my bachelor's but after working for a couple of months after graduation, I decided I didn't want to have a career in that field. During that time I had a very toxic relationship which ruined my mental health and made me lose my  best friend (they are together now but I don't mind anymore) and ruined my relationships with other friends too. At that point I decided to escape; get a masters, get a job and start a new life. I wanted to start a life in Prague, to build my emotional and financial independence. To make that step to becoming an adult.

&amp;#x200B;

Before coming to Prague I felt so drown by everything that I just wanted to escape so bad, I didn't even do a proper research about the country, my university or anything. A friend of mine was planning to study in Prague at that time, so I just sticked to him. Found this program that I thought might fit me in the same university, then he changed his mind so I happened to come by myself.

&amp;#x200B;

From what I knew, I could start working right away as a student; at least 20 hours per week. I got a job first month after coming, but 10 days later HR told me that my visa doesn't allow me to work at all as I study in a foreign institution, not a Czech university. 

&amp;#x200B;

They said they don't sponsor people for visa and need someone to start working immediately. I offered them to work as an intern. I was ok not to get paid for a few months until I get my work visa and I would be responsible for the whole visa process - payments, documentation etc. I offered them to work with Zivnostensky List. The answer was no. 

&amp;#x200B;

I thought starting a new life in Prague would help me heal but everything got worse. I had few more interviews and some of them I've been told they would want me for the position but they need someone with work permit. If I had years of working experience in IT for example maybe they would go for it but my background doesn't worth it. Few months ago I thought I found a job which turned out to be an MLM business. Got ripped off even more (I was paying for trainings etc. because I thought this would be my only shot and my 'manager' was baiting me with work permit. I simply chose to believe them)

&amp;#x200B;

Getting rejected because of this makes me feel so useless, so disposable. I just need an opportunity, to see some trust. At one point I gave up. My depression and anxiety gone worse, bad habits got stronger, eventually I got broke. I lost my self-esteem, social relationships and job interviews gone worse. I am still getting help from my family and I know I am a huge burden to them. They say they will support me as much as they can but this hurts even more.

&amp;#x200B;

I finished all my master's classes but I need to submit my thesis on January, then I will have my diploma. On March my visa expires which means I have to go back to my country. That will be the golden shot of depression I suppose. 

&amp;#x200B;

The reason I am sharing this is that I am looking for someone whom I can have civil partnership with. For now this seems like the only option for me. I am not looking for any emotional relationship and I do not mean to be burden to anyone. I seek someone that we can get along. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have been sharing my room with a friend for the last 2 months to split the rent. She will leave Prague for a few months to take a journey to India, in 2 weeks. Basically I am looking for a new roommate with 'partnership' based on friendship. The room is very spacious; you have your space and your bed, I get the couch. By not being 100% sure, it is also possible for the person to move in to another room as the other flatmate will also leave Prague in December. 

&amp;#x200B;

I enjoy cleaning around, washing the dishes and cooking. I am very willing to do these for the person as I don't mind doing them anyway. Once I get the work permit I am willing to help the person with her rent or anything. It feels so weird to be writing these kind of things, but I don't know what else I can offer.

&amp;#x200B;

I am very sorry for the long post. I know what I am looking for is not legit. I am more than happy to hear any other suggestions. I know I could do more during my time in Prague, to not be in this situation but I got weaker and weaker day by day. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what else to say. Thank you if you read this far.

9v04nn,2,2018-11-07,"My [28 M] GF [28 F] of 3 years told me that moving in with me is giving her anxiety, and she resents me some for making her move.",Fuegofox,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9v04nn/my_28_m_gf_28_f_of_3_years_told_me_that_moving_in/,"tl;dr I made my GF move from Boston to Miami and back to Boston over the course of 1.5 years, and she is having anxiety about moving in with me again. 

Backstory: First, we are both fairly independent people, and sometimes do not communicate well, but that hasn't ever stopped us from loving each other. 

GF and I have been together for 3 years. We lived in separate apartments (in Boston, where we are both from) for the first 1.5 years, until we both quit our jobs (we both did not like what we were doing/where we were working) to backpack through Europe for 3 months. We spent every minute together for those 3 months in hostels, questionable AirBnB's, trains, planes, and buses. I thought that, if we survived that trip, we would have no issue living together. 

During that trip, I was accepted into graduate school in Miami. I asked her, while in Portugal, if she wanted to move to Florida with me, and she said yes. We found an apartment together from another continent, and moved down not knowing anyone and her without a job. 

The first few months were rough. She couldn't find work and was walking dogs to pass the time between applications. I came home whenever I was not in class to be with her. I thought she missed home, hated the heat, hate our apartment, and hated being alone so much. And I was afraid she would grow to resent me for that, but she didn't. She did eventually found a full time job in the right industry, we made friends with the local running group, and started to become more comfortable there.

Now, my degree is a professional master's, so rather than a research thesis, you apply and complete an internship, write and defend a thesis regarding that experience. We both know that internship could be anywhere in the world. It happened to be back in Boston. So, for the summer and early fall, I moved back to Boston, she stayed in Florida, applying for jobs in Boston while still working full-time. My internship has hired me on full time and she got a job in Mass as well. I thought everything was going to plan. I thought we were on the same page. 

Jump ahead to last week, I had just moved into our new apartment in Boston, and was waiting for her to come the weekend after. I thought something was up that week, she was distant. When she arrived on Saturday she didn't have any of her stuff. I came to find out that she couldn't move in with me (yet, I hope) and resented me some for making her move from Florida. In particular, back to Boston. She said that, during the past week, the thought of moving in with me again was giving her anxiety. She doesn't want to be in Boston forever, she loves to travel and wants to live in new places. I do too, but I didn't know being here was going to be this bad. She feels awful for signing a lease with me here and not wanting to be there. I don't want her to feel stressed about that, I can handle it. I want her to want to be there. 

I did not know how attached she got there. Probably during the time I was gone and we were doing distance. She told me she felt like we weren't even dating during some of that time, which broke my heart a little. I know now that I did not ask her what she wanted, how she felt. Even though the job I have here is amazing, I would give it up in a heartbeat so be with her, anywhere in the world. 

We are still together, though she is living at home with her parents (central Mass). We are spending this weekend together. Doing all the things we used to do here in Boston, hoping that things feel normal and right again. I hope to god they do. If she wants to leave Boston, I would leave with her, if she would let me.

I know I effed up, but does this sound fixable? Or have I done damage that cannot be undone?

Thanks all. "
9v0uh8,2,2018-11-07,[M4FFFF+] Overwatch on Glassdoor: “Internship was lit. Comfortable boarding. Cafeteria’s open 24/7. Tracer gives head like a champ.”,SuckMyDPPenis,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/9v0uh8/m4ffff_overwatch_on_glassdoor_internship_was_lit/,"Of course, that’s not the review I actually left, but maybe if Hana begged a little harder I would have. I’m kind of getting ahead of myself, though, so let me explain what’s going on here.

Two years ago, when I was sixteen, I went to the museum with my little brother. The poor kid broke his wrist like a week prior and was cooped up inside the whole time while he ‘recovered.’ Frankly, I thought the whole thing was bullshit; he wasn’t torn up about the whole thing since it was his off hand, and within a day of getting the cast he was already flying around the house like a maniac, but Mom *insisted* that her little baby boy not risk it by going to school for a while. It wasn’t all fun and games, though. Like I said, he was forced to stay inside, and Mom practically butchered Timmy’s lessons when she tried to teach him to keep him caught up. Lucky for him, I went to the same school, and I saved my notebooks, so it wasn’t life or death for him.

Anyways, not the point. The point is I felt bad for him because of everything that was happening, and to make it up to him I brought him to the Overwatch Historical Museum. I half expected Mom to object, but of course she was *thrilled* that I was ‘spending time with him’ and ‘getting involved in his hobbies.’ I sort of just rolled my eyes at the time, the way she was gushing over it like it was some big deal, but I never realized just how much it would change my life.

If you’ve seen the security tapes that got released all over the news, you know what happened next. Lots of guns, lots of spandex. I did a lot of staring at butts on the side as a hormonal teenager, then I did some punching, the robbers fucked off and Tracer made Timmy’s day. I did a lot of bragging after. I thought that would be the highlight of my life, too; not many people get to say they saved the day by punching a Talon sniper in the gut. Of course, if I was right, the story would’ve ended right there. So, yeah, I was wrong. My highlight was about to get a whole lot highlight-ier.

Maybe it was luck, destiny, karma paying off or the butterfly effect in action, because I saw a whole lot more of Lena Oxton after that. She spoke at the school district, showed up at restaurants, I saw her in the park, and each time we recognized each other and spoke. Somewhere along the line we traded contact details, and chance encounters turned into planned ones. I learned that she was in state for a while on unofficial Overwatch business. She learned I was on the chess team at my local high school (riveting, I know). It didn’t take long for me to realize that this was what having a role model felt like. She was always there to listen, always eager to answer questions. It felt weird to have a peer that wasn’t a peer.

I guess at some point she began to feel a little differently, because on my eighteenth birthday, after all my plans for the day were exhausted, she sent me a text. In it, she apologized for calling so late, but she had a gift for me and needed me to come as soon as possible. I, of course, was only too happy to oblige, not realizing what the gift was. Yeah, this is going exactly where you think it is.

Lena mounted me like an animal. Perfect, perky tits, tomboy locks that made for perfect sex hair, and a bush so well trimmed you’d swear she took a clippers to it every night. We must’ve gone through two boxes of condoms, each one filled just a little less than the previous one as I mustered up everything in my balls for her— and when we ran out, we switched to anal. The whole time we were doing it, she talked about how she’d been waiting for my eighteenth birthday, how the way I carried myself made her buzz inside, how she was screaming my name for the past month as she fingered herself to this exact scenario. I, on the other hand, was too busy working her holes to talk.

The morning after was... well, surreal to say the least. I thought it was a dream, but that theory went out the window as quickly as it came, because when I tried to sit up another hundred and thirty pounds was keeping me down in a fancy hotel bed. Not that I was complaining; I just rolled over, held the woman as tightly as she held me, and went back to sleep. The next time I woke up, she was up too, eyes locked with mine and smiling like a devil with a soul to claim. I was too busy watching those eyes to notice her reaching under the pillow and pull out an envelope, labeled with the words: **URGENT. OVERWATCH INTERNSHIP DETAILS ENCLOSED.** I guess she noticed when I stopped looking at her and started looking at the envelope, because she only had one thing to say to that.

“There’s more where this came from, luv.”

- - -

**TL;DR:** In which an Overwatch agent gets frisky with a barely legal teenager and invites him to get frisky some more. At the Overwatch HQ. With other Overwatch agents.

The scene we’ll be playing will kick off a couple months after this prompt. Tracer’s just invited Brian (from the cinematic trailer) to serve an internship with Overwatch after he finishes his senior year, all expenses paid. He knows Lena’s ready to get down and dirty with him, but the British brunette’s been very vocal about her opinion on Brian back home, and a couple other agents want their fill of teenage dick— and if they don’t yet, all it takes is a little convincing. Luckily, Tracer is all too willing to share.

I’m typically completely limitless, but I’d like this roleplay to be a little more lighthearted. That being said, I’m more than willing to redefine what that means, so if you want to put a specific fetish into this, feel free to ask.

I’d like to put some focus on these particular fetishes.

**COSTUMES/COSPLAY:** ‘Tis the witching season! Could be one of the alternate skins, could be a new costume altogether. Who doesn’t want to see Mercy in a ‘sexy nurse’ costume?

**IMPREG:** Everyone’s a consenting adult with a lot of money. No reason Brian can’t leave everyone with a bundle of joy in their bellies!

**WATERSPORTS:** Urine’s just hot. Shower in it, pour yourself a glass, or just drink straight from the tap; that golden glory is just *divine.*

**FUTA/TRAP:** I don’t mind if certain heroes are packing beneath their suits. D.Va’s a trap, Mei’s a futa, change my mind.

Of course, four fetishes doesn’t nearly encompass my list. I’m also into BDSM, latex, drugs, consensual abuse, pet play, toys, tattoos, piercings, exhibitionism, and foodplay. But again, that doesn’t cover everything. Certain fetishes may apply to certain heroes.

I can’t wait to see those orange envelopes, guys. Don’t disappoint me!

I started trading in early August after a basic research period from May - August. I threw $2k into a TastyWorks account and started playing around with different strategies. I have basically made all my gains from the weed boom with CRON and CGC but otherwise have seen inconsistent success, so my account has had some losses in the past month. I am currently in a standstill of progress and am wondering exactly where to go forward. Currently in my learning pathway I have:

\- gone through all OptionAlpha and TastyWorks videos, read Understanding Options by Sincere, Market Wizards, and listened to many Chat With Traders podcasts

\- gained experience from my own personal account experience

\- have spent 3 - 5 hours a day since August focusing on account management, reading research papers, screening and creating strategies, etc. I have been focused non-stop on this and has become everything I spend my free time on 

\- am forming a startup this upcoming summer with a group of 10 or so college students (majors of students including finance, economics, risk management, and comp. sci.) that will be focused on trading options with a research-based and a group information-sharing approach where we learn from each others winners and mistakes and experiences through both personal accounts and our managed ""general fund""

\- will be joining the major investment management fund at my school for the next 3 semesters, even though it is long-only and equity only it is a great resume builder and experience along with great networking opportunities

Even so, I am not currently confident in my abilities and know I need to learn more. I want this to be my career and my losses only spur me on to put in more effort and research into this. I don't exactly know where to go from here though. My first plan is to obviously read Option Volatility and Pricing by Natenberg and I hope to have this done by the end of the month. Going forward, I want programming experience foremost but there are a lot of things to focus on. 

For those who trade full-time and have taken the pathway from student to professional, what were your steps to success?

The things I want to do, but don't know how those who took the pathway would recommend completing: 

\- gain a programming certificate / minor in computer science and load up on classes for next few semesters?

\- create and follow through with this options trading startup and form it into a business if successful OR do I look for an internship to start next spring that will leave into an institutional job for the next few years to gain experience? Or just spend all my time teaching myself and become as successful of a retail trader as I can be?

\- look for a trading mentor that would help me become the successful retail trader?

\- take an advanced online course solely on the topic of options?

\- get my MBA right after graduation regarding investment management or find a trading / business management / programming MBA program?

Sorry for the long post. I just have a passion for options and want more than anything to succeed and am wondering the next steps. There are lots of pathways I could take and would love any feedback from those who have succeeded in making it the whole way out there. I am very willing to spend as much time as possible within the upcoming years to try and at least be able to make consistent gains from trading alone in addition to a side job that will keep me afloat otherwise, just mainly wondering if I need to go institutional to truly be able to make those gains or can I eventually teach myself."

Over the summer, I was fairly happy and so excited to be able to spend a semester abroad in Europe. However, ever since going abroad, I feel like everything has only been going wrong, especially within the past few weeks. I see friends and acquaintances receiving job and internship opportunities left and right, and in the meantime the only response to any job application I got was a flat-out rejection. After recently dealing with a pretty bad heartbreak and dealing with toxic situations, I've really wanted to find a cute partner abroad and put myself out there in the dating scope, only to be met with more heartbreak. While I've casually dated a few people, things only ended up fading out due to traveling or getting left on read- I got left on read by a date I went on last week, and just got left on read an hour ago by a guy I've been talking to for a few months and have been making plans with for this coming weekend, and don't know how much more rejection I can take before I give up altogether. I'm also spending my Thanksgiving break all alone. All of my apartment mates and friends are going to see other family and friends, and meanwhile I don't even have the money to see my best friend abroad and my parents refuse to visit me. I've gone completely broke from traveling so much- I spent almost the entirety of last month in different countries in Europe, and it completely depleted my bank account to the point where even if I WANTED a social life, I no longer have the money for it. I've slacked on working out, partly due to depression and partly due to inability to afford a gym membership anymore, and find myself gaining weight. I found out that there's no room for me to live in my sorority's housing next semester, and I'm scrambling to find housing arrangements back on campus to no avail. I found out recently that my dad has cataracts as well, which he needs surgery for. These past two weeks, everything in my life has gone completely wrong. I'm supposed to be having the time of my life abroad, yet I'm crying to sleep nearly every night these past 2 weeks and just want to sleep forever and not wake up. Music and alcohol are the only things helping me get by lately. After going through so much struggles at university, I wanted my time abroad to be different so badly. I guess nothing will ever work out for me, I'm so close to just giving up. Reddit, I'm sorry I keep on using this as a platform to rant. I'll delete this soon."
9v47pg,39,2018-11-07,"[Well-Being] [Vent] After seeing my final grades, I am convinced I am a true impostor and am not good enough for medical school.",nerdynamya,medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/9v47pg/wellbeing_vent_after_seeing_my_final_grades_i_am/,"I'm currently a 5th year medical student (European system). In a few months, I will be transferred to hospitals to start our internships and clinical stage of our education. So, it's safe to say I'm at a critical juncture in my medical education.

My 4th year was incredibly rough on me, academically speaking. I performed absolutely horribly in almost all my exams. My total average was 12.86/20, the passing average was 12/20. In terms of rankings, I was in the bottom 20 for that year. This is a sharp drop in my performance. My total average for the 3rd year was a 15/20, which though nothing particularly spectacular, was still considered a fairly good average. 

Admittedly, I was dealing with a tonne of anxiety and some family and money issues. In addition, my psychiatrist is highly suspicious that I may be showing signs of adult-onset ADHD and wants to put me on Strattera (PMS-Atomoxetine). 

&amp;#x200B;

However, I still feel that I am a complete and utter failure. I mean, sure I had problems that were affecting my studying, but so does everyone else. No one lives a perfect life. And, if I look at the bigger picture, it's not like my problems are that big or severe anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

I understand that these exams are not necessarily indicative of my performance in a clinical setting, but it's still a black mark on my record. For example, how am I supposed to be taken seriously during my surgery rotation if my score in the general surgery exam was a 50% (the passing grade is 40%), and my urology score was 55% and my vascular surgery score was 45%? I know that I technically passed these tests, but still these grades are horrendous and I only passed them by a razor thin margin. How am I supposed to talk to attendings and build up the courage to ask for an LOR? I assume the first thing they would do would be to look at my grades and write me off. So, this is a black mark on me and will severely hamper my future prospects and make my life so much more difficult for the future.

I guess it's human nature to want to find a reason for their shortcomings instead of just accepting the blame and stop deflecting. I honestly want to improve. I was not such a poor performer. When I started studying medicine, I actually had potential and was considered a competitive student. However, 4th year has changed all that. I have objective proof that I am the worst, the I am not fit to be a physician. At this point, the only reason that I feel I'm still going is because of the sunken cost fallacy. I'm almost 23 years old with no marketable skills because I've been studying medicine for the past four years and my parents are nearing retirement age and I need to start gaining some financial independence. I can't just throw away four years of my life and start something new. It wouldn't be fair to me or to my parents. In the end, I was the one that wanted to do medicine.

&amp;#x200B;

I do plan on doing Steps so I can apply to residency programs outside my university, and at this point I'm sincerely hoping that good Step 1 and 2 scores would be my saving grace and help put me back on the right track. But, that is also a pipedream, because the odds are against me (as much as we like to think that Step scores aren't correlated with in house exams, there is a positive correlation between them). So, I guess I'm screwed either way. 

&amp;#x200B;

I really want this to be a new year with a new beginning and to not allow myself to be haunted by my past. However, I can't also go on like somehow everything is fine and dandy. I feel like I'm lost. Medicine is a difficult field, but I feel everyone else seems to be reasonably able to handle it (as proven by their much better grades), while I am spinning out of control and headed for a crash. I don't want to enter a cycle of negativity and self-doubt, because this will cause me even more anxiety, which will make studying and memorizing even more difficult than it already is and then I end up doing horribly again. I really want this to be a fresh start, but I can't shake the feeling that I no longer belong, that I am a lost cause, a poor investment.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for taking the time to allow me to vent. This sub can be therapeutic to me."

9v4fi4,3,2018-11-07,"Dealing with a controlling friend and not sure what to do. Want to hear other people's thoughts, opinions, how I should go about this.",Arsenalfan94,FriendshipAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/9v4fi4/dealing_with_a_controlling_friend_and_not_sure/,"So, I am writing this because I would like to hear some outside opinions on this. I have a good friend of mine, (let's call him Jake), I have been hanging out with for about 2 and a half close to 3 years. One issue I have with him is that he acts controlling and aggressive. At first, I brushed it off and thought nothing of it. I have gone on road trips with this dude, we're both close with each other, but there have been some friction going on recently. 

I have noticed that he has been pushing and disrespecting my boundaries and tries to make me act like him and do what he wants instead of what I want to do. For example, when he was doing his internship about a year ago, I never called him to hang out when I knew he had to be up early at 5:30 to get to his internship. Yet, when I have to go to work or have class at 8 or 9 in the morning, he will call me at 12 or 1 AM saying ""You're acting like a pussy. you're a boring person, so what? It's just a part time job and it's just a stupid class. You always think about yourself. Life isn't what about you want it;s about what other people want"".

  Jake tries to toughen me up and make me act and think like him even though I have already told him I want to be like myself and that I don't want to act like him. Another time, I told him I was going to a movie with a friend of mine to a movie, he got mad and invited me to go to an outdoor park, (Starved Rock) with him. Since, I was not standing up for myself at the time I caved in and went with him and I secretly felt bad about it. Since that time I began re evaluating my friendship with him. Last weekend, we were going to plan a trip to Detroit. On Wednesday night he texted me saying he was not going to go. Naturally, I went and scheduled plans to get some important documents turned into school before the deadline for that weekend. The next day, on Thursday, he calls me after I get out of work saying he is ready to go to Detroit. I was taken aback and told him I couldn't go. He ended up yelling at me through the phone and telling me that I was acting weird because I was listening to my parents and that I should be acting more like him and that the only reason why he hangs out with me is that he feels bad for me and that he wants to ""fix"" me.

On, Saturday night i hung out with Jake to try to talk to him about all of this, and he started acting cold towards me and saying that I should be acting more like him, (again), and that I should toughen up and be more like him. I told him I am introverted and that sometimes I just don't feel like going out all of the time and that I am naturally a quiet and shy person. He ignored this. 

This has been on my mind a lot recently. Jake called me twice about a day ago at 1 in the morning and I ignored it and went to sleep. Then I get a message from him later that day saying that he needs some time alone and that I am a good kid. I responded with ""I understand"" and that was it. I have not spoken to him since. There are other examples I could mention but I already have a whole wall of text I don't want to make this anymore longer than it is.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: I have a friend of mine that I have been close with the past few years but I have begun to notice that he acts controlling and aggressive towards me and pushes my boundaries.  I am considering either hanging out with him a lot less or just cutting him off if he doesn't change. I would just like to hear other people's thoughts and opinions on how I should go about this."

I am looking for advice from those who have worked in a corporate graphic design environment. I am a recent college grad and have just been hired for a position as a graphic designer at marketing agency. The thing is, I will be their first in house graphic designer because they previously used freelance contractors for their design needs. 

I am so excited to begin work and definitely feel like I’m qualified for the role, however, I am struggling with being able to switch from a “student” role to a “teacher” role. I have had two design internships, but at each internship, there was another designer working above me who gave me guidance on how to integrate into the role and how the dynamic between the design department and the rest of the company functioned. I took on more of a student role because I was being taught how to do things. At my new company, I will basically be creating these standards as this is a new position they hadn’t offered before. 

My question is, how do I know that I am making the best decisions when it comes to my designs if I am the only designer? And how can I change my mentality to be more sure of myself when making design decisions?

Also, lets say for example I am asked to create a website but I don’t already know the best platform to use or the 100% correct way to do it. Should I just rely on googling heavily and hope it works out? Or is there an online forum or website that teaches about industry standards in graphic design?

Thanks so much everyone. Hope this wasn’t too lengthy. I just want to make sure I am fully prepared for this new exciting chapter in my life.

However, it looks like my GPA will drop significantly after this semester since I'm not doing too well in Cost Accounting and Intermediate II. It looks like I could pull off a B-/B in Cost and a C/C+ in Intermediate, which would pull my GPA down to 3.5/3.4. I took a hit to the grades because of recruiting season at the beginning of the semester and I've had to deal with some personal issues as well, but I admit I could have came up with better studying techniques and spent more time studying as well. Is it likely that EY will rescind my internship offer due to my new grades? If so, what can I do besides study more to keep my offer?"

# District Choice Voting

Instead of having geographic districts (""Nanaimo"", ""Vancouver Quadra"", etc.), we have numbered districts. Every voter, regardless of where they live, gets to choose which numbered district to vote in: you can go to the polls and say ""Give me a ballot for district 74"", and they'll give you one. But you only get one ballot, so choose wisely.

Advantages:

* Groups of committed citizens can make a big splash electorally, even if they aren't concentrated geographically. (For example, maybe a group of people want to try and win district 29 for the All Drugs Should Be Legal Party. If there are enough of them, they have a fighting chance, even if they all live in different places.)
* Individual voters will have tons and tons of choice, and absolute freedom to pick the candidate they think best.
* Parties can't get cocky. This system is completely impossible to poll or predict: their only option is to fight every seat to the wire. No safe seats. No layups. And, conversely, no seats where your party is so far behind that you might as well just run an intern: you always need to put in an effort.
* While this system may sound like it advantages areas of large population, consider that, because smaller groups can decide that they want to try and ""lock in"" a specific district, rural and isolated places can actually punch above their weight -- if they coordinate and organise their vote properly. Indeed, it's very likely that larger population centres will lean heavily into specific seats as well, wasting their votes!

# Fractional Voting

Every voter gets 1 vote, but they can split it into pieces as small as 0.1 vote, and assign votes accordingly: a given voter might vote 1.0 for the Liberal candidate, or 0.5 for the Green and 0.5 for the NDP candidates, or 0.7 for the Liberal and 0.1 each for three Independents. If you have 10 or fewer candidates on the ballot, you can even choose to vote for all of them!

Advantages:

* Parties will be encouraged to be nicer to each other, because winning 0.3 of someone's vote is better than winning 0.0.
* Indeed, you get the best of both worlds: PR has incentives for parties to be nice to each other, but also undermines the election of majority governments; FPTP has no incentives for people to get along, but elects stable majorities; Fractional Voting gives you incentives to be nice while still allowing plenty of outright majorities.
* Small parties and independents will be buoyed.
* You can simultaneously make a ""heart vote"" and a ""smart vote"". (Feel like you *want* to vote Green, but feel you *have* to vote NDP to block the Liberals? Don't hold your nose: vote for both!) This also means that voters who may be holding their nose on their way to the polls can split their ticket and more clearly show their feelings.

# Partial Representative Elections

Elections are conducted on a FPTP map, with one exception: everybody wins!

More specifically, every candidate who gets at least 10% of the vote in a given riding is deemed elected, and is assigned ""points"" in proportion to their share of the vote among those candidates who passed the cut-off. A candidate who got 80% would be worth 80 ""points"", while a candidate who got 15% would be worth 15, and so on.

Within the legislature, every legislator's voting power would be equal to their number of points. This may mean that some legislators have several times more power than others -- and this a feature, not a bug.

Advantages:

* The perfect fusion of FPTP and PR: proportional representation on an FPTP map!
* Local candidates need to get along, because they'll all be sharing a seat once they get to Victoria.
* Vote your conscience every single time. There's no good reason not to: your vote will never allow the ""wrong party"" to win.
* If your community speaks with one voice, you get one strong MLA; if your community speaks with many diverse voices, you'll each get a slice of the action.
* Elections themselves would become far less competitive and far more collaborative: candidates aren't being made to fight for their lives, so they'll be less invested in the cutthroat side of politics and more invested in other priorities: constituent services, policy discussions, etc."

9v607n,14,2018-11-07,"I want to quit my job in STEM...I am only female engineering on my floor, 10th female in the enitre department. Help.",Qanalysis,Feminism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/9v607n/i_want_to_quit_my_job_in_stemi_am_only_female/,"I am an engineer in a civilian job. In just 6 months, I have faced more sexism and horrible situations than I can even believe. My problem is I don't shut up, or stay quite. If you are mansplaining me, I will tell you. If you are being sexist, I will call you out. If you are being a bigot or homophobic, I will speak out. But I'm alone. The comments and men's rights type are coming out in full force ever since 2016. The need to protect men is an attitude shared with the sea of white men at my place of employment.


I have already been transferred from a troubleshooting department to analytics. I now have a guy now threatened to file an complaint against me for being sexist beause I told him he was mansplaining me in a subject I taught at a local University for 3 years, which he had never studied. He was the classic textbook definition of patronizing, condescending talking down-to... to the point he said "" you do know what a capacitor is, right?""...I studied materials for caps for my thesis...I was so offended and insulted. ..., to which he told me in private he would win the complaint against me because people like him and will side with him. He also told me he was going to be our new groups boss when he retires, and it should be obvious to me. He also threatened me if I ...""ever used that word again or any other ""woman power"" word again, there was going to be some problems for you, got it?!"". My bosses are not doing anything, even though they don't think mansplaining is a bad term/sexist/offensive term. 

I want to give up. I'm emotionally tired and drained from years of this crap. I have faced so much of this in school, internships, social situations and even my marriage. I just feel like giving up and have no idea what to do."
9v622n,3,2018-11-07,26 [f4f] New intelligence agent signing up for more than she bargained for,chattycathy92,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/9v622n/26_f4f_new_intelligence_agent_signing_up_for_more/,"Had good success with guys, curious how a woman would play this...
____

I had spent years chasing my dream. Ever since I was a little girl, the intelligence community appealed to me as a future career. The intrigue and excitement I had seen in the movies as a child had always captivated me. The real world was not as fun, however. I had just completed what seemed like an endless amount of studies. A double major in macroeconomics and political science. I had gotten perfect grades at the cost of graduating a virgin. Receiving a masters in international business with a thesis on organized crime in the US. (I even defended it in Russian that I had learned on the side.) Internships with law enforcement every summer and a sterling record with each, every cop begging to write my recommendations letters to apply to the CIA. Maybe it was to try to butter me up so I might let them fuck me in the back of their cop car, but I didn't care.

I had been called back for the first round of interviews and could hardly sleep. Just because I was incredibly educated and a virgin didn't mean I hadn't learned how the world works. A nice pair of ass and tits walking through the door with my resume would never be turned down. This wasn't the time to play it safe. My interview outfit was a pencil skirt that seemed to threaten to rip it was so tight on my ass and ending just halfway down my thighs. Both nicely toned from the years I spent preparing for the physical requirements of the job. When I bought the blouse I wore, I knew exactly when I would wear it. In the most professional tone, it screamed, ""these perky tits are way bigger than my slender frame would suggest.""

I about screamed when I got the call that I had gotten accepted into a field office in Chicago. I showed up 30 minutes early to my first day and my excitement quickly wore off. My dreams of undercover roles and stakeouts were buried under the mountain of paperwork I was to file. They said it took years of this before I'd even be considered for anything more. This was not what I signed up for.

One Tuesday, 6 weeks in to the job, as I was taking the senior agents their coffee during a briefing, I heard them discussing a new covert operation. It was dangerous, exciting, and would require a female agent to act as a hussy to a local coke running group for as long as it took to get the information. (Please include the work ""pink"" in your message so I know you read this) They suggested it might be a couple of days of solo work, mostly just hanging around trying to overhear something good. However, the 2 female agents balked at the idea of being involved with one of the most dangerous groups in the country. I didn't even remember speaking up, just the looks I was given after I did, the male officers looking at each other and then back at me (well my body at least) and nodding. ""You've got the job...err...what was your name again?""

""Agent Allison, sir.""
____

So, the premise is that I am sent undercover to dig up dirt on a crime lord. The mission should be fairly safe and innocuous sounding in the prep. It's supposed to be a short-term in and out, but when the crime lord won't give up the information and start pushing me, I have no choice but to drop to their level of incivility.

I think ideally we could start as the senior agents ""prep"" me for my role (in a realistic way though), then move to the crime lord. I would ask you play both.

I would ask that this try and stay in the realm of realistic, no threesomes on a desk with two agents in the middle of the day. However they might help me dress up to find the right look for my role, etc. With the crime boss, I am desperate to keep things professional but my safety is put in jeopardy if I don't learn to bend the rules.

The main kink for this is the idea that I am ""forced"" to do things for my dream job that I don't want to, but have only myself to blame."

Hey everybody,

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently in college and shall be taking courses on C# (in which I have done some minor stuff on Linux via Mono). Between C, C++, Java, Python, JavaScript and PHP, in which I have either worked during internships or for school projects, it's currently my favourite language and I am actually considering using it professionally.

For these reasons, I've come to accept that for the next few years, I will have to accustom myself to the Windows environment. I know, one can argue that with ASP.NET Core, working in C# on Linux became more of a viable option, but I think the hard majority of C# jobs are completely Windows-centric. 

I am not a Linux power user by any means, but I do use (and enjoy using) the terminal for a huge amount of things, as I am somewhat well-versed (thanks to my great university) in Bash and tools like grep, sed and awk. Therefore, I've been looking into options on how to retain the ""power"" of the terminal in a Windows environment.

I found out about WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) and thought it sounded REALLY nice, basically exactly what I need. However, I have so much on my plate these days in school that I simply don't have the time to tinker with it that much. 

Therefore, I would really really appreciate it if someone could enlighten me on WSL and how good it really is, you know, how it compares to the real thing. Or maybe I am wrong about having to use Windows as a C# dev these days?  Thanks in advance!

However recently I have been troubled with two cases of ""weird invitations"" and would like some advice. 

The first case is from a friend of mine from another country who I last spoke to around a year ago. The conversation went something like this:

Him: Hey will you be free from ___ to ___? I'm planning to drop by (my area) and perhaps we could meet up?

Me: Yes I am free during that time, when are you coming?

Him: -silence-

And the second case, while similar, is even weirder to me because it is from my supervisor during my overseas internship who I last spoke to around 6 months ago (I'm fine with meeting people of the 'same level', but with supervisors it makes me even more anxious)

Him: Hello ____, how are you? Mr. ___(head of the company) and I will be in (my place) from ___ to ___ It would be nice if we could have a meeting over dinner.

Me: Hello ___, I am doing well, how are you? I am free during that period and would love to meet over dinner and you and Mr. _____. May I know if you are coming for business or leisure, so that I could decide on a suitable place to meet?

Him:  -silence-

In both cases I replied them on the same day of them messaging me, and have not heard a reply in two weeks.

What is going on? What should I do now? Maybe they could tell that I was just being polite when agreeing to meet and was turned off by it? Why do people even bother about sending such invitation and disrupt my schedule if they can't be bothered to follow up?!

9v6upp,1,2018-11-07,unbelievable,epsilon4_,copypasta,https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/9v6upp/unbelievable/,"Unbelievable. Being a woman in this position is scary enough. Intimidated is an understatement. Jim Acosta, senior reporter for CNN, a man who is known nationwide and is a household name to those well-versed in politics, uses his masculinity and power to physically subdue an intern who is simply doing her job. An indelible moment for anyone, to say the least, but for this brave young woman it could be a traumatic turning point in her bright young career. We need to allow her to tell her truth, and we need to foster an environment where she feels comfortable sharing it with those of us who are accepting enough to listen. I want a full investigation and I hope real Americans will stand with me. We need to protect our women. The time to do the right thing is now. This could be your wife, your daughter. I am shaken but I know we can use this to have a real conversation and put our country and our men on the right path."
9v6w2j,2,2018-11-07,"[Venting] Things were going so well between her (24F) and (24M) before she left a month ago, but I'm going to fight for what we had",thatguyfromchicago,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/9v6w2j/venting_things_were_going_so_well_between_her_24f/,"So my girlfriend (or I guess ex girlfriend now I guess) and I were together for almost a full year up until last Wednesday morning. We spent 11 months together happily, only being apart for about two month for her post graduation vacation and some family issues I had. Everything was amazing, I was never happier than when I was with her. While we didn't live together, out of 14 nights she would spend 13 at my place.
 
Some background:

Her and I had an amazing relationship, having met 4 years ago, we were both seeing other people at the time. Last summer we bumped into each other and got to talking. It was too long before her and I began to hook up regularly, and two months later began an official relationship. She originally didnt want a relationship, having left her ex 3 months prior to our bumping into each other, but over time she (and with much persisitance and stubbornness on my part), we got together.

In that time I fell so hard for her, and within a month and a half of actually dating, I told her I loved her. She said it back, and we continued on happily for awhile. About a month after that, she packed up for a month long trip around Europe with a close friend of ours. She called me the day she was flying out and told me she wasn't sure she loved me, and was sorry for being dishonest. 


Now this was after we hadn't see each other for awhile, as I had just spent three weeks taking care of family buisness as home, and we only had about 4 days (out of a month)  together before she left. So, while she was in Europe, we took a step back. Not a break, but I wasn't as open about my feelings toward her. Upon returning, we picked right back up where we left off. Within a week, she told me she was in love with me, and she was 100% sure. 

We went on like this for months, which were the happiest months of my life. In early August, she found out about an 8 month internship in Africa, and was accepted by the end of the month. We found out she was leaving September 24th at the end of August. Naturally, we both had some reservations about how we were going to proceed. I told her over lunch that I wanted to marry her, no matter the wait. She told me that she loved me with all her heart, and was willing to try long distance. 

For the next few weeks we were inseparable, and had so much fun. The day I took her to the airport was one of the hardest days of my life, and I cried quite a bit. After she settled in, we began to communicate very frequently, 2 or so video chats a week, with constant text communications. Everything was going so well, when suddenly, after a month of long distance, she told me she wanted to take a break over facetime.

I took this very hard, and begged and pleaded for another result. She assured me I had done nothing wrong, and that this was something she thought would be best for us while she was working on taking her GRE and doing her internship. Still, I begged to stay with her. She said what was happening wasn't fair to me, and that she couldn't give me everything that I was giving her. 

The break turned into a break up, with her telling me (through tears and an inability to maintain eye contact) that things changed when she moved, and she saw me as more of a best friend. This hit me completely out of the blue, as she was constantly saying I love you first, and we were maintaining as much affection as possible. I still love her and she told me that she still loves me and always will.

The past week has been incredibly hard (I assume for both of us). We've still been communicating, bits and piece of friendly conversation here and there. On Friday, the day before I one year anniversary, I sent her a long message, which I originally intended as my goodbye message. By the end of the message, I had realized that she was worth fighting for, and I couldn't just let things end like this.

She told me that she knew I couldn't just give up, but for now I had to, and that she needed space so we can both . So I agreed, although bits and piece of communication has still been happening (mostly on my part). I still firmly believe I'm going to marry her, and that she is the person for me. I think the stress of the LDR has been wearing on us, and I'm not willing to push it.

So for now, I wait. I'll working on myself. I'll be somebody that I wouldn't want to be with, and in 7 months when she comes back I'm going to do everything I can to win her back. A friend of mine told me that almost the exact same thing happened to him word for word, and now he and the girl are happily married. I still believe that's the future we have, and I'm going to do everything I can to make it a reality.

Edits:

I don't believe this was something she was planning. We had already planned out a vacation for us when she returned,  and I had been continually sending her money to help support her between paychecks. She isn't the type to take the money and just take advantage of me. I believe this was caused by stress brought on by the internship as well as the upcoming GRE. I may be biased, but I honestly believe this."

I am not sure if this is an okay place to post this, but from what I saw, the weekly thread is just for android programming related questions.

I am currently a CS senior graduating next semester, and very eager to become an Android developer so I am trying to find an entry-level/new grad Android developer position somewhere in the US. I have no internship experience, but I do have experience from attending hackathons and I also recently found a good gig where I work part-time as an Android Developer and as an IT support as needed, but I am trying to find a full-time developer job after graduating in May.

My college GPA is not on the good side, it's just 2.9 and I've tried applying with and without it but still, I am not receiving any responses back. Should I leave it off completely and never put it on unless I get 3.0? I would like any feedback regarding my resume and how I could possibly improve.

Thanks!

I know the title may suggest you a somewhat complicated problem, but it isn't...I hope. I just feel like I need to make the final decison about my future but I'm very confused/anxious about it. So I've created this account just to share this with you. I'm open to any advice! And thank you for reading this :)

Anyways, I'm a 19 y/o college student in a Middle Eastern country. Growing up, I developed an over-competitive personality due to being the only daughter of two academically successful professors. Of course, I'm not blaming neither my parents nor my upbringing. I just...I've always felt like I should be at least as successful as them so I won't feel like shit ...I know it's a bit selfish to think like this. But this is me :/ Because of this, I was obsessed with my grades and ""academical excellence"". I would cry for at least 3 days if I don't get an A and you know, typically whiny nerd girl stuff :D In the end, I graduated middle school in 2nd place.

During high school though, I started to fall apart. I definitely didn't know what to pursue as a career or even which university should I get into. That's when my grades went down and I became very depressed... I felt very empty and aimless. I've just watched 4 years of my teen years waste for nothing...

I somehow managed to get into a good university (of course, by paying a huge amount of tutution) in my country. Relatively good, I mean, but not for me...( I know I started to sound like a spoiled brat, but please bear with me :) ) I definitely like my major and my grades are going pretty well (I've even got a scholarship which made me so happy!). But because of that, the over-competitive personality of mine started to creep in...I started to ask myself: ""What I'm going to do after college?"" ""I need X GPA to pursue this..."" ""Should I have participated in more club activities?"" ""Why I'm not a social butterfly?"" The question got to a point where they're on my mind just to torture me.

Is it really bad that I think about my future a lot? When I talk about stuff like this to the people around me, everyone thinks I should just focus on making more friends (I have no problem that but I'm quite shy ,so I can't go to someone and ask them to be friends. I've just let it happen...naturally) or be a club president (I'm a terrible leader, trust me). I definitely believe I don't feel bothered to make social connections so that's why I don't think this is the problem. Some suggests that I'm just homesick which is impossible, I've been away from home for the past two years.

The problem is that (I believe), I'm very unsatisfied with my current university. When I chose this university, I had a completely empty mind. No idea about anything regarding my future career. And I fully believed that if I chose this university, I would find my way with ""the help of the guidance provided by them"". (This is their own words of advertisement btw.) It's been two years and I've pretty much decided what to do after university: Where to obtain my master's degree, where to apply for internship etc. And all these decisions were done by myself with no help from the school. I've decided on everything purely based on my research. The guidence counselor here is a joke. She was supposed to answer my career related questions instead of making me fill a 6-page-long-psychological analysis test. And the professors only tell you nothing but which classes I should get.

I also don't have the mindset of the students here: I have a few friends but I still get to meet people through them or lectures/radio club etc. So far I've not encountered with someone who thinks like me. Not even a little. Which makes me even more lonely. Maybe it's because of me...Maybe I should change that. But it's really hard. I tried, believe me.

That's why I'm planning to change my school to somewhere outside my country. I've been practing one of my secondary language for a while and I'm hoping it will help me get out of this..misery. I hope I will be happy. God, I just want to be happy and satisfied with how things go for once. I know there is no way to be sure of it, but you'll never know before you try, right? :)

Anyway guys, thanks for listening to me and my probably stupid problem and I wish you a nice evening (or morning)! :)

I understand I need a proof of assets at the border, will my Canadian Bank account work for that? It has significantly more than the amount required. 

Furthermore, would it be worth finding a local credit union, or would just going through big bank X be better? For some context: 

* My internship is 4 months, so I won't be in the area for an extended period of time
* I'll be returning to Canada after, so I want a good way to exchange the money (I was told xe.com was good, but I have no information about it)
* I'll probably make no more than 30K USD over my internship, so I'm not likely to have a large pile of money BUT
* I very likely will need to move ~10K USD back over the border to pay tuition at some point
* Big Bank X has a branch near where I work

I'm not sure what other options I need to consider, but I think these are the prime factors. I hear credit unions are better over reddit for citizens, but how should I really approach this situation?

Furthermore (Canadian Side), a portion of my income will be housing stipends, which I hear aren't exactly taxed in the US (??), when I bring it over to Canada, would it be taxed as a housing stipend or could I declare it as standard income? 

Thanks in advance!

PS: Do debit/credit cards work in the same general way? Can I use a Canadian CC in the states?

Next thing you know I’m signing an non disclosure agreement to build a data scraper for retail stores and do data analysis on stock management. He told me he won’t be able to pay me anything as of yet but would do so once he gets funding. I loved the idea and believed it would work well so I did not question anything.  

Jump to May 2018, I have built his core data scrapper that saves files locally as well as uploads them to AWS. Now he asked for a cross platform desktop application that turns on on startup and runs in the background. I told him this is a lot of work and i cannot continue to work without pay. He told me he has “people” ready to purchase it as soon as i get it done. I put even more effort into it. Then he mentioned that he also has someone else building the same desktop app in C# as a back up. I was confident in my work and didn’t even bother about that. 

August 2018: 
My desktop app is ready ! Sure, a few minor bugs here and there that I fixed all along but nothing major. He said he will test it and let me know how it goes. 
Didnt hear from him for a month. 
October 2018: he sends me an email out of nowhere with a screenshot of the error. This dumb fuck entered the wrong value in the date field and was blaming me for the app not working. Sure, i added a check to it( like i already had for all other variables). He calls me for a meeting to discuss the idea of me working for the startup as an intern, and I question that twice because I have my own work to do. But then again it was one way to get paid for it and we were talking about at least $3000 of payment for the work that i had already done. So i agree to it. He said he would get back to me but i dont hear from him for a month. 

Jump to last week : 
He calls me for a meeting. It’s been a month, he hasn’t replied to my messages or emails. I ask him where’s my compensation and he said there is none because the app doesnt work. My blood starts to rage and i lose it. In the middle of the library I went on a rant to give him the worst shit of his life. I asked him one last time if he is going to pay me or not and he said he cannot, his hands are tied. I didnt even think twice and I left. 

Sitting in my room I thought about how I couldn’t let it all go. So, I sent him a message apologizing to him and said I will get it all patched up in 48 hours. He agrees. 

Guess what? I added an hidden feature that gets data from my aws storage (personal) checks for true or false and encrypts all his data on the laptop and shows a message ,” Go fuck yourself”. 


TLDR; my professor promised compensation for a project. He didnt pay so encrypted ~~his machine~~ my application and data  and only I have the password for it 


Edit: no im not doing it for ransom that would be ridiculous. Neither am I doing it to blackmail him. I simply encrypted all the data that was scraped using the app and the app itself. Im not the devil who is willing to go such lengths to perform  criminal actions 

Edit 2: I am as eagerly waiting as all of you. I would give him a day or two before I expect any dramatic response from him.  I do not have access to his machine anymore(he turned off teamviewer). Also, thank you for all of your support I know i can do better but it does hurt when someone tells you all your effort is worth nothing. My whole revenge is for an apology and to be appreciated for the work I did ! And I think thats fair. 

Edit 3: I am as impatient as all of you are. I apologize for not replying to all the comments about updates because I don’t have any. He hasn’t replied, and I haven’t tried to bug him too much. I would’ve updated you all sooner but I’ve really been stressed lately trying to figure out the whole money problem this whole situation has caused for me. It’s not easy when a few months of rent just decides to disappear. Hope you guys understand! I promise you will be the first one to find out about his reaction/apology/firing from school/or whatever it maybe ! Thank you for being patient and supportive !! "
9vbkbz,2,2018-11-08,Constructively disclosing Autism to future employer,TheD3xus,autism,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/9vbkbz/constructively_disclosing_autism_to_future/,"Background without personal information: I'm a soon-to-be college graduate going out into the real world (scary, right?) entering the tech industry in the USA. I have already received and accepted a job offer with a large company. I won't be starting for a few months, but one thing on my mind is how, or even if, I should disclose my having autism to my employer.

It didn't come up during any of my interviews, it never came up during the negotiation process, and it's never come up at all. I've had negative experiences with not disclosing autism in internships, either very late into the actual internship or not at all. I want to meaningfully disclose my autism, rather than it feeling like a burden.

I was diagnosed with Asperger's (not sure if that diagnosis still applies, not even going to get into those politics). I've overcome a lot of the issues that have historically held me back (eye contact, meeting new people, acting independently, are not problems anymore). I still have trouble speaking clearly (I can speak pretty fast), my mind can sometimes move really really fast (faster than my mouth), and I'm somewhat afraid to do things if I feel like I'm going to step on someone's toes or irritate them. I also struggle with clearly communicating ideas without needing to take some time to process information before communicating my response. 

How can I meaningfully communicate these issues, in the scope of autism, to my future employer? My current idea is to frame it with respect to the issues mentioned above. I don't believe that I would need significant changes or alterations to my work environment to succeed. But I would want my future manager to be cognizant of these struggles I have, so they can help me improve in these areas, and give me room to grow.

#National Development Project

##First Phase

###Section 1: Job Creation

&gt;Brazil now has 169 million people of working age. To generate employment and occupation in a sustainable way for this formidable mass of Brazilians, our country needs to adopt a planned strategy, a national plan debated by society as a whole, establishing social and economic priorities. Short, medium and long term goals that allow Brazil to achieve, in terms of income and human development, the same level of some European or Asian countries that have already left behind such problems as unemployment, poverty and poverty and offer opportunities and a good level of life for all its inhabitants. 

&gt;Brazil has the conditions, wealth and resources to do so. But this requires a plan, a path established between society and government, between workers, the private sector and the public sector, which clearly defines development policies focused on expanding the competitiveness of the productive sectors, especially the transformation and redoubled attention to the export sector, also considering the strength of our agribusiness and mining, which generate essential foreign exchange for the country's external accounts. We need to create jobs for millions of Brazilians and Brazilians. This is one of the most important goals of our program. To achieve these goals, the country needs to resume growth and a series of economic measures will be needed; all of them aim at increasing investments that will increase productive capacity, making possible the creation of the much needed new jobs.

##The following directives will be applied by government as a part of the Project;

**1.1)** The achievement of fiscal balance so that the government regains its capacity to invest and carry out social policies to improve the living conditions of the population. In other words, we will ensure the fiscal and social security sustainability of the State in all its spheres and promote the simplification of the tax system, raising the investment capacity of governments and enabling the provision of quality public services for the whole of society. We set the goal of achieving balance in the primary outcome in two years of government, and in order to achieve this balance, a series of reforms will be necessary:

**Tax, tributary and social security reform**

* Implementation of a capitalized multipillar social security system, in which the first pillar, financed by the Treasury, would be dedicated to assistance policies; the second pillar would correspond to a social security regime with parameters adjusted in relation to the current situation; and the third pillar would amount to a capitalization scheme in individual accounts. In addition, it would be discussed the introduction of minimum ages differentiated by activity and gender;

* Initial reduction of 15% of tax concessions;

* Review all government expenditures so as to eliminate waste, overlap and privilege; spending on investments, health and education should be preserved;

* Review all government expenditures so as to eliminate waste, overlap and privilege; spending on investments, health and education should be preserved;

* Exemption of taxes on the acquisition of capital goods;

* Reduction of Income Tax of the legal entity;

* Reduction of taxes on consumption (PIS / COFINS and ICMS);

* Creation of a Value Added Tax (VAT), unifying various taxes currently available;

* Gradual elimination of so-called pejotization;

* Reconstruction of income tax on profits and dividends;

* Alteration of ITCD rates (inheritance and gift tax);

* Simplification of the import tariff structure;

* Increase in the ITCD tax rate (inheritance and gift tax);

* Repeal of EC 95 (Expenditure Ceiling Amendment), to be replaced by another mechanism that controls the evolution of the overall expenses of the government, preserving, as stated above, spending on investments, Health and Education;

* Reduction of bureaucracy for opening, monitoring of tax operations and closure of companies.

**Budget reform**

* Greater integration between planning of government objectives, their goals, budget and a results-oriented management model;

* Introduction of the multi-annual budget for major priority projects;

* Creation of the priority projects unit, with monitoring and evaluation system;

* Schedule of disbursements associated with the evaluation of the execution of projects and results achieved;

* Creation of incentives for saving budgetary resources;

* Improvement of the bidding process;

* Greater transparency in budget classification and execution;

* Creation of monitoring system and apportionment of costs.

**Reform of public management**

* Implementation of a dynamic long-term planning process, with a 20-year horizon, in which every four years planning would be updated for the next two decades, serving as a basis for the preparation of multi-year plans;

* Redefinition of ministries according to the duties to be performed by the government;

* Improvement of integration among the various organizational structures with a view to magnifying the intersectorial and transversal effects of public policies;

* Carrying out workforce planning that aligns staffing needs to the strategic functions and objectives of government;

* Alignment of personnel policy with workforce planning results;

* Professional development of the server board and the structure of incentives based on the achievement of results;

* Creation of realistic incentive mechanisms and performance evaluation;

* Introduction of a meritocratic system for occupying positions in commission;

* Creation of instruments and parameters for the monitoring and evaluation of public policy;

* Implementation of a system of targets and monitoring of results associated to the budget;

* Improvement and strengthening of fiscal management mechanisms and cost control;

* Creation of mechanisms to identify innovative projects that can be disseminated in public administration;

* Integration and modernization of public Information and Communication Technology systems (TIC) and implementation of Big Data systems in the Federal Government;

* Improvement and expansion of so-called e-government, greatly increasing the provision of services, controls carried out electronically and the debureaucratization of work processes;

* Improvement of the federative agreement and of the public consortium rules for the execution of public policies;

* Stimulus to the provision of public services, which are not exclusive to non-state public organizations such as social organizations;

* Review of the regulatory agencies' performance;

* Improvement of the legal framework governing public administration,
including the purchasing process.

**1.2)** The reduction of the interest rate, to stimulate the resumption of investments
depriving the population and businesses, is essential. To achieve this objective, a monetary reform must be carried out accompanied by a set of measures that will reduce both the basic interest rate defined by the Central Bank and that charged to consumer and corporate financing:

* Commitment to the reduction of the basic interest rate (Selic) in line with the fiscal adjustment;

* Reduction of indexation in the financial market through the gradual replacement of Treasury bills, adjusted by the Selic, for fixed-rate bonds in debt financing;

* The gradual replacement of repurchase operations (overnight operations with ballast in public bonds with a repurchase commitment by the Central Bank) for remunerated voluntary deposits (which are not backed by government securities) with the Central Bank;

* Bank deregulation to enable the greater offer of financial services by small and medium-sized institutions and expand the banking network;

* Improvement of legislation in order to facilitate the operation of new financial businesses inside and outside the banking system, including regulation and encouragement of the development of financial institutions operating exclusively through the Internet, called Fintechs;

* Greater control of banking concentration by regulators; CADE's participation with the Central Bank in this process;

* Active participation of Banco do Brasil and Caixa Econômica Federal in the process of reducing bank spread, guaranteeing the necessary profitability of its operations.

**1.3)** The defense of a competitive exchange rate is essential, together with a series of other measures, to recover the capacity of Brazilian companies, producers of industrialized goods and sophisticated services, to compete in the foreign market. It is also fundamental to prevent importing companies from bringing artificially low prices in Brazilian reais that make it impossible for Brazilian companies to compete with them, resulting in the elimination of many jobs in the country:

* The exchange rate should fluctuate, with reduced volatility, around a competition for the domestic industry;

* The balanced fiscal policy and the reduction of the interest rate will be the determinants of this behavior of the exchange rate;

* Reconstruction of the sovereign fund, to prevent excessive exchange rate fluctuations due to commodity cycles, enable the implementation of countercyclical policies and the stability of important prices, such as oil, in the domestic market (always safeguarding the profitability of assets).

**1.4)** Maintaining inflation at low levels is fundamental for the
and this is another essential point of our program. We want to combine the lowest possible inflation with the goal of creating the necessary jobs for the Brazilian population. Therefore, the inflation targeting regime will be maintained, and the Central Bank will pursue the lowest possible rate of inflation associated with an unemployment rate that does not sacrifice the Brazilian population:

* The Central Bank will have two primary goals: the rate of inflation and the unemployment rate, as it is in the United States of America;

* Adoption of core measures of price indices as inflation target;

* Change of the convergence period from inflation to the target in case of inflationary shocks (instead of the calendar year, adopt a greater number of months);

* Disindexing relevant prices of the economy;

* Extension of the composition of the National Monetary Council;

* Dissemination of the transcription of the recordings of the Copom meetings after six months, aiming for greater transparency of the actions of the Central Bank.

**1.5)** Industrial policy, along with other instruments such as science and technology and credit policy, has always assisted in the development of sectors considered strategic, whether for the generation of innovations or jobs (or both), in both developed and developing countries. It should be designed in a complementary way to macroeconomic policy, not to compensate for imbalances, as it was in the recent past:

* Definition of four major priority complexes. The choice of these complexes is due to the following factors:

    * its impact on the trade balance, through the high participation of imported inputs in its production process;

    * its positive impact on the production of other sectors;

    * the possibility of better utilization, with added value, of our natural resources;

    * the generation of technology that could be disseminated to other sectors of the economy. They are agribusiness, defense, the oil, gas and biofuels sector and the production of goods to serve the health services.

* The fifth relevant sector, civil construction, a strong generator of jobs, will be stimulated by the policy oriented towards the recovery of infrastructure, including basic sanitation and housing;

* Policies to encourage innovation and sustainability financed by the BNDES and private banks, primarily aimed at increasing competitiveness and raising exports with greater technological content and diversification, and encouraging complementary investments in the production chain, especially in the integration of industry and modern services, so as to enable us to participate in the most relevant stages of global value chains;

* Definition of the BNDES as a major financial agent of the industrial policy strategy, together with FINEP and state innovation promotion agencies;

* Reinforcement of the policy of preference for local inputs in government procurement processes;

* Improvement of the local content policy, aiming at its simplification and, at the same time, its adoption as an effective instrument to stimulate the national producer;

* Link with science and technology policy through the creation of stimuli to the joint action of universities, companies and research institute in the development of products and technologies.

**1.6)** A policy of international insertion that promotes the productive sector, with a special focus on the high-tech manufacturing industry and for knowledge-intensive services, is fundamental to ensure that globalization generates quality jobs, rather than destroying the few remaining jobs in these sectors . To do so, there needs to be a strategy focused on the long term, with strong support for the exports of these products and services. Brazil is able to approach, in terms of income and human development, the European countries, as long as it clearly establishes policies focused on expanding the external competitiveness of the most technologically sophisticated productive sectors:

* Definition of clear growth targets for manufactured exports;

* Prioritization in the concession of credit, by the BNDES, to companies that fulfill export goals, innovation, increase of competitiveness and generation of jobs; practice of lower interest rates for those that innovate and preserve the environment;

* Development of mechanisms to facilitate the access of exporters to financing with costs compatible with those obtained by their external competitors;

* Improvement of infrastructure for production outflow;

* Rationalization of the import tariff structure;

* Establishment of trade agreements, preserving the interests of the country;

* Structuring of support to Brazilian companies in the prospection of markets and in customer service abroad.

**1.7)** All policies aimed at growth and job creation lack the resources to be made viable. A credit policy, which resumes the capacity to finance companies and the population at large, will be fundamental in our development strategy. A series of measures will be adopted to recover the volume of credit in the Brazilian economy. The reduction of interest rates and repurchase operations will lead the financial system to carry out loan operations and the volume of credit supply is expected to grow:

* Definition of a set of actions to help reduce the indebtedness of families and companies;

* Changes in the current policy of compulsory deposits on bank deposits;

* Stimulus to the dissemination of the positive register;

* Popularization of the market of funds backed by private titles;

* Encouraging the development of the capital market and long-term private financing, which will also contribute to the increase of national savings;

* Development of alternative credit mechanisms, such as venture capital;

* Definition of a tax structure that stimulates the granting of long-term credit;

* Resumption of the BNDES 'role in granting investment, research and innovation credit through the creation of new forms of fundraising;

* Reinforcement of the role of Caixa Econômica Federal (CEF) in the financing of social policies;

* Strengthening BB's role in granting credit to agriculture and working capital to small and medium-sized enterprises.

**1.8)** In addition, specific policies for the direct creation of jobs, complementary to all of these mentioned above, will be necessary, given the high unemployment of the Brazilian economy. In June 2018, this contingent reached 13 million people, almost double the number registered in 2014; so that in order to recover the employment of millions of Brazilians quickly and create jobs for other people entering the labor market, we will propose a set of emergency and other actions that will help promote the sustainable generation of jobs, giving priority to the vulnerable groups of the population, stimulating formalization in the labor market and professional training compatible with the demands of public and private organizations, also improving the policies of productive inclusion:

* Creation of an emergency employment program, with emphasis in the areas of sanitation and civil construction, in line with the policies to stimulate these areas, as proposed in these guidelines for the government program;

* Creation of training programs in the unemployment pockets of large cities, such as the support of Sistema S and federal educational institutions;

* Establishment of a policy of ""adoption, improvement and multiplication"" of existing ""informal"" day-care centers to enable mothers of infants to enter the labor market;

* Policies to provide cheap and cheap credit for retirement and expansion of housing for low-income families, which will improve their living conditions and simultaneously contribute to the re-establishment of the labor market in construction;

* Offering short-term courses aimed at Nem-Nems (young people aged 15-29 who neither study nor work; 23% of young people in this age group were in this situation in 2017). The policies in relation to this group will be more detailed later in these guidelines for the government program, but it is emphasized that one of its components will be the creation of training courses to facilitate their insertion in the job market;

* Review current labor laws to adapt them to new labor market trends, leverage entrepreneurship, encourage firms and workers to enter into longer employment contracts, stimulate productivity gains and reduce legal uncertainty;

* Improving monitoring and evaluation systems to determine training needs and to better target the expansion of vocational training programs, including in the direction of new jobs that will be demanded in the future, as well as the expansion of partnerships with the private sector to verify the areas that more need training, facilitating students' access to internships and work placements;

* Reform of services such as the National Employment System (SINE), improving its structure and its capacity for articulation with the productive sector.

**1.9)** No less relevant, the sectors of agribusiness, family agriculture, services in general, commerce, the creative economy and tourism will also be stimulated to contribute to the growth of the Brazilian economy and the generation of jobs. In the same way, special attention should be directed to entrepreneurs, innovators and small and medium-sized enterprises. These stimuli will be discussed throughout the campaign.

9vcyzt,12919,2018-11-08,I just want my coffee!,Rakenyul,IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/9vcyzt/i_just_want_my_coffee/,"Obligatory: This happened about 3 and half months ago.

I work as a management consultant at a firm where we travel to companies and businesses to improve their organization in certain areas. I won't get into the details of the work as it does not matter in this case.

I have been at the company (we'll call ABC for security) for about a week, meeting with the management team to gather information in order to start analyzing potential risk areas. Note the building that we are in has about a hundred plus employees, all for the same company. I have just finished an entire morning with my team and some of company ABC's managers/directors/VPs, I decided to take a short break to grab a coffee at the cafeteria downstairs. On my way to the elevator, a lady in her mid-40s (We'll call her CL, short for corporate lady, and M for me) called towards my direction, and it went like this.

CL: Hey, you, come here!

I completely ignored her as I didn’t think she was trying to get my attention, so I kept on walking towards the elevator. Now in my peripheral vision, I see the CL speed walking towards me and immediately got into my personal space in seconds.

CL: Hey junior, I’m talking to you! How dare you f---ing ignore me?!

Note that I am in my late 20s, but thanks to my Asian gene, I look like I’m 18 to 20. Which is probably why bouncers at bars always triple check my ID. My visitor pass is also clipped to my belt.

M: (thinking I misheard that she cussed at me) I’m sorry, what did you say?

CL: Are you as incompetent as you are deaf? Go to IT and let them know my computer is having issues with printing, and while you are at it, grab me some (forgot what supplies she wanted) from downstairs.

M: Sorry Miss, but I don’t work for you, I’m just trying to get a coffee.

CL: So f---ing what?? As an intern, you should be listening orders from all senior level people. Also, you shouldn’t be on coffee break when everybody else are working!!

M: Wait what? No, you don’t understand, I- (CL immediately cuts me off).

CL: Listen kid, you get that s--t done right now or I’m gonna report you to your manager for poor teamwork and ignoring helps of others.

M: First, you need to talk calmly and politely, then you need to understand that I don’t – (she cuts me off again)

CL: I’m the MANAGER, you are NOT! Now, I don’t want to hear your lazy ass excuses, just get it done ASAP, I have an important meeting in the afternoon.

She storms off right after.

I mean obviously I’m not going to do what she asked so I shrugged it off and got my warm caffeinated lover. Also I know one issue to bring up on why the company is losing young talents so quickly.

The afternoon meeting starts again and we are to meet with a new set of managers from other departments. Lo and behold, CL enters the room muttering something with a director or VP I can’t remember. She looked at me and immediately said

CL: Yeah, that’s the kid who didn’t get my s--t fixed, so I don’t have all the files ready. Why the hell is he here?

I guess the moment she said that, something clicked in her head and she realized I’m not with the company, but rather the people they pay a hefty bill rate for. I explained the situation briefly because I want to get the current day agenda out of the way, and said we can speak with HR after the meeting to clear up the issue. CL sat through the meeting without really saying a single word unless we ask her questions directly regarding her department.

I am certain that she got in a ton of trouble with HR and her supervisors as I didn’t see her for the remaining 3 weeks I was there. All of her department information were handled by a guy who supposedly reports to her.

Tldr: OP gets mistaken for an intern, yelled at, cussed at, by a manager at the company that hired OP’s team.

&amp;#x200B;

They’re in industrial construction in Michigan and I am wondering what I should potentially negotiate for as a starting salary. I’ve heard somewhere in the 60k range but I’m hoping to get a little more. I’m top 10% of my class and in the CM honor society and have had 3 summers interning at the same company. Do you think I could potentially get 70k? I know it’s at the top end of Project Engineer starting salaries but I’ve really been in that role for 3 summers already and think I have enough work experience to potentially get that salary.

Okay, so when the White House reports blatantly fake, altered ""news"" what does that make them?

A Fox News commentator horrified even other Fox journalists by taking the stage with Trump at a rally, just hours after saying he would do no such thing.

Then yesterday, the White House revoked the press credentials of Jim Acosta, a major journalist from CNN who wasn't afraid to ask Trump questions Trump didn't like.

To be clear, that is the action of a tyrant. **Period.** I believe it's unparalleled in US history even under Nixon.

Even worse, the White House later released video, apparently gotten from the disgraced site Infowars, that had been altered to make it look like Acosta struck an intern who was trying to take his microphone away from him. They tried to pass it off as legitmate, but of course smarter people on the Internet [were having none of it](https://www.vox.com/2018/11/8/18074966/sarah-sanders-infowars-cnn-jim-acosta-banned). 

In case it's not clear, Trump is lying. Sarah Sanders is lying. They are trying very hard to limit media access to the President and vocally casting the media as ""the enemy."" So much so that these very same media outlets had *pipe bombs* sent to them. 

This is about the point where I get fed up with every latter-day Saint who has one of those paintings of George Washington kneeling in the snow in their homes, who intones reverently about the inspired nature of the Constitution, and who then shrug and say essentially, ""at least he's not a Democrat"" when confronted with this sort of immoral, unconscionable action from our President and his cronies.

9vdrcm,2,2018-11-08,Young doctor in need of financial help!,drchazington,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/9vdrcm/young_doctor_in_need_of_financial_help/,"It seems like this is a recurring theme and I have read many of the posts, however I would really appreciate some advice specific to my situation. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am a 32 yo doctor, completing a residency in radiology (will be complete 7/2020) and have already matched into a 1 year fellowship in Musculoskeletal radiology (complete 7/2021). Afterwards, the place I am completing my fellowship has already said they would offer me a job. (obviously, nothing is official) My wife, is a 30 yo dentist who has been in practice for almost 4 years and recently bought a practice (\~6months ago).  

Ok, a little about our INCOME.  I earn a resident salary in California \~70K/yr, which is not that bad actually as far as residents salary go. As mentioned before my wife recently bought a practice , so her yearly income is currently changing. Her first year out of practice, she earned just under 100K, then it has slowly been rising and she will probably make \~170k. Ok, so combined 245k. After taxes I take home \~47k and she takes home \~83K, so combined \~130K/yr or \~10.5/mo. I know to many people, this sounds like a lot, even to me, but somehow we still practically live paycheck to paycheck and we are not even paying back our student loans fully yet.  We would like to buy a house and have kids sometime soon, so we want to come up with a plan of how to save more, reduce costs, and hopefully some other good ideas. 

And now the monthly EXPENSES:

We live in southern California, we do not own a house(2100$ Rent)

Lease 2 cars(\~900$ combined)

gas 200$ (we both have an hour commute each way)

wife's dental practice loan (1800$)

My student loan (100$ while a resident/fellow, will be much higher after graduate)

\-more info on my loans: I recently refinanced through SoFi @ \~5.2% loans were previously 6.8%. My plan was to utilize SoFi's 

My wife's student loan (900$, will be at least 2k starting 2019 given her increased income)

Gym memberships (75$ for both)

Cell phones (140$)

Medical expenses(surgery payment and prescriptions) 100$

Dental Association 150$

Cable/Hulu/Sling/CBS/internet- 165$ (I think i could reduce this to 105$)

Credit Card Debt Loan- 1200$ (This was mostly racked up during college and medical school. My mother paid off this debt before the interest rate raped us, and agreed to pay her back at a set rate. At the current rate of repayment we will be finished 8/2019, so like 9 more months)

Food-600$(combination of groceries (100/wk)and eating out(dinner dates)

Utilities- 100$

Ok these are the bulk of our expenses which, if I added correctly equals \~8400$/month. There are usually  miscellaneous expenses each month, that we try to reduce, but it is not uncommon to have expenses \~9k.  As above our income equals about 10.5k. I try to put 1-2k away in savings/mo and have done so for the past 4-5 months, but if any unexpected expenses come up, then savings gets scrapped. For making almost 250K combined income, you would think that we would have more for savings, but no. I have many friends that went into business and are earning 200-250K per year, however they have no or little student debt and have ben earning  for the past 5 or so years. I have to admit it is mildly depressing working so har over the past almost15 years in undergraduate school, medical school, internship and now residency to realize that its going to take another 15 years to dig myself out. Im hoping people have a few ideas. 

Lastly, the upcoming changes can be expected: My wife will likely continue to earn a little more each year and I will get a job mid year 2021, hopefully earning anywhere between 200-300k/yr (pretty conservative estimation).

Let me know what you guys think, if there is anything I forgot to include."

I need a place to live and I am not from here. I did intern in the city so I have a vague idea of what downtown is like, but nothing south of it. In a perfect world I'd probably just live in River Market, but my commute is actually going to be pretty far south, and the furthest north I can absolutely live is Crossroads. 

- I can comfortably afford up to $1250/mo

- I want to be around people my age who are also making pretty good money, or who are doing cool things with their lives. 

- I don't really like to waste money at bars/clubs, but like to waste it doing other pretentious or interesting things.

- Low crime would be nice

- The further south, the shorter my commute actually is. I interned in KC last summer, so I know even the worst traffic still isn't that bad. Still, a quicker commute still carries some weight, just not sure how much yet. 

I've searched through old posts and these were the stereotypes I pulled out:

Crossroads: Cool and hipstery. The most things to do on a weekend among the choices. On the uptrend. Expensive. 

Westport: Less cool, but still on the uptrend. Noticeably cheaper than Crossroads. 

Plaza: Cold and pretentious. People in their late 20s. Culturally boring and usually nothing going on.

Are these accurate AT ALL? I'd rather be proven wrong here.


edit: I also have a feeling this sub hates these posts, I know my home city does. So bear with me.

9vfkyz,28,2018-11-08,Having an identity crisis and unsure if exploiting the system.,biracialandconfused,mixedrace,https://www.reddit.com/r/mixedrace/comments/9vfkyz/having_an_identity_crisis_and_unsure_if/,"Hi everyone, I'm a 20-something year-old Computer Science major who is mixed (black and white). Up until recently, I've never thought about my racial identity but now that it matters for a specific program I'm applying to, it's causing me to have a lot of second thoughts.

A little about me: my biological father is black and my mother white. Said father left the family when I was 2 and growing up, I never experienced black culture at home. Somewhat unrelated: I was adopted when I was 10 by two gay white men who I view as my true dads, but even so, there was never any discussion about what it meant to be black. Black friends at school always seem to accept me as one of their own (more so than any white person), but both white and black people say I ""act pretty white for a black guy"". So I really do not know what I consider myself as - it's hard for me to say I'm white since I am half black, but knowing nothing about black culture or what it means to be black I don't see myself as black either.

The program I'm applying for is called Code2040 ([http://www.code2040.org/fellows-program/](http://www.code2040.org/fellows-program/)) and it requires you to ""Self-identify as Black and/or Latinx"". Anytime I've ever applied for anything, I've always checked the ""two or more races"" box and moved on, but this program is all about advocating racial equality in the tech industry and since I *wouldn't* (but also would, idk!) consider myself black, I feel as though I shouldn't be applying. I have already  been contacted from companies participating in the program to line an internship, but I'm stalling on going through with the interviews because of this identity crisis. I feel guilty about accepting something that I barely believe in when someone else who rightly identifies could have been in my place.

Not necessarily looking for answers here, but it would be nice to hear others' thoughts who may have been in similar situations.

EDIT: all these comments have been super encouraging, I'm gonna stick with it and see where it takes me. Thanks so much for the kind responses!"

They battled for $100,000, where every week, they would compete in challenges. The winning team or people were rewarded with invincibility for the week, while the losers faced the dreaded campfire ceremony, where they'd vote off one of their own. There was laughter, there was pain, there was anger, there was excitement, but most importantly...there was [drama.](https://i.imgur.com/jVKvOMT.png#evidence)

**Week 1**

* The twenty-two campers arrived one-by-one, showcasing their diverse personalities and making waves before the competition even began. The campers were immediately split into two teams: Sakura and Ryoma were randomly selected as the captains for the Killer Bass and the Screaming Gophers, respectively. After a schoolyard style pick, the campers nearly put themselves in a battle-of-the-sexes situation. The Killer Bass consisted of Sakura, Kaede, Maki, Himiko, Gundham, Celeste, Sayaka, Chisa, Hiyoko, Keebo, and Seiko, while the Screaming Gophers consisted of Ryoma, Kirumi, Kiyotaka, Korekiyo, Nekomaru, Nagito, Kazuichi, Gonta, Aoi, Angie, and Toko. 

* They were introduced to Robo-Chiaki the Intern, a life-like robot girl who acted as their chef for the entire season. While she wasn't the best cook in the world, she still tried her best! After being introduced to her, getting settled into their cabins, and having their first meals, it was time for the first challenge. In the Hot Tub Relay, it was the Bass who outran, out-swam, and outbuilt the Gophers in the very first challenge of the season.

* With this came the first few alliances of the season. Angie hit the ground running by making deals with Aoi, Kazuichi, and Korekiyo individually, while Kirumi and Ryoma also formed a final two. Over on the Bass side, Gundham and Himiko grew closer as well, forming the first Bass-side alliance of the season. Though the vote went back and forth between a few people, and though Angie campaigned pretty hard for Gonta, it was Toko who became the first boot of the season as a result of the Gophers entrusting their votes to Ryoma. Toko walked the dock of shame, boarded the boat of losers, and departed.

**Week 2**

* Rather than letting the campers get some well-deserved sleep, Chris decided to spice things up with some sleep deprivation word games. The second challenge of the season, Sleepytime Word Arrangement, forced the campers to try their best to make as many words as possible out of a single phrase, and bet correctly on how many they could get. In the end, thanks to the help of Kiyotaka, Nekomaru, Kazuichi, and Gonta, the Screaming Gophers scored their first victory of the season, sending the Killer Bass to the dreaded campfire ceremony.

* As it came time to voting, yet another Bass alliance formed, and it became a powerhouse that dominated for the rest of the season consisting of Kaede, Sayaka, Seiko, Himiko, and Sakura. On top of this, Sayaka and Sakura made a side alliance with Celeste, in hopes to win her number over as well. Sakura and Himiko also got along quite well. Lastly, Gundham and Celeste formed a pact as well. Meanwhile, on the Gopher side, Angie solidified her alliance with Aoi and Kazuichi. Overall, however, the Bass seemed pretty united in getting Hiyoko out for her bratty behavior and lack of help in the challenge, and outside of a few stray votes, Hiyoko was sent packing.

**Week 3**

* After some much needed sleep, the campers were faced with a showdown in the form of arcade games in the Olympic Flash Games. Some serious competitors came out to play, namely Sayaka, Kirumi, and Chisa, but in the end, it was Angie who clinched another Gopher victory with an incredible speedrun attempt on an escape room flash game.

* Angie soon made waves when she was offered a small reward for her status as the MVP and requested a poster indicating her 'carrying' the Gophers. On top of this, after seeing their mutually respectable performances, Angie and Chisa formed the first cross-tribal alliance of the season. Once again, the Bass remained united for the most part, and when Gundham failed to deliver in the challenge, despite his ties to Himiko and Celeste, he was sent to Playa Des Losers next.

**Week 4**

* On the next episode, campers were met with the ultimate writing task -- Poor Toko, she missed it! Campers were sorted into groups of three and came up with stories that incorporated them and their talents. On the Bass side of things, Kaede, Sayaka, and Chisa cooked up a fun hotel sing-a-long, Maki, Sakura, and Himiko battled handsome villains like warriors, and Seiko, Keebo, and Celeste wrote about an underground gambling and drug ring. Talk about dark. On the Gopher side of things, however, Kirumi, Aoi, and Kazuichi told a tale of Kazuichi's failure to get a girl, Angie, Nekomaru, and Nagito wrote a football game for the ages, and Ryoma, Kiyotaka, and Gonta fused into one to make the touching tale of Gontakyoma and his sister's birthday. In the end, the Bass won out, sending the Gophers to their second campfire ceremony of the season.

* The team mostly agreed that the fault lied in the lowest-scoring group, consisting of Angie, Nekomaru, and Nagito. Despite Nagito writing most of the prompt, it was Nekomaru who bit the bullet due to his lack of participation in a nearly unanimous vote.

**Week 5**

* After the elimination, and after two less-than-physical competitions, Chris chose to send the campers...camping as their next challenge. Of the remaining campers, only Keebo, Gonta, and Korekiyo were captured by Sasquatchanakwa, and Maki began to bond with Kiyotaka and the others on the Gophers by getting fish for both teams. Though the Gophers put up an admirable attempt, the Bass could not be caught, getting all of their team members back to camp and clinching their second win in a row.

* Though the vote seemed to be an easy choice between Gonta and Korekiyo, Angie had other plans, and chose to set her sights on Nagito due to his troublesome nature. She gathered as many votes as she could through her alliances, and when it came to the campfire ceremony, we were met with our first tie of the season between Korekiyo and Nagito. Because nine people were voting, the re-vote would decide their fate, and in the end, Kiyotaka set his outlier vote for Angie to Korekiyo instead, and on top of that, Kazuichi flipped his vote in the same direction. Thus, Korekiyo walked the Dock of Shame, but not before warning the others of Angie's true nature.

**Week 6**

* After that shocking turn of events, Chris sought out to stir the pot even more with his next challenge, where he forced campers to fill out questions about their fellow teammates that weren't so nice, which would then become quiz questions for the opposing team. Of course, the teams were given the correct answers, and could do whatever they pleased with that information. In the end, Kiyotaka and Ryoma rose to the occasion and scored the highest scores, alongside Keebo of the Bass, giving the Gophers the win.

* With Kaede's poor performance, it seemed like she was the perfect target. However, due to her alliance's strength in the tribe, they successfully eliminated Keebo, their highest scorer in the challenge, with votes scattered all over the place between Kaede, Maki, Celeste, and Himiko. Though it was a shocking blindside, Keebo left happy with the progress he had made for robo-rights.

**Week 7**

* Bored due to the lack of full-on drama in the game, Chris chose to throw a twist the campers' way this round in the form of a sudden death decision for all of them. Campers chose partners from the other team and were forced into an ultimate Prisoner's Dilemma. Both teams were destined to go to the campfire ceremony this round, and so this vote was for immunity. If both people in the partnership allied, they would both be immune. If both betrayed, neither would be. If one betrayed and the other did not, the betrayer would not only be immune for that campfire ceremony, but also for the next one they attended.

* Partners shaped up to be: Seiko and Kirumi, Kaede and Gonta, Sayaka and Kiyotaka, Himiko and Kazuichi, Celeste and Nagito, Sakura and Aoi, Maki and Ryoma, and Chisa and Angie. Much to Chris's pleasing, Celeste began to stir the pot by publicly announcing that Nagito had received multiple negative answers, in an attempt to forge trust with Nagito and turn him against his own teammates. Some vitriol was exchanged...however, Chris's plan backfired on him. In a surprise turn of events, nearly everyone voted ally, including a newly formed partnership between Maki and Ryoma. The only exception...was Himiko Yumeno, who betrayed Kazuichi for immunity. Though this would typically mean an automatic elimination for the mechanic, Chris took pity on him, and instead forced the Gophers into a vote. Their options were, one, keep Kazuichi, but face a disadvantage at the next challenge, or two, boot Kazuichi with no repercussions. In the end, all but Nagito chose to spare him, and the week concluded with no elimination.

**Week 8**

* Following the chaos, Chris tasked the campers with finding or creating fan art that represented one of the seven deadly sins, plus an extra ""Ultimate Sin"" category. In these head-to-head battles, some tensions flew when Sayaka's lust picture depicted her and Celeste getting intimate, and even more when Sakura failed to submit an entry for the challenge. In the end, despite their challenge disadvantage, the Gophers came out on top, sending the Bass back to the campfire ceremony.

* With the numbers waning, and with Himiko having immunity, the five-girl squad of the Bass were scrambling with who to vote for between Celeste, Chisa, and Maki. Due to Celeste's pull with Sakura and Sayaka, and Maki's with Kaede, and despite Sakura's lack of performance, it was Chisa who next met the Boat of Losers. Her kindhearted and compassionate heart made for quite a touching moment as she departed.

**Week 9**

* On the next episode, campers were faced with a puzzle that challenged their sights by presenting them with tiny fragments of pictures of their competitors and guessing who they were. The campers struggled greatly with this challenge, and though Ryoma gave an extremely impressive time for the Gophers, he and Kiyotaka couldn't overtake Kaede, Sakura, and Seiko's scores, giving the Bass the win.

* Though tensions were still high between Angie, Kiyotaka, and Ryoma with a clear tribal divide present, they were all able to come together and agree on a common enemy to take out: Nagito. In the first unanimous vote of the season, Nagito was sent to Playa Des Losers after a shower of compliments from his team.

**Week 10**

* After a challenging puzzle, it was time to get physical again, with a good old-fashioned game of paintball. The hunters (Maki, Sayaka, and Kaede for the Bass, and Kirumi, Ryoma, and Gonta for the Gophers) would track down the deer (Sakura, Seiko, Himiko, and Celeste for the Bass, and Kiyotaka, Angie, Aoi, and Kazuichi for the Gophers) and test their luck with their perception of the deer's alignment and their shooting accuracy. After a long, hard-fought battle, Kirumi emerged as the MVP for the Gophers for shooting Celeste and Sakura, ending the game in favor of the Gophers.

* Though Sayaka shot one of her own teammates accidentally during the challenge, the trend of the Bass continued in remaining loyal to the alliance. Though they went back and forth between Celeste and Maki, Sakura and Sayaka were able to persuade Kaede to rid of Maki for the sake of the team, and in a near-unanimous vote, Maki was sent packing.

**Week 11**

* In the next challenge, the campers got into partners within their own teams and were tasked with repeating a list of names over and over again in an ultimate test of will and determination that went on for about 48 hours. Aoi and Kazuichi produced a magnificent score for the Gophers and the best score in the game, but their teammates didn't quite pull through, whereas the Bass, particularly Kaede and Sayaka, had consistently good scores. In the end, the totals favored the Bass, giving them the win.

* Though Kirumi and Ryoma under-performed, it was Gonta and Kiyotaka who got the worst score in the challenge, and both men had accepted their fates and expected the boot that night. Both sides of the tribe went back and forth, but ultimately they decided to give Kiyotaka one more chance, and gave Gonta the boot in a near-unanimous vote.

**Week 12**

* Once again, the campers' intellects were put to the test in a quoting challenge where they had to match the quote to the speaker in showdown style. To put it lightly, the Bass smoked the Gophers in a clean sweep, with Himiko in particularly delivering yet another crushing defeat to Kazuichi.

* Tensions at the Gopher camp were at an all-time high. Angie's power alliance of herself, Aoi and Kazuichi faced the tight duo of Kirumi and Ryoma, and in the middle of it all was Kiyotaka. It was at this point where Kiyotaka faced a great internal conflict volunteered to be voted for, once again, for his challenge performance, despite mostly everyone competing the same. Though Kirumi and Ryoma fought hard for Angie to go, Kiyotaka intentionally threw his vote away, while Angie's alliance voted for Kiyotaka, sending him to Playa Des Losers after an emotional campfire ceremony.

**Week 13**

* Campers competed in a game of ""Huts"" where they had to predict the movements of the other team and send them flying to the ground in a fight for the win. In the end, though Seiko put up a good fight, Aoi and Angie dominated the challenge and rose to victory, grabbing a vital win for the Gophers.

* Though it seemed like an obvious boot for Celeste at first, tensions were at an all-time high for the Bass girls. Sakura and Sayaka, in particular, were at a crossroads between ditching their ally or betraying their alliance. More than that, of the Bass alliance, one girl seemed like more of an outsider than the others, and on top of that, Kaede also approached Sayaka about voting for Seiko instead, as she had been interested in working with Celeste. Thus, Sakura, Sayaka, Kaede, Himiko and Celeste sent Seiko home. Sparks flew as Seiko's betrayal was revealed, and she left the island cursing their names.

**Week 14**

* With ten campers remaining, Chris decided that it was time for the merge! Before they moved into their next challenge, however, they were met with one more big twist: two campers were coming back to Camp Wawanakwa. Of the first twelve eliminated from the game, two would return to the game after a hard-fought puzzle battle. Though most of the losers put up a good fight, it was Toko, the first eliminated from the game, and Chisa, the shining smile of the Bass, who rejoined the battle for another shot at the $100,000 prize. The merged team deemed themselves the Charging Bears.

* The next challenge tested the social strengths of each camper by tasking them with getting information from one another to solve a murder mystery. Lies and deceit flew left and right, but in the end, Celeste came out on top, winning the first individual invincibility challenge of the season.

* This vote would set the tone for the remainder of the game. With the tribes being evenly split, and with returnees from both teams, things were up in the air. Kazuichi attempted to qualm the tensions of the past Gophers through Kirumi, hoping it would reach her. However, Kaede was also interested in working with Kirumi, and so they too formed a deal, in hopes that Kirumi would flip to the Bass side. To ensure Toko's questionable vote, Angie formed a closer bond with her, in hopes of working with her in the future. On top of that, Toko and Chisa decided to form a pact as the returnees to look out for each other and to fulfill the wishes of the previously eliminated to break up the large Bass alliance. Toko also formed a closer bond with Ryoma to solidify her safety will all parties going into the vote. Angie revived her alliance with Chisa for the time being, while also trying to pull Celeste in for being the general ""outsiders"" of their respective tribes. With deals and names flying all around, it was hard to tell what would really happen. The ceremony came down to Himiko and Angie. In the end, Kirumi and Ryoma chose to side with the Bass over their previous teammate, and Chisa abandoned her very early ally as well. Angie became the first person to board the Boat of Losers after the merge, which would set the tone for the rest of the game.

**Week 15**

* After the dust settled on the last campfire ceremony, campers were faced with logic puzzles that forced them to think outside of the box. While Sayaka, Kazuichi, and Aoi flopped, Kirumi and Celeste scored incredible scores, but it was Sakura who took the win at an amazing score of just over 3 minutes to solve ten puzzles.

* Much in contrast to the previous vote, the vote seemed to be much quieter and more cohesive. Though Kazuichi put up a fight by offering an alliance and appealing to Sayaka, emphasizing his case by revealing his previous alliance, it was no match for the consensus of the Bass girls. So, Kazuichi was voted out unanimously due to his previous ties with Angie and his tense past with Himiko.

**Week 16**

* The challenge after involved a classic game of Scattergories, where campers had to avoid each others' answers and get creative with their own. After an interesting set of answers, including 'sorry work ate dog' and 'sumimasen', Ryoma soared above the competition, snagging his first invincibility win of the season.

* At this point in the game, the original Gophers knew they were facing an uphill battle. In an attempt to win people over, Ryoma tried his best in convincing Chisa, among other members of the Bass, to vote out Sayaka along with himself, Kirumi, Toko, and Aoi. His words would not succeed, however, as new developments were forming. Toko had been working as a swing vote for the past few votes, and she formed an alliance with Sakura and Sayaka at this time, both of whom wished to use Toko as an added number when they started to target one another. As votes flew in a few different directions, the Bass girls and Toko chose to eliminate Aoi for the same reasons as they did Kazuichi, and she quickly departed.

**Week 17**

* The next challenge was a strategy drinking game, where you didn't want to have a little, but you definitely didn't want to have too much to drink! In the end, though Kirumi put up a fight, Toko came out on top, and Sayaka definitely got wasted!

* Kirumi and Ryoma's backs were against the wall, so in yet another scramble, they attempted to save face and get Sayaka booted through a number of channels like Chisa and Toko. Unfortunately for them, however, the Bass girls plus Chisa and Toko remained united, sending Ryoma on his way for winning the previous challenge. Though the final male of the season left peacefully, Kirumi made a bold move and extended the ceremony by calling out the alliance due to being lied to in hopes that she wouldn't be the next one to go. The girls, particularly Kaede and Sayaka, reacted quite negatively to this, and most of it fell on deaf ears.

**Week 18**

* Immediately following the blowout, Kirumi attempted to appeal to Celeste, Chisa, and Sakura in order to give her a fighting chance to stay. Though all said they would consider it, it was looking grim for the maid as they headed into their next challenge, which was a gambling event where campers competed in a tournament that tested their betting and speed skills. The final showdown came down to Sakura versus Toko, but Sakura came out with the gold, scoring her second invincibility of the season.

* Kirumi fought and fought for Sayaka to go, as she felt she was the core of the alliance. She urged that she was alone and had no allies, and that she was a number for anyone who would take her. In the end, unfortunately, her pleas fell on deaf ears, as the tightly-formed voting bloc of the Bass girls, Chisa, and Toko all voted her out of the game. Before she departed, however, she was sure to mention that Kaede had offered her a final three, and urged the Bass to rid of Sayaka. She departed, leaving behind several new enemies.

**Week 19**

* In this episode, campers were sent on a hunt for previous campers in the sand based on riddles. Once again, Toko became the bridesmaid by coming in a fierce second, but the bride was Sayaka, who won her first individual invincibility of the season.

* With nowhere left to hide, the Bass girls faced a dilemma between voting off Chisa or Toko. Though Kaede insisted on Toko, Sakura and Himiko realized that keeping Toko would benefit their future plans of booting their biggest social threat, Kaede. Celeste, too, realized that keeping Toko around would benefit her in keeping the target off of her back, and so the consensus agreed on a Chisa boot, despite Kaede's rebuttals. Chisa was blindsided in a near-unanimous vote, though this upset Toko greatly, as her allies, Sakura and Sayaka, had told her otherwise. Chisa left the competition for the second time this season, but before she left, she gave everyone heart-warming drawings -- even Chris!

**Week 20**

* The final six competed against one another in identifying the parents of Total Dangan ""babies"" that used letters from their names. While Kaede totally ate it, Celeste soared above the competition, making her queen of the nurser--er, island, guaranteeing her a spot in the final five.

* With only six choices remaining, five with Celeste having immunity, there was truly nowhere to hide in terms of the vote. Tensions were rising, and Sakura in particular began to make her move by forming plans with Himiko, Celeste, and Toko to break up the power duo of Kaede and Sayaka. In an added spark of drama, Sakura told her plans to Sayaka, who shared them with Kaede. Kaede confronted the group on their betrayal, but in the end, it was no use. Kaede received a near-unanimous vote, Sayaka being the only one to spare her. Rather than get angry, however, Kaede was forgiving, and shared a very emotional goodbye with Sayaka before joining the losers. Thus, we were introduced to our final five: Celeste, the strategist, Himiko, the under-the-radar backstabber, Sakura, the leader, Sayaka, the social threat, and Toko, the wildcard.

**Week 21**

* For the final five invincibility challenge, campers once again tested their speed and luck as they competed in teams to score points, with a bettor placing their money on one of two teams. All of the girls fought their hardest, and some rounds had mere seconds separating winners from losers. Ironically enough, however, the only camper to have not yet won an individual invincibility at the merge, Himiko, was the one to come out on top, securing her a spot in the final four.

* As the challenge ended, two clear sides began to form. Because of Sakura's dominant role in Kaede's elimination, Sayaka broke off her deal with her and immediately joined forces with Celeste, the one camper to not completely betray her. Celeste, too, was interested in the deal, as it could potentially benefit her end-game to have more people on her side. Further, as Sakura and Himiko became a more obvious duo, Celeste and Sayaka felt it was a necessary alliance. Thus, the stage was set for the final vote: Sayaka and Celeste versus Himiko and Sakura, which meant it was all up to our lonely bookworm Toko. Toko was caught between a rock and a hard place, as both of her closest allies, Sakura and Sayaka, had split, and she also had connections to Celeste as well. She was faced with an extremely tough decision, as Sakura and Himiko chose to gun for Celeste, and Celeste and Sayaka aimed for Sakura. After much back and forth, Toko remained loyal to her deal with Sakura and Sayaka, sending Celeste home in a shock elimination. Celeste exchanged some scathing words with the girls before taking fifth place and joining the realm of the losers.

**Week 22**

* Invincibility was more pivotal than ever as the campers vied for the a spot in the final three. The challenge tested their memories, as the girls were forced to recall the order of important events in the entire game. Though Himiko put up a great fight, Sakura was the one to take home the win, guaranteeing her safety and a 33% chance of winning the game.

* Once again, the sides remained as they were, with Sakura and Himiko on one side and Sayaka as the sole fighter against them. Sayaka pleaded to Toko for her life in the game, which put Toko in yet another tough but powerful position. Once again, she chose to honor her deal with Sakura and Sayaka, and chose to tie the vote in favor of Sayaka against Himiko. With a 2-2 vote, the pop sensation and the magician were forced into a jigsaw puzzle tiebreaker. In the end, the winner was Himiko, meaning that Sayaka was officially eliminated from the game. Though heart-breaking, she took it well and left graciously, making her one of the last campers to leave the island.

**Week 23**

* In the penultimate challenge of the season, the girls were met with a showdown in how well they knew their former campers by guessing how they answered questions about the game. All three girls fought with their lives, and though the fearsome duo did well, Toko emerged as the clear winner of the final invincibility of the season. For the third time in a row, Toko was left with the ultimate decision: who would she take to the finals? In a shocking turn of events, however, Himiko volunteered to go home and give Sakura the chance for the grand prize, asking Toko to vote for her at the campfire ceremony. Though Toko flipped and flopped back and forth, she chose to grant the request, eliminating Himiko just before the finale and choosing Sakura as her rival in the final challenge.

**Finale**

* The ever-so-exciting finale of Total Dangan Island didn't fail to entertain. The amazing showdown between Sakura Ogami, the leader of the pack who commanded the game strategically, and Toko Fukawa, the wildcard who played a pivotal role in a lot of late-game votes, was bound to be one of the most epic fights in history.

* The girls faced off in a Total Dangan Medley, where the girls faced off in shortened versions of all of the past challenges of the season to score points, with 8 points being the winning ticket. Toko picked up the first point by winning the jury vote by a mere 11-9 margin (with Angie, Kiyotaka, Ryoma, Maki, Seiko, Gonta, Sayaka, Aoi, Korekiyo, Nagito, and Hiyoko voting in Toko's favor). Sakura won the second point in word arrangement, while Toko claimed the third point with art and prose. Sakura took the fourth in a gambling showdown, and Toko won the fifth in guessing the ex-campers' statements. The before-or-after showdown was painfully close, as both girls got all five questions correct, but Sakura claimed the sixth point of the game in a tiebreaker question, evening the score to 3 all. Toko bounced back, however, by finding the correct campers in the sand in the next round, as well as decoding rebus puzzles faster than Sakura in the round after that, giving her a 5-3 edge at halftime.

* Sakura didn't go down without a fight. She came back the next round for the ninth point of the match in a redux of the hot tub relay race. However, Toko maintained her lead the next round by correctly matching quotes to campers, scoring the tenth point of the game and keeping her just two points away from the win. The next round involved a spamming competition, which went to Sakura, and the round after featured identifying campers from tiny cropped pictures, which also went to Sakura. Suddenly, we were at 6 all. The next challenge was a throwback to the questionnaires given very early on in the game, and in a multiple choice quiz, Toko came out on top. Right after that, Toko and Sakura got down to naming Total Dangan babies, and Sakura took home the win on that one...which meant we were tied 7-7. In an incredible moment, we were going to the sudden death game that would end it all: the Olympic Flash Games.

* It was a tough battle, and after 84 long, grueling days of fighting, a winner emerged. By a score of 8-7 in the Total Dangan Medley, Sakura Ogami was declared the winner, walking away with the $100,000 prize. Toko Fukawa fought admirably, though, and so she was given $10,000 as a runner-up prize. [Congratulations, Sakura Ogami!](https://i.imgur.com/TOmObzA.png#evidence)

(Once again, a huge thanks to /u/SparklingJustice for making this! Appreciate the beautiful gay baby!)

And with that, Total Dangan Island came to a close. But, perhaps this isn't the last you'll see of Chris. After all, you can never have enough drama, and you should ALWAYS expect the unexpected.

9vgfvb,32,2018-11-08,Connected with Woman Whose Sperm Donor Dad May Be My Deceased Cousin,probwitgenez,23andme,https://www.reddit.com/r/23andme/comments/9vgfvb/connected_with_woman_whose_sperm_donor_dad_may_be/,"Hi everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

This account is a throwaway since this is a fairly private family issue.

&amp;#x200B;

I got my results from 23andMe a few months ago. I connected with a few cousins on there and all was great. A few days ago, I noticed that someone who 23andMe estimated was a 2nd cousin (same great-grandparents) recently joined the site. I took a look at her profile and noticed that she had the same relationship that I did to one of my other cousins on my mom's side (2nd cousins). My maternal grandfather had 10 siblings and my connection implied that this person was the grand-daughter of one of them.

&amp;#x200B;

I immediately reached out to her. She has very little information about her family - her mom was adopted before her maternal grandparents were killed during WWII and her dad was an unknown sperm donor. After talking to my mom about her aunts and uncles and communicating more with the match on 23andMe, I'm pretty sure that I narrowed down her dad to one of two people.

&amp;#x200B;

One of my grandfather's siblings moved to another part of the country where they had a family. One of their sons became a doctor and the other became a lawyer. I'm not sure which one is her father but when I told her about my grandfather's sibling's sons, she said the doctor would make sense since in the early 60s (when this woman was conceived), ""sperm donors typically were medical interns working in the same facility."" The doctor would have been in his late 20s at the time he donated sperm. Unfortunately, he passed away a few months ago. He does have at least three children though who don't know me (I knew him fairly well but never met his children since they are much older than I am). I also don't know his brother. Obviously, the only way to know for sure if the person who we think is her father, is to get the DNA of his children to see if they are half-siblings with her.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, I don't know what to do... As I see it, I have three options:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Reach out to my cousin's children. They don't know me although I think they knew my grandfather. Since they don't know me, I think that would be awkward. I would ask them if they would be interested in connecting with this person and if they ever had their DNA processed by a genealogy site.
2. Provide the contact information for my cousin's children to her and she can reach out to them directly. However, this would be even more awkward since she would basically be contacting his children and saying that she may be their sister.
3. Forget the whole thing. I don't think I could do this, though.

&amp;#x200B;

Does this make sense? Am I completely off the mark here? Of course, it's possible that one of my other relatives randomly donated sperm in this part of the country but that seems very unlikely.

&amp;#x200B;

I would be interested in hearing people's thoughts...especially those who were contacted by their half-siblings. Would you want to know if you had a half-sister? It's also possible that my cousin donated sperm multiple times and so they have many half-siblings. It's also possible that my now deceased cousin didn't mention any of this to his family because he wanted to keep it a secret. These people aren't young kids - the woman is in her late 50s and my cousin's children are in their mid-50s so I would hope that everyone would be able to think maturely about the situation.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - connected with woman on 23andMe whose dad was a sperm donor who I think may be my cousin. Not sure how to proceed."

All characters and scenes within are purely fictional.

- - -

Nobody really *expects* the unexpected. No matter what your daily routine is, the terms always seem to change on you. Wether it be finding a winning lottery ticket on the ground, meeting someone new for the first time, getting robbed in an alleyway... or getting caught up in a museum robbery between two international superheroes and a couple of terrorists. That’s always fun, right?

Totally not what I was expecting when I brought my little brother to the museum. Poor kid broke his arm on the school playground and wanted to go outside after mom practically jailed the kid in his room. Told him he needed to rest or it would never heal, and as inclined as I was to agree with her... well, the poor kid was miserable. What was I supposed to do, ditch him at home? Poor kid couldn’t even pick up a game controller to pass the time. It was horrible.

That’s why, on a sunny Autumn morning, I decided to take little Timmy to the Overwatch Memorial Museum. I figured he’d get his fill, run around, get yelled at for climbing on Rocketman’s rusty armor again, and we’d go home, right? Except, yeah. That whole thing about the unexpected and what-not. Glass shattered, bullets flew all over the place (except for the gorilla, who mostly swung his fists), and... well, that’s all I remember of the actual fight. I kinda spent the majority of it staring at purple and gold latex-clad butts, and then one of those butts started coming towards my hiding place, and *then* I panicked. Next thing I know, I’m putting on some antique mechanical fist and telling knockoff Spider-Girl to eat shit.

Well, I guess the one in the gold spandex (Tracer, I learned her name was, then Lena later on) kinda figured out where my eyes were the entire time, because when I emptied my pockets a week later for laundry day I found an interesting surprise in my pockets... and when I say *interesting,* I’m more or less saying *earth-shattering, rock-my-world, mind-blowing development,* because apparently during the fight— yes, *during,* I can see Winston in the background— she found time to duck into cover, take a picture of her bare tits, write down her number, and sneak it into my pocket. Of course I called right away. Or... well, right after a handful of panic attacks and acting out a couple of worst-case scenarios in my head. But I did call!

I wish I could tell you the exact conversation. Word for word, each breathy, teasing syllable. Unfortunately, I was too busy trying to keep myself from falling apart to focus on much of the conversation. In all fairness, I probably sounded like a complete tool. Just a lot of bubbly-sounding ‘uh-huh’ and ‘yep’ noises. But out of the entire conversation, I remember two things: the address she told me to meet her at, and the cutesy kissing noise she made at the end. And, no, you don’t get the address.

After that, the next nine months kind of blur. We fucked on a regular basis, sometimes as equal, sometimes as a sub and dom. A couple months after that, we started going on actual dates. I learned she was in town on a terror watch, and that Lena had a girlfriend back in London (who she swore up and down was cool with her having another boyfriend). She learned a lot about... well, school. I don’t think I’m super interesting, but she very *passionately* disagreed.

Just as fast as she came, she left. That’s the one thing I really remember the clearest. March sixteenth, Lena said she had important business and would get in touch soon. I figured that would mean a few days, or maybe weeks. By the time the last week of school rolled around, I was starting to panic. Did she find someone else? She certainly didn’t seem super loyal to her girl in London. Was I just tripping balls or something the whole time? *Was my life naught but a lie, plugged in to the matrix as my body was drained to power a mechanized race?*

Apparently not. Just as I was about to spiral into tinfoil hat conspiracies in my school desk, I got an email from an address I’d never seen before. “oxtonfree69@overwatch.net.” Of course I opened it in a heartbeat, and I closed it just as fast when tits flashed across my screen. Once I got over that scare and made it to the bathroom, I opened it a second time. Inside were three things: A picture of Lena, knuckles deep in her cunt, a two way ticket to Switzerland, and a long letter that began, “Congratulations on your acceptance into the Overwatch Internship Program...”

- - -

So, just shy of ten paragraphs condensed into a small synopsis: Lena gave Brian (the kid in the blue hoodie) her phone number. Booty calls turned into an actual relationship between the fifteen year old kid and the twenty-six year old woman. After dropping off the map for a couple months, she resurfaces in Switzerland for the reformation of OW, offering Brian an internship for the summer where he builds up a harem of Overwatch women.

I would play Brian in this game. He’s fifteen years old (we can go younger if you want), neck-deep in horny teenager hormones, and can’t believe his luck. You would play the various women of Overwatch, as well as the world around them.

I have no limits, but I’ll respect yours.

Thankfully, nobody I knew was hurt. But that is a *safe* neighborhood, the last place once would expect an attack like this to occur. But it did.

The best thing we got out of our President is ""thoughts and prayers"", but nothing else. No proposed policies. No paths forward. Same thing he does with every other damn mass shooting.

Why? Because he doesn't want to piss off his awful base.

And now there's this garbage about his Press Secretary sharing doctored video to trick the country into thinking that Acosta assaulted an intern. She even had the nerve to be all ""#MeToo"" about it, even though she's shown time and time again that she doesn't give a damn about what's best for women. The White House is *deliberately* spreading ""Fake News"" to push their agenda: suppressing those who disagree with them.

People keep voting for this guy and his party, though. My parents did. My parents-in-law did. They're terrified of the caravan, because that's all that they see on their TV channels. They think all forms of abortion is murder, and so they won't vote for anyone who's even a little bit pro-choice. They don't realize that climate change is a threat, and think that the universe was created in 7 days.

Any time I question them (or anyone on Reddit, specifically /r/AskTrumpSupporters) about how they can continue to support this administration when it's done so many horrible things (and more), all I get is ""yeah, but... the tax cut gave my business a huge boon! I was able to buy more stocks!""

How many times can you use ""yeah, but..."" to avoid these horrible things that this administration is doing? Two years into this administration, and they have nothing to show for it. All they've done is hurt the country.

I have so little faith in my family, and my country. It's so disheartening."

If you’re wanting to try paragard here’s my First 12 hours with it. It’s rough not going to lie. From everything I’ve read everyone has different experiences and I haven’t run across any like mine specifically so her we go! So my appt was at 3:30. So I took 800mg of ibuprofen at 2:30 (FYI oral medications that are not coated or extended release generally become effective within 45 mins to an hour). Initially they do a pregnancy test, then my doc came in. We talked about risks and such. Then she used a speculum to open things up, and wash the cervix, this feels like a pap. Then my doc warned me about a pinch as she dilated my cervix, honestly if wasn’t horrible but there was some slight cramping nothing horrible. Next she measured my cervix. Next came the IUD which once that hit my uterus it was cramps city. Then it subsided and felt like the general menstrual cramps— NBD. Walking to my car I felt them more then I went to ulta (naturally) and things really started to ramp up but not unmanageable. On my drive home things changed, I got extra crampy, nothing unbearable but some serious cramps. Once I made it home things really intensified—holy cow! It felt worse than the pain that I had when I broke a bone! At this point it was 5-6, so still too soon for more meds. A heating pad really didn’t help much and that’s when I called my more to have her bring a TENS unit, these help with spasms so why not give it a try. That didn’t help from there my mom who is a nurse recommended that I call the on-call GYN. She recommended I come in to make sure I wasn’t rejecting it or expelling it. 

ER Visit
They did vitals and my Heart Rate and BP we up these due to anxiety and I was also having a bad cramping cycle.  The ER was slow so I didn’t have that long of a wait. Then the nurse came in did labs, then the generalist doctor came in. She did an ultrasound to make sure everything was still in place. (I wanted to rip this thing out at this point) Everything was in place sooooooo we left it in. Best she felt for the strings, and then used a light up speculum to visualize the strings. They were right where they were supposed to be. My nurse and my generalist both had IUDs and they could relate an sympathize with the cramps I was having. The Generalist said the BEST THING TO DO FOR THE CRAMPS IS NSAIDs, (Advil, Asaparin, Naproxen)they inhibit or stop the your body from recognizing chemicals that tell your interns (and other body parts) to cramp, these are called prostaglandins. 5 hours later I left with a piece of mind that my body wasn’t rejecting it, and a script for Naproxen (Aleeve). 

Main Take Away Points (sorry this is so much info kudos to you for sticking in with me) 

•Listen to your body and get help if you are concerned
•TAKE THE IBUPROFEN before hand
•maybe have someone drive you if you can
•Don’t have ANYTHING planned for later in the day besides eating whatever guilty pleasure and taking it easy.

**I Spit On Your Wave**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Long before polls closed Tuesday, political commentators, and nearly all Republicans circled in on the conclusion** that 2018 would not be a wave election. Instead, the public had rendered a “split decision,” there had been a political realignment, Democrats were having (and were going to have) a fairly disappointing night.                    
               
**Two days later, many of them remain committed to that interpretation, but reality has zoomed past them.** Democrats really did [win the election in a wave](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/democrats-rack-more-gains-house-key-tight-races-are-called-n934066?utm_source=hive&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_23704&amp;h_sid=ea5def399c-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84), and the wave is still washing ashore along with thousands of [wave metaphors](https://www.theatlantic.com/photo/2018/11/blue-wave-photos/575362/?utm_source=hive&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_23704&amp;h_sid=ea5def399c-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84).                    
               
**Republicans have an obvious self-interest in downplaying or mischaracterizing the Democrats’ performance.** But the prevailing view among political journalists took hold relatively early on election night, when Democrats were first slow to make gains, then appeared to be losing iconic races in Florida, Georgia, and Texas. Republicans, by contrast, knocked off a few vulnerable Democratic senators early in the evening.                    
               
**By now, it’s clear how wrong that premature assessment was.**                     
               
- Democrats are on pace to [win more than 35 House seats](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/democrats-rack-more-gains-house-key-tight-races-are-called-n934066?utm_source=hive&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_23704&amp;h_sid=ea5def399c-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84), more than the 31 seats they won in the undisputed wave of 2006.                    
               
- The [popular vote margin](http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/house-popular-vote-gives-democrats-something-brag-about?utm_source=hive&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_23704&amp;h_sid=ea5def399c-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) in the national race for the House could reach nine percent, higher than the margins Republicans won in their 1994 and 2010 blow out midterms. Republicans were spared from complete wipeouts by their own partisan gerrymanders in the House and historically friendly, but anomalous, Senate map.                     
               
- The races for Florida governor and senator are both headed for [automatic recounts](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/democratic-candidates-in-florida-pull-into-recount-range-as-the-state-once-again-becomes-the-epicenter-of-a-post-election-fight-over-ballots/2018/11/08/908c42b0-e38b-11e8-b759-3d88a5ce9e19_story.html?utm_term=.f25f759a8a6b&amp;utm_source=hive&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_23704&amp;h_sid=ea5def399c-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;noredirect=on).                     
               
- Votes are still being counted in the [Georgia gubernatorial race](https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/08/politics/brian-kemp-resigns-secretary-of-state-georgia-governor-race-stacey-abrams/index.html?utm_source=hive&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_23704&amp;h_sid=ea5def399c-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) which may force Democrat Stacey Abrams and Republican Brian Kemp into a runoff.                     
               
- In Arizona, Republicans are [suing basically everyone](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/arizona-gop-sues-limit-mail-ballots-senate-race-n933866?utm_source=hive&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_23704&amp;h_sid=ea5def399c-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) in the hope of stopping officials from counting all the outstanding votes, in order to prevent Democrat Kyrsten Sinema from overtaking Republican Martha McSally in that state’s Senate race.                    
               
- If Democrats hang on in the Florida and Arizona, they can limit the GOP’s Senate gains to two.                    
               
**From Brian:** There are more important things in the world than media narratives, but they do have an impact on public opinion, and public opinion should reflect the fact that people turned out overwhelmingly in opposition the Trump GOP. But even today, [Bret Stephens](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/08/opinion/midterm-results-2020-democrats.html?utm_source=hive&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_23704&amp;h_sid=ea5def399c-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) and [Nicholas Kristof](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/07/opinion/midterms-democrats-republicans-results.html?utm_source=hive&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_23704&amp;h_sid=ea5def399c-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) of the *New York Times* told their readers that Tuesday was a let down. Stephens called the midterms that Democrats won “a warning to the Democrats.” “It was only a blue ripple…. Don’t listen to Democrats who portray these midterms as an important triumph,” Kristof wrote. *Washington Post* writer Karen Tumulty [agreed](https://twitter.com/ktumulty/status/1060520563574300673). Journalists don’t gauge the importance of their stories by whether the people they reach live in gerrymandered districts or large states. They shouldn’t gauge the importance of public sentiment that way either, and public sentiment is clear.                     
               
**What Else**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Acting-Attorney General [Matt Whitaker](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trumps-acting-attorney-general-matt-whitaker-has-no-intention-of-recusing-from-russia-probe-associates-say/2018/11/08/a5bc8d90-e370-11e8-ab2c-b31dcd53ca6b_story.html?utm_term=.fe90ff2dcaf1&amp;utm_source=hive&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_23704&amp;h_sid=ea5def399c-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84), who replaced Jeff Sessions today. reportedly does not intend to recuse himself from Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation,** despite a comical and growing list of conflicts of interests. He’s also unlikely to allow Mueller to subpoena President Trump. Prominent Justice Department veterans, including Kellyanne Conway’s husband George Conway, [argue persuasively](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/08/opinion/trump-attorney-general-sessions-unconstitutional.html?utm_source=hive&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_23704&amp;h_sid=ea5def399c-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) that Whitaker’s appointment is unconstitutional. But even if the courts might ultimately disagree with them, we know that it’s highly irregular and obviously corrupt. The only reason to circumvent the line of succession at the Justice Department, and elevate a staffer who is a declared opponent of the Russia investigation, is to impede or end it.                     
               
**A 28-year-old Marine Corps veteran murdered at least twelve people at a bar in [Thousand Oaks, CA](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/08/us/shooting-california-thousand-oaks.html?utm_source=hive&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_23704&amp;h_sid=ea5def399c-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84),** then took his own life with a .45-caliber handgun. The shooter had previously been referred to mental-health professionals after a domestic-disturbance call, but was deemed not to pose immediate danger to himself or others. One of the victims was Sgt. Ron Helus, who was killed upon entering the building to save others.

**You've Gotta Be Fucking Kidding Me**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Last night, the White House [suspended CNN reporter Jim Acosta](https://www.wsj.com/articles/white-house-accused-of-posting-edited-video-that-exaggerated-incident-involving-cnn-reporter-1541703579?utm_source=hive&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_23704&amp;h_sid=ea5def399c-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84),** revoking his hard pass—the credential that allows him to enter the White House—after he and President Trump had another contentious exchange. In justifying its decision, the White House falsely claimed Acosta placed his hands on an intern trying to take the microphone from him.                       
               
**To corroborate this blatant lie, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders tweeted [doctored footage](https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/08/media/sarah-sanders-jim-acosta-infowars-video/index.html?utm_source=hive&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_23704&amp;h_sid=ea5def399c-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84),** which accelerated frames to make it appear as if Acosta pushed the intern’s arm away from him. It is unsurprising that an administration this Orwellian would doctor video to smear members of the media, but it’s still completely outrageous.                       
               
**From Brian:** White House “hard passes” don't accredit White House-approved reporters; they’re given to reporters who have cleared background checks, so they can come and go and do their jobs like regular professionals. Revoking Acosta’s hard pass isn’t just a thumb in the eye of the press, it’s a gross abuse of power.

I knew he was having a hard time and had personal issues he was dealing with. I got fed up that he wasn’t communicating with me at all, and when he suggested a break, I asked how that would work. He didn’t reply. Even to the most important conversations he couldn’t reply. At that point I thought I knew it should definitely end. So we broke it off. We’ve been civil and he apologized for not communicating and rushing into a relationship...he took all the blame for things going wrong. I feel like I shouldn’t really like him and I should be at peace now that I won’t be constantly waiting on a reply that will most likely never come, but I realize I’m checking my phone even more often now. Seeing if he’s okay, and making sure he hasn’t harmed himself in any way. I thought I’d be at peace with myself and finally be able to focus on my school work and internships and moving on to pursue my career, but I wish he could’ve been there with me and I’m having a hard time getting rid of that feeling. This is the first break up where I’ve actually cared about the other person enough to feel sad. I’m pretty old [21] but this was what I would consider my first heart break...I feel like I’m still waiting on him. I know it’s pointless and I should move on, but I finally understand what people meant when they said they can’t imagine themselves moving on because I feel that way now. I’m so busy though. I have to focus on graduating and achieving all the goals I’ve set myself up for. I don’t have time to mope around and idk what to do. I would even take being with him and barely talking over what I feel right now even though the other is just as bad...I really don’t know anymore."
9vij7l,0,2018-11-09,Should I go to tafe rather than continue with uni for IT?,t-hrowawayobvs,sydney,https://www.reddit.com/r/sydney/comments/9vij7l/should_i_go_to_tafe_rather_than_continue_with_uni/,"I've been at uni for four years now (right out of high school) and I'm really tired of it. I've changed degrees and have no qualifications. I don't think I'm fit for uni or higher learning at this point in my life although I do love learning. I've been studying a bachelor of IT but it's difficult even though it is supposed to be fairly simple, especially the programming aspect which is a bigger part of the curriculum than I thought it would be. If I continue with uni full time and pass everything (which is unlikely), it will be another two years before I graduate. If I don't continue but don't drop out either, I'll have two years to resume working on it.

I'm thinking I should go to tafe and get a diploma in IT as well as entry-level cisco or ms certs. It'll take a year and a half for the diploma, hopefully only a year or less with recognition of prior learning. I've noticed the units for a diploma are quite different from the ones in a degree. If I could get an IT traineeship or something that would be great but IT traineeships aren't nearly as common as internships, same with IT jobs - more graduate opportunities than for people with tafe certs or diplomas. Experience is valued highly too but that's hard to get without any qualifications.

It just feels like a downgrade and a huge waste of time and money. Uni for 4 years and 40k in debt with nothing to show for it, only to end up at tafe which is 10k to do the diploma. My mental health really isn't good (depression &amp; SA) and sometimes I feel like I may as well be dead but I'm not suicidal. I haven't even been doing anything for the past month besides searching for info on all of these things, looking for volunteer opportunities because I need references to get a job (even maccas requires references), and worrying about this from morning to night. Not looking forward to my parents flipping their shit and telling me how stupid and worthless I am for the next few months when I tell them (if I go through with my plan). As an aside, if anyone knows how to best deal with this, I'm all ears. 

At the end of the day, I really just want to start working asap and gain some independence (so I can get therapy and eventually leave my toxic home environment) which comes from financial stability. I've definitely thought about doing a trade since there's a shortage but I've heard some not-so-great things about women going that route, especially if they're not very physically big/ strong. Any recommendations about what I should do or general advice is very welcome because I'm very much lost and struggling. "

9vl1l7,1,2018-11-09,How can I [23M] stop being awkward and let her [22F] that I want a relationship too,Randommthrowwawwy,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9vl1l7/how_can_i_23m_stop_being_awkward_and_let_her_22f/,"Hey there , I really dont post on reddit (im on a throwaway obviously  cause I dont want to be known).

&amp;#x200B;

English isnt my first language so bare with me , also sorry if the title isnt clear or related to my problem.

&amp;#x200B;

I met this girl a few months back in the same place I do my internship , we're both interns there...I met through a mutual friend and we started talking a little bit and more days has passed we started talking/texting daily, we talked about deep stuff and stories about our past and we just .. clicked ...

&amp;#x200B;

fast forward a couple of months during it we get closer and closer , we shared alot of interests and both of us had feelings to each other  (but having this low self-esteem didn't help me).

&amp;#x200B;

a couple of weeks ago she was not having it ... she had mood swings and would suddenly get depressed and  sometimes cry for no apparent reason, I always try to talk to her and try to help her or just have someone to listen to, but she was always saying she'll get through it and I dont have to worry etc .... i was really worried cause she didnt seem herself and I can see she is hurting for somereason, and ofc it made me miserable cause I dont like seeing her miserable.

&amp;#x200B;

So one day she texts me up in work and telling me she wants to meet , because she had something kinda serious to talk about, I went over there holding my strongest face trying not to show worry...then she hits me that her mother is moving(her mom and dad are divorced and living in different cities)  to another city and wants her to go with her and finish her internship over there...

&amp;#x200B;

My heart dropped cause it meant I wont be able to talk to her... see her ... and not being around her at all..

&amp;#x200B;

Well clearly my face showed how hard it hit me (lol) but I tried to hold my self to not ask her what did she decide ... so we have this seconds of pure silence before she breaks it and asks if im okay, then we talked for a bit and asked if anyone knew? and she told me she didnt tell anyone cause ""no one matters , except you do""

&amp;#x200B;

Before I say what happened next you need to understand that both of us had really terrible EXs , so why did it take us along time to be together cause we both are afraid... and I am really weird and I dont know why she even a girl like her likes me..but I try to not listen to these thoughts cause it only slows me down and effect my mental health, she helped me alot and I hopefully did help her too...

&amp;#x200B;

back to the story , she told me that her mom wont force her to do anything , she can stay , and she can move with her if she wants to, she told she decided to stay cause ""there are more important things and people(and looked at me) here)"" , my heart filled with joy cause I never thought someone would like me this much...Here's where I dont know if I fucked up or not

&amp;#x200B;

I told her I had feelings for her(it was obvious that we both did but we are both were scared , So I told her that) and then friends interrupted us so she couldnt talk, fast forward a few minutes (which felt like YEARS) we excused ourselves and continued walking cause we were sitting before, then we talk for god knows how long then she asks me ""why now did you pick this time to tell me"" I told her I dont know she said ""I mean im glad, Cause you know.."" then another person came by and said hello....

&amp;#x200B;

after the friend left we walked there in silence ... i didnt wanna hold her to her words if she didnt wanna say anything or feel the same way , then I broke the silence and said ""I dont want to pressure you into anything , i just wanted you to know how I felt"" she smiled and said""I know"" and held my hand...

&amp;#x200B;

i was a wreck for the next 24 hours cause I dont know if its just me or that she does like me )which she once expressed that she liked ).

&amp;#x200B;

we didnt text much (was mostly my fault I just didnt know what to say/do) and I was having one of my depression periods flaring up, So throughout that day she would keep texting me and talking to me.

&amp;#x200B;

the day after she saw me in the morning and then texted me if im okay cause I look sad(which I was lol) I lied to her and told her im fine , but she ofc caught my lie and told me to meet up later, we met later on and talked of random stuff like we always do , and then I said I word that she didnt like (which I didnt know she didnt like it and she agreed with me later on that she should not have gotten upset cause I didnt know she didnt like it ) and got upset and stopped talking while our mutual friends are there , I texted her while we are sitting cause something was off with her..she kept saying im fine nothing is wrong then I pulled her a side and we started a small argument (which made us understand each other more and im glad we had it) then I felt like she got upset not cause of the word it self ... maybe there is an underlying reason wich you guessed it .. is what I said to her yesterday..

&amp;#x200B;

she panicked and assured me that its not ! being me ... I asked her if she wished that I didnt say it cause  if she did im gonna be better knowing we are in the same place rather than thinking that we are .. she said that no she didnt wish I havent said it and she's glad that I did , and expressed how fucked up her mind is and how she has so many trust issues (which I knew about them , and no her mind is amazing and not fucked the slightest)

&amp;#x200B;

im that this is getting too long but the backstory is needed to understand if anyone is even gonna read this lol

&amp;#x200B;

Now , how do I stop being an ass to myself and show her how much she means to me , cause she does that to me in many ways, and move forward.....

&amp;#x200B;

P.S:

one of the main reasons that im thinking about her moving to another city is that I dont want her to miss an opportunity just to stay for me , then she would resent me...im really afraid that she will in the future

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR ;

A girl and I like each other but we both have so much issues holding us from moving forward and she had the opportunity to move to another city but she chose to stay cause she has important people here and her life is here

Prior to summer, I was still motivated to finally finish my degree (only have cornerstone project to go) but i guess i just...broke during summer internships.

Ever since then ive found everything pointless. It doesnt help that i got locked out of the category i wanted to take part in only because traffic caused me to arrive late for screening. Now im 25% in on my thesis project, hitting dead-ends here and there and have no one to help me out on the subject. Ive been delayed for 3 years so i really need to finish this now.

But now that im here...nothing. i cant. Muster up the courage to keep going further. And then I had the worst breakdown last week, starting at my paper and not being able to understand anything ive written down though ive read up on those things. It was the worst ive felt. The dumbest. The most insignificant. I just want to end it all. My friends noticed it really getting bad, so they encouraged me to get help.

I tried two hospitals yesterday. Woke up bright and early for the first one. Had troubles getting there via commute so i had to grab over and back to a drop-off point. Only to get turned down and referred somewhere else. Im short on money because i dont want my family to know. Only my brother does currently. I broke down as soon as they sent me somewhere else.

Luckily my friend kept me companyband helped me look someplace else for an affordable consultation. We found one and ended up going there. I broke down again once an attending nurse asked about what i thought was wrong. It was a breath of fresh air hearing from someone that what i was feeling wasnt overreacting. 

I got recommended meds, almost confined because i honestly answered that i still have persistent suicidal thoughts and barely anything is keeping me alive, and went home reassured after staying a while at my friend's place. I was given enough free meds to last a week and another check-up next week.

I took the meds as prescribed last evening. A whole tablet of escitalopram before bed. I didnt expect to wake up at 4am with a really upset stomach. I got up to go to the toilet, but ended up feeling like i was about to faint. I woke my brother up and asked him to carry me there. I blanked out and woke up assisted to the toilet by my aunt because my brother asked for help. It was mortifying. They told me i was cold to the touch and corpse-pale.

I spent the rest of the day lethargic. Whenever i got up from bed, i felt heavy and dizzy. My family takes it as fatigue. Only me and my brother know its the side effect of the drug. I spent the rest of the day like that. Sluggish. Slow. My thoughts were clear of negativity for the most part, but that was because it was so hard to focus on anything.

Now it's evening here again and im afraid to take the meds. I know i need to. But last night i felt like death, and i just had another breakdown because it sucks keeping this a secret from the rest of the house but knowing its for the best. I just...needed to let this out somewhere. I know it's too early to expect results and that an adjustment phase always happens, but im scared of keeping this up. I feel worse. I just...want to give up at this point. Does it even get better? Why do things feel like they're only plumetting further into the abyss?

Im sorry for shitting out a big wall of text, but i really needed to let this out somehow. One of my friends is alseep, and the other is going through some instability right now too. Any my family doesnt know and im scared of unloading too mucn on my brother. I just want to be assured that things will turn out fine after a few days, that ill be back to understanding my studies, and that the bad thoughts would shut up enough for me to get some work done. Existing is such a drag. Im so tired"

Drs. B. Visser

Vragen van het lid Kerstens &amp;#40;PvdA&amp;#41; aan de minister van Defensie over tekortschietend onderzoek naar ongewenst gedrag. &amp;#40;ingezonden 15 oktober 2018&amp;#41;.  
&amp;nbsp;    
1  
&amp;nbsp;    
Kent u het bericht ‘Onderzoek van defensie naar ongewenst gedrag schiet tekort’?   
&amp;nbsp;    
Ja.  
&amp;nbsp;    
2  
&amp;nbsp;    
Welke maatregelen gaat u nemen naar aanleiding van de conclusies van de commissie-Giebels?  
&amp;nbsp;    
3  
&amp;nbsp;    
Bent u bereid te overwegen, al dan niet gedurende een overgangsperiode, een extern meldpunt op te zetten, nu is gebleken dat een cultuurverandering binnen Defensie meer vergt dan de tot nu toe getroffen verbetermaatregelen? Zo nee, waarom niet?  
&amp;nbsp;    
4  
&amp;nbsp;    
Wat zijn de voordelen van een intern meldpunt ten opzichte van een extern meldpunt, nu is gebleken dat een extern meldpunt vooralsnog beter werkt?   
&amp;nbsp;    
In de Kamerbrief &amp;#40;Kamerstuk 35 000 X nr. 13&amp;#41; van 15 oktober 2018 ben ik ingegaan op de aanbeveling van de commissie voor het inrichten van één centraal en onafhankelijk meldpunt. Dit onafhankelijke centrale meldpunt zal worden belegd bij de Centrale Organisatie Integriteit Defensie &amp;#40;COID&amp;#41; en is begin volgend jaar operationeel. In het verlengde hiervan neemt Defensie aanvullende maatregelen om de meldstructuur te vereenvoudigen en een cultuur van transparantie en openheid binnen de organisatie te bevorderen. Daarnaast heb ik u in dezelfde brief gemeld dat ik voor het einde van 2018 met een uitgebreide beleidsreactie kom op het eindrapport van de commissie-Giebels.  
&amp;nbsp;    
6  
&amp;nbsp;    
Wat gaat u doen om de medewerkers van Defensie te overtuigen van de verbeterde werkwijze?   
&amp;nbsp;    
7  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vindt u ook dat Defensie zich extra moet inzetten om het vertrouwen van haar medewerkers terug te winnen dan wel te vergroten?   
&amp;nbsp;    
In de Kamerbrief &amp;#40;Kamerstuk 35 000 X nr. 13&amp;#41; van 15 oktober 2018 ben ik ingegaan op de concrete plannen om de sociale veiligheid binnen Defensie te verbeteren. De verdere uitwerking hiervan ontvangt u later dit jaar.  
&amp;nbsp;    
8  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ziet u in het kader daarvan de betekenis van een goede cao en bent u bereid een &amp;#40;sterk&amp;#41; verbeterd bod te doen, teneinde te komen tot een cao-akkoord waarin de medewerkers de waardering die zij verdienen ook in hun portemonnee terugzien?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Er was geen sprake van een bod vanuit de werkgever, maar van een onderhandelingsresultaat dat is bereikt na overleg tussen de werkgever en de vertegenwoordigers van de werknemers, zoals vastgelegd in het besluit georganiseerd overleg. De werknemers zijn vertegenwoordigd door de vakcentrales die het onderhandelingsresultaat hebben onderschreven. Het defensiepersoneel heeft recht op goede arbeidsvoorwaarden en een goede pensioenregeling voor militairen. Ik heb u over de uitkomst van de ledenraadplegingen geïnformeerd in mijn Kamerbrief &amp;#40;Kamerstuk 35000 X Nr. 7&amp;#41; van 5 oktober 2018.

During the questioning one reporter asked the president to comment on the “doctored” video the White House released of Jim Acosta’s confrontation with the President and his contact with a female intern.

President Trump unloaded on the dishonest hack!

**President Trump:** The taped video of Acosta? What are you talking about?…

**Reporter:** It was manipulated.

**President Trump:** All that was… Nobody manipulated it. Give me a break. See that’s just dishonest reporting. All that is is a closeup. See that’s just dishonest reporting. I watch the that, I watched that last night. They made it close up. They showed it close up. And he was not nice to the young woman. I don’t hold him to that. Because it wasn’t overly horrible. But when you say ‘doctored’ you’re a dishonest guy. Because it wasn’t doctored. They gave a close up view. That’s not doctoring.

**The video in question was first posted by journalist Paul Joseph Watson.
   
 Watson cropped the video that was re-published by the White House.
   
 The liberal media all said it was “doctored.”**

**This is MORE PROOF you can NEVER TRUST the liberal mainstream media.**

9vlqaj,3,2018-11-09,TF4F - The Business Trip,yoursissygf,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/9vlqaj/tf4f_the_business_trip/,"*TRIAL SEPARATION.* Just the thought of those two words made your stomach roil.

At first, you thought you were lucky: after all, what's more fortunate than being a lesbian couple in the first US State to recognize same-sex marriage? You and your wife had gotten your license the day after she popped the question, and both of you assumed that this was the start of a lifetime of marital bliss.

Now, twelve years later: *TRIAL SEPARATION.* Affection had turned to resentment. Comfort to disdain. Giggling to bickering. And it wasn't one-sided: she wished that you'd spend less time on your career, you wished that she'd stop whinging about the smallest details; she wanted you to make more of an effort to get to know her friends, you wished that she'd ditch that gaggle of gossipy hags altogether. She wished you'd try out some of her hobbies, and you wished she'd be more open to experimenting in bed...

And thus, *TRIAL SEPARATION.*

You decided that, ultimately, it was possible that you'd jumped into the relationship without really knowing what you wanted. You'd been dazzled by good looks and an artistic flourish and hadn't considered that such a contrast in personalities might not work out in the long-term. You thought you'd wanted an equal partner and maybe, just maybe, someone more focused on *your* happiness might have been better.

You wondered if dating might be something you should consider, keeping in mind the potentially indefinite nature of the *TRIAL SEPARATION.* But how could you meet someone? You supposed you could try a dating app, but those things were full of the desperate and deranged. You wouldn't debase yourself that way. However, perhaps your (ex?) wife was right when she said you were too career-focused. Your friendships from school had evaporated over the years, and all that left were your myriad work contacts. Being in middle management, perhaps you weren't ready to cross that professional line, but it was worth keeping an eye out...

Until you saw *the bulge*, I'd been quite beneath your notice. After all, who noticed the mousy little intern unless she forgot the creamer in your coffee? If anything, I was *trying* to escape notice: painfully shy, awkward, prone to mortified laughter at the most inappropriate moments. You suspected that if I could spend my day curled up in a file cabinet, I'd do so without the least complaint.

And so I'd blended pretty well into the background until the day you noticed *the bulge.* It was during a team meeting, helmed by low-tier coordinator Laura Vazquez. In the wake of the *TRIAL SEPARATION*, you'd been making an effort to re-assess the women around you, and Vazquez would have climbed up the listings, with her curves and risqué sense of humor, were it not for the inconvenient fact that she was straight as an arrow.

Breaking your gaze away from the presentation, your eyes wandered the room until you noticed, with some amusement, the hungry look in my blue eyes as I keenly watched Vazquez. *Poor girl. She's in for some real disappointment...* Your thoughts stopped in their tracks when you noticed it.

It jutted upward against my skirt, tenting the fabric rather conspicuously. It didn't seem exceptionally long, from the few ones you'd seen in the past, but it had a rather nice girth to it, same as the toys you'd kept an eye out for whenever you made a new purchase.

""Any questions?"" Vazquez asked, and by the time you turned your eyes back to me, *the bulge* was gone.

---

It was nice, having *the bulge* to consider rather than the *TRIAL SEPARATION.* It was really quite astonishing; you figured I must've started transitioning quite early, to be as passable as I was. You never would have suspected until now. And now that you *had* noticed, you began to notice other things about me too.

I was, for lack of a better word, *cute.* I had a petite figure that made you want to just *squeeze* me, and a round little tush that *must* have been the result of regular exercise too. And, of course, my face wasn't hard to look at either, from my soft lips, to my dimpled cheeks, to the way my thick-rimmed glasses always slid down my button nose. You even came to appreciate my hair, how lush, dense and wavy it was. How a streak of pale blonde had somehow grown among my brown bangs. It was the kind of hair you just wanted to twirl your fingers around...

A week later, you decided to pull the trigger, and damn the consequences.

""As you know, I'll be going out of state for the upcoming industry conference. As such, Vazquez will be filling in for me during my absence. Also, I'll be taking our intern, Ms. Yates, along as well. I trust you'll be able to clear up your schedule, Julie?"" With some satisfaction, you saw your trap unfold in my mind. Of course, being as timid as I was, I wouldn't *think* to contradict you in front of our colleagues, nor would I have the courage to go back on my decision once agreed. After a few seconds' hesitation, I stammered out my assent.

---

*The trip is planned, the plane tickets purchased, the hotel room booked. Due to an ""oversight"" we'll have to share a bed, but you're sure I'll understand...*

*And from there, the options are limitless: you could get me tipsy at the hotel bar, threaten to reveal* the bulge *to the rest of the office, or even wake me up with said bulge tucked somewhere wet and warm... Or simply seduce me. ;)*

*Either way, this is just the first step in pulling me into your web, making me into the perfect companion you've wanted all these years, and show your ex just what she'd been missing out on.*

*Kinks (all optional) include office harassment, orgasm control, light bondage, anal play, ass worship, long sessions of oral sex, toys, pegging, age/size gaps and twisted romance. Limits are scat and gore.*

*Let me know if you're interested! This prompt is always open!*"

Funny, I almost remember the Trump wrestling gif, featuring Trump clotheslining a CNN **logo**, was morally wrong and required an apology:

https://archive.fo/cI88X

&gt;Andrew Kaczynski / CNN / **July 5, 2017**: How CNN found the Reddit user behind the Trump wrestling GIF

&gt;Now the user is apologizing, writing in a lengthy post on Reddit that he does not advocate violence against the press and expressing remorse there and in an interview with CNN for other posts he made that were racist and anti-Semitic.

&gt;The user further apologized for calls for violence against the press in his statement on Reddit.

&gt;The Committee to Protect Journalists said in a statement this week that the tweet ""undermines the work of the media in the U.S. and makes it more dangerous."" CNN said in a statement that the tweet ""encourages violence against reporters.""

Guess rules change, huh?"

Note that, for many of these, you can already apply if you'll graduate before Summer 2019. (Also, at the end of the comment, I will list internships, which don't require even that. Yes, you can already apply for Summer 2019 internships).

 **AIRLINER MAINTENANCE ENGINEERING**

If a Boeing airliner gets damaged too severely to be fixed by simply following one of the standard repair manuals (like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBG62FkKHYk) or [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyhxExhfVic) or [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayCWSm1f9qk) or [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=788mOucDELU) or [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw-aUVa3a0U) or [this](http://www.nycaviation.com/2013/07/developing-ethiopian-boeing-787-involved-in-incident-at-london-heathrow/29564)), the airlines' maintenance facilities call up Boeing's office in Seal Beach. This was my first job at Boeing and **it's more interesting than it may sound**. Instead of just designing and analyzing parts on a computer for future airplanes, engineers design and analyze parts to patch up the damage to old airplanes that need it asap. (Each day that the airplane is sitting on the ground waiting for a repair, or getting maintenance, is hundreds of thousands of dollars of revenue that the airline is missing out on). You learn a lot about the airplane's structures and systems, about what things break and how, about how and why airplanes are designed the way they are and how this has (or hasn't) changed over the last 30 years. It's much less theoretical, much more ""when the rubber hits the road"", than most aerospace jobs. In addition, these engineers are increasingly being tapped to help Seattle folks do design and analysis for new airplane models currently in development.

 **SPACE**

Boeing's Huntington Beach facility does research into space stuff that has potential military applications. You've probably heard of the [X-37B](http://www.spaceflightinsider.com/missions/defense/u-s-air-forces-x-37b-space-plane-nears-one-year-on-orbit/) (although [not much is known about it](https://www.space.com/40227-x-37b-space-plane-200-days-in-orbit-otv5.html)) and probably not heard of the [XSP/XS1](https://spaceflightnow.com/2017/06/13/boeing-darpa-to-base-xs-1-spaceplane-at-cape-canaveral/?fbclid=IwAR3AP5TQ0qFeV87zDOyDjcjbPS4C0-wONILZrPwyLwlrA6vG6VLpU3vQDrM) (which is like a SpaceX reusable rocket except it will land like an airplane rather than vertically).

(Those two Technician positions do not require a Bachelor's degree. However, if you do have a Bachelor's degree - or if you know how to code but don't have an engineering degree - then you could get into Boeing through those positions, and hopefully become an engineer later. Becoming an engineer at Boeing is easier if you start ""from the inside"", i.e. if you already work and know people at an engineering department within Boeing).

 **SOME EXPERIENCE PREFEERED**

These are jobs that say that candidates should ideally have a couple years of experience. But if you have had an internship, worked at a lab, or if your hobbies or extracurriculars involved hands-on making stuff (design-build-fly or making your own RC airplanes, being on a solar car team, learning to fly airplanes, doing an ambitious senior project that took a lot of design and analysis and building and testing), then you probably have a decent shot.

9vlyjr,1,2018-11-09,[M4F] My new Hispanic maid.,DC_guy_throwaway,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/9vlyjr/m4f_my_new_hispanic_maid/," *Where is this bitch?*

I grumbled and tossed another pinstriped dress shirt on the bed. That one was no good either. There was lipstick on the collar and perfume still wafted up from the fabric in waves, and for a moment I’m reminded of an Asian girl with dramatic eyes whose name I’d already forgotten.

*Now that was a good night.*

I sigh loudly – more of a growl now – and glance at my watch, the heavy silver band catching the light spilling into my condo. You’re three minutes late already. I rake a big hand through my dark brown hair, and continue the hunt for a shirt that is in decent enough shape to wear into the office. There would be a new crop of interns arriving any day, and I didn’t want to poison the well by showing up looking sloppy. My phone buzzes, and the caller ID shows Front desk. The message is brief: **maid on the way up**.

“Fuck. Finally.”

The timing of arriving guests is familiar and predictable. By the time I open my front door, you should just be stepping off the elevator. I flick open the locks and try to remember what your name was.

*Maria? Sofia? Chalupa?*

I actually smiled at that last one."
9vm2tm,3,2018-11-09,"[M4A](M playing F) Older woman has affair with younger son, step son, stranger or student. Other ideas in post (futa included)",Shogun_Logan,AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/9vm2tm/m4am_playing_f_older_woman_has_affair_with/,"I am an adult looking for another 18+ year old adult for a fantasy role play.

Please have the Discord app as I prefer to chat on it because of all of its user friendly features (mainly editing posts if mistakes happen).

I'm a male but I’m looking to play as the older woman so I’m looking for someone to be the boy. I'd like the female character to be pretty much based off actress Milla Jovovich and I have a specific idea in mind for the boy but because of the new rules I'm not allowed to say his name. PM me and we can talk about it (if you don’t like the choice we could possibly change him if need be). Female character would be in her mid-30s to early 40s and male character would be around 12-15.

I was thinking of three possible scenarios (all amendable) and I’m open to any other possible suggestions.

1 - Mom/step mom is about to get married and she is in her [wedding dress](https://imageevent.com/hailtotheking/dppthrowaway13941?p=2&amp;n=1&amp;m=-1&amp;c=4&amp;l=0&amp;w=4&amp;s=0&amp;z=2) at the church waiting for the ceremony to start. The son/step son could walk in on her and confess his feelings for her and for what ever reason she decides to give into temptation and have sex with him. Maybe she tells him it has to be a one time thing to get out of his system but once she see's his surprisingly large dick she becomes obsessed with how it stretches her out.

An alternate take on this could be that the boy is some what evil and he blackmails the groom into writing a letter saying the wedding is off (perhaps he threatened to start saying he molested him) and when she finds out that her big day has been ruined he comes in to comfort her, with or with out her really wanting to have sex with him.

2 - Option two is that she is a [married woman](https://imageevent.com/hailtotheking/dppthrowaway13941?p=5&amp;b=-1&amp;m=-1&amp;c=4&amp;w=4&amp;s=1&amp;n=1&amp;l=0&amp;z=9) in a rather loveless marriage. They are fairly wealthy and the husband provides her with pretty much everything she needs...except for routine fucking. Alternatively, she could be completely single and be yearning for her next conquest (especially if it’s extremely risky). One day she comes home from [grocery shopping](https://imageevent.com/hailtotheking/dppthrowaway13941?p=47&amp;b=-1&amp;m=-1&amp;c=4&amp;w=4&amp;s=1&amp;n=1&amp;l=0&amp;z=9) and notices a moving truck next door and spots the absolutely beautiful son of the new neighbors and her [minds starts going to dark sexual places](https://imageevent.com/hailtotheking/dppthrowaway13941?p=50&amp;b=-1&amp;m=-1&amp;c=4&amp;w=4&amp;s=1&amp;n=1&amp;l=0&amp;z=9). After a while, some [light teasing](https://imageevent.com/hailtotheking/dppthrowaway13941?p=177&amp;b=-1&amp;m=-1&amp;c=4&amp;w=4&amp;s=1&amp;n=1&amp;l=0&amp;z=2) and [exhibitionism](https://imageevent.com/hailtotheking/dppthrowaway13941?p=188&amp;n=1&amp;m=-1&amp;c=4&amp;l=0&amp;w=4&amp;s=0&amp;z=9) beings to take place and one day the next door boy comes over and overs to clean her pool/mow her lawn. She gets into a [sexy bikini](https://imageevent.com/hailtotheking/dppthrowaway13941?p=172&amp;b=-1&amp;m=-1&amp;c=4&amp;w=4&amp;s=1&amp;n=1&amp;l=0&amp;z=9) and goes out to the pool to tan and gives him something to look at and she starts to notice his big dick in his shorts.

This concept is highly editable and the two of them could be made to be related instead.

3 - Kind of stole this third idea from someone else’s post but basically I'd be a [woman jogging in the park](https://imageevent.com/hailtotheking/dppthrowaway13941?p=7&amp;b=-1&amp;m=-1&amp;c=4&amp;w=4&amp;s=1&amp;n=1&amp;l=0&amp;z=9) and [getting her daily exorcise](https://imageevent.com/hailtotheking/dppthrowaway13941?p=61&amp;b=-1&amp;m=-1&amp;c=4&amp;w=4&amp;s=1&amp;n=1&amp;l=0&amp;z=9).  I would see you on a park bench by yourself or paying on a on of the athletic fields and I can't take my eyes off you.  As I get closer I can see that your shorts can barely contain your huge dick and I approach you in an attempt to get it inside me.

This idea could feature a bunch of different options. We could be complete and total strangers meeting my chance. It could piggyback of the theme of option 2 and we actually live in the same neighborhood and this is how we approach each other. I could be a mom and my son could go to the same school as you and I’ve seen you at parent teacher meeting and other school functions. Or I could be a teacher at your school and I’ve seen you walking through the halls before. Many options to be decided on this one.

So those are my three ideas but I'm willing to take any suggestions if anyone is interested. I’d also be willing to play multiple women and include a sister character or have a secret (or not so secret) girlfriend on the side. Group role play is also acceptable.

[Lingerie](https://imageevent.com/hailtotheking/dppthrowaway13941?p=181&amp;n=1&amp;m=-1&amp;c=4&amp;l=0&amp;w=4&amp;s=0&amp;z=9), latex, feet and shoes (especially platforms) are a plus. Anal, water sports, cum shots (facials and cream pies) that are larger that normal, public/risky sex, clothed sex, handjobs, squirting, sleep/wake up sex, oral sex (especially giving while the other person is busy doing something else’s like talking on the phone or playing video games with a headset on), [smoking](https://imageevent.com/hailtotheking/dppthrowaway13941?p=163&amp;n=1&amp;m=-1&amp;c=4&amp;l=0&amp;w=4&amp;s=0&amp;z=9), stomach distention/inflation, larger objects, fisting, beast, [glasses](https://imageevent.com/hailtotheking/dppthrowaway13941?p=196&amp;n=1&amp;m=-1&amp;c=4&amp;l=0&amp;w=4&amp;s=0&amp;z=9), tattoos and piercings and a lot more are all acceptable kinks in my book.

My only hard limits are snuff, gore, vore, and scat.

Here is a link to some pictures of Milla to give some visual references plus some dick pics for the boy’s genitals to be modeled after.

———————-

All the ideas above can be played as me being a dickgirl but here are some extra ideas for FUTA prompts (but could also be regular genetic female).

Like above, I’d want my character to be based off Milla Jovovich (specially the first few photo options in the link below). The other roles can also be based off actors, models or any one else you’d like to use as a visual basis. https://imageevent.com/hailtotheking/dppthrowaway13941

A) I would be the [boss](https://imageevent.com/hailtotheking/dppthrowaway13941?p=0&amp;b=-1&amp;m=-1&amp;c=4&amp;w=4&amp;s=1&amp;n=1&amp;l=0&amp;z=9) or a [high level executive](https://imageevent.com/hailtotheking/dppthrowaway13941?p=4&amp;b=-1&amp;m=-1&amp;c=4&amp;w=4&amp;s=1&amp;n=1&amp;l=0&amp;z=9) at some kind of company and I'm always [wearing](https://imageevent.com/hailtotheking/dppthrowaway13941?p=62&amp;b=-1&amp;m=-1&amp;c=4&amp;w=4&amp;s=1&amp;n=1&amp;l=0&amp;z=9 some kind of [suit](https://imageevent.com/hailtotheking/dppthrowaway13941?p=207&amp;b=-1&amp;m=-1&amp;c=4&amp;w=4&amp;s=1&amp;n=1&amp;l=0&amp;z=9) for the [most part](https://imageevent.com/hailtotheking/dppthrowaway13941?p=68&amp;b=-1&amp;m=-1&amp;c=4&amp;w=4&amp;s=1&amp;n=1&amp;l=0&amp;z=9). You’ve just started working at the same place (full employee or summer internship). I’m pretty demanding and have a bit of a temper while you’re soft spoken and fairly intimidated by me. After some time there you start hearing rumors about me and how I’m different and you become increasingly intrigued by what you’ve heard. Alternatively, I could be the one that take a great interest in your youthful body and my condition could be a total surprise to you when I make my move on you.

This scenario would have me be in my late 30s, early 40s with my new employee being around 16-24 and their gender could be male or female. If you want to go younger, pitch me an idea of the situation to explain your presence (maybe you’re the kid of an employee and you’re in the building for some reason).

B) I'm a [military instructor](https://imageevent.com/hailtotheking/dppthrowaway13941?p=1&amp;b=-1&amp;m=-1&amp;c=4&amp;w=4&amp;s=1&amp;n=1&amp;l=0&amp;z=9) at a juvenile boot camp for troubled youth and you're a real piece of work and I make it my personal goal in life to break you out of your delinquent lifestyle by any means necessary.  Maybe I single you out during P.T. and make you keep doing obstacle course runs over and over and at some point I stop you in the woods when we are alone.  Or maybe I keep you exercising well into the night and while everyone else is at the mess hall eating dinner I finally let you stop and tell you go take a shower before going to eat.  While you're in the shower I come in an join you.  Another option could be that I sneak into the barracks in the middle of the night and pull you out of bed and drag you outside and have my way with you.  You're character could be gay or bi and be openly flirting and teasing with me or it could be completely against your will.

Yet another way this could go is that I'm in another country on deployment.  You could be a local kid from a near by town or village that hangs around near the base.  I notice you one day trying to make some money by selling bootleg stuff or offering to be an interrupter but I'm more interested in another service that you may or may not be willing to give.

C) I’m a [teacher](http://imageevent.com/hailtotheking/dppthrowaway13941?p=38&amp;b=-1&amp;m=-1&amp;c=4&amp;w=4&amp;s=1&amp;n=1&amp;l=0&amp;z=9), a [counselor](http://imageevent.com/hailtotheking/dppthrowaway13941?p=39&amp;n=1&amp;m=-1&amp;c=4&amp;l=0&amp;w=4&amp;s=0&amp;z=2) or [P.E. teacher/coach](https://imageevent.com/hailtotheking/dppthrowaway13941?p=6&amp;b=-1&amp;m=-1&amp;c=4&amp;w=4&amp;s=1&amp;n=1&amp;l=0&amp;z=9) at a school. I could be a teacher you have a class in every single day or I could be someone that teaches a higher grade than yours and you’ve just seen me around before. This could go either way we me being attracted to you and making the first move or if could be the other way around. Maybe one day you notice something off with my skirt or pants, a lump that shouldn’t be there, and you want to find out more.

If I’m a P.E. teacher/coach maybe one day I’ve told everyone to get changed and I call you into my office and we have a discussion about your recent lack of effort in class. By the time we finish everyone else is gone so you hit the shower to clean up before leaving for the day while I stay in my office for a bit. You finish your shower and changing in the locker room and walk past my office. I had completely forgotten you were here so I took my dick out and started stroking it to porn on my phone. At first you’re freaked out but then you start to get excited. 

Alternatively, it could be me that goes to shower, thinking you had already left after changing. You spot me in there back first lathering my hair and then I turn and you see my large semi hard dick hanging between my legs.

This option could have me be any age between late 20s-early 40s. You could be a female or male student. Age ranges could be wide for this, 13 to early 20s. For young female students we could use girls that look like Eleven from Stranger Things, Hit-Girl from Kick-Ass, Mathilda from The Professional or any number of possibilities.

D) Final scenario is that I’m a [mechanic](https://imageevent.com/hailtotheking/dppthrowaway13941?p=3&amp;b=-1&amp;m=-1&amp;c=4&amp;w=4&amp;s=1&amp;n=1&amp;l=0&amp;z=9) at a little garage in the middle of no where. I’m the only one that works there so I’m by myself at the place. For your character you could be someone that just got their learners permit a couple of months ago and you’re freaking out because something is going wrong with the car. You’ve stopped at my garage in hopes oh getting a quick fix but you’re blindsided by the cost and you can’t afford it...so we work out another form of payment. 

Another option could be that you’re the kid of the driver and that way you can be younger if you’d like or you’re a runaway or just out playing further from home than you normally do."

:-:|
The Eagles won their bye within the division as the two active divisional opponents suffered losses in week 9 while the Eagles took a much needed break to get healthy after getting a tough win in London against the Jaguars. Doug Pederson will try to use some of his mentor’s bye week magic to come out and get another win as the Eagles return to the friendly confines of Lincoln Financial Field for Sunday Night Football. The Eagles improved their team on their week off adding WR Golden Tate in a trade with the Lions. Tate will get his first taste of the Eagles Cowboys rivalry as he tries to make an impact with his team. Look for Pederson to use Tate in a number of ways to get him involved early especially on screens and jet sweeps to put him in space, also don’t be surprised to see him returning a couple punts with Carter being released and picked up and Sproles reinjuring his hamstring. The Cowboys improved at WR as well at the deadline trading a first round pick for WR Amari Cooper. The Cowboys were able to get Cooper involved early last week with his first TD as a Cowboy, but it wasn’t enough as the Cowboys fell to the Titans 28-14 to the Titans. It was a rough game for Dak Prescott, who was sacked 5 times while giving up a fumble and throwing and INT in the endzone. Dak won’t get any reprieve as he will have face a fierce Eagles pass rush that sacked Prescott 4 times the last time they both faced off with the starters. Dak has struggled this year, but some of the blame has to be on the Cowboys coaching staff whose play calling has been predictable at times. If that trend continues expect the Cowboys offense to struggle against the Eagles defensive front especially when Dak holds onto the ball longer on average than every other QB at 2.83. The Eagles have only played 1 QB that has held onto the ball for an average longer than 2.40 seconds. That was Blake Bortles, who they sacked 4 times. The Eagles blitzed Bortles more often than other QBs, so that trend may continue on Sunday Night. These two teams usually play each other tough and sloppy, so I expect more of the same especially on a national stage.|

Eagles 0 - Cowboys 6|
In a meaningless game where the Eagles were resting many key starters after locking up the number 1 seed the week before, the game was ugly. The Cowboys struggled to get anything going vs the Eagles backups with the Cowboys making the lone score in the game when Dak Prescott tossed a 20-yard touchdown pass to Brice Butler. Dan Bailey hooked the extra point and the Cowboys denied the Eagles a franchise record 14th win.|

**Last Meeting that Meant Something**|
Sunday, November 19th, 2017|
Eagles 37-Cowboys 9|
The Eagles came out of the bye slow and did not play their best football in the first half as they trailed the rival Cowboys 9-7 at halftime Sunday night. After a halftime pep talk and some midgame adjustments the Eagles game out firing on all cylinders in the second half as they put up 30 points while shutting out the Cowboys in the second half. The Eagles had a balanced attack on offense as Carson threw for two 2 TDs and the Eagles rushing attacked put up 215 yards rushing. The Eagles defense also played well as they picked up Dak Prescott 3 times and forced a fumble while not allowing any TDs. Kicker Jake Elliott left the game early forcing the Eagles into going for it on 2 point conversions and 4th downs and backup LB  Kamu Grugier-Hill was forced into kickoff duties and did register a touchback.|

Recap from Last Week’s Games.|
:-
**Eagles** - Eagles were on Bye last week.|
**Cowboys** - [Video](http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-game-highlights/0ap3000000985136/Titans-vs-Cowboys-highlights-Week-9) –  It was the Cowboys first game since trading a first round pick in next year’s draft for former first round pick Amari Cooper. The Cowboys got him involved early as Dak hit him with his first pass of the game and connected with him in the endzone on the Cowboys second possession. The Titans started off slow as Mariota fumbled the ball on their first two possessions. The Cowboys were unable to capitalize on the second fumble as Dak Prescott handed the ball right back throwing an INT in the endzone to Kevin Byard which sparked the sluggish Titans. It was a flashback for Cowboys fans and just as disheartening as the original as Byard mimicked TO’s celebration on the star logo from 18 years ago. Following the pick the Titans were able to march down the field and tie the game at 7, force a 3 and out by the Cowboys and take the lead on the following possession. The Cowboys answered on the following possession with a 23 yard TD from Dak to Hurns to send it into halftime tied. However, it was all Titans in the second half as they added 2 more TDs and shutdown the Cowboys offense to hold on for the win 28-14.|

**Stats to Know** |
:---|
**DL Pass Rush Productivity**|
[Fletcher Cox is a beast. DeMarcus Lawrence is *also* a beast. Both could put up monster games in this coming matchup. First, I'd like to point out that only one player in the league has generated more pressure than Cox, so far, and that's Aaron Donald. In fact, the Eagles have 3 Defensive Linemen in the top 10 for total pressures created (D-Law is tied for 14th). When you look at the Defensive Linemen of just these two teams' pressure generation on a snap-weighted basis, however, Lawrence squeaks out the top spot...but then the Eagles fill out the next 4. When you consider that Dak Prescott is 34th/39 QBs with notable snaps in terms of completion percentage when under pressure, and the Cowboys will likely be shuffling OLmen's positions, due to injury, the Eagles DL should have a productive day. Unless Cooper and Beasley make the Eagles look silly, as they've shown the capability of doing, on quick throws. On the flip side, through six starts this season, Wentz has been sacked on 8.5% of his dropbacks, the ninth-worst mark in the NFL. League average is 6.5%, and last year Wentz was at 6 percent (cited from The Athletic).|
 
 
**Matchups to Watch**|
:--|
**Eagles Offensive Line vs. Dallas Defensive Front**|
Considering the nature of this season for the Eagles this is a very important matchup the Eagles need to win. For all of the Cowboys faults they do have talent on defense that is better coached than it has been in the past with some difference makers that could cause fits for the Eagles banged up offensive line. Jason Peters is playing well on a torn bicep and Lane Johnson has been playing well on a high ankle sprain. Lane likely plays this Sunday with a grade 2 MCL sprain against one of the best EDGE rushers in the NFL in Demarcus Lawrence. Lawrence is a great athlete and incredibly long and disruptive on the edge; how well he plays typically tells you how well the Dallas defense will play as a unit any given week. That'll likely be amplified this Sunday given the injuries the Cowboys have on their defensive front. So far this week, DT David Irving hasn't practiced and likely won't play this Sunday which is a huge boost for the Eagles offensive line. Randy Gregory has flashed at times and is still a work in progress but he hasn't been practicing either and will likely be out. Taco Charlton stinks so his absence likely won't be noticed. Last year Lane Johnson shut down Demarcus Lawrence in the one Cowboys game that mattered - the blowout in Dallas. This was no small feat considering how good both players are. Lane has been a man on a mission since injuring his ankle and will enter the game Sunday more banged up against a great opponent. If Lawrence is very disruptive it can have ripple effects. The Cowboys defensive front is a disciplined unit without explosive pass rushing depth but do well in run defense allowing their young LBs to flow to the ball. They will likely be without Sean Lee as per usual but Jaylon Smith appears to have returned at least close to his pre-injury form and LVE has been solid as a rookie. The Eagles offensive line has been quite good this season despite some notable high-profile mistakes - do not let the anyone tell you otherwise. They face a weakened opponent they should fare well against generally but the key will be shutting down Demarcus Lawrence.|
**Eagles Defensive Line vs. Cowboys Offensive Line**|
Remember the time Cowboys fans were hootin and hollerin that anyone can run behind that line? Good times. Now, anyone can beat that line. Times have changed in Dallas; the once invincible offensive line is suspect for a number of different reasons despite still being pretty good overall. Tyron Smith is still a good LT for the Cowboys but his nagging back problems seemed to have sapped him of some of the ability that made him truly elite. Rookie Connor Williams has been pretty poor this year despite his talent. He still has the frame of a tackle but is playing guard and getting bullied in the process. Williams is also hurt and may not play this week forcing Dallas to use weaker depth. Travis Frederick is still out battling GBR unfortunately and Zack Martin has been limited in practice this week. I say it is still a good offensive line due to the poor play of OLs in the NFL in general but it isn't near the level it has been in the past and can't hide the mistakes of it's flawed QB. Despite injuries, the Eagles defensive line it still a very disruptive force and a difference maker for the defense overall. Fletcher Cox has been playing at an All Pro level with Michael Bennett also being a disruptive force. Brandon Graham is still a very good edge player with Chris Long still being excellent in the rotation. Injuries have forced the Eagles hand a bit limiting the rotation they like to use but are still very disruptive in spite of that. On the season, Dak Prescott has a 10.53% sack rate good for worst in the NFL. Some of that is certainly on the offensive line playing worse than it has in the past with middling talent at some spots; some of that is also Dak who has no feel for pressure in the pocket whatsoever. Furthermore, Dak has an average time to throw of 2.83 seconds which is almost at the bottom in the NFL. That rate is nearly a half second longer than the average time to throw the Eagles defensive line has faced this season. This is a big opportunity for the Eagles defensive line to set the offense up in good position forcing Dak into making mistakes he is prone to make against pressure while making their already vanilla game plan even more predictable in less than ideal situations. Additionally, the defensive line should be able to feast on an offensive line that is struggling with consistency and predictability in the run game. Ezekiel Elliott is still an elite RB but isn't nearly as dominant a rusher as he can be thanks in large part to simple offensive designs with poor OL play. Assuming no schematic changes for the Cowboys offense in this game, everyone knows what they are going to do. The Eagles have the defensive line to disrupt the entire Cowboys offensive game plan and can go a long way in ensuring a second NFCE win on the season.|
**Eagles Offensive Weapons vs Cowboys Secondary**|
One area where the Cowboys have shown some real improvement is in the secondary thanks in large part to Kris Richard joining the staff from the Seahawks. He had the bright idea of moving Byron Jones to cornerback from safety since he saw he was obviously better suited for that role. Why it took as long as it did for the Cowboys to make that change I'll never understand; Jones immediately started playing well outside and has been one of the best CBs in the NFL this year. He isn't flawless but he overall athletic ability allows him to be sticky in coverage versus anyone. One area to his game where he seems to struggle is with physicality from Wide Receivers. He can be bodied at times. Chidobe Awuzie is another CB for the Cowboys who has grown as a player from year one to year two. Jourdain Lewis is another young and talented corner. The unit as a whole hasn't been great in pass defense but it is more talented than it has been in some time. The Eagles have an elite QB in Carson Wentz; the addition of Golden Tate to a a good receiving group that includes two excellent TEs should help bring out the best in the offense. Tate will allow Agholor to be a little more of a downfield threat than he has been to date this season while opening up the underneath for Wentz. Zach Ertz is having a monster season and is always open. Dallas Goedert is having a good rookie campaign for the Eagles this season. Alshon Jeffery has been the reliable playmaker outside Eagles fans have craved for. This Cowboys defense can be beat through the air and has been on a few occasions this year. It's not an easy coverage scheme to move the ball against but the Eagles have the weapons to take advantage of them, especially at tight end.|
**Eagles Secondary vs Cowboys Passing Offense**|
This is a key matchup for the Eagles largely due to the play of the unit as a whole this season coupled with the myriad of injuries the secondary has faced. The Cowboys weapons as a group is really uninspiring but the addition of Amari Cooper has made this matchup a little trickier. There is no denying that trading a first round pick for Amari Cooper was very shortsighted and pretty stupid. Especially when you consider the Cowboys are actually a middling team with poor coaching. Despite that, Cooper does have the talent to at least be good for the Cowboys and flashed that ability last week against the Titans. Has Cooper been the elite receiver he was drafted to be? No, but he's still quite good and can be a problem for the Eagles secondary that has been up and down this season. The Eagles will be without Jalen Mills and likely Sidney Jones this week. Rasul Douglas will get his first start this season. Douglas was up and down when he came in for Mills against the Jags but still flashes the ball skills that made him a fun prospect to study. Darby had a rough early season for the Eagles but has played quite well the last several weeks and will need him to do that again. It is difficult to project who will play in the slot for the Eagles this week. Being down a number of bodies is far from ideal for the secondary but this should still be a favorable matchup outside of Amari Cooper. Dallas doesn't have any tight end worth mentioning. Dallas doesn't also use Elliott as a receiver nearly enough. Cole Beasley is limited receiver but effective in his role. This is a matchup the Eagles need to win consistently given the favorable opponent. The Cowboys just have little in the way of game changing weapons.|

9vmtx8,1,2018-11-09,Everything feels muted,StillAdvice,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/9vmtx8/everything_feels_muted/,"I'm not sure what produced *me*. It's the age old question of nature vs nurture, am I haunted by my past, things I can barely remember, things I believe I've gotten over but actually haven't, am I just genetically predisposed to neurosis, or worse yet do I have a bad attitude? Would someone else have done better than me? Maybe. 

Looking back I see a steady breakdown, a slow loss of motivation, small things feeling like massive blows. At the same time I see correlations between relapsing on amphetamines and strong motivation, a feeling like I could overcome anything with the sense of determination and disgust right after coming down from a high, promising myself never to do it again, or the gut-wrenching feeling of screwing up a relationship and resolving to work out and be better. 

People will probably tell me I'm depressed and there's an element of truth in that, psychiatrists have diagnosed me with depression, OCD and anxiety, they prescribed me with anti-depressants and beta blockers, but I don't think it's so simple. The anti-depressants didn't work and I stopped after a week because the side-effects were intolerable. There's an environmental component to depression, factors people have very little sense of control over, one of them being the lack of control some of us have over our own lives. There's a commonly touted social narrative which says that everything that goes wrong in one's life is their responsibility, so when things are spiraling out of control, people don't just accept it, they desperately try to hang on despite the futility of their actions.

Depression rates have been increasing; it could be environmental toxins, the technologically driven atomization of society, dispossession of workers or unattainable standards of achievement being broadcast to all of us through social media. All these factors have one thing in common, they erode our sense of control. Today so much action is contingent upon permission from authority, from the institutions that manage everything from the norms of human interaction to the environment, the nuclear family, the workplace, the neighborhood and the nation. To be clear, I'm not talking about our interdependencies as a species. While nature, both external and internal, presents a constant source of struggle (being rejected by people and excluded from groups to crops failing to grow) we have posed additional constraints upon ourselves, or rather those in power have. Constraints that some would claim serve to preserve humanity and support societal growth according to a set of fixed standards; I disagree, ""humanity"" in this context is an abstraction that ironically serves to exclude anyone who diverges from the norm, oppositional defiance is classified as a psychological disorder. It creates a meta-narrative that reinforce power. I'm not going renounce personal responsibility, genetics or mere contingency in my own personal growth, but I know I wouldn't be here if I could just go off and farm the land. 

I was hospitalized for mental health issues twice after going through intense periods of suicidal ideation, anxiety and obsessive thoughts. I attempted suicide twice in college, but both were half arsed attempts that functioned more as exercises in self pity than real attempts at suicide or even calls for help since I was and still am too ashamed about my mental health to be open about it. The ""serious"" mental health issues began after periods of drug abuse involving weed and amphetamines that I was using in order to escape real life, a habit that was immediately tied to my inability to secure a junior year internship but possibly more deeply connected to other events I'll cover later. At least that's how psychologists want to see it. It doesn't feel that way though, I've been able to bounce back, suffering has always been tied to the immediate issue at hand. I can still feel happy, excited and despite everything, have a strong appreciation for life. I can eat, exercise and do complicated tasks, but two things stick out, waking up is a struggle and simple administrative tasks completely immobilize me. I'm not writing this in a fit of depression, I'm writing it to understand and document.

The nuclear family unit is a social and a legal institution historically tied to the patriarchy, my family lived in a country where my mother wasn't authorized to work, didn't have access to a social safety net and therefore was unable to independently support herself. She also had little family support to fall back on (without judgement and hostility) and I come from a cultural minority that discriminates against divorcees. When I look back I had a pretty normal early childhood, we were fine financially speaking. However, over the years my dad was always absent and I much later found out he was cheating on my mum. I still got to know him and developed a close bond, but there was always something lacking. He was also abusive to my mum and my brother and I. It was a mixed bag, sometimes things were perfectly fine, often for months on end. Other times it was a nightmare. It's difficult to put into perspective because there were so many good periods interspersed with the bad. 

The real fights started when I was in elementary school. I haven't told anyone about this part of my life because I know what the response is going to be; ""all parents fight,"" that's what my mum used to tell me too. Well, not like this. My dad used to beat the crap out of her, the fights would last for hours and hours, she'd sometimes smash things in anger, injuring herself in the process and I was always there to see it happen. He once punched her leg almost fracturing a bone, I was woken up in the middle of the night to call the ambulance. A few times she went to the balcony and threatened to jump, it wasn't quite high enough for her to die, but it was still scary. Another time I remember her threatening to harm herself with broken glass. There was further self-harm involved somewhere along the line and overtime it was the frequency of these incidents that got to me. 

She eventually came to terms with the kind of person my dad was and I stopped caring, previously having tried to stop the physical abuse and shouting. The fights calmed down since she stopped challenging his authority. It's weird but I know he cared about her deeply and she did too, they had a relationship despite the abuse, as fucked up as it sounds. This family shit is complicated. Today, I don't *feel* traumatized by those incidents but maybe it's an explanatory variable at a subconscious level. My day used to beat my brother and I up too, my brother getting most of the abuse and he's doing better than me. Hell he tried to beat me up this morning leading to an intense bout of emotions that I managed to rationalize, anyhow I can defend myself now (he's 6'3 and I'm 5'11, which is weird since we're ethnically Japanese). Overall, I still look back at my childhood with fondness.

School life was also a mixed bag. Of course I was relentlessly bullied over various periods, these kinds of stories always involve bullying. I often repress that part of my school life, I've never mentioned it to anyone because it makes me feel ashamed. I have a hard time explaining why, I think it's because I don't want to seem weak, something something toxic masculinity, yeah I have it in spades. I even held it back from the therapists. I wasn't a loner though, the bullying periods were short and intense and most of my time at school was fine. My parents used to emphasize achievement in school, in those years I developed an inferiority complex in academics and sports because of the intensely competitive environment, probably not a huge deal, but it's something that affects me even now. It wasn't just my parents, everyone emphasizes the rat race, I can feel people's satisfaction when I tell them what I'm doing with my life, their smirks, knowing they're winning because that's all that matters. We can hurt each other in subtle ways, through expectations in addition to a generalized lack of empathy. Even so, I follow the predetermined path, often resentfully, spending hours crying and engaging in self-harm because of anxiety about college apps, but part of me enjoyed the competition, I did pretty well in school and sports and got a scholarship to study in the US, which was nice. 

Another common source of trauma is relationships, attraction is something imposed on us by nature. That's kind of of how I look at it now at risk of sounding like the ""gamer"" meme. For some reason relationships affected me more than they should have. Something something dependence on external validation rather than an internal sense of self worth, yeah sure, that's something I've struggled with, not so uncommon in this day and age. But it goes beyond that, I used to get obsessed, I had enough validation from others girls, but I went through a brief intense period of depression involving suicidal thoughts after getting rejected by a girl I liked in high school. This pattern continued in college after dating a girl for 4 months she cheated on me, I calmly broke it off, not wanting to give her the satisfaction of knowing I care, but inside I was pretty broken up. The last episode was probably the worst, I fell hard for a good friend and that kind of changed things, I was in deep and it was my fault that everything got fucked up. After flirting and her directly expressing interest, I managed to fuck it up. I'd rather not go through the whole thing because it makes me cringe so hard. 

There's a standard for getting over people within a certain time allotment, but that hasn't happened. I'm not on any social media, went no contact and sometimes even convince myself I'm over her. I put up a front pretending I don't think about her, people would think I'm a fucking weirdo if I admitted that I'm still kind of broken up over it. Thinking about her today doesn't make me feel depressed though, just exasperated, like I missed out on something that could've been great. Overall, I haven't had a big issue with sex, I just feel empty after it's all over and would rather not due to the risk of catching an STD. In the months after I fucked it up, graduated and started work I went through a bit of a phase that involved some self-harm but it passed. 

In college I also developed a drug addiction. I started using marijuana and hard amphetamines and eventually began abusing both in order to cope with underlying insecurities, eventually developing an addiction. Junior year was a haze. In the end I was hospitalized twice. I tried to quit but also started abusing prescription benzos in that period and even now I occasionally relapse. I suffer from post-acute withdrawals that make me feel like I have brain damage sometimes. I can't think, I literally become stupider. Thankfully that has eased up, it's coming up to 4 years now and I can think a lot more clearly, but because I've relapsed dozens of times it's still here. One thing I've noticed is that relapsing uplifts my mood and has helped me realize something; the constraints posed by history are literally all in your head and that a lot of what I'm experiencing may not be down to history at all but simply withdrawals. I know I can do better if I can overcome it permanently and allow my brain to heal. 

Another factor I think I might be repressing is my mother's death. She developed cancer in my senior year. The disease lasted for a year until she finally passed away. I was living in America and she told me she'd be around for longer and that I shouldn't risk potentially loosing my job (which was nightmare to get and also paid pretty well) and my ability to stay in America in order to travel when things seemed to get worse. However I realized I'd regret not visiting forever if I put it off and was able to use family leave to visit her. At the same time, my boss constantly hounded me, eventually setting a deadline, saying I had to be back before a certain date whether she was alive or not. She passed away before the deadline, but it left a bad taste in my mouth. I returned to the US and between drug cravings, running into that girl a few times and in all honestly not having my mums expectations to motivate me anymore, quit my job, not being able to take the 10-12 hour days. A standard case of burnout. I took some more classes before being forced to leave the country. 

Recently I developed health anxiety. I was convinced I was dying, came from nowhere really, I had some medical procedures and turns out I'm fine. But I realized I don't want to die, suicidal thoughts in my opinion are, not for all, but for some, closer to an expression of raw despair than any true desire to die. Statistically speaking almost everyone who seriously attempts suicide mention regretting their choice in the final moments. So I want to live and I value life. I'm alive and some people my age (23) don't even have that luxury. I know my reasoning is fallacious, the fact that it could be worse doesn't invalidate the experiences of those who suffer. I just personally find solace in this way of thinking especially after having read the mature accounts of so many who're dying. 

So now I'm back with my abusive dad and grandma. I have no friends, my dad sometimes abuses me verbally and physically and I spend all day on the internet talking to people in chatrooms. Seems bad on paper, but it's alright. After a few months of being jobless I've finally got a boring, soul crushing office job, I found getting the paperwork together to be a huge challenge, *I'm still not sure what it is*, people give me weird looks when I describe it. I think I'd find complex math easier than pushing paper. It's been 2 months and I've only just gotten the documents together, the HR woman hates me. I'm grateful though, life is kind of muted these days, calmer and more stable. Things used to more intense and colorful, emotions would drive me to heights of elation and despair. Now I can look forward to new anime series, books, chatrooms and Twitch Starcraft.

9vn8g1,0,2018-11-09,Unsure about breaking up with long distance BF,notbbkitty,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9vn8g1/unsure_about_breaking_up_with_long_distance_bf/,"I created a throwaway for this since my bf knows my reddit account even though he himself doesn’t have one. 
 

Me(21F) and my(21M) bf have been together for the last 2 years. We knew each other from middle school but had lost contact over the years.

The relationship started long distance since we are both international students. I’m in France and he’s in Russia. I had a hard crush for two years before this so I was a bit hesitant when we first started dating, thinking it was too rushed. He comes to visit me once a year and we see each other over the summer.

I’ve been feeling weird around him for a while, and some things he has done has been batting an eye. He started talking about our future family and our marriage as soon as we started dating. I first brushed it off since he was newly out of his on again off again long distance relationship but later I confronted him about it. He was sad and a bit squeamish about it saying that he was hurt and he cna’t imagine himself with anyone but me. This might feel sweet to some but I thought it was stupid, delusional and kinda creepy so asked him to not say stuff like that. Sadly, we have this convo every few months because « he can’t help himself ».

The first time he came to visit me, he tried to rush into intimacy and I told him I needed time, bc even though we were together for 4 months I hadn’t seen the guy for 6 years. He respected my request but after we became intimate, we had a « discussion » on how he feels bad about not being my first while I’m his. He says he ought to ask me out in middle school and this wouldn’ t have been a problem. He always finds a way to blame himself btw.

The first summer we spent together was fine but we ended up spending too much time with his family and their family friends who would call me the new bride of the family, while I on the other hand have no plans for getting married before the end of my studies.

Last year when he came to visit, he would always say that he will walk with me in the morning to school and wait for me in the library while he was there. Every day he would say stuff like this and everyday he would sleep, play video games and sleep again. It wasn’t like he wasn’t helping me around the house, and I encouraged him to stay at home because he seemed like he needed a break (I suspect he has some sort of depression due to his uni and his father) but I wanted him to spend time with me when I came home for lunch to see him, which he did not. When he was buying his return ticket, he bought it for a monday when I had asked him to buy it for sunday so that I would have time to study. Monday morning rolls around, we had slept for only 3 hours, I had 5 hours of ab and 4 hours of lectures in front of me. I dropped him of to the station and left at 7.45 for my 8am class and he was bitter that I wouldn’t sacrifice my lab for 30 minutes with him. I was so pissed that I could’ve ended things right then and there. I wish I did, it would make things so much easier.

Last summer was rough, he had an internship overseas so I only saw him for a month. I was hoping we could go on a holiday together but he told me it was too expensive and we stayed in the city instead. I was with my dad (in another city) beforehand and he was on a holiday with his parents. We agreed to meet up when we both returned. I asked him to come back to my house at least so that we could have a little holiday at least since my mom was away. I come back, he picks me up, we go to my house, have a quickie and go to his house for breakfast. Not 2 hours of seeing each other and he does it his way. When I confronted him he was trying to guilt trip me saying he wanted to spend time with his parents and he told me he felt guilty afterwards.

His mom found some condoms and tried to confront me about it, which I found awfully awkward but I joked about it and that’s that.

He’s being going through a lot lately, he put on 20+ kilos, anxiety, depression and uni hasn’t been good tı him at all. I was in a rough shape too. I slacked off the first 3 semesters but I’m trying to get into studying again. I never went out or had many friends because I would come home so that we could talk but now I’ve been avoiding talking to him for over 2 months. Anytime I tell him that I’m in the library, he tells me how he’s not studying and how he’s going to fail again.  
 

I tried to help him many a time, he still is going through stuff and I don’t wan’t him to suffer. We always end up fighting when we’re together but we have our good times as well and he does encourage me to an extent, but the cons stand out like a sore thumb. I genuinely did love him for a time, but it doesn’t feel that way anymore. I have dependency issues and stayed a while too long with my previous so’s and became too attached even though I didn’t even like them that much. And I cocoon myself into my house with depression post breakup and I fear that I might go back to my bad habits if we do separate.

We both have different dynamics in our homes ; his parents have been together for the last 25 years, with their fare share of arguments and resentments, while mine divorced 13 years ago. Most of my moms friends are either remarried or divorcées while he has married people all around him. We discussed this once and he told me we could work this out. Work what out, we aren’t even out of college yet let alone be married.

I tried to talk with him about my feeling of how things were lately, he told me that I should leave him, that he will be sad but never forget me and never find someone who understands him like I do. I called bs on him but somehow we ended up staying together. He told me, a couple of times now, that he loves me so much that I can never love him/give attention to him as much as he does me.

I was ok with the way things are for the last month since we weren’t talking much if at all before he texted me the name suggestion of our future children. Just like that, out of the blue. I mean, why ?

By the looks of it, he will get his dads job and would want to settle down in the future and that may be why he’s talking about marriage and kids alot, but I don’t even know if I’m in the right major, let alone knowing where I’ll live or where I’ll work.   
 

I was thinking that if this weren’t long distance, we wouldn’t even last half a year. 

Thank you so much if you read it this far. What do you think I should do ?"

9vnjgw,203,2018-11-09,Producer Letter - Definitive Edition,oneden,AlchemistCodeGL,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlchemistCodeGL/comments/9vnjgw/producer_letter_definitive_edition/,"Dear Money,

In lieu of the recent events, it came to our attention, that many of you were displeased about the recent changes. We couldn't believe it at first, but apparently there is still some confusion regarding the direction of this game. But let's do this one step at a time.

1) Hard Quests

Your insistence on getting shards for older units so you can stay competitive is genuinely vexing. No, we didn't accidentally misjudge how fast units were released and how little time you have to farm those. However, since Nensous and Kaigan are around the corner, we don't even need to rely on Hard Quests to pressure you into spending money for dupes anymore. But since we're firm believers of the philosophy that you annoying people require a sense of pride and accomplishment™, we won't increase the rates of hard quests too much. And no, we won't say outright what ""at least four HQs"" the month mean. Ambiguity is the salt of our business (like your tears). Let's move on.

2) The six word horror story aka No more 3-step guaranteed banner pulls

You have to understand, that this was harder for us than it was for you. We had to wake up the intern to make the appropriate changes happen and Kevin gets quite grumpy when we do that. His name isn't actually Kevin, but we don't care enough about him to actually learn his name; But what we DO care about is our quarterly fiscal reports and our bonuses. Sadly (for you), we had to axe this concept, because the game became too rewarding and fun for too many without paying enough. 

So we replaced this already deliberately frustrating experience that was diluted and obfuscated with some actual clunker units with... Summon Coins! Frankly, you whales spent too little for our taste, so we thought about how to raise the ante and came up with the ingenious plan to devalue your free gems even further by using paid banners that share awfully similar designs with older banners to trigger your basic instincts. And since we openly hate pact players, consider this our middle finger to you, you smug bastards. Speaking of pacts, won't you buy our anniversary pact? It only costs three times the regular one for just twice the amount of gems! What a steal!

3) Elite and Ex+ Balance

Numerous players have complained - much to our annoyance - that they dislike one of our newly introduced features, that consists of blocking 95% (and always your collab units) of the character roster from taking part in the quests, while claiming that ""it pushes players into spending"" calling it a ""predatory and egregious practice"". The moment we learned about these allegations, I personally sprung into action to rectify these dishonest accusations aimed at us. 

We did SO much more than this! 

We split up rewards from regular EX quests and ramped up the difficulty, which didn't only devalue the rewards in their sum, but also made progress for the casual player more challenging for less bounty. But since we're not monsters, we're considering giving you a heads-up which units we'll let you play with. Maybe.

But there is even more!

Many players were elated, when we released our most recent global exclusive unit - Roxanne. Powerful and beyond broken, she made even Gilgamesh (more like Girlymesh) appear grounded and balanced. But since she's so powerful, we deemed it only fair to start balancing the harder quests around Roxanne's strength and beyond that. Some of you might have noticed already, but many enemy units (from now on) possess an outrageous amount of Jewel Regen, Health, Attack and Defences that ruin any semblance of balance and strategic gameplay. 

You're welcome.

And with all that said, I want to close this letter, by thanking you all for the first - and likely last - anniversary of this game. We'll keep handing out some genuinely lukewarm and lackluster collaboration rewards to show our appreciation for you throughout this month. 

P.S: Stop giving us nicknames like ""Scumi"", ""Bob-Gumi"" or ""Gimu"". We're very sensitive and other companies have started picking on us. For that alone we've nixxed the Skip Tickets from the Secret Shop and affordable unit skins.

9vo2gm,1,2018-11-09,I Don't Want to do Anything,type4000diabetes,depression_help,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/9vo2gm/i_dont_want_to_do_anything/,"I'm female and I am 21 for reference for this.

So lately, the past few months, it has been so incredibly hard to do anything. I still manage to go to classes and do important assignments like my papers. Somehow, I don't know how. I however find it so hard to do any readings for any of my classes unless I absolutely need to for my papers. Even doing my papers has been so difficult for me to do. 

The past two years in college I was always able to do all my readings and papers. I was sad too, but I still was able to do all of it.

But now, it is just so hard. I also have to juggle two jobs and an internship. I think I can handle the jobs and internship fine, but my college courses are just a struggle.

I find myself having a mental breakdown once a week. Usually I have a mental breakdown once a semester but now it's getting more frequent.

I feel so unmotivated, and most of all, I feel so defeated. I think defeated is probably the key word to how I feel. I am starting to feel more...I guess I just don't want to get out of bed in the morning. There has been an increase with the number of days where I just want to sleep and do nothing else. Today being one of them. I feel like I am forcing myself and dragging myself everyday to just go to school. 

I also find myself eating more and more. And I am working to fix that habit, but still, I find it just hard to do anything. I feel like the only joy I get out of the day is by eating. And I know I can't keep on doing it, so, I am fixing that. 

If I didn't have my family, I think I would have ended my life a long time ago. I guess I find myself thinking the only reason I am still living and not ending it is because I do not want to burden my family like that. That would be horrible of me to do. Especially to my younger siblings.

While I think I should talk to someone, I feel like...because this is something so common for people to go through...I should just deal with it. People usually go to therapy because something bad has occurred that caused it. For me, there wasn't anything too horrible that happened, so I feel that it isn't fair for me to go. And I always feel...like it would show that I am weak if I did go. I've had this insecurity where I always felt I was inferior and weak, and I don't want to be that. I would like to believe I am independent and I can handle everything on my own. So to go...I just don't want to be seen as weak. And that I feel that I don't need it. Because like I said there are worse things people go through that I haven't. So I would feel horrible to go.

And I am still dealing with a breakup. I was the dumper, so I feel this guilt and I know that I was the toxic one in the relationship. And there are times where I want to express how sorry I am but I can't because things will just be worse. I think also if I didn't try hard enough. But at the same time I felt miserable the last few months of the relationship...so it is hard to deal with. It is better now than a month ago, but still I deal with it to some level. Like a subtle pain in my chest, usually.

Anyway, thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope I explained myself okay.

9voofd,1,2018-11-09,A guy friend sent me pics of himself,ewwwhypeachpie,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/9voofd/a_guy_friend_sent_me_pics_of_himself/,"TL;DR: A guy [28M] who works in the same company as me [33F] sent me some unsolicited non-sexual pics of himself. Is this normal male behavior and what could his motivations be?

Earlier in the summer, I [33F] trained an intern [27M] for a month at my job. He was a fun and pleasant person to work with but I didn't notice any flirtatious behaviors or at least anything that I was aware of. Anyway, after the month of training he moved on to a different position in the department and he still occasionally works at the same building I'm at. We still occasionally see each other and chat with each other when we run into each other at work. Again, I haven't noticed anything out of the ordinary or out of the platonic realm.

For his job, he recently had to spend 1 month at another job site. I don't want to give specifics to protect my anonymity but the job site was pretty cool and he was really excited about having the opportunity to work there. Before he left that site, he emailed me some pictures of him posing at the work site. They were not dick pics lolz. I also didn't ask him to send the pics.
At first I didn't think much of it because I thought he was just excited to share his excitement of working there. But then some of my male friends have told me that guys usually don't send girls pics of themselves like that on texts or emails unless they're looking for specific attention and that it's different than them just posting those pics on Facebook, etc.

Also the last time I ran into him, which was 1 week ago, he touched me on my upper arm when thanking me for helping him with the training earlier this year. His eyes were also noticeably dilated, which I know could be a sign of attraction but could be due to the lighting. We have drug testing here so probably not that.

Anyway, I'm pretty dense when it comes to these matters and there have been multiple times in my life I have not realized when a guy friend or coworker likes me or is trying to get my attention. You would think that I would have learned by now... Is it normal for guys to send pictures of themselves to send non-sexual pics to girls? Also in case anyone is wondering, yes I find him attractive and would definitely date him if he were interested.  Is there any other way I could find out if he’s interested?

&amp;#x200B;

My wife is becoming a pharmacist in USA and has recently cleared her FPGEE exam (this is for pharmacists who have studied abroad. Now she has to give TOEFL before she can start her pharmacy internship. The problem is that in order to get your pharmacy certificate you need to pass your TOEFL exam with a certain score in each section as below.

 

* Reading: 22
* Listening: 21
* Speaking: 26
* Writing: 24

My wife gave her exam and cleared listening (23)  and writing (25) but in speaking she got a 23 and in Reading she got a 13. She only studied for two weeks. I feel she can improve her speaking with more practive and focus since he spoken English is pretty decent. But our biggest concern is her reading score which is really low and she has a problem answering questions under limited time.

 I have been trying to push her to prepare again but it looks like she is freaked out by the short amount of time and is pretty disheartened that her reading score is this low. She says she has tried to self study using various online resources (paid/unpaid) and improve her reading score but it will not improve much.  She is thinking about giving up on the TOEFL exam itself which upsets me because she cleared her FPGEE which is a beast of an exam.

I am thinking that she needs a dedicated tutor who can explain on how to improve her reading and have her practice and be used to handling the reading section under the given time limit. Does anyone know any good TOEFL tutors online or in person? We live in New Jersey. I have tried searching but I cannot find any tutoring services focused on TOEFL prep for adults or any solid tutors who can focus on  her getting the scores she needs.

&amp;#x200B;

Much thanks.

9voxaq,1,2018-11-09,"Broke up with my [22M] girlfriend [22F], she's now dating my best friend [22M] now and I feel lonely",Tuzokun,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9voxaq/broke_up_with_my_22m_girlfriend_22f_shes_now/,"Sorry if I couldn't express myself clearly, I sometimes have problems putting my thoughts to words. There is a tldr at the bottom of this post if it is too long to read. But please read it through and let me know if I am just feeling petty.

&amp;#x200B;

My girlfriend from class broke up with me as soon as the summer started. I went back to my hometown over the summer whereas she stayed in the campus with a bunch of friends  (my best friend, let's just call him ""the bro"", included) to do research internships. I'm not sure of the details but she probably got close with my best friend during that period and they started dating. 

&amp;#x200B;

Three of us, together with all other classmates are in this transfer program where we would spend our final year of study in a foreign country. So fast forward a few months, we travelled to this country and are studying together again. I should mention that the three of us usually spend time together with a circle of friends. It is these friends that I actually became close with and spend most, if not all, of my time together. And here in this new place, we are staying quite close with each other (we are in the same university based accommodation), and would hang out quite often.

&amp;#x200B;

After the breakup I feel used by my ex and wouldn't want her in any part of my life ever again. Also, I couldn't accept having a ""bro"" who goes after my ex right after my breakup, no matter what the circumstances might be. The thing is, this ""bro"" is a really outgoing person and he socialises well with people. Whereas as more of an introvert myself, I often kept quiet myself and only listens to other people's conversation whenever we hang out. I would really avoid seeing my ex with the ""bro"" at all, but whenever there is an occasion all three of us are invited (since it is the same group of friends) and I would go anyway to spend time with the other friends.

&amp;#x200B;

Now that a few months have passed I am sure that my friends noticed that I am not in good terms with the two, so they would avoid asking me out when the two of them were there. And the two are staying closer with the other friends so whenever they made plans together like going for a trip or checking a new restaurant out, it is always my ex and the bro to know first. So most of the time I am excluded from having fun with these friends. 

&amp;#x200B;

I should also mention that I have closed myself out from my friends for feeling too devastated and embarrassed from the breakup. A few friends actually wanted to talk to me at that time but I put up the tough act and refused to talk. Now none of them mention about the breakup to me at all, probably because they have heard about it from the other two. Now I really regret doing that because it feels like no one actually understood the story from my side. And it made me feel like my friends are more close to the my ex and the ""bro"" now, they the two of them are sucking my friends from me.

I have been telling myself that it is fine and they are still my friends, but the more I try to get close to them again, the more left out I realise I am. Now I am really struggling, are these friends worth having, or should I start out new and try to make other friends? And if I were to join the group back, what is the good way to start? I never had issues with making friends until lately. It has been really difficult for me to avoid the two while having fun, and I don't feel as ""belong"" when I am with other people than with this bunch of friends.

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr - Girlfriend broke up with me, currently dating my best friend and they are always hanging out with the group of friend I was with. Now I don't know if I should 'force' my way back in."

I dont see any 3rd world villagers coming up with excuses about having families

&amp;#x200B;

My reply to him:  Hello. I'm a third world villager turned immigrant (gasp!). I'm childfree, sterilized, and I have a PhD and well paid career (no, I didn't steal it from anyone) in the country I migrated to. The most common reasons we ""village people"" have children are because: hyperconservative Christianity was enforced by former colonists, lack of birth control access, and traditional misogyny. Some of us, not just myself, are fighting to have access birth control and would rather not suffer the risks of maternal death if it can be helped too. 

&amp;#x200B;

\---

 I feel very very lucky to have the chance to get a job abroad and stay long enough in a progressive country to be sterilized. I will never stop being grateful that I was able to have my rights and bodily autonomy respected here in Europe. I know some friends back there who never intended on having children but have had their birth control fail.

 As abortion is illegal where I came from and adoption is nigh impossible, I have seen some CF souls crushed by the fact their lives will never be the same. It's actually only when I shared I got sterilized to some, that they shared to me how they wish they had access to the same things I have, things I believe all people should have. This is why I donate to NGO charities that would help other women gain access to proper and constant birth control.

It pisses me off when people assume everyone from developing countries are just stupid breeders that have 20 children just because they can. Some do want big families, because that's what they've been told by the LifeScript that they should want, but not many want to get pregnant over and over again when childbirth is more dangerous there than in first world countries. A friend quit studying nursing when she has had to witness 5 women die in her internship.

Many of my CF friends would love to add themselves to the statistic of being behind the falling birthrate if they can. Those that aren't wish to have just 1 and not more."
9vp5mr,3,2018-11-09,[Event] A Proper Finale,MrWrenington,Geosim,https://www.reddit.com/r/Geosim/comments/9vp5mr/event_a_proper_finale/,"In a way, he was the only real remanent of the DPRK. Her military had surrendered. Her people had been pacified, merely wanting to live their lives. Her scientists had fully defected to the PRK. The dream of a true Korea was on her last limbs. Only one man really hoped anymore. After all, a United Korea had been accomplished, despite the legitimacy of her truth. 

In a way, he both regretted everything and nothing he did during his time. From an intelligence agent to an upstart party member to the most powerful man on the peninsula, to here, an exile that nobody knows or cares about, left to rot in his own devices. It was by no means a poor life. Seoung was a generous man to him after all. But it was an empty life. What was the point of living if one could not make the world any better? 

The minister took a puff from a PRK brand cigarette, which he found to be distasteful compared to those of Korea. Fortunately, in his age he was unrecognizable. Not a soul recognized him other than those who had aged with him. The bus ride was short and quick. He managed to get a plane ticket and a few other items and he was quickly boarded onto the plane. The PRK had improved a lot in recent years, although it was still quite poor compared to much of the West. 

The pilot gave his speech in both Korean and Khamer, of which he spoke both, although he cared little. His plane would make it to his destination, that he was sure of. And of course, it did, as if it was destiny. He had arrived back in Pyongyang. 

The city was still suffering, despite the war having ended over ten years ago. With a large portion of the city having been rigged to explode, along with the urban combat that had accompanied the occupation of the city, there was still a large amount of rubble being picked up. An odd quiet had captured the city since his leave, and he found it to be quite calming. Children played in the rubble while mothers scolded them for their unsafety. Occupation forces had left the city years ago, and the population had essentially integrated into the South surprisingly peacefully, with all who never would fleeing to the Communist states of Southeast Asia, such as Vietnam, or Kampuchea.

&gt; Still home.

He sighed and began his green mile, visiting all of that importance. The monument to party founding had been all but destroyed in urban combat, with only the hammer remaining intact. He thought to himself that it was fitting, given that neither the sickle or brush would see much use in the coming years. Only the hammer for reconstruction. 

The Juche Tower had been completely decimated by combat and bombings. The Mansu Hill Monument was similar. The pattern followed for all but the reunification monument, which had somehow remained standing. Korea was finally united, and in a way, it was fitting that it still stood. Of course, there was one last place left in Pyongyang to visit. He was not done until he could see there. Then he could rest. 

Fitting that the last place he would visit would be Mansudae Assembly Hall. It was, after all, the location of his bunker. Of course, nobody knew this. The building had been bombed into ashes at the end of the war and nobody bothered to capture it. He walked into the rubble with ease, and quickly found the entrance to the bunker. He typed in the pass code and entered a place that hadn’t been seen in years. It was empty. Dust covered the papers scattered on the entrance desk, everything inside the extremely fortified bunker still well in tact. The minister observed a small note on the desk, left by his beloved yet underappreciated intern, Ran Soo-Jin.

&gt; Dear Minister,

&gt; I truly do love you. I always have. You are the greatest man I have ever met, and I only wish that we could have been closer. My passion for you rivals only the passion I have for the Fatherland, and I pray that I am forgiven for my actions. I am leaving this place to fight. Every man, woman, and child must fight for the Fatherland to survive. I have salvaged a weapon and a meager amount of ammunition. I know that I will not survive. I know now that my destiny is to die for the fatherland. 

&gt; My Minister, I hope that you forgive me for this decision, and I apologize for it. I love you, sir. I love you, I live for you, and now I will die for you, Sam.

&gt; Sincerely, Soo-Jin

The note was signed on the very day that Tang left his bunker to the coast for his escape, he noticed. He only wished that he could have told his feelings for her. At that very moment, he thought about the life the two of them could have had together. 

&gt; What have I done?

The minister walked into his office, and sat down in his now-ancient desk, sobbing. He sniffled up his tears, and began reciting something that he had once heard from a woman he once met and loved. 

&gt; *Every man, woman, and child must fight for the Fatherland to survive.*

He began sobbing again, continuing to recite the message through his tears. 

&gt; *I have salvaged a weapon and a meager amount of ammunition. I know that I will not survive.*

His sobbing intensified as be pulled a small Kampuchean pistol from his bag, and pulled it to his head. 

&gt; ***I know now that my destiny is to die for the fatherland.***

The Minister winced, and mumbled

&gt; I’ll see you above, Soo-Jin.

A single bullet echoed through the once more empty bunker.

She wished you'd try out some of her hobbies, and you wished she'd be more open to experimenting in bed...

And thus, *TRIAL SEPARATION.*

You decided that, ultimately, it was possible that you'd jumped into the relationship without really knowing what you wanted.

However, perhaps your (ex?) wife was right when she said you were too career-focused. Your friendships from school had evaporated over the years, and all that left were your myriad work contacts.

If anything, I was *trying* to escape notice: painfully shy, awkward, prone to mortified laughter at the most inappropriate moments. You suspected that if I could spend my day curled up in a file cabinet, I'd do so without the least complaint.

And so I'd blended pretty well into the background until the day you noticed *the bulge.* It was during a team meeting, helmed by low-tier coordinator Laura Vazquez. In the wake of the *TRIAL SEPARATION*, you'd been making an effort to re-assess the women around you, and Vazquez would have climbed up the listings, with her curves and risqué sense of humor, were it not for the inconvenient fact that she was straight as an arrow.

""Any questions?"" Vazquez asked, and by the time you turned your eyes back to me, *the bulge* was gone.

You even came to appreciate my hair, how lush, dense and wavy it was. How a streak of pale blonde had somehow grown among my brown bangs. It was the kind of hair you just wanted to twirl your fingers around...

A week later, you decided to pull the trigger, and damn the consequences.

I'm not sure if this is a valid feeling or not, or if it's just a normal thing that relationships go through. This is where I'd like some advice.

First, some light background: He and I met while we were both still in college through a friend. We hit it off quickly and started dating, even though he lives 2 hours away from where I currently go to school. We make it work, and it's been pretty good so far. We've made the effort to see each other on the weekends- if not every weekend, then every other. I graduate in the spring, and we've been trying to look for apartments closer to where he works. He has an awesome job that he loves, so barring me getting an internship (I'm an art student) that's where we plan on living starting in the summer. He was my first real sex and he took my virginity right when we started dating when I was 19. I haven't had many other sexual relationships besides him- a few flings here and there before him. 

Now down to the issue I've been having the last year or so. There will be instances that can last for hours, or even days where I imagine what it would be like if I wasn't in a relationship. Or if I was intimate with someone else. What other people do differently, what it might be like if I had a companion that liked different things- sexually and emotionally. I love my boyfriend to death, and I'm happiest when I'm around him. But we have some fundamental differences that I feel may have me missing out on things. He absolutely hates art, will never pose for me when I have assignments or help me prep things. He hates horror movies- understandable, as many people do- but I love them, and I'm sad that I miss out on seeing them with him. He's more introverted, completely fine with staying in all the time, whereas I like going out occasionally and exploring bars and breweries, and I get restless at times when all he wants to do is stay in again. He's never happy when I make him go to social events. 

These things start to get to me, I believe. They make me think about the ""what ifs"" more, and I feel so guilty wondering about different partners and exploring that aspect. We do have things we love to do! I love playing new video games with him- we take turns and we can play for hours. We like going out with his coworkers when I visit him, drunk laser tag is awesome (you should try it someday).

Now, The incidents. They've happened twice, both times pretty identical. I will go to a party with a few friends from college away from home and without my boyfriend. I get very drunk and end up making out with a guy I don't know. The first time, the guy practically shoved himself on me, but I didn't fight that hard back (I was drunk enough that night that next day, the details are blurry, but I know I didn't dislike the kissing, moreso the feeling waking up and knowing I'd done it), but the second time I was the one that engaged it. 

Both times, I called him the next morning and told him what happened. After the first time, he said it wasn't my fault. That guy seemed desperate and drunk, he basically assaulted me. I accepted that, told him I was sorry and I still felt guilty. The second time, I called him and explained. He still thought it wasn't my fault. Even explaining it more clearly, he wouldn't change his mind, he wasn't mad, he forgave me instantly. I wanted to talk about it, because now my friends seemed worried too, and I still felt horrible that this was happening, that drunk me threw herself at guys, it seemed. But he wouldn't talk, didn't seem to take it seriously. So I reluctantly apologized again but let it go.

I went away this summer after these incidents for an internship out of state. Remembering these drunk mistakes, I wanted to think more on them and take a break to sort myself out for two months. It seemed like a nice idea. (the internship was to an all girl camp, by the way). So I decided I wanted to take a break from our relationship and figure this out, just have a headspace outside of worrying about what he thought or what he felt (a bit selfish I know). I stayed with him the month between school letting out for the year and my internship. The night before I left, I told him I wanted a break, and he broke down. We talked, he sobbed for awhile and it broke my heart to see it. I told him I was going away, so I changed my mind, we didn't have to take a break necessarily. He accepted that and I left. 

Came back, and I still have these moments. These ""what ifs"". I think I saw somewhere else where it was explained as a ""Fear of Missing Out"" or FOMO, and I'm worried that I am afraid of missing out, that I'll get married and not know what it was like to explore a bit before settling down. These feelings don't really last, I get busy or I may forget about them momentarily when I'm visiting with him. But they always creep back and I'm not sure what to do. 

Sorry for the SUPER long post, but I thought it would be worth it to lay it all out for you guys so you can get where I'm coming from. Please let me know your thoughts."

""I'll go with...Famous YouTube Videos for 400!"" the contestant replied.

""In this adorable video, two baby brothers try to handle a conflict as one invades the other's personal space""

Beep! Beep!

One of the panels the contestants stood behind buzzed as it lit up with a white light. A bar of segmented red lights quicky ticked down to indicate the remaining time. 

""Daniel!"" the host shouted with enthusiasm as he pointed towards the third contestant.

""Umm, what is 'Charlie Bit Me'?"" Daniel replied hopefully.

""That's the one!"" said the host, ""Next category?"" 

""Memes with small animals for 1000.""

""In this meme a black dog looks off in the distance, appearing to be skeptical of what it sees.""

""Ugh, I can't watch any more of this crap"" Jake uttered in disgust as he reached for the remote. Turning off the T.V. he lied there motionless in bed, staring aimlessly at the ceiling. He wasn't sure how much time passed. It could have been 10 minutes or 1 hour. It didn't matter to Jake as he just wanted to lay there forever, slowly melting into the uncomfortable hospital bed and fading from exsistence, no longer needing to think about the many things he didn't want to think about. Suddenly, he heard a knock on the door as his mom's face poked through.

""Hey honey. Don't wanna bother you but I figured I should get some food. The police told me that they found food all over the floor next to...you know, so I'm assuming you haven't eaten.""

As she said that a sharp pain tore through Jake's stomach, followed by a mighty growl. He remembered the porkchops he had made with such love and anticipation, pefectly seasoned and cooked to a tender finish before falling to the ground, a small pool of blood collecting near it's edge.

""I don't-I don't think I can eat right now mom."" Jake said as he held his hand to his mouth. He could feel something attempting to rise up his throat.

""I understand honey but you gotta get something in you. I can hear your stomach from over here!""

She gave a smile but it quickly faded as it wasn't matched by Jake. She continued, ""Anyway, I'll just go pick up what you usually get from Wendy's. When your appetite comes back it'll be there waiting for you.""

Mrs. Roberto smiled again, looking proud at her plan. She walked over and gave Jake a kiss on his forehead before heading towards the door. She grabbed the handle before turning to face Jake.

""Don't worry honey, "" she said, her voice now filled with hope, ""The worse life seems to get, the bigger the opportinuty for it to get better.""

She left the room as Jake lied there in bed, reflecting on what his mom had just said.

""The worse life seems to get, the bigger the opportinuty for it to get better.""

That was something she always used to say to Jake when he was much younger. His parents got a divorce when he was really young and his father eventually left the country to live with another woman; the woman he ""actually loved"" as Jake overhead him say one night during a particularly nasty fight with him mom. She was always come to Jake's room afterwards, crying, as he did his best to comfort her despite not understanding the gravity of the situation. He would ask her,

""Mom, is everything OK with you and dad? Things seem to be getting worse.""

She would stop crying and look down at Jake, smiling and pulling him into her arms.

""Don't worry honey"", she would say as she rocked slowly back and forth, ""Don't worry. The worse life seems to get, the bigger the opportinuty for it to get better.""

Jake would always remember those words and, despite the fact that he could not currently think of any way for things to get better, they did give him a feeling of calm and hope as he lay in the brightly-lit room.

""OK, I'm definetly not just gonna lie here all day,"" Jake thought to himself as he crawled out of the bed. He despised hospitals and did his best to ensure he would never have to end up in one. He got out of the bed and looked down to see that he was entirely naked except for the thin, mint-green gown that hung loosely from his talk, slender body.

""Oh great,"" he thought to himself, ""Someone definelty saw my penis.""

He looked around to see if he could find his clothes as the thought of him lying naked on the bed with a group of young, giggling female interns standing around him bounced around in his head. He eventually spotted the clothes, sitting neatly folded on a chair next to the window. He walked over and grabbed his boxers, quickly tossing them to provide some level of privacy as the back of the gown was completly open, leaving his hairy buttocks out for the world to see. Now having at least a bit of coverage, he removed the gown and reached for his jeans, sliding them over his legs and thighs as he wiggled around. He grabbed his belt from the back of the chair and started to thread it through the loops in his jeans, taking a moment to look outside. It was a perfect day: no clouds in sight and the trees swayed around in a dizzy dance as a gentle breeze slid through their leaves. Everything was heavily illuminated, almost turning white, as the sun's harsh rays pummeled the city before him.

""Hmm, that's strange,"" Jake thought to himself as he slid his head and arms through the holes of his shirt, ""This is the sunniest day I think I've ever seen in my life. ""

He didn't have time to do much thinking, however, as he heard the door swing open behind him.

""Ah Jake, great you're awake!"" came a man's voice. It sounded like the voice Jake had heard earlier.

Jake turned around and saw an average-height asian male dressed in doctors clothing beaming at him. The doctor walked over and extended his hand

""Hi, I'm doctor Chang."" he said.

""Oh hey, nice to meet you Dr. Chang,"" Jake said, shaking his hand, ""Thanks for..umm, everything I guess.""

Dr. Chang laughed, patting Jake a few times on the sholder.

""Don't worry about it my boy! You only had a few scratches on you, nothing serious. Err...I assume you've been informed about your wife?""

Jake slowly shook his head, doing his best not to realease the tears building in the corner of his eyes.

""I'm...I'm so sorry,"" the doctor continued, his voice losing the pep it once had, ""We did everything we could but...it was too late.""

""It's-""

Jake struggled to get any words out. He swallowed and gave let out a heavy sigh before trying again.

""It's OK, doctor. I-I understand.""

Dr. Chang gave him a smile and shook his head.

""Well you probably already know that you're free to go since you're getting dressed. If you have any questions later don't hesitate to give me a call.""

""I will doctor."" Jake replied.

Dr. Chang left the room and closed the door behind him.

""OK, it's way too bright in here."" Jake thought to himself as he closed the blinds. Powerful streams of sunlight poured through the gaps. Jake heard his stomach rumbling again and bent over slightly in pain. He made his way over to the chair further away from the blistering heat seeping out the window and sat down. He still felt absolutely exhausted and his head bobbed back and forth as his eyes began to close. He fought against the waves of sleep washing over him, stretching and yawning as he felt himself sinking into the chair, everything around him fading into darkness.

""Jakey honey, wake up!""

Jake shifted in his chair and inhaled deeply as the smell of freshly broiled beef, sharp cheddar cheese and soft, fluffy buns filled his nasal cavities.

""Wendy's?"" Jake called out, his eyes still closed but his body automatically rising in the direction of the smell. He only took one step before a hand grabbed him by the shoulder and started to vigorously shake him.

""Jake, darling, stop this sleepwalking nonsense and let's get going,"" Jake heard his mother call out, ""We both know you don't like hospitals Jakey, so c'mon."" she pleaded.

Mrs. Roberto gave Jake another violent shake and his eyes snapped open, frantically looking around.

""Huhwhat, wh-where am I?"" he asked in confusion, holding onto his mom's arm. She drew him close with her free hand and gave him a firm hug.

""It's okay Jake, mommy's here,"" she said softly as she held him close, ""Let's go home.""

""Okay, mom.""

Jake's teeth tore into the double baconator with extra cheese as he ripped off a large chunk and began to loudly grind it between his jaws. Little bits of meat escaped his mouth and tumbled down his clothes as they landed on the floor below.

""I know you aren't feeling well Jakey but you don't have to make such a big mess"" Mrs. Roberto said. Jake stopped chewing and glanced over at his mom. Streaks of light danced across her face as the sun blasted outside and people zipped by in vehicles around them, oblivious of Jake's aching soul.

""Hrmph hrmm,"" he uttered through bursting cheeks as more food fell out of his mouth. Mrs. Roberto let out a sigh; she was all too familiar with Jake's emotional spiral when depression took a hold of him.

""So have you decided yet?"" she asked, ""Do you want to stay at home, stay in a hotel or come hang out with me?""

Jake hated his mom's hyped usage of the term ""hang out""  as it could only mean that she already had a series of sweat-inducing, relationship-building activities lined up to try and cheer him up. He shuddred at the thought. However, he could probably use the company and definetly use the home-cooked meals. Plus, staying anywhere was better than spending a night in his house, alone. Jake swallowed the food in his mouth.

""I think I'll stay at your place for a bit."" he said as he took another bite out of the succulent cheeseburger. A huge smile broke out on his mother's face.

""Okay honey! Don't you worry this will be fun, there's already a few things I can think of us doing that'll definetly cheer you up.""

Mrs. Roberto's eyes sparkled with excitement as she thought of finally spending time with her son again.

""Uhh, maybe I should just stay in the hotel...""

""Nonsense! If you don't feel like doing anything and just want to stay in the house that's fine with me too. If you want we can swing by your place so you can pick up a few things.""

""Yeah. Yeah, sure.""

The pair drove in silence for the remainder of the trip, only being mometarily broken as Jake tried desperatly to suck the remaining soda from the bottom of his cup. Unsuccessful, he placed the cup in the cupholder and leaned back as they neared the corner to his house.

""Be careful going around this corner,"" Jake said with an annoyed tone, ""Those puny brats are usually running around on the street somehere.""

""Those little devils are still running around here?"" Mrs. Roberto asked, slowing down as they rounded the corner. Sure enough, the two kids stood out in the street screaming and jumping from side to side, pieces of broken sticks flying up into the air around them as they engaged in an intense swordfight. Mrs. Roberto laid her hand on the horn as she leaned out the window.

""GET OUT OF THE ROAD YER LITTLE BUGGERS!"" she yelled as they drove past, ""Go find your parents and do something constructive!""

Both the kids stuck out their tongues and pulled on the skin under their eyes as they ran off, laughing.

Mrs. Roberto shook her head in digust, ""It's ridiculous Jake, The Aktins really need to keep their children under control,"" she said.

""Uhuh...""

Jake couldn't focus much on what his mother was saying. As they pulled up to his house he saw many vehicles, somewhere around 10, parked in his driveway and all along the side of the road. They shined brightly as the harsh sun reflected off their glossy surfaces."

Hello Reddit!

I am currently a University student at San Diego State University that has 2 years of credits worth. I am behind and honestly disliking my school. The classes are just a grind and I feel like it is just based on attendance. I also went into college straight after High School so I just went into Computer Science just because it was closest to 'working close to games.' I am currently feeling pretty unhappy with how school is for me right now.

But enough of that, my dream is to become a Game Designer. I love games and have always wanted to do something with it. My school does not offer Video Game Design degrees (other than Media studies?). So I am stuck whether to transfer to a different school or to finish up my degree at my current University.

I live in San Diego,California so my options are limited for Game Design degrees when I looked through google. I have : National University, and Art Institute of San Diego.

I've heard some negative things about both these schools so I am very hesitant to pick... I am open to suggestions on other schools!

I am open to any advice or help. I am very naive to how the graphic design jobs work and what they want in terms of qualifications. I am also planning to intern at Playstation or something!

Thanks reddit!

Edit 1: Thanks for the comments so far. I really wish to go for this work. However, Im unsure where to go for my education/degree. If anyone can recommend a school between National University, Art Institues, or any other school would be fantastic. Thanks again!"

9vurkv,0,2018-11-10,He(19M) found out that he is the father of my(27F) unborn child.,flmlflml,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9vurkv/he19m_found_out_that_he_is_the_father_of_my27f/,"I think I should start from the beginning.

14 yrs ago my parents died due to a car accident. My grandma took me in.  My grandma's best friend is also the grandmother of my best friend(Amanda, 27F). Their family took care of us a lot whenever we had problems. They also took us on vacations with them. They were also early investors in my business I started when I was 20. I will always be indebted to them.

My best friends' younger brother(Alex,19M) moved in to the apartment next to mine last year for university. I own both the apartments, so I am also his landlady. To lessen his rent, we made a deal that he would make breakfast and dinner for both of us and also feed my cat. It was a bit awkward in the beginning but we gelled with each other after a few weeks. It became routine for him to enter my house, make breakfast then leave for his classes. And at night he would be making dinner after I came from work. We would sit together and watch Netflix or foreign dramas. Both of our tastes were similar because he liked to follow whatever his sister and I did since we were young. He became like a best friend to me. We would share what happened throughout the day. I talked to him about my work. He would talk to me about his school. We would debate about the actions of character in an ongoing drama. Before long this had become normal for us.

After my boyfriend had passed away due to cancer 3 yrs ago, this was the first time I had gotten close to another man. At the beginning of this year he had got himself a girlfriend. They made a beautiful couple. They were perfect of each other. This also caused his time together with me to decrease. The days he would make dinner for me became sparse. Rather than dinner I missed his company. I started feeling lonely again. One day he had a party at his house. I went in for a few moments and I saw them making out. Seeing them made my heart hurt. Seeing him holding another girl made me jealous. I knew it was wrong of me to fall for my best friend's brother but before I knew it I had developed feelings for him.

I started distancing myself from him and focused only on work. It was a hectic time for my business too. However he broke up with his girlfriend after 5 months. Somewhere inside me I was happy but he was having a hard time processing the break up. We started spending more time with each other. He would help me with my work. I would help him with his studies.

Soon summer break was upon us. He had gotten an internship on the other side of the country. The day before he was leaving my cat died. I was completely distraught. She was a present to me from my ex-boyfriend. I was suddenly reminded of the hard times when my ex-bf was going through cancer. The pain was killing me. Alex helped me bury my cat in the park. When we came back to my house he offered to make me dinner since I had not eaten throughout the day while I went in for a shower. Seeing my face in the mirror I started crying again. I slipped and laid down on the floor. He came rushing when he heard the noise. He picked me up and laid me down on the bed. As he was turning away I hugged him from the back. Once he turned his face towards me I started kissing him. At the point it felt as if the flood gates were finally open. At first he didnt respond but then things got intense and we ended up having sex.

Next morning I woke up early and saw him sleeping next to me. I felt happy and guilty at the same time. He was my best friend's brother. His parent viewed me as their own daughter. I got ready and wrote a letter explaining that last night was just a mistake due to sadness and loneliness. I left for work. He tried to call me multiple times and texted me too but I blocked him. I didnt know what to say to him. I was running away. I know I hurt him and made him confused. That day he also left for his internship and was only going to come back after two months. I missed him a lot but I diverted my attention to work again.

A month and half after that I found out that I was pregnant and also this could possibly the last time I could have a baby due to some genetic problems. If I were to explain my feelings at that time I was mostly scared. I had no family left. My grandma passed away when I was in university. I also had to hide it from my best friend because her brother was the father. I could not show my face to her. I had to keep this a secret from everyone.

Eventually Alex came back after his two months. It was also the time when my morning sickness was coming to an end. In the middle of his internship we had talked to each other and decided to forget about that night. He started treating me normally but I was a bit more sensitive to his actions. I could feel my self become more aware whenever he got close to me. He also noticed that all the beer was gone and I had stopped smoking. I had also stopped wearing tight clothes. I made excuses whenever he asked about something which could give me away. I think I did a good job hiding my pregnancy.

However my best friend visited me a few days back and she instantly realized that I was pregnant. She already has two kids. Luckily Alex had gone on a trip with his friends at this point. She kept on badgering me about who is the father. I knew she was concerned about me. Yesterday, I told her all the details about my pregnancy but I didnt tell her about the father. However i felt really bad about lying to her. So I took the risk and spilled the beans. At first she was really angry (like how dare I sleep with her kid brother. he is not a kid anymore.) Eventually she calmed down and heard my side of the story. Just as we were finishing the story Alex walked in.(this was also the day he was coming back) I dont know how much he heard but he had a shocked look on his face. He kept on staring at me. Before we could talk to him, he walked out. We tried calling him but he didnt pick up. Finally he texted us to give him some time to process. He didnt come back yesterday night. Just a few minutes before as I was writing this he texted me that he wants to meet me at our favorite restaurant and have a serious discussion.

At the moment I am feeling very scared for me, him and my baby. I dont want him to say that he wants me to abort our baby. I am fine with him not taking responsibility. I have confidence in myself to become a single mother. As for marriage I dont want to restrict him in his life. He is studying at a top university and has his whole life ahead of him. I dont want us to be a burden on him.

Please advise me on how to go forward.

So I came back this weekend to see her and while I slept in the morning, she woke up and looked through my phone and saw a conversation that I had with another girl. I said stuff that were really innapropriate and out of line. She dumped me straight away and blocked me everywhere so that I could never talk to her again and then she left for work.

I just want to say to her that I’m sorry for the last few weeks because I was a total piece of garbage with her. I don’t want to fight for her too much because she’ll never take me back, I’m pretty sure. If I fight to go back together, it will just cause her more pain and thats really not what I want. 

It really breaks my heart and makes me shake to say this, but what can I say to say sorry? What can I tell her to help her cope and help her move on successfully without me? We are both pretty young (20M and 19F) and this is her first relationship. I don’t want my fuck ups to mess up her future relationships because she can’t trust her boyfriends anymore.

She is the sweetest and most loving person I ever met and I will never have the chance to meet someone as great as her again. She really does deserve better than me and she really does not deserve to feel like she probably does right now.

I really need help to write this appalogy letter.

And kids... don’t cheat emotionnaly or physically. It will mess you up if you truly love someone. You’re going to destroy that person and you will feel like a total piece of shit for it for years. This is my number 1 biggest mistake i’ve made in 20 years. "

So, on paper I graduated top of my class pulling late nights and all nighters to maintain a 3.8. I was one of those students that became irritated when my first A- ruined that 4.0 in the 3rd year. I have enough on my resume to usually get an interview, but not get past that stage. The only job I've ever successfully landed, without close friends getting me the job, was from lying to the interviewer about being born in the same small city as him.

I have a disorder similar to Asperger's and come across as highly socially awkward. So, I prefer to plan out questions for interviewers in advance. Only problem is that comes across as wooden behavior, and usually my questions are covered during the interview. I really just need that stepping stone job to follow the typical software engineer job jumping path. 

Ended up getting stuck in a bunch of unpaid internships where the boss was just looking for free labor with no intent to hire, or hire with unreasonable pay schedules. (only getting paid when they ship a completed project) 

TLDR: I've seen others suggest coming with a list of questions to pull out at the end of the interview. Doesn't that look wooden to the interviewer, though? How should I approach asking questions, without sounding inauthentic with the delivery?"

I was born and raised in the States and had never been in Japan, so I was super excited about getting to know more about my background and experiencing life in a different country. I knew that it would be not be without its challenges and differences, and I have truly struggled to be open minded, open-minded, and appreciative, but at the end of the day, there is still that part of me that strongly feels negativity towards many things in Japanese culture. I feel so guilty for feeling this way, especially because I’m Japanese! 

Honestly it mostly has to do with social mannerisms . 

- yes, they’re polite. But also fake as f***. 
being so overly polite in society creates less space for individuality, to be yourself. It seems to create a lot of repressed negative emotions like anger and irritation that comes out like toxic vomit later on. 

- I feel like this behavior is a large part of why basically every working businessmen and women get burnt out in Japanese society. The societal belief that the “customer is god” (there’s literally an actual saying) and pronounced hierarchy within workplaces allow for others to step all over you. It’s like you get stripped of your own basic, human rights and respect. it’s shocking to see all the businessmen who go to work each day — walking to and fro from work, commuting on trains, because they all look exactly, EXACTLY the same. (Not physically). They’re all so tired, burnt out, just gray. So much of the atmosphere is gray. 

- lack of individuality. Different is bad. everyone wants to have the same things, do the same things. When something trends, everybody buys into the same exact thing, whether it be an outfit, a hairstyle, a makeup product, it’s the weirdest thing because so many people walk around looking the exact same. When someone else does something different, a lot of the time, it’s not seen as “new”, “unique”, “interesting”, but “odd” , or “alien”. People don’t seem very open to diversity, or perspective. A lot of them seem to obsess over how people will view each outfit, each gesture, each hairstyle, it just seems so draining. 

- yes, they mind their own business. Which is nice, until you’re dying on the side of the street. Last statement was obviously an exaggeration, but Ive literally seen grandmas drop their groceries, women trip and fall, kids be 50 yen (around 50 cents) short to get on buses, and no one bats a single eyelash. They see it and completely ignore it, or record it. The recording especially makes me so angry.  They have this reputation for being “so polite” and “so kind”, but i keep seeing this cold-heartedness that I’ve never seen in the States towards strangers in these people. 

- weird fascination and totally different attitude towards white people and foreigners. The way they treat some of my white friends is TOTALLY different than how they treat me or different foreigners I’ve seen. It just throws me off when I see a lot of them like suddenly become insanely helpful, start smiling a lot more, or when their voices suddenly go up like three octaves I’m literally standing there like, “YOU TOLD ME YOU DIDNT HAVE A BATHROOM I COULD USE TWO MINUTES AGO!” 

I fully understand that not all Japanese people, or experiences in Japan are like this. I’m doing my best to throw away all cultural expectations that I was raised with and understand THIS country’s way of life (not mine) , but still some things I just feel like I can’t conform to, or let slip. I know this post is bound to attract a lot of hate from people who have had wonderful experiences in japan, its just my account of some things I can’t seem to agree with. "
9vvdc8,2,2018-11-10,Here I go again,LarryAlphonso,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/9vvdc8/here_i_go_again/,"So I had subscribed this sub a few months ago and then unsubscribed again when I thought I would be fine. But here I am once more. Back then I was a lurker only but now I decided to make a post.

So, I just spent about half an hour or so to just let my shower make me feel somewhat more comfortable with its warm water. However, the moment I step outside I am about to break apart in tears ... somehow I overcame it though. Probably because I remembered this post some months ago which stated something like 'To know that I will die one day fills me with relief' and I also remembered that this one highway crossover, I have already thought about so often by now, is still only about a 15 to 20 min walk away from my home.

I don't know ... I had some hopes a few weeks ago that my situation could get better -- doing an internship at some company, get myself a weekly schedule to hang on, so that I can go along in my studies a little better but I did none of these things. Meanwhile, I see once more some friends obtaining these things comparably easy -- at least that's what it seems to me to be like -- and the same with my girlfriend. The latter one being several hundreds maybe thousands kilometers away from me now in a foreign country having her year abroad.

There are too many things that make me feel that I don't live for myself anymore but only other people who maybe tell me that they love me and at times I may even feel that. Still, though, I don't see much of a point anymore in carrying on. i just keep on living for them not to break apart, too. When I spoke with my girlfriend about these feelings about one and a half year ago, I remember how she broke into tears and how she seemed to feel even worse than me in that particular moment. And I can even imagine it's the same with, say, my mother. She seems to block away these thoughts somewhat but if I would draw the final line she would probably either crash down or fading into a parallel world where she would suppress all these feelings and thoughts about me.

I have wished for someone 'neutral' to talk to so often but just couldn't find someone. Someone who's at least, I don't know, 30 years older than me (I'm 23) who never knew before and who would just let me tell all these things I want to talk off my chest. Who doesn't tells me just do this and that and it will change ... but someone who simply listens to me no matter how bullshit all the things I say might sound. Someone who gives me the feeling that they really care about what I have to say but I don't know where to find someone like this.

A couple of times I thought about calling one of these help lines but I just couldn't bring myself to do so. I don't even know what I fear, maybe to break up in tears, like I'm doing right now, or that it just doesn't help me ... I don't know."
9vvvom,0,2018-11-10,"""At two Dutch-speaking primary schools, children can now also use their mother tongue""",faroename,belgium,https://www.reddit.com/r/belgium/comments/9vvvom/at_two_dutchspeaking_primary_schools_children_can/,"I think this is a great idea! I don't get the problem with speaking another language in a school setting as well, I speak another language than dutch as my primary language and when I was younger it was difficult for me to understand why it was such a problem to interact with some of my friends in our mother tongue... I'm happy that these results show the advantages of allowing students to speak different languages in a school setting, what do you think?

[https://www.bruzz.be/onderwijs/op-twee-nederlandstalige-basisscholen-mogen-kinderen-nu-ook-hun-thuistaal-gebruiken-2018](https://www.bruzz.be/onderwijs/op-twee-nederlandstalige-basisscholen-mogen-kinderen-nu-ook-hun-thuistaal-gebruiken-2018)

(Deepl Translation)For a pilot project children from the fifth and sixth years of two Dutch-speaking primary schools in Anderlecht were sometimes allowed to use their home language last school year, for example when preparing a group work. ""The children are involved, motivated and proud. Their speech in Dutch is also increasing"", says the Erasmushogeschool, who supervised the project. This is now being extended to all primary school classes.

Most pupils of the Anderlecht primary schools De Vijvers en Goede Lucht, who participated in the pilot project, often only hear Dutch at school. Both Brussels schools attract a mainly French-speaking public.

""This strict division between the school and the world outside is a rather schizophrenic situation for these children"", says Anouk Vanherf to BRUZZ. Vanherf is a teacher of Dutch at the teacher training college of the Erasmushogeschool Brussel, and as a researcher she is working on the use of home languages in education.

Disadvantage in Dutch

Immersing the pupils in a Dutch language bath, and keeping the home languages completely outside, did not produce the desired results, the schools observed. ""At the end of primary school a large part of the pupils appeared to be lagging behind for Dutch.

Hence the idea to use the home language at school in the fifth and sixth years. With a project, the university also wanted to use the language skills of its own students. ""The influx into our teacher training programme is increasingly a reflection of the multilingual reality of Brussels"", the researcher says. ""We have French-speaking students, or students who also speak Arabic, Albanian, Turkish or Russian, for example.

Anouk Vanherf, researcher Education and Pedagogy at the Erasmushogeschool

""If you let primary school children prepare a group work in Turkish, they usually talk effectively about the subject matter.

ANOUK VANHERF, ERASMUSHOGESCHOOL BRUSSEL

After a survey of the opinions of parents, teachers and pupils about the use of home languages, the students set to work during their final internship. They integrated the languages and cultures of the students in a playful way. Where in the past the home languages were excluded from the classroom, the children were now also allowed to use them occasionally, for example during group work or when making an assignment.

""But in the end the presentation was made in Dutch. The goal was always to strengthen the language skills of Dutch,"" Vanherf emphasises. ""Dutch is and remains the language of instruction at school. Home languages are only used if they can support the pupils' learning process. Their speech daring in Dutch effectively increased.

It takes getting used to for the teacher who is not always able to follow during the preparation, Vanherf understands. ""But if you let primary school children prepare a group work in Turkish, for example, they will talk most of the time effectively about the subject matter during the Turkish conversation. This is shown by a study at four schools in Ghent, where the Dutch-speaking researchers recorded the conversations and later had them translated"".

Mother's day poem in mother tongue

Another example: the children translated poems for Mother's Day into their mother tongue so that they could issue a bilingual card. Or after a W.O.-lesson about the space they had to translate the concepts into their home language as homework. ""This way they can make connections with the words in Dutch,"" explains Vanherf, ""and at the same time the vocabulary in their home language is enriched, essential for learning another language.

Anouk Vanherf, researcher Education and Pedagogy at the Erasmushogeschool

""The school recognises part of the pupils' identity that they have never been able to show up to now"".

ANOUK VANHERF, RESEARCHER ERASMUSHOGESCHOOL BRUSSEL

""That homework had to be completed only a few days later, but the next day everyone had already made the task very proud"", says Vanherf. ""It's about the attitude of the school, it's a recognition of part of their identity that they could never show up to now. Classmates also discovered each other's home languages. So little attention has been paid to that so far.

""For the Dutch-speaking children, the foreign language moments are a broadening of the horizon,"" says Vanherf. ""The project is also an added value for the multilingual student teachers. Their language skills are appreciated and for many pupils they are a role model.

The plan is now to extend to the other classes in both primary schools. ""We also hope to make the teachers who are still suspicious of the project see the benefits of the project"", the researcher at the Erasmushogeschool says."
9vw1ir,2,2018-11-10,I (25M) have a problem and don't know where or how to start,furryoverlord,stopdrinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/9vw1ir/i_25m_have_a_problem_and_dont_know_where_or_how/,"I’ve known for awhile that my drinking is problematic. I’ll drink at least 5-6 nights of the week. If I’m tired, sad, or nervous I crave a drink - but if I’m happy, wanting to celebrate or relax I also crave a drink. I’ve tied drinking to most of my leisure activities, and once I start, I basically have zero impulse control. I don’t really get buzzed anymore, at some point I cross over into drunkenness. Usually, I go for beer: high percentage craft that I told myself was a hobby, but now I’m realizing is just an excuse. 

In the past few months I’ve added some extra liquor to my nightly beer drinking since I can’t get drunk easily like I used to. A pretty normal night for me is to come home, tie one on, then I go outside and chainsmoke on the porch. I only smoke at night when I’m drinking and always regret it. Still, this is my idea of a good time. 

At social events, I can’t control myself either. I consistently find myself being too drunk for the situation: family events, casual weekday dinners with a friend, after work drinks with colleagues… once I start ,I just go till I’m hammered. At times, I’ve shown up drunk to something important where you’re really not supposed to be drunk. I had this little sketch comedy group from a continuing studies class at my old university, and we’d meet every once in awhile. The last time we had a meeting, I got off work and convinced an intern to come grab some beers with me. Then I invited myself over to his place, got hammered, left abruptly, and stumbled into the restaurant for the group meeting. They told me I smelled like booze and I remember I was farting the entire time. It was disgusting.

I was tallying it up today, and I think every one of my close friends and family members has at some point taken me aside and told me they were worried about my drinking. Each time I ignored it. 

This past year, I enrolled in a post-grad college program in film production. It’s a dream of mine and I’m proud that I had the guts to give this a shot. We had a little video project this past week that we shot in my apartment. We were shooting a party scene, so naturally there was beer and wine around. Everyone was having one or two. But even though I’d written the script, organized, and invited people over, I proceeded to get fucking blasted. One of my friends tried to film her own little video as well and I fucking ruined it by being drunk. And I’m so ashamed of myself… the thing that gets me is with each drink, I KNEW I should stop… kept telling myself it was inappropriate, that everyone could tell, that they could write me up to the teacher which would hurt my job prospects… but each time I couldn’t help myself. Everyone in the small class looks at me different now. And when I’m alone I do that ALL THE TIME.

I never thought I was at the point of blacking out. But then people were describing things from that night I had zero memory of. I just nodded along. And I started remembering times I’ve been talking to a friend after a party and they’ve reminded me of something funny one of us said that I have no memory of…

I didn’t drink for about 48 hours after that. Then went out with some friends, stuck to water at first then caved. I went to bed drunk last night and woke up hating myself. Do I just not go out anymore? 

I guess I’m not at the point where I’m day drinking, but still… like holy fuck I’m reading this all back and I sound like an alcoholic. Alcoholism and addiction run in my family, my dad’s mom/my grandmother drank herself to death long before I was born. Other cousins on that side of the family struggle with substance abuse. I don’t know how I could face my dad if this became noticeable, because it would hurt him so much.

But where do you even start? What do I do to even begin to unpack all this?

Any help/advice would be appreciated. "

I spoke with an advisor and the program is very new. They have only had 30 graduates and this worries me. She was not able to tell me any industries where graduates went and they do not help with finding an internship. I am more wondering if the school that I attend matters when I go to look for jobs or not. There is plenty of opportunity to learn SAS and R and it seems as far as classes go to be on par with the other programs. Also due to scheduling if I apply to the other programs I would have to wait until most likely January 2020 so I could finish some prereqs but I could start at KU this summer. At KU they don't require linear algebra or even calc III which also makes me uneasy. Some insight would be extremely helpful and greatly appreciated."

**D**uring a news conference in the press room of the white house the other day,  President Donald J. Trump confronted two elitists entitled white men who were reporters for CNN and some other organization too small for me to remember or to even mention.  Jim Acosta from CNN, a lying deceitful person and an organization determined to cause dissention and separation among the great public of the United States, who believes that he is better than and above anyone no matter the color or creed.  Black, brown or orange. And Peter Alexander from some place, I truly don't remember.  Is he actually a journalist?  I don’t ever remember even seeing him before this or ever seeing his name anywhere.  I couldn't even tell you from where or how he even got in there, probably through white supremacy trickery.  Either way, they displayed themselves to be unbecoming a journalist.  Their actions show that White Entitled Elitist Men who are supremacists must be fought against to this day and everyday. 

Undeterred President Donald J. Trump, the greatest president to ever grace himself to us,  smacked these two white supremacist losers back to equality, as a message to all Elitist Entitled White Supremacist men across the country, that they are not above everyone else, and that this country will not be destroyed by them.  One of these disgusting, low-life, garbage human beings even went so far as to assault one of the interns.  A young, small, fragile woman who was just trying do her job to get a microphone back from this scumbag was brutally pushed to the floor. After forcfully smacking her arm away with the full force of a grow adult *man*.  A truly insulting and dismissive action.  President Trump immediately called White Elitist Entitled Supremacist Jim Acosta out as rude and disgraceful then promptly removed his press credentials.  This garbage human being whose name feels and looks like the taste of vomit coming from my mouth and in print and his co-white supremacist friend, Peter something,  I already forgot his name, Baker? Bander? Bastard? Alexander!, that's it, Alexander, who though did not suffer the same appropriate, if not lenient, fate of just having his press pass and balls removed in front of everyone, was still blasted and put on notice.  These truly evil White Supremacist Elitist Entitled White men must not succeed in their evil lies, deceptions and hate.

 Thank god we have a president with the strength and conviction to smack the light of truth down upon these goons of hate and intolerance and toxic white supremacist masculinity.  How there are still businesses that continue to employ these racist women-beaters is beyond me. CNN and the other place, if it actually exists, should be ashamed of themselves for hiring such vitriol.   We need better.  We should demand better.  And we shouldn’t give these organizations, such as CNN and that other place, if it really exists, any ratings until they do so. 

White Elitist Entitled Supremist Man, Jim Acosta and all your White Elitist Entitled Supremacist friends have been put on blast.  Not here, not in my country. And not to my country men and women. "

**6:23 PM November 15th, Jubaoyuan Hot Pot Restaurant, Xicheng District, Beijing**

&gt; “Good evening everyone! Tonight, I will be discussing with President Xi Jinping the Made in China 2025, specifically the how China will reach its aviation goals by 2025. The state of the aviation industry in China is one of the biggest debated topics about the policy as China brings ten key industries up to first world technological standards. We will be discussing this policy over the hottest Chongqing pot base, and it will surely make for a comical, and educational conversation. President Xi, how are you doing this evening.”

---

&gt; “I am pretty good [Yang Yang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yang_Yang_(actor)), how are you doing?”

---

&gt; “I am doing fantastic this evening, President Xi, I have ordered a fine selection of delicacies, and Qingdao Beer to ensure this makes for a good time for the two of us, and our viewers this evening, in this very unique opportunity to give the people of China some insight into your plans, and learn more about their President.”

---

&gt; “So while we wait for the food, we can start on the beer at the very least President Xi, and the first question. How does that sound?”

---

&gt; “Fine, Fine, ask what’s on your mind, as I am sure it is on the nation’s mind too.”

---

&gt; “Very well, one of the highest rated question among CCTV viewers happens to be what in your opinion the [specific challenges](https://www.scmp.com/business/article/2170746/chinas-aviation-industry-has-steep-climb-made-china-2025-goals) are to the Aviation Sector in regards to Made in China 2025. Would you mind sharing your stance?”

---

&gt; “Not at all, the biggest challenges up until this point have been, undoubtedly:
* One, the production of engines domestically. There is no doubt that we have come a long way since the 2015-2016 era, when the policy was introduced but there is still much work to be done on the subject.

* Second, the lack of skilled domestic talent currently working on the project, which I will go into further detail on later.

* Third, commercialization of the aircraft produced.

* Fourth, the quality issues expressed by our Civil Aviation Administration of China and the American Federal Aviation Administration, which our currently our barriers to market in the US.

While these problems are not small in scope, I have a plan that will make sure that China can meet its requirements in the field of aviation, for Made in China 2025.”

---

&gt; “It is well known that to solve the problems they must first be addressed, which I can commend you for as it is clear you have thought about them extensively, as you stated you have a plan. You first mentioned the production of engines domestically have run into some backwater in terms of meeting the standards required by 2025, can you go into detail more specifically about this? What plans do you have to solidify that domestic engine production will meet the needs asked by your government?

---

&gt; “The most pressing problem, Yang Yang, is the demand. [Boeing has analyzed](https://www.boeing.com/commercial/market/commercial-market-outlook/) that China alone within the next twenty years will need to obtain 7,690 new aircraft, 75% of which being your single aisle aircraft, valuing in total at $1.2 Tn. It is clear from our airline companies from a business standpoint are looking to expand well into the future, they will need to deal with the largest global passenger increase of around 9%, and to do so they will need aircraft, and most importantly engines to power these aircraft. The [IATA has stated](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-10/29/c_137566666.htm) that there will be 5% annual market growth leading into the future, Boeing puts that same statistic anywhere from 4.6% to 5.2% annually. The growth these airline companies are looking for, can be solved in short by filling aircraft demand, they will need engines. To solve this large demand crisis for engines and aircraft, I have spoken to senior members of CAIGA, Comac who focus on largely jet aircraft, and the XAIC, more focused on regional turboprop, on the engine crisis. They all have said that the main barrier that has slowed the process has been teams unwilling to cooperate, and some unable to communicate with each other. The large problem has stemmed from their lack of ability to provide proper succession in the company to pave a path for the future engineers and leaders of these wonderful companies. They are bringing in foreign employees from around the world, none of them know how to speak Chinese, and most of them have never worked on jet or turboprop engines previously, however have been put in charge of these large projects nonetheless. As a result of this, I have spoken with Beihang, Qinghua, Beijing, Renmin, and several key provincial level universities to work on building our research and engineering programs in the field of aerospace, and have decided that we will creating Aviation Experimentation and Fabrication Laboratories at these universities, with state funding, lead by our experienced professors at the universities to make sure that students even at the undergraduate level will begin getting the practical experience they need in the field. We will be extending Aerospace Engineering Scholarships sponsored at the Provincial and Central level to the most outstanding applications, and current students with outstand performance up to the research level. The wonderful thing about these students is that, not only do they have the faculty expertise at the universities, they have their own thoughts and ideas that they can bring into the field, and with practical research and engineering at their back starting from the first year, they can enter the industry in 2021, 2022, and show the management that they are able to produce these engines to keep us on target. In my opinion, practical expertise is not something that has been immensely stressed at the university level, and it will start immediately. Every engineering student wants to produce engines for the J-20, make their own fighter jet, and make it rich, who are we to clip their wings so to speak?”

---

&gt; “This Aviation Experimentation and Fabrication Laboratories you are mentioning at the university level sound like exactly what Comac, CAIGA, just to name a few, are looking for, my main concern would be, how will the students know what industry standard is after working in these labs? How will they know what China, the field of aviation, expects of them? Will they be prepared for the industry standard?”

---

&gt; “Talking about the industry standard is a whole other mess of spilled green tea, however this AXFL will be key in transforming the top down industry standard to a skill driven bottom up standard. I share your concerns with what Comac, CAIGA, and the others will think of our graduates, and they share the same concerns in my discussions with them, that is why they have proposed to have competitions at the universities at a provincial then central level to bring the best prototypes to the national stage, where they will be tested. Of course winning students will be given a prize and a status to put on their resume, but it will highlight all of our outstanding prospective engineers from across the nation and put them in the eyes of these big companies, a key maneuver to grab them for internships, where they will get practical experience in the current aviation industry before graduation. Upon returning to university, they will have better knowledge about how to continue research and production in these labs, the results will keep getting better and better.”

---
&gt; “This plan is very orderly and supports the notion that growth of our aviation industry will come from within, rather than the outside, which is key for the industry itself, but our prospective students as they move through middle school and high school. It sounds very promising for our future engineers, and the industry as a whole, but if the demand for these aircraft is as high as predicted, who will be flying them? Oh, and it seems our food has arrived, you can dig in as you think.”

---

&gt; “Alright, thank you… Wow this is surprisingly hot, I’ll have to wash this down with some beer and get back to you on that question…. Now, as you were asking, we can’t give the engineering students all the scholarships and the treats, how is that fair? Up until this point, many of China’s best pilots have come through the military, Beihang, or studied abroad at other prestigious foreign institutions. While up until now this has not been much of a problem, it will not feed our growth in the industry in the long run as China does what it does best. Yang Yang, do you know what that is?”

---

&gt; “No, President Xi, what does China do best?”

---

&gt; “Haha, just Xi is fine, although I appreciate the respect, why what we do best is moving people of course! To feed the large demand of pilots and flight instructors we will currently have, starting with high-school, and including universities at the provincial and central level will be given easier access to aviation materials, and aviation standards. If a student in high-school has decided aviation is their future, and they dream of being the next commercial pilot or the next flying ace, they should be able to. It is my goal that a high-school student can earn his or her private pilot’s license, meeting CAAC **AND** FAA American Standards by the time they graduate high-school. For our students that have made it to university, or even after graduating and have not decided what their future is, they too will be able to take and practice their private pilots license and earn it in due time. Universities and high-schools that are interested will apply for a permit to receive a select few flight instructors per geographical area, and teach the prospective students. All the flight instructors will have met FAA Standards, and CAAC Standards, by having completed their private pilot’s and flight instructor certification. They will train the students to prepare for their practical and written exams, training them in the proper usage and maintenance of the aircraft, and will operate out of small local airfields. I will be working with the CAAC in analysis of the current status of small airfields, and providing them with investments to get the airfields produced and the small training craft acquired ready to start by November 2019. Our pilots will no longer have to come from the three small venues, there should be plenty of options to provide for success in this fastly growing field.”

---

&gt; “So what you are saying is, a person as young as first year high-school, and a person who has already entered their middle-stages in life can earn their private pilot’s, possibly even their flight instructor certifications? That would be amazing, anyone regardless of their field, as long as they can pay for the lessons, could have a future determined for them.”

---

&gt; “That is correct! Your next question?”

---

&gt; “While with this very pinpointing solution you have scratched off the first two issues you outlined with the goals for meeting the requirements in the field of aviation by 2025, you have yet to mention the commercialization or the quality concerns about the domestic aircraft produced. I would like to hear your thoughts on what actions you have taken, or are currently taken to combat this. Care to share?”

---

&gt; “Sure, I can share, but first please pass the duck feet, you are keeping them all to yourself over there, I see what this is! Thank you. You are taking this spice a lot better than I am, did you cheat and practice first? What fun would that be?”

---

&gt; “Hey, I’m not cheating, I just did a lot of work in Chongqing. Hey, don’t forget to answer my question!”

---

&gt; “Okay, Okay, as far as the commercialization of the aircraft is concerned, we will be opening up the board and middle management of the CAIGA, and Comac state-owned enterprises to Chinese business magnates that can work on the plans for marketing and sale domestically as well as abroad. The long-term party members that have sat in these positions with little practical experience for many many years have been stunting the growth and expansion of these companies and the industry. While China decreases its dependence on foreign aviation products over the years as we gear up for Made in China 2025, we will need to make these companies more efficient, even if that means sacrificing some party members of their eternal positions. The bottom line is aviation is a key and bombing industry in China, we have the [AG 600](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVIC_AG600), [C919](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comac_C919), [CR929](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRAIC_CR929), updates to the [ARJ21](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comac_ARJ21) , and the [MA700](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xian_MA700) just to name several, all hitting the tarmac in the coming years. It is our job to make sure that it moves forward as planned, and that key businesses leaders, in conjunction with party members, can point out the issues, and create a roadmap for the marketing and sale of the aircraft around the world in the coming years. As it stands we have proposed a 70% private business investment, and 30% party affiliate cooperation in the rungs on upper, and middle-level management, and entirely internal management at the first-line level. This will tackle the issue of getting ready for commercialization, and getting these aircraft ready to meet the quality standards imposed domestically, and by the FAA. The companies will be a majority private at this point, with minimal party oversight, but enough to ensure goals are met, that it will meet the qualifications set by the FAA as a company, and the quality control will be self-vetted by the private managers, which will allow our aircraft to roll out on time, and meet American, Chinese, and International standards, a triple threat. It has been high time these measures be implemented, as we have been working for the past 40 years at opening our economy to the world, creating a Global China, and the aviation industry has been left in the dust. That is about to change.”

(dual Can-US citizen here),josie_96,tax,https://www.reddit.com/r/tax/comments/9vxa4m/can_a_regular_tax_preparer_file_my_back_taxes/,"I was born in the US but have never worked or resided there, so I never filed taxes to the IRS. However, I will be moving to Boston in January for a 4-month internship, so I am trying to get this process started.

I got in touch with a US tax expert at H&amp;R Block here in Canada and was told the process of filing 3 years of back taxes (ages 18 to now) + 6 years of FBAR would cost me at least $2,500 CAD. After that, regular US tax filing would cost $600 CAD/year.

My parents seem to think the charges are excessive and think I may have better luck just finding an accountant in the US to do that for me. They believe Canadian accountants overcharge because not a lot of Canadians know how to prepare US taxes. However, I believe the forms to fill out wouldn't be the same as a regular American, so I don't know that anyone could just do it.

My dad wants me to wait until I get to Boston in January to talk to someone. Does that seem like sound advice? How much would the process cost me in the US?"
9vxbil,1,2018-11-10,How to cope with overseas romance?,throwaway19385730237,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/9vxbil/how_to_cope_with_overseas_romance/,"I apologise in advance for the fact that this post will probably be a long, rambling mess.

For the last 3 months or so, I've been doing an internship overseas after having finished studying at uni in Australia. I was fortunate enough to have the time and opportunity to travel during my internship so I was able to go to a lot of great cities and meet a lot of wonderful people. While I was visiting a different city, I was using Tinder a bit and thought (as it was my birthday that weekend) that I would arrange a meet up with a guy that super liked me and have some fun. We met up and I was very pleasantly surprised, he was SO much more attractive, interesting, funny, sweet, etc than I had initially anticipated. We spent all night together and the rest of the day together (until my flight out of the city, he also had a university exam that afternoon). He was so incredibly sweet with me, telling me he liked me a lot and that he was genuinely disappointed that I had to leave. We started messaging as soon as I landed back in my city and long story short, we arranged that I would fly out to spend time again with him for a week, and he would visit me back in my city the following fortnight. Thankfully, this all did end up happening and it was honestly the highlight of my entire trip.

I had such a wonderful time with him and he kept telling me he felt the same way, at NO point during this time did I feel like I was more emotionally invested than he was. I haven't felt this way about anyone else before and I just can't get over the fact that someone this wonderful actually exists and is actually interested in me! And also that he spent so much time and money just to see me!

Unfortunately, it had to come to an end. As we were waiting for his uber to the airport, we were cuddling and kissing and I was trying to pluck up the courage to tell him how I really felt and that I would like to see him again. Thankfully, he brought the issue up before me. He is expecting to finish studying by the end of next year and was already planning on living in Aus for a year once he's finished. He said that we would definitely see each other then, and also to let him know if I come back to this part of the world before 2020. I was already thinking of coming back next year for another 6 months (different country but still 5hrs drive between our cities), this just makes me more determined to make it happen.

Since we said goodbye, we are still messaging each other a couple of times a week. He makes an effort to keep the conversation going and asks me a lot about what I'm doing and how I am. I told him that I was so happy that I met him (he said he felt the same way) and that I sincerely hope that we do see each other again (he assured me that we definitely will). Its been about 3 weeks since we said goodbye, now I'm feeling anxious and slightly heartbroken about it all.

He is TERRIBLE with his phone; he ignored calls and messages from others the entire time we were together and could easily go an entire day without looking at his phone. Despite knowing this, I find myself feeling nervous if a couple of days pass without a response (especially if I see he was active on social media during this time). I know that this is a ME problem, I need to learn how to manage these crazy, intrusive thoughts. I can't help but worry that I'll eventually lose contact with him or that a couple of months down the track, he'll tell me he's found someone else. We did not discuss any sort of commitment or exclusivity so obviously we are free to do whatever we want. I genuinely don't mind this, as long as I know that further down the track, we'll be able to pick up where we left off.

The most frustrating thing about this all is that I can't do anything about it. In the past, I've been able to seek closure with other guys, break up with people or be dumped or just accept it won't work out and move on. In this case, I just have to wait and hope it falls into place in the future. I guess I need some sort of advice on how to manage intense infatuation + anxious thoughts + an ocean separating us. I'm already cringing at how long this post is and how pointless it may be. If anyone has any advice on how to stifle an infatuation, how to be less anxious when it comes to texts/dating, or how to cope with wanting something you can't have, I'd really really appreciate it!!

TLDR: Met an incredible person overseas, tiny glimmer of hope that we will see each other again in the future, impatient, struggling to be level-headed and chill about this all"
9vxoz5,1,2018-11-10,Asking for a friend (about the new iPad Pro),barbaraisnotreal,ipad,https://www.reddit.com/r/ipad/comments/9vxoz5/asking_for_a_friend_about_the_new_ipad_pro/,"Hi there, my friend is an artist who fell in love with the new Ipad, specifically the 12.9 inches one. She already owns a drawing tablet, but the idea to see her drawings on the screen made her want to step up her game, but here's the ""problem"":

She ONLY has interest in the iPad for drawing, and other minimal functions like web navigation (to search references), social media (to post work-in-progress pieces, also to search for references) and that's about it. She is not an ""Apple person"", only owning an iPod (Nano, 7th Gen, I think) and knowing the basic on how to use a Mac (we used them in out internships for a couple of months). 

I already spoke with her about an iPad being able to go much further, that she can download movies, games and all, but she showed no interest in having all those things with her and told me that she can always download them when she needs (when traveling, for example).

The one thing that 'scared' her is the price (we are from Brazil, and the dollar has been pretty expensive these past years), but I managed to convince her that at least Apple products, when taken care of, can last for a long time and keep up with the annual launches.

Going straight to the point, I'm here to ask if maybe buying the 64gb is more worth to her, since it's only going to be used for drawing. (Also, if she lacks space for her art, upgrading her iCloud for uploading everything may be an alternative). I never owned an iPhone/iPad with that low capacity so I can't say if it really affects how you use them."
9vy958,51,2018-11-10,"The more you train yourself to be free, the less you will suffer from the collapse",flusterer,collapse,https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/9vy958/the_more_you_train_yourself_to_be_free_the_less/,"We are in this predicament because each person is doing what they consider the best for themselves. I cannot convince them otherwise. Even with all the brainwashing, advertisement, herd behavior, agenda pushing, etc. everyone decides ""this is what I want"". But are they really free? As in, how many of their actions are a reaction from fear, anger, hate, shame, greed, or any of their basic instincts?

When I look around, I see victims of this kind of thinking: I *must* do this, I *have to* do that. That is, however, a limiting belief. Only when one has learned to live with the consequences of their decisions, there is freedom, otherwise there is a sense of powerlessness, obligation, and submission.

You can say ""yeah, but if I don't do this job, I won't be able to pay rent"". And I can tell you, that is *your choice*. Nobody can force you to do anything, not even by putting a gun on your head. As long as you are conscious, you *always* have the choice to say no. The question is, are you ready to deal with the consequences of your decisions?

It is *extremely* difficult to reach this kind of freedom. Even if I live a low footprint lifestyle, sometimes I make decisions that have a negative impact on the environment, like taking the plane to visit my family during xmas. It would be much easier for myself and for my family if nobody would take the plane. And still, being fully aware of the consequences of my actions, I choose to do them and carry the guilt with me. Perhaps one day the guilt will be so huge, that I won't dare to do it anymore. Or I will simply understand that my chosen path of non-violence towards the environment is not negotiable. Unfortunately, I'm not there yet.

By being alive we cause suffering to other living beings, some of it can be avoided, some of it not so much. It is by focusing on the harm that can be avoided that we start to be free. Some aspects appear often in this sub: veganism, childfree, simple life. Yet that is only the material aspect. There is also the mental aspect of understanding that each person that choses to do harmful things towards the environment is trapped in a delusion. There is no need to get angry at someone who is totally deluded by materialism. If they were a minority, probably we would intern them in reeducation camps in order to reintegrate them in a sane society based on cooperation and minimal impact on Earth's ecosystems.

But we are in minority, so we can only resist and be as free as we can to say no. No to consumerism, and no to competition. It takes effort and years of training to build the solidity necessary to resist the push of all those running frantically towards the abyss. Maybe this time I failed, or I am not so strong as I wish to be, however it is a necessary step to build strength and resilience. How else would I appreciate the calm of living a low-impact lifestyle if first I hadn't experienced the horror of being complicit with the Cult of Death that our civilization has become? And also, I appreciate that I am not alone in the resistance. I wish that someday each person could start groups in their local area, because that is where the action happens, not on the internet.

These days the atrocities caused by our civ make me suffer less. I know that behind them there are forces that ignorant people haven't learned to harness yet, and because of that they become cogs in the megamachine. I can only try to understand how those forces operate in me, and through that understanding find freedom. In the end building freedom is like building a raft, it requires skill (practice, failure) and finding the right materials (will, opportunity). I might fail, again and again, yet just by trying I am already living the best life. And of course, if I find others on the path, we can build a better raft together.

I recently became independently licensed and am becoming more and more disillusioned with CMH. I'm looking to get out of that setting and getting into private practice. I don't necessarily want to start my own PP just yet, but maybe find a practice to contract with. 

My hope is that working with a PP will enhance my work/life balance, maybe even allowing me to make more money while working less hours. In your experience, is that feasible? We'd like to have another baby sometime soon, but I just can't fathom doing it while working like I am currently. I know lots of awesome people who can manage working in CMH full time while maintaining a home and raising two kids, but I just don't know if I would have that in me. Even just working 30 hours a week would make a huge difference to me. 

Another concern I have is that I've spent the last two years concentrating on getting clinical hours, trying (and failing, most often) to meet productivity, and passing licensure exams, that I haven't had much time to fine tune my clinical identity. I dont have any specialties or much post grad training, which I imagine may hold me back in trying to get into PP. This area is at the top of my career priority list, and I might finally be in the place to concentrate on it. 

I'd love to hear your experiences in moving from CMH to PP. Inspire me. (Or talk me out of it, lol.)"
9vz6w4,435,2018-11-10,An Open Letter to r/NASCAR,Carbinkz,NASCAR,https://www.reddit.com/r/NASCAR/comments/9vz6w4/an_open_letter_to_rnascar/,"Over 4 years ago, I joined the r/NASCAR community, a then small community filled with people who shared common interests as me: watching cars run at speeds unimaginable to the average human, side by side for hours at a time. I think I joined the community around the time of the Dogecoin Josh Wise craze. In the last four years in the community, and the last 19 years as a NASCAR fan, I've been able to see so many highs and lows, dynasties made, hearts broken, championships won and lost in the narrowest of fashions. A week from today, I'll be able to (hopefully) leave my own mark on history on this sport and this community that's given me so much love for so many years.

In 2016, I was able to attend the CAMP 95 program after learning about it on r/NASCAR. It was an opportunity I'll never forget, being able to meet guys like Michael McDowell, Ty Dillon and Dave Winston (then crew chief for the 95).

The CAMP 95 program was the big selling point on my resume to get me my first job in the sport at SS Greenlight Racing in the summer of 2017, right before starting college. It was no easy job by any means, hard work, long hours, knowing that the good days were probably gonna be Top 25's. It was very rewarding, however, learning under the wings of Kenny Evans and the entire No. 07 and No. 99 team, and being able to score two Top 5's in one summer with David Starr and Andy Lally.

It was also last summer that I met one of the engineers at RCR. After coordinating for months after starting college at Duke, it wasn't until the spring of this year that I got an internship secured working for the RCR Xfinity Shop. This summer was amazing, being able to learn from guys like Danny Stockman Jr., Randall Burnett, Chris Rice and Nick Harrison, getting my first career win at Michigan, and having the success that I've had.

Being taken under the wing of Danny Stockman and the entire 21 team, it was an honor to even be considered one of Daniel Hemric's engineers at only 19 years old. And now, after all the hard work that I've put in and everyone else at RCR has, we go into Homestead as one of the four eligible cars to walk out with an Xfinity Series championship in our hands. The thought of being a part of a championship winning NASCAR team at such a young age is mind-boggling, and I'm still grasping at straws at how it's all come together so fast, being with a group of guys to lean on and learn from in order to develop and eventually reach my goal of becoming a Championship winning Cup Series Crew Chief.

And none of it would have been possible without the help of the people and the community of r/NASCAR. Being able to interact with people in the sport like Kenda from LFR, schroll over at HMS, the amazing mod community and all the people on here and in my real life who have supported my dream from Day 1 is an amazing feeling. Hopefully a week from today, Daniel and I can bring home the Xfinity Series championship. For all the fans. For all the people cheering us on. For the record books.

For r/NASCAR

Thank you &lt;3"

I think it might be because I'm not pursuing a computer science or software engineering degree, so I might be getting screened out from a lot of companies just for that reason. I'm senior level in my computer-related degree with a computer science minor.

On my resume, I make it clear that .NET is my focus. I'm applying for internships all over the US, so that I can target .NET internships specifically. I despise front-end web development, so I'd like to stay as far away from that as possible. I'd like to focus on desktop app, mobile apps, and back-end development.

I've been using C# for 6 years. I probably have thousands of hours of experience with C#. 
 
I have a pretty good understanding of object-oriented design principles (SOLID), design patterns, unit testing, Git, MVVM, dependency injection, parallel programming, data structures &amp; algorithms.

I have experience with Xamarin, WPF, XAML, WCF, ADO.NET, Entity Framework, LINQ, MSTest, Moq, Unity Container.

I have a few projects listed on my resume that demonstrate my practical capabilities with WPF, Entity Framework, MSTest, Xamarin, MVVM, WCF with Azure Cloud Services, and more.

I have a GitHub page with several other C# projects and years of commit history (just to my own projects).

I have most of this information on my resume. I'd expect that this would be enough to demonstrate that I'm serious about C# development, and I posses more than just surface-level C# programming knowledge. Why am I struggling to even get phone interviews? 

Any suggestions? Is there something else I should learn? 

I'm thinking I should start a blog and/or contribute to some open source projects. 

I'd really appreciate any help. Thank you. "

9w2rcm,13,2018-11-11,My [24F] boyfriend [25M] of 8 years just dumped me out of the blue and I don’t know what to do,NanaCadabra,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9w2rcm/my_24f_boyfriend_25m_of_8_years_just_dumped_me/,"My partner and I have been together for almost nine years. We were high school sweethearts. I remember having a crush on him for like a year before we started dating. My family and friends always tease me because I was so obsessed with him then. 

Our relationship has always been so strong and good. I’ve never had any doubt that we’re soulmates. I love him so much. I don’t even know who I am without him. We’ve planned kids names and puppy names and talked about the kind of house we’re going to buy one day and the vacations we’ll go on when we retire. There’s never really been an indication that either of us thought this was anything other than a forever thing. 

We’ve definitely had our struggles, though. Almost entirely situational. His interests led him to work outside of our city a lot and end up going to school in another city for two years. then he got a job with six months of training outside our city, and then had to move cities to do that job. My schooling was in a very intense professional program so I was busy too. Despite the long distance we’ve always made it work. One time like four years ago we had a major falling out because he was feeling lonely and as if I wasn’t visiting enough when he was in school. We worked through it and talked and changed some things and it was okay again. We never really fought about anything other than that one time. 

This year he had to move away again for work, and so did I. So this is the furthest we’ve been apart. It’s only for one year - I’m doing a sort of internship in this city I have no intention of staying in, and as soon as I’m done I can move to where he is working. 

I have been so excited, like counting down the days, until I can move in with him. Finally. We picked out a house in his new city together. We moved all of my stuff there and I rented a small, furnished basement suite in the city I am living in for this year. We bought a bed together. We talked about getting a puppy as soon as I moved in. 

Although we’ve been in different cities we have seen each other at least once a month since this started. Mostly I visit him or we meet in the middle, in our original home town. He visited me once. All of these visits were wonderful. We never fought, he never gave any indication that anything had changed and he wasn’t looking forward to me finishing my internship and coming to his city. We also texted a ton and would talk on the phone semi regularly. He’s been struggling at his new job and feeling socially ostracized, so he hasn’t been super happy. He hasn’t said anything at all prior to today about not being happy with us. 

There’s only five more months until I am done and can come be with him. And I got a last minute opportunity to spend the rest of November in his city! So only four months of actually being apart is left. I was over the moon when I found out! He was super busy doing an intensive training course for work this past week, when I found out. So we were barely texting and when I told him I was coming to his city he didn’t seem that excited. I chalked it up to stress and exhaustion from his course. 

Today I started the drive to his city. Just as I was leaving he texted and said he would meet me in the middle. I was confused about why he’d bother doing that, so I told him to call me so we could talk while I drove. He responded “No, I wanna just talk in person.” 

That’s a pretty terrifying text to receive. As I drove I was trying to guess what it would be. I thought someone had died or was sick, maybe he’d found out he was sick, or something had happened at the house in his city that he needed to tell me about before I got there. I knew there was a chance he’d dump me or say he’d cheated. I’m not a complete idiot. But it didn’t make sense to me that that would be it. 

We met in our original hometown just in a parking lot. He came into my car. I asked if everything was okay. It was not. 

He told me he loved and respected me and admired me. He told me that even though he thought I was perfect, he couldn’t make himself be happy with me. He said it was unfair of him to stay with me if he wasn’t happy, because I deserve someone who will fully appreciate me. He said he’s felt this way since the first time he brought up his loneliness about four years ago. He said even when we’d lived in the same city briefly he just didn’t feel connected to me the same way or in love the same way. He said he wants so badly to be happy with me, but just can’t. He said he feels lonely. He said even when we’re together he feels alone. He told me because of this he feels guilty all the time. He said it’s not my fault and there’s nothing I can or should have done differently. And then he said that on top of that, he thinks we want different things in life. He knows I want kids, and he says he doesn’t. Even though we’ve talked about having kids since we were like 18. He says he doesn’t want to get married. He says it would be unfair of him to make me move to his new city, which is smaller and has fewer opportunities for my profession. He said he’s not willing to leave there, ever. He says he doesn’t want to hold me back. 

I told him that I think he’s perfect and that I love him and that there’s literally nothing, not kids or a job or anything else, that I want in my life more than him. I told him I don’t feel like I’m sacrificing anything and he’s made me a better person, not held me back. 

I told him I wished he’d cheated because then I could be angry and that’s when he told me that he does in fact have feelings for someone else. She works with him at his new job. I asked him if she felt the same way and he said “probably”. That indicates to me that he’s at least done some flirting and maybe even talked about where things could go with her. I found her on Facebook and it makes absolutely no sense to me. She’s the kind of girl who posts a million selfies and little life quotes every day. Nothing wrong with that, except that he used to make fun of people like that, unsolicited, all the time. I don’t understand how he’s into her. 

He told me he had talked to his therapist about this and his best friend. And he had fully decided we are over. He wouldn’t change his mind. 

I’m completely devastated and confused. I don’t believe that he’s been unhappy as long as he says. I just can’t believe that he could pretend to be in love with me that long. I know him and I know how these past years have been, and it is unfathomable to me. We have been happy. 

I know it’s been really, really hard this past year and I feel like it’s not a surprise that he’s feeling lonely and unconnected right now. But after how long we have been together it seems unfair to just give up without trying. I don’t understand how he could come to a final decision without ever talking to me about how he’s feeling. I can’t understand why he wouldn’t be open to at least trying to fix it. I feel like when I move there it will be all better, because we will be together again and can reconnect. It’s literally only four more months. How is it not worth it to wait just a little longer, after eight years? If he still loves me, like he said, then I think we owe it to each other to try. 

I begged him to attend couples counselling with me. I asked if he could just stay with me the rest of November, because I have to be there for work now anyways, and just see if that time together helps at all. I told him we could take a break for a few months while I’m still doing my internship and then reassess after that. He outright refused. He’s not willing to work on it. He’s just done. 

When he was breaking up with me, at one point I hugged him. And he completely and totally broke down sobbing. I have never seen him cry this hard. I don’t understand how, if this is really the right decision, it could hurt him so badly. He was berating himself the whole time, asking why I would be comforting him and that he’s a terrible person. I told him I loved him and it was going to be okay and he was perfect. 

I feel like he’s letting his overall loneliness and unhappiness at his new job negatively effect something that is meant to be. I feel like he’s letting his low self esteem dictate what he does - he says he doesn’t deserve me. It doesn’t seem like it’s actually us that is the problem, it’s just that he’s decided he can’t be happy and can’t make me happy. He shouldn’t be able to decide whether he’s enough for me. Especially when I love him so much and am so happy with him. 

I don’t know what to do. Eventually he left and I had to get my parents to pick me up because I couldn’t drive because I was crying so hard. My whole family is shocked. He and I have always been the poster child for a strong, healthy, loving relationship. I can’t eat, I can’t stop crying. I feel awful. 

I feel like this is a mistake. 

I still have to go to his city to work for the rest of November. He said I can stay at our house and he’ll find somewhere else. 

What should I do? 

Should I text him and try to talk again? Should I try to convince him to try to fix it? How can I convince him that this sudden decision isn’t fair to me or to him, and that we owe it to each other and ourselves to at least try to work through it. And even if I convinced him, how can I help us get through it for those four months when I’ll still be in a different city? I don’t know how I can move on knowing we never even tried, that we never both knew there was a problem and then worked on it as a team. 

Should I just give up? If I’m giving up, what am I supposed to do in his house for three weeks with no other support around me. He’s the only one I know there. How am I supposed to handle this in a healthy way in these circumstances? And what do I say when I go to work? My internship sent me to his city because they knew I wanted to work there after I finished. It’s essentially an extended interview. Do I lie to them and maintain I want to be there, and then change my mind once I’m back in my internship city? 

I’ll truly appreciate any advice, because I’m just at a complete loss. 

TLDR: Very long term, currently long distance boyfriend dumped me out of the blue two days before I was set to come work in his city for the rest of November. I think it was a mistake and we shouldn’t break up. What should I do?"
9w35uc,1,2018-11-11,Here We Go,poor_icarus,u_poor_icarus,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_poor_icarus/comments/9w35uc/here_we_go/,"So my mother called me yesterday, said she sent me some money so I can make my long journey home. Earlier, I had informed the landlady I was moving out of this beautiful, brick-walled room next week. 

So here we go, this is it! 

I'll have to say that deep down, I am actually glad I manage to complete this internship. 

To be honest, I don't mean to get all emotional tonight, but let me tell you that at one point, I was even crying non-stop in the pantry as Azin, my superior, confronted me regarding my reckless behavior. The office was dark as it was Earth Hour, and all I could see was his eyes staring back at me. It was probably the worst day of my life, even worse than when I got transferred, but it was the turning point I needed. 

He asked me why he should let me continue and on Monday, I came up with five reasons. 

After that day, I respected my attendance, and even when I was sick I still came to work. And I stopped going for lunch early and coming back, except for the occasional times, when something got in the way. 

It got easier after I understood the rules and started learning how to make compromises, and sometimes I wonder if it's a mistake to adapt a little too late in the game, which in a way, it is indeed a mistake, but would I change the past if I could? No, not really. Because, one day, I will fully understand what it all means. 

Anyway, I'll miss being greeted by the operators as I walk past by the assembly line. I take it back saying some of them are mean, because the nice and sweet ones are all that matter. They can look big and scary, but inside they are different. 

I will miss being given the side-eye by certain snotty people as I do my morning exercise. 

I will miss talking to the regular faces in the office. They're the happiest and tolerant group I know. 

I will miss the metal staircases and green walkways and the sight of heavy machines and cars being lifted as they get assembled. I will miss driving to work as the sun rises and back home as it rains. 

I woke up today to a message from Rene. He's still in Colombia. He said Asian boys are better than Colombians. I cheekily replied by saying that is a given. I miss him, it's been a long time since Bangkok, and when I think that after this internship, I'll get to visit him in the Netherlands, see those pair of bright blue-green eyes again, and tread on Dutch snow and go to coffee bars and celebrate real Christmas, I feel a little less sad about leaving Perodua.  

Yes, I'll admit, even if I never feel like I belong here in this factory, even if I said many terrible things about this place and its inhabitants in the past, I feel sad, because of all the struggles and triumphs I experienced and the people I've gotten to know and adore. Can't just let it all go, you know? 

I'll never make any more memories with anyone from the 'office atas' again. 

It's not just about them, or leaving, it's also about how short this life is, how impermanent everything is, how fast time goes, how in the end, you don't get to take anything with you, as even keepsakes get lost or broken -- you can only remember. "
9w3kd9,0,2018-11-11,UPDATE: He(19M) found out that he is the father of my(27F) unborn child.,flmlflml,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9w3kd9/update_he19m_found_out_that_he_is_the_father_of/,"[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9vurkv/he19m_found_out_that_he_is_the_father_of_my27f/)

&amp;#x200B;

So we met each other. We were both quiet at first. I started the conversation. I told him everything. My feelings. The reason for that night. Everything I wrote in the previous post. Actually writing it all down on reddit helped me a lot. It made me gather my thoughts. Also the support from people through comments and private messages is something I'm grateful for. 

He listened to everything without saying a word. After I finished he touched my belly all of a sudden. I dont know what was going on his mind but he had a happy expression. Then he shared his part. 

He told me he always had a crush on me since his teenage years. But when he started living opposite to me he was surprised by the real me. (I wear really lousy clothes when I'm home alone like mens boxers and stuff. But in front of his family I always dress prim and proper. His sister was a tomboy so their mom for her satisfaction made me wear girly clothes outside all the time.) He was disappointed that his first love's image that he had in his mind was completely shattered. However staying with me all the time made him look at me in different ways. Anyways he never thought of crossing the line with me because of all the people related to us. So he pushed the thought out of his mind even though he was tempted some times.

When he finally made a new girlfriend, he was infatuated with her. (As he was talking about her, it made me a bit sad but I didnt say anything and let him continue.) But slowly he started missing the time he spent with me. He would try to make excuses so that he could go home when he was with her like how he has to make dinner for me, look after my cat and so on. His girlfriend finally got frustrated with him and left.(Before breaking up, she cheated on him with one of his first friends he made after coming here.) Remembering those days made him a bit sad. He told me that he was even depressed for a month though he didnt try to worry me with that as it was an important time for my business. 

Then came the talk about that night. He loved my cat too. Seeing her pass away was the first time he was dealing with death so closely. He didnt know how to feel that day. It was as if he was tugging along not knowing what to do. But when I kissed him, at first he was like is this even happening. He was genuinely shocked. He told me so many thoughts were running through his mind like do I like him, or I am just doing it because I'm feeling lonely. Me kissing him was also clouding his mind or so he tells me. He then reasoned it out by saying he blocked out everything and just focusing on me and his feelings for me. (While he was talking about this topic he had gotten completely red and was fumbling with his words. Looking at him closely I realized how much I like him.)

However what I did the next day had hurt him a lot. He said that he had opened his heart only to have it crushed. Me blocking him made him very angry. Anyways he became busier with his internship and pushed me and his feelings for me to the back of his mind. After he came back he tried to act normal but seeing my suspicious behavior (I was trying to hide my pregnancy) he assumed that I had become interested in some other guy and was only trying to hide it from him so as to not hurt him.

But when he heard that I was pregnant and also that he was the father his mind went completely blank. He had thought of this scenario occurring since we didnt use any protection that day but he couldnt imagine that it would become real. After he stormed out of the apartment the day before yesterday he ran two blocks and came across a dad with his baby in the stroller. And thats when he realized that now he is a father too. 

Anyways we talked about our future and I'm not going to go into much details but we have decided to live together at least until the baby is old enough or till the time he completes his university. Since we both have feelings for each other we have decided to get into a pseudo-relationship and test it out. Rules being we cant see anybody else, being completely honest with each other and prioritizing the baby. (All of this was thought up by him). And if things develop further we'll think about it then.

We are still discussing about the future.

As for my best friend, being Alex's sister she gave him a good thrashing. She only stopped when I told her that she is going to become an aunt. She has also decided to support all my decisions in the future. We are still planning on how to bring up the topic of my pregnancy with his parents. However at this point of time in my life I feel completely relieved like a huge burden has been lifted from my shoulders. Its amazing how support from the people you love can be so precious.

Thank you everyone for your supportive messages."
9w3sbx,4,2018-11-11,5 years with unmotivated bf [21] is it time to end it and how?,sarcasticoverthinker,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9w3sbx/5_years_with_unmotivated_bf_21_is_it_time_to_end/,"I am a F [20] and bf is [21]

Short version: Boyfriend of 5 years not motivated, not being healthy (no gym and poor eating habits), very adamant about doing things his way, never does anything without being asked. If I’m upset he says I’m exaggerating or being ridiculous and laughs. He also does anything his friends want and won’t reschedule things with them if something with us comes up. Continue to try and fix or end it?  

Long version: I’ve been with my boyfriend since high school and I have recently graduated college and began my higher level education.  I am a very motivated person, while bf kind of figures things out as they come. He has no internship experience/no jobs for after graduation and is not looking for any. While that’s a big part, it’s not the biggest. He is very stubborn and if I suggest doing something a certain way he says that it’s too much or doesn’t make sense so why would he do it that way. He never does anything without being asked. He won’t do dishes, take out the trash, pick me up somewhere-unless I ask. If we’re in a group with my friends he’s on his phone most of the time and not trying to talk. He also does the same in front of my parents. He’s told me that he doesn’t come over to do chores or socialize with my parents. He is also on his phone while at holiday parties or he’ll be cling to my hip and asking if I can just spend time with him.  I’ve recently moved far from home so getting to know my friends is really important to me. He also complains about his grandparents who are saints and do anything and everything for him (he lost both his parents who he was not very close to within the past 4 years). Also I’m Hispanic and family and respect are important values to me. I feel like he’s disregarding them. He also hasn’t surprised me with anything like flowers or a care package to show he’s thinking of me. I think in the 5 years we’ve been together I’ve gotten flowers 3 times (2 graduations 1 Valentine’s Day). If his friends are rude to me he literally does nothing. They’ve made me sit in the back seat of road trips in my bfs car (despite me telling my bf beforehand that I didn’t wanna sit in the back). One friend yelled at me to shut up because they were slut shaming a girl because she didn’t wanna hook up with him and I defended her. I’ve literally made food for him and his friends and got them drinks when they couldn’t.  And nothing from my bf. Even my parents have said something about his treatment towards me. He has also gained a significant amount of weight and grew a beard (which I hate). I also have gained some weight but am working really hard to lose it. I exercise daily and do my best to eat as healthy as possible. He does not and being around his eating habits make mine worse. I’ve tried to talk to him saying it’s not about the looks but I just want us both to be healthy. When he visits me at my new university about 5-6hrs from him and when we were in college together, he would come over and just want to have sex.  We cannot lay down and watch a movie together without him trying to have sex. When I tell him I don’t want to hell say “oh I haven’t seen you in forever and you never wanna have sex” or he’ll say “sorry you just turn me on so much” and he’ll continuously ask until I just say yes then he says “oh well I don’t want it like that”. I think all of these issues I have with him are decreasing my interest in him and have not made me want to be physical with him. I’ve been feeling this way for over a year now. I’ve talked to him about all of these things and he always says he’ll change but I feel like now he’s just saying it to appease me and never changes. I’m just lost, because I’m just tired of being constantly behind him or like I’m nagging him. He’s not a bad guy, but I just want more and more motivation. I appreciate him driving to my university to see me, but we always wind up staying in and him trying to have sex. If we go out he says we didn’t spend much time together. I just want someone who is motivated to pursue their career, surprises me with things just to show their thinking of me, and engages with my friends and my family. Am I asking too much? Do I stay with him? If I do want to break up with him how do I do it? I’m worried that he’d be alone without me since he doesn’t have parents. "
9w4w2g,4,2018-11-11,Here’s a list of some the really shitty things I put up with.,Punsnotbuns,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/9w4w2g/heres_a_list_of_some_the_really_shitty_things_i/,"There were many beautiful things about him but I need to stop romanticizing our relationship. A lot of history between us and I know he cared for me, even though none of this will make it sound like he did. But I’m pulling out the shittiest of things he did. 

If i has to give him a ride somewhere in the winter, he would sit in my car while I scraped off the ice. And if we were going somewhere together and no close parking spaces were left, he would make me drop him off and then I’d find a parking spot myself and walk there.

He couldn’t remember when my birthday was. Only because of Facebook.

He stopped complimenting me.

He made fun of me for not finding an internship

On Valentines Day he spent a lot on me. Which he made very clear. He bought me dinner and when we got back to his place he opened the door to his room and said “that’s for you.” There were flowers, a box of chocolates, and cupcakes. He told me the cupcakes were $12 and they were the cheapest thing. And he also said “i was thinking about accidentally leaving the price tag on everything.” I appreciate that he got something but he was an ass about it. And he didn’t even get me anything O liked. I don’t like cupcakes or the chocolates he got me. Wish he knew me better than to just give me such a cliche gift.

He stopped foreplay and cuddling after sex. Would go straight to his phone.

Once while making out he started to push my head down. I asked if all he wanted was a blowjob, and he smiled. I responded I was in the mood too and wanted to have sex. He sighed heavily and said fine. 

And when over the summer you kept getting more and more distant. And when I asked what was wrong and if you wanted to break up you said nothing was and he didn’t want to. And then you pulled further away. I gave you an out and you said no.

9w548t,5,2018-11-11,"BO4 Issues, please fix soon (lol)",Mr_Grinch_Z,Blackops4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Blackops4/comments/9w548t/bo4_issues_please_fix_soon_lol/,"**Net-Code/Hit Detection**

Ok, Master Prestige now, lots of time looking at problems and issues etc etc.  

I play on an Optimized Setup: 

     \*Gaming Monitor

     \*Been gaming competitively online and at tournaments for years (CoD, Halo, Smash Brothers, other fighting games, etc)

     \*Port's Forwarded, all systems Open

     \*IPv6 

\*Hardwired (Honestly shouldn't even have to say this but someone missed it so fixing)  \*\*Edited to Add this\*\*

     \*I live in the Washington DC area which is next to 2 of the largest Data Centers in the country

     \*Threw that in there before anyone tries to say ""Check your Connection"" don't even try it. 

Something's up with your Net-Code for this game.  It almost seems like the TreyArch team reverted back to BO2's Net-Code for this game for some reason.  

My reasoning?  Hours of recorded gameplay where my shots are landing dead-on (and yes, I went back and checked frame by frame) and a lot of them just.. Don't register.  So it's either an issue with the Net Coding, or the hit boxes and Character Animations are not lining up.  Oh, and yes this was with my own capture device, not the Theatre mode. This was not an issue in BO3 and it wasn't an issue in the Beta either so I'm inclined to think it's something up with the Net Code (like why would you mess with the hitbox profiles post launch???)  Actually, I'm almost certain you guys flipped back to BO2 code just so you could save time and money trying to Rehook the Theatre mode to modern coding... I'd be willing to bet lol. 

For a Gaming Company that would probably like to think of themselves as at least somewhat prestigious this is TERRIBLE.  This would very easily make you the laughing stock of the FPS gaming companies, you have to fix this immediately.  Servers are not that expensive relatively and you guys make Billions where your rivals provide much greater stability with not even the same scope of Profits.  It's hilarious.  Infinity Ward and even lolSledgehammer does better than this xD  

Covered the Game's Net-Coding/Hit Detection issues, moving on...

**Spawn Logic**

I will admit it's a little less Chaotic but only a little, this is still an ongoing issue.  

**Maps**

I like the new maps, they are  for the most part pretty good.  However you guys really need to stop bringing back the old maps, especially the tiny ones.  They are literally too small to facilitate modern gameplay and movement mechanics. 

Firing Range, Slums, and Summit are almost perfectly Spawn -&gt; Turn Left -&gt; Shoot and now you guys are bringing Nuketown back Tuesday... With this game's buggy net coding and oddball spawn logic, I'm literally going to just sit in back and Spawn-Kill people through walls with the FMJ-II Titan.  I'm not even playing around here, if you put me on a trash map, I am trolling lol.  Just like when lolSledgehammer thought reviving Shipment would be a good idea.. and we all remember how that went... Don't even think about it.  

Stick with the Medium Sized/Large maps, those provide the overall best playing experience.  Open up some polls here on Reddit or something if you want to verify. 

Add just ONE or TWO maps that are about Stonehaven's size ish so the Snipers and Sneakybois can have their fun (Icebreaker does NOT work because the map is convex and screws with the sight lines that these players like)  

**TDM is trash for XP**

This is a pretty bad issue that the single most popular game type by a mile is one of the least rewarding in the game :/  Please adjust the XP formula for this mode, or better yet just increase it to TDM-100 like it has been for the last few years.  Actually why on earth did you change it in the first place? Stop letting the interns contribute, they take out the trash and buy the coffee, thats all.  Literally hurts nothing at all for this game to have 25 more kills in it.  

**Some Perks are literally broken/useless**

I'm not going to go too far into this, I know you guys are already being bombarded with the Youtube Videos.  But yeah, you should look at getting these fixed.  

**Gun Balancing**

So people weren't using SMGs very much at first.. And you guys obviously want people to use SMGs so in the first weapon balance update, you should naturally beef up the SMGs to make them more appealing right?   Yeah... you guys let the interns handle this one and they decided to make nearly every other weapon before it weaker... That's terrible logic lol Especially in a game where it feels like we're shooting marshmellows.  We want the guns to be stronger, the TTK is too slow overall.  And it didn't really even fix the issue, people are largely not using the SMGs even now from what I can see so I guess you're going to nerf the other weapons again instead of fixing the actual problem.  Incoming average shots to kill being adjusted to 8 hits minimum. 

Bullet Proof Soldiers, Baby!!

**9-Bang**

Yeah, just remove this from Multiplayer altogether, Ajax is plenty broken just with his Ridonkulous Shield, take this thing out for the love of God..  Replace it with a Smoke Grenade or something instead.  Ohhhh good idea: Make it so that Ajax's gun is now the Special Equipment and his Shield just be only a shield unless you have both up and use both.  This removes 9-Bang, gives Ajax a power weapon to use on occasion and properly powerbalances the Shield so that you can't just shoot through it unless you wait until you have both your Special AND Equip up simultaneously.  But no matter how you look at it, the entire community 100% hates this thing.  We'd much prefer it be removed entirely or at least make it so that the Tac Mask almost outright negates it, that way we'd have to pay a price if we want to not worry about it. 

**Body Armor**

You've been making good efforts to nerf this thing's effectiveness but that is Not the correct answer.  Remove it completely from Multiplayer.  Keep it in Blackout or Heist but it has no place normal Multiplayer.  Never has, never will.  I'm a Pipefitter Superintendent and if you lot were working for me, I guaruntee whoever made that decision would be fired without remorse.  In no survey ever made has anyone made even one positive remark about Body Armor.  

**Matchmaking logic is trash**

The algorithm has a nasty habbit of pitting players against overwhelming odds.  Example, I usually play alone or with 1 or 2 friends usually and for some reason, the game feels it acceptable to put all of the random, non-teamed and legitimately weaker players on one team (Mine) against an enemy team comprised of several 2-3man units.  Like.. why not balance the units against each other? Does the Algorithm genuinely think that because I'm a 3+ KD, I'm going to magically carry the game?  Even in Objective modes where stats like that don't even matter? Seriously???  Now obviously, if you're against a 5-man, it is what it is but it really should make better efforts to put teams against similarly balanced teams.  Otherwise, you'll just end up with tons of bad games where people keep leaving every two seconds because it literally STARTED Pear-Shaped lol. 

**Gold/Diamond/DarkMatter**

Revisiting this again, I am severely disappointed in how you guys have handled Gold/Diamond/DarkMatter in this game.  They look amazing.. but only if you get a Nuke.. that's a stupidly steep condition to get the full awesomeness of the Camo especially after all of the hard work put into getting these camos in the first place.  You've gotta do something about this, it's a slap in the face to wave this in our faces like this when the game is only a shell of what it should be. 

Propositions:

     \*Make it so the kill counter does not reset on Death.  This will make it so instead of needing a full-blown Nuke (Extremely hard to do) You will instead need to get 30 Gun kills to have your Big-Shiney.   This will allow players to get that sweet satisfaction while having it still be decently challenging.  It's not that easy to just up and get 30 kills in any game believe it or not, especially in game modes that aren't as long lived as Hardpoint or Domination.  

     \*Make some fashion of Master Craft-esque Challenge that will either straight up Jump the Camo to max tier or cut it's requirements in half altogether. 

     \*Lastly you can make this a Prestige Master Award (I hate this idea but it would work in your favor)  Make it so that certain Prestige Levels count as Pre-Kills for all Reactive Camos across the board.  That way anyone a certain level up (or knowing you bastards, MP-1000) would start with Purple-Strobe/Rainbow Diamond/Purple Spike right away so they can REALLY show off the camo in all it's splendor.  As I said, I don't like this idea but it would solve your MP Rewards dilemma so you don't end up ousted by the community like lolSledgehammer did in lolWWII and it would give players incentive to really push for MP-1000 like you want.  

**Create-A-Class is Bugged**

     \*Right now (I play Xbox) any and all Custom Classes made in the 7th slot or further lock and remove the Equipment slot in game.  In one of the prior update notes it was stated that it was fixed.  It clearly was not and video proof can be provided upon request.

     \*As of right now, in the Opening Lobby, characters will only hold Main-Weapons.  So if you're only equipping a Knife or Shotgun or Pistol, your Character will only stand there with his/her fists.  I don't mind going Kong-Fu-Hustle but sometimes I just wanna show off my fancy Shotgun :/

     \*In the Create-A-Class some weapon displays are straight bugged (this is actually hilarious)  Like please help me understand why the Fast-Mags attachment for the VAPR-XKG adds straps and padding for the **HANDLE** of the Gun xD.  And its not even all the way on there, it's like stuck in Space lol.  Like how did this make it past your QCs?  Wait, do you even have QCs? O.o;  You need a QC department....  You managed to fix the issue with the Saug 9mms floating in space at the Opening Lobby but you only hold one gun even if Akimbo'd.  You've literally never had this problem before and you guys had some GOOFY weapons in BO3 so I'm surprised and disappointed.  

**XP Rewards for Scorestreaks is trash**

For some very strange reason, you guys made it so that the XP Medals for almost every scorestreak is basically garbage but the question is why?  And no, I'm not talking about the In-Game Score, I'm talking about the post-game XP awarded for having gone through all the trouble earning the Streak in the first place.  Like if you sweat and earn a Strike Team, every kill they earn is only worth 25 xp.. That's such a huge let down lol.  We all want to rank up as fast as possible  and we all want using Scorestreaks to be WORTH IT but as things are right now, you're literally far better off just killing everyone with your Gun/Special Weapons.  The only exception being the Gunship, I think that one offers 100 XP per kill but ALL Streaks should be this way not just the most expensive one in the game.  Right now the XP rates are abysmal for the average player's amount of free time.  In my case, I had a 2 week Furlough so I had tons of free time but most people only get 3 or 4 hours a day after work/school and that's only if they don't have a wife and kids.  At the moment you guys are not trying to help your fans even remotely and that's terrible.  

**Black Market is trash**

The Youtubers are already tearing you a new one over this so I won't go too far into it.  But we want weapons and Variants, **NOT** Outfits.  Thanks to that one YouTuber that got curious and dropped $1000 maxing your Black Market out we come to find out that out of alllll that flak, there was only one hidden Gun Variant which was the Boombox for the SG12...  $1,000 for only one piece of what we actually want to see?  That's just shady xD I'm sorry, there's no getting around that, not even Trump would do something that sleezy lol.  Like you guys put every ""EA-Money Monger"" meme to shame xD.  

&amp;#x200B;

**TRANSPARENCY**

Before I forget, please for the love of god get better about being Transparent about what you plan on doing with the game.  Every game I have ever played always had a list of patch notes attached to every update.  In fact, you could literally read them while the update was downloading usually.  I don't think there's a single soul out there that wouldn't want you guys to be more vocal and clear about what you're planning to do, or tweak or add.  In literally every line of work that's ever existed, open communication has always been crucial and that's because IT WORKS.  I strongly recommend you adopt this into your policies.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Well there you have it, that's the current list of things to be fixed in the game as of 11/11/2018

Thank you for reading 

And I'm not here to put the game down, I want it to be better.  ON PAPER, this game is GOOD but these goofballs keep making stupid, stuuuupid mistakes and it's ruining the experience.  So I'm hoping this reaches them and they realize where they're screwing up.  

If nothing else, I tried.  "

I was social enough not get bullied and I guess smart enough to get descent marks to go to a relatively prestigious university. I go to university, and the first year was GREAT. I got fit, social, had tons of friends, good grades and was finally starting make some effort with girls. Sure I was an edgy kid, believed in stupid shit like militant atheism, and read and pretended to understand people like Nietzsche, but how I acted generally reflected what I believed, no matter how shallow my belief structures were, which is more than I could say about myself today. I only had a surface level understanding of the shit I believed in but didn't  hold me back from making loud reaching proclamations. 

&amp;#x200B;

Second year I started smoking a lot of weed. At first it was great, 420, legalise weed bro!! and all that cooked shit. But I also started chilling with a somewhat domineering mate, and all we would do was get high and argue. Soon I realised I didn't care enough about my beliefs to really argue for days, and spent my days getting high and watching movies instead. I started making less effort with the academics, women and just the process of making and keeping friends. Lo and behold my grades plummeted and I started to get a taste of not giving a shit and putting in zero effort. It was also end of this year that I got in some trouble with the law. My parents were involved, I was embarrassed, they were sad and found it difficult talking to them ever since (The record got expunged because of the nature of crime and because the cops could tell I was a good little boy). 

&amp;#x200B;

Third year I got acclimated to the  uni schedule of doing jack shit and then cramming for assignments and exams.  I got through and started my masters in Physics. The first semester, I told myself I cant hack it and dropped out. I took a year off, worked at a job where I do absolutely nothing and get paid for it. It was then I realised I was pretty bad at everything, you know like basic life skills, but cramming for exams. Now I really stopped making an effort. My parents pressured me to go back to uni, so decided to jump in the really employable field of Computer Science, because ""surely I would get a job here in this field, surely it had been my major and not my abominable work ethic that was stopping me from getting a desirable job"".  I have started doing my masters in computer science now and am looking for an internship. I have not found one.

&amp;#x200B;

BTW, I am also currently living with teenagers, I mean 18-20 year olds. Which means party and drugs every weekend. So now my weekly schedule is watching motivational videos, listening to self improvement audio books, getting motivated, getting excited, getting pumped,  getting hyped, going out, getting smashed, getting hungover, getting depressed, feeling guilty, feeling lazy and losing all will to give it another go. I have forgotten how to make an effort, I am lagging behind five years, hanging out with bunch of teenagers I think I starting to be 20 at 25. So decision I have to make is:

&amp;#x200B;

* a) Be a 25 year old when I am 30
* b) Be a 25 year old now

Obviously b), right, so why is brain making me select a) every day. It's like I spend 90 percent of the day not giving a shit and 10 percent of the day giving a little shit. So I need your advice boys. How do I land an internship/job? How do I make friends with similar interests? How do repair my relationship with my parents?  How do I get a girlfriend (I need a bosom to cry on, goddammit, amongst other things I guess)? But most importantly, How do I make an effort? How do I not give up or feel content after 7 days of making an effort, only to spend the next 30 days feeling guilty and depressed for finishing the entire series of friends and Seinfeld instead of doing something productive. I need something, give me a reading list, offer me a slap on the face, kick on the behind, give me words of wisdom, an action plan, killer app, anything man, I am really starting to bottom out. I have read books, downloaded apps and made a routine, but my future self keeps betraying me, I need love that guy once more, treat him right, make him happy, take him around the world, buy him good shit, make him loved by his family and friends, make him someone I and his future self would be proud of but he makes it so hard to trust him, to make an effort to nurture him because he keeps on fucking me up at every moment of weakness, he fucks us all up.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I have been in conscious comatose for 5 years my comrades, I need your help to relearn life. Or in other words, HOW THE FUCK DO I MAKE AN EFFORT AND KEEP MAKING IT FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE?"
9w6gzn,3,2018-11-11,My Girlfriend Cheated. I'm broken. How do I,allofthethrowaways_,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9w6gzn/my_girlfriend_cheated_im_broken_how_do_i/,"This is a long one, and a throwaway, I'm sorry, but I just needed to write it down. Whatever you can offer me to help will be much appreciated. I've also posted in a couple of other subs in search of help. I hope that's ok.

We (me M/35, her F/38) have been going out for 2.5 years. We met online in March 2016 and instantly got on well together. When we met she was enrolled to start a masters degree that new academic year (September) at a University that is 2.5hrs (and £65) away on the train. We started sleeping together after the 2nd or 3rd date and the dates and sex were great. She suffers from depression and quite severe anxiety, but it's ok, because I'm pretty good at reading her and knowing when to back off, or when she needs a hug or just to chat, and understand when she's not up to being more intimately physical. I'm fine with that.

She struggled to sleep at night due to her anxiety and overthinking everything that happened during the day and stressful things that were coming up, such as finding accommodation for Uni, whether she was too old to start a career change, but said to me more than once that she slept the best she'd ever slept when I was with her because we would talk about her worries and stresses before going to sleep to get it all out of her head. She has occasional mood swings when she's not dealing with life very well, but in between she is sweet and kind and loving. Hugs in front of the telly in the evening were my favourite moments.

I helped her choose and buy a car that she would need for Uni, I helped her find accommodation and move all of her belongings (an apartment's worth) to her new house near Uni (3 hours by car). Throughout her course, I helped her with her projects; proof-reading, doing artwork for some of the projects which needed it, helping her practice and refine presentations and keeping her generally ""pepped up"", throughout her course. I visited as often as I could (every 2-3 weeks on average, occasionally it would be a month). She was constantly doubting her abilities, always saying her projects were crap, that she wasn't good enough and couldn't retain the information. I reassured her and told her that they were (genuinely) great and she was doing well. She was getting 2:1s and Firsts in all her projects. She completed the course with a First Class Master's degree and was awarded best student prize for the entire year. The Uni is now publishing one of her articles in their own journal. I was (and am) so proud of her and went to her graduation as a guest, along with her mum with a big smile on my face.

Part of her anxiety means she has real trouble making decisions. Everything from what car to buy, to what job to apply for, to what shoes to wear, whether she wants tea or coffee, and, if she's in the right relationship. This started to put a strain on our physical relationship while she was at Uni. Sex happened less and less - to the point where we hadn't had sex in 3 months or so. We talked about it and she said she sometimes had doubts about whether I was ""the one"". Knowing her anxieties, I understood and reassured her that it was ok and we can work on it and make sure we communicate about how we're feeling. Things got better, and after uni she came and stayed with me whilst working in various jobs related to her degree.

While she was staying with me (September-December), we didn't have sex. I understood that she was under stress, trying to find the job she wanted, so was I patient and understanding. Over Xmas 2017, she got confirmation of a 3-month internship in a prestigious organisation related to her degree that would be amazing on her CV. But it was in Gothenburg, Sweden. I encouraged her to go for it. It would be amazing for her and the experience would definitely get her the job she wanted and I could go and visit her and we'd have fun in Sweden together! She left at the end of April this year. We didn't have sex before she left. I was disappointed, but understanding - we were still having our hugs. We were getting her ready for the internship, finding accommodation, we found an AirBnB that would let her stay for 3 months, I would take care of her car, we put all her stuff in storage, so she was stressed. That's ok.

In Gothenburg we texted every day and she was enjoying the work. I went to visit her for a week halfway through the 3-moth term. The weather was insanely hot. We went swimming in the lakes, stayed in a little chalet on an island off the coast - it was great. No sex. She was worried about the work and whter she was good enough and still worried about whether this career change was the right thing to do. Coming up to a year without sex.

I come home from Gothenburg, and we are still texting everyday. But the texts get less fun. They become small-talky. How's the weather? How was your day? etc. I start to worry that the relationship might be failing and confide in my best friend that this might not be working. One or two nights here and there we would fall asleep before texting goodnight, or one of us had been out with friends and forgotten to text goodnight. No biggy.

Fast forward to the end of July this year, when she comes back from the internship to stay with me until she finds a job here. We start talking about us and why we haven't had sex in a year. She said because every time I approach her to be intimate, she suddenly tenses up and becomes anxious and overthinks us all over again. Even though I've been the most supportive and loving guy she ever been with and she loves me, something inside her stops her wanting to be intimate.

We agree that maybe the relationship isn't working and decide to call it off. It's a very emotional chat and we agree to still be best friends, because we still are, and that she can stay with me until she finds a job and somewhere to live.

While staying with me, our relationship actually improves. We talk more openly about what we're feeling. How we feel about each other. We even have sex! 3 times in 2 weeks! We start to discuss that, maybe, if we can work through it this might turn out well for us after all, as long as we don't put pressure on each other to be coupley or intimate.

Fast forward to 6 weeks ago. She sees her dream job. It's exactly what she studied for. Its very senior though, and in Stockholm, Sweden, so she definitely won't get it - she has the qualifications, but not the experience or the language, but it's good practice to apply. I help her with the application and we send it off and think nothing of it. 2 days later, she is invited for a Skype interview. We get her prepared and I help her practice answering the questions. She's super-anxious now.

She has the interview while I'm at work. It went badly. She mumbled some of her answers and her mind went blank a couple of times and she came across as shy and unconfident. So she thought.

She got the job. So, I helped her get ready to move. We packed up all the stuff that had been taken out of storage after the first time, and found a new storage place. We talk about how great the job would be, and if we work out, maybe I could find a way to join her there in 6 moths or so, or if she doesn't like it, she'll come back and if we' still feel the same way, we can settle here - take it slow. It's not the ideal situation, but I'm proud of her for getting the dream job she wanted. After all that work, stress, tears, patience, maybe there's a chance we can be happy.

I went to Sweden with her last Sunday and helped her carry her big bags to her new place there. We go exploring the city, doing museums and discovering the nice areas and bars. But she's being reserved and retracting into herself again. So we talk about it and she's still not sure about us. We agree that maybe it would be best if we stay friends after all. That's ok. We'd rather be happy friends than an unhappy couple.

At the same time, during the week - I start to get niggly feelings. Not major and with no evidence, but I start to remember bits and pieces from when she was in Gothenburg. She'd been out and about with the two guys that owned the AirB'nB quite a lot. And had mentioned how one of them in particular was really easy going and nice to talk to. I thought that was great at the time. She can have trouble socialising sometimes, and I was happy that she'd been making an effort to be social.

I checked Facebook and noticed that he had liked nearly all of her posts recently. Once, while she was messaging someone on Facebook Messenger, I wasn't looking, but caught a glimpse of her list of recent chats and he was near the top.

So, yesterday, on my last day in Sweden, and we parted to be friends, I asked her directly, ""Did anything happen between you and either of the guys in Gothenburg?"". She started crying and said yes. They had something one night after she came back to the AirB'n'B drunk. I asked if they'd slept together. She said yes. She said they sat up chatting after she got home, and he came and sat next to each other. The they started kissing and they had sex.

I'm utterly, utterly devastated. She said she hated it and doesn't know why she did it. But she was down and anxious about us at the time and he provided her with comfort. He'd even met me while I was there.

I want to get one thing straight. I don't hate her. I hate what she did. She's not a bad person. She has problems. She's a good person that did a bad thing. And I know that for a fact. We talked about it all night and I made her tell me everything. I know she didn't tell me every detail, but she told me how it started and where it happened and what happened after. I know she is also devastated, having never done anything like it before and totally against anyone who cheats up until now. I left Sweden this morning and have just got home.

But I can't stop thinking about them together. I couldn't stop thinking about it the whole flight. I can't stop thinking about them sitting next to each other, and starting to kiss. I can't stop thinking about the moment she would have put her hand on his crotch. Then down his pants. And then they would have gone to the bedroom and took off each other's clothes. She would have wanked him off. That's what she did to me. She liked to do it. Then he would have got on top of her or vice versa and she would have been looking into his eyes as she put him inside her. She said the sex was shit and she didn't orgasm. But I know he did.

I looked through all our texts and have found the evening I think it happened. I texted her good night and she didn't reply. She texted me the next day to say she been out and drunk far too much and was feeling hungover and down. That was it. That was the day.

I can't stop it going around and around in my head over and over again. We were still together at that point. Yes we were struggling, but we loved each other. I can't understand why she didn't think of me through each of those steps. Wy didn't she think of me when they started kissing? Before she took his penis and made it hard? My chest constantly aches.

I agreed to call her this evening. So we can talk over it more matter-of-factly after cooling down. But it's still going round. And round. And round. Every time I close my eyes. Every time I look at my phone. I'm known amongst my friends for always being happy and up for a laugh, but I'm broken.

I don't know what to do with myself. I haven't eaten since dinner yesterday. I can't. I'm smoking like a chimney. I've avoided alcohol, because that surely won't help. I'm beside myself. I can't distract myself from it. Please tell me what to do.

9w6vro,2,2018-11-11,What are some underrated and often overlooked things that students should learn in STEM universities?,WhaleConductor,STEM,https://www.reddit.com/r/STEM/comments/9w6vro/what_are_some_underrated_and_often_overlooked/,"I'm a freshman in Germany (Electronics\* Eng) and to be honest I am kinda naive to the whole aspect of ""engineering = very good salaries"", even though I didn't choose these studies entirely on that aspect. With that said, I am willing to work my butt off to make sure that I will have a proper chance in this very competitive environment.

Now, like most students in around me, I am pretty ignorant about the whole engineering field and its opportunities and complexities. What I do know is that this is amongst the only fields I was ambitious to study and advance in.

So help a younger brother out and explain what I should expect or look into, like what skillsets employers search for the most (soft eng, communication eng, physics, maths, CADs), or what skills are pretty helpful to have as an add-on to my CV. My uni is near an enormous factory (that funded said uni) and that place reeks of internship potential.

Now, the subjects in my uni are pretty broad (in terms of the quantity of what they teach) and that's why I'm open to a ton of suggestions and tips. I do want to experiment with as much as I can, before I narrow my studies to what interests me the most.

Also, I feel pretty blind about this whole university thing, in a sense that things could hit the fan if I'm not careful enough and that I might be overlooking some very important things that the potential me should pay attention to. Any tips here are more than welcome as well.

Thanks in advance.

Maybe you want me to lactate for you and every day I bring you lunch in you office and then you feed from my tits. Maybe you want me to wear a butt plug so when you come home to the apartment you can fuck me nice and hard before going off to your wife. Maybe you just spend the weeks with me and weekends at home and every day you come home and make sure I've been good for you, and if I haven't you spank me good and hard to remind me. You love that I wear what you like, that I'm so excited to create a world for you where your pleasure is the most important thing. We go shopping together and you approve everything I own.

Maybe you just need to come home and put me over the trendy breakfast bar, and fuck me good and hard. Maybe what you need after a hard day is to order me over the sofa and take it out on my ass with your hand. You love knowing that I'm at the apartment, waiting for you and so willing to do anything for you.

I'm not looking to be humiliated, just be the eager girl you can finally afford to keep to do everything you want to. Your wife either doesn't know about me or doesn't mind, knowing I'm a good way to keep you busy while she has her own life. She can do her high jet set life while you have your obedient girl in the city. She acts as your society wife and maybe she's glad not to have to deal with any of your baser desires.

 I interned at a WPP agency this past summer (and with the hiring freeze, I'm not feeling confident that they'll be full-time opportunities for me there) and am currently interning at an independent agency now. I graduate in May. The college I attend is not located in/near the city, so I'll be applying remotely. It seems like full-time entry-level positions are becoming increasingly difficult to obtain, and that makes me nervous. A lot of people I know seem to be stuck in the perpetual intern stage- taking on multiple internships as post-graduates. I'm really not interested in post-graduate internships. First of all, it's nearly impossible to live in the city of an intern salary. Secondly, it seems that very few of these post-grad internships turn into full-time gigs. Third, I feel that I have enough experience for an entry level role. Thanks in advance for the help!

&amp;#x200B;

A few questions....

1.) When should I start applying? 

I've been keeping in touch with contacts I have but am not sure when I should be actually applying.

&amp;#x200B;

2.) Is it realistic for me to pursue entry-level positions?

I've had three internships and feel like I'm ready for a full-time role. 

&amp;#x200B;

3.) What can make me stand out/convince hiring managers that I'm as qualified as someone who has been out of school for a few years?

9wa9cs,7,2018-11-11,Scott and Bobby,TooWrongForTooLong,MakingaMurderer,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakingaMurderer/comments/9wa9cs/scott_and_bobby/,"I will admit, there was a time where I was on the Scott/Bobby-Killed-Th bandwagon. I took Kathleen Zellner at her word, not that she ever actually followed through on a single promise. I guess I just wanted Steven and Brendan to be free so badly that I had to blindly put my faith in something, and the only person who seemed to be doing anything (even if it was just tweeting) it was KZ. The number of cases she has won vs. lost is constantly in dispute, but it didn't change the fact that she has freed 18 innocent people. So, while her social media tactics, $10K guilty challenge, low blows at the judge, and constant Kratz-bashing were all done in bad taste IMO, I still respected her for the work she has done behind the scenes.

&amp;#x200B;

That was until I saw season 2. In the first episode, KZ had me whipped. I was just like okay girl, you got this. After episode 1, she lost her flair. it was like every time she made a statement, I was waiting for her to make a follow-up statement to redeem that statement. There were many ""AHA!"" moments where it seemed like KZ was the only one who knew what the ""AHA"" was about. There were so many holes, inconsistencies, misrepresentations, blatant lies, shoddy experimentation, and not a single coherent scenario presented with a possible killer other than Steven. It pissed me off that she publicly accused Ryan as being the killer as early as in episode 3 (episode 3 may as well been called ""Threatening Ryan"")  and then later accused Scott and Bobby as being the killers at the end when she was scrambling to do damage control when the court denied her motion. I knew it was going to happen that way because I have been following the case since 2016, and I am well aware that KZ changed her theory of who the killer was between motions, but there was something much more unsettling about seeing her announce it on TV for an audience of millions. 

&amp;#x200B;

From watching season 2, I got the impression that Scott was actually a pretty decent human being. He certainly didn't seem like a violent wife-beater that KZ made him out to be on Twitter a year ago. He was supportive of Barb and her sons, you could tell he had a good relationship with Brendan and that he cared about him. This also struck a nerve in thinking back to MAM1 where the filmmakers spliced the footage to make it seem like Scott was smiling when Brendan was found guilty. I have serious doubts now about the reliability of season 1, but since that season has been thoroughly dissected, I won't even go there. But I am seriously angry about the smear campaign that KZ launched against Scott and Bobby with very little evidence to back it up, other than Bobby also happened to be home when Teresa arrived at the property. There is nothing to suggest that he nor Scott had anything to do with the murder. And on that note, if she planned to name them as the killers in the end, why would they even bother devoting an entire episode to making Ryan look like a killer? If you spend 60 minutes trying to prove that someone is a murderer to an audience of millions, you will ruin, and possibly end up endangering their life. So when KZ is complaining that Brendan's life is at stake in prison because inmates are jealous, well guess what? You put a person's life at stake when you call them a killer in front of millions of people.

&amp;#x200B;

I think Steven committed the murder. I don't know what role Brendan had, if any, but regardless, I think Brendan was collateral damage in this whole thing. I have no trouble believing Brendan when he said Steven threatened him with physical violence if he didn't keep his mouth shut or participate in the cleanup. I also have no trouble believing that Brendan was used by law enforcement to secure a conviction against Steven. Like I said, I think he was just collateral damage, regardless of how it went down. Here's what I don't get....most of us were engaged when we witnessed Brendan being convicted of rape and murder of Teresa in Season 1 when we knew there was little-to-no evidence against him. So why aren't we all enraged now that KZ is pointing the finger at Scott and Bobby when there is absolutely no evidence against them? They, too, are just collateral damage in this whole thing. The only difference is that it is KZ who is doing the life-ruining now, not Kratz. There is simply nothing to suggest that Scott and Bobby are culpable. A phone call between Steven and Barb, where Scott is enraged because he was publicly accused of murder is not evidence of murder. Porn on a computer that was accessible to 5-6 different males at any given time (including Steven) is not evidence either.  And don't even try to claim that the video re-enactment  of KZ's intern driving around the salvage yard in a RAV4, pulling over at ""Bobby's"" behest and being stuffed into the back of a RAV4, is evidence. KZ should have just stuck with the photograph of the CD. It was a hell of a lot more compelling than what was actually on that CD."

According to the books, he's a Future Foundation Executive, and the headmaster is already planning on executing him.

They both question Duck about this, and he decides to tell both of them all he can, privately. He explains the Future Foundation is on their side, and decides to reveal to the both of them there was another killing game, one that he participated in.

Duck and 14 others were remnants of despair, and had been put into the Neo World Program by the Future Foundation. However, other Remnants of Despair found where they were, and broke into the facility. Instead of helping their fellow remnants, they decide to put them in a killing game, similar to the Killing School Trip. They send one of the other remnants into the thing, Giichi Kentaro. Giichi had to pick a fake talent, so he went with the Ultimate Intern. The remnants that were put into the Neo World were supposed to be put on an island, but the Remnants decided that was too boring, and put them into a giant prison. However, for some reason, these people were extremely violent. Instead of killing one student to try and escape, a lot of them killed 2 or more.

However, there was one person, who managed to remain their symbol of hope throughout the entire killing game. Akio Ren, The Ultimate Lucky Student. She was similar to the protagonist of Despair City, except she remained hopeful the entire time, and managed to be a leader to everyone. However, that didn't stop anyone from killing. Akio believes that the Future Foundation will save them, some time, they will come and save them. She has hope that they will save them.

At the final trial for this Killing Prison Life, there were only 3 people remaining. Duck Kuwakku, Akio Ren, And Giichi Kentaro. Duck and Akio managed to figure out that the mastermind was Giichi, and Giichi reveals that they were being watched by other remnants of despair, and that their killing game was being broadcasted around the world. The remnants were trying to continue Junko's work, after she died, and her AI was destroyed. So, they come up with a plan to try and bring despair to everyone watching. Which survivor should be executed, and which should try and survive the despair they were about to drop on them? The remnants were supposed to answer that question, but...

 (Flashback)

Akio: “I volunteer!”

Duck: “W-What?!”

Duck: “Akio, you can’t!”

Giichi: “Well there we go folks!”

Giichi: “Akio Ren, The Ultimate Lucky Student has just volunteered to die!”

Duck: “Akio...Why?!”

Akio: “Duck, I believe there’s still hope for you.”

Duck: “A-Akio, you…”

Akio: “The Future Foundation has been doing everything they can to get us out of here.”

Akio: “A-And, even if I have to die…”

Akio: “There’s still hope for you!”

Duck: “But, Akio, I don’t deserve life more than you!”

Akio: “No, that’s wrong.”

Akio: “Duck, there’s more potential in you than you know.”

Akio: “I know that the Future Foundation hasn’t saved us yet…”

Akio: “But trust me when I say this.”

Akio: “There is hope for you.”

Akio: “You will not be stuck here, do not fall into the despair that this world is throwing at you!”

Akio: “When the world does this to you, fight back!”

Duck: “B-But I-”

Akio: “Duck, after you get out of here...”

Akio: “Promise me something.”

Akio: “You don’t have to become the world’s hope or anything…”

Akio: “But atleast make one person happy.”  
Akio: “Make at least one person full of hope.”

Akio: “Please Duck.”

Akio: “Please promise me.”

Akio: “Just be one person’s hope, for me.”

Duck: “I-I…”

Duck: “I promise Akio.”

Akio: “You’ve already fulfilled your promise Duck.”

Akio: “You’re my hope.”

Akio: “After I die, you will continue to live.”

Akio: “Live your life with hope.”

Akio: “Even if you can’t do it all the time…”

Akio: “If you feel like the world’s against you…”

Akio: “Do not stop living with hope.”

Duck: “I-I won’t.”

Giichi: “Aw, that’s so cute!”

Giichi: “Telling him some bullshit lies, just to give him a false sense of security!”

Akio: “It’s not a lie!”

Akio: “The Future Foundation will save him!”

Giichi: “With what army?”

Giichi: “They haven’t saved you yet, now have they?”

Giichi: “Duck will not make it out alive, you hear?”

Akio: “Duck, don’t listen to him!”

Giichi: “Anyways, I’ve prepared a very special punishment for Akio Ren, The Ultimate Lucky Student!”

Duck: “N-No!”

Duck: “Akio, you can’t let him-”

Akio: “Duck, don’t die here.”

Akio: “I know you’ll make it out alive.”

Akio: “With or without me, I trust that you will be saved by the Future Foundation.”

Akio: “I’m giving you my hope Duck.”

Akio: “Alright?”

Giichi: “Let’s give it everything we’ve got!”

Giichi: “It’s Punishment Time!”

Duck: “I-I promise Akio.”

Duck: “I will trust the Future Foundation, and the hope you have given me.”

Akio: “That’s all I wanted to hear.”

&amp;#x200B;

Those were the last words Akio said to Duck before she was executed. Duck was alone, him against the remnants of despair. Akio believed in the Future Foundation...Why couldn't Duck?

(Another Flashback)

 

Giichi: “That’s it for the actor, huh?”

Giichi: “Now you’re trapped here with me for eternity!”

Duck: “That’s not true, the Future Foundation will help me!”

Giichi: “How?”

Giichi: “They haven’t saved you yet, and now it’s just you!”

Giichi: “Hell, if I wanted, I could kill you right now!”

Giichi: “But watching you suffer will be more entertaining.”

Giichi: “Think about it, you’re the last survivor.”

Giichi: “No one’s come for you yet.”

  
Giichi: “Face it, you’re trapped here.”

Giichi: “So how about this Duck?”

Giichi: “I give you a choice!”

Duck: “A-A choice?”

Giichi: “Yeah!”

Giichi: “2 choices!”

Giichi: “You can either live, and be trapped here for the rest of your life…”

Giichi: “Or I execute you right now, and you don’t have to live through the pain!”

Duck: “W-What?”

Giichi: “Well here’s your options, because there’s no third choice.”

Giichi: “Live in despair, or die.”

Giichi: “Go ahead pick!”

Duck: “...”

Duck's inner thoughts: “I either live, or I die?”

Duck's inner thoughts: “There’s no third option?”

Duck's inner thoughts: “B-But…”

Duck's inner thoughts: “Akio gave me this hope, just so I can live or die?”

Duck's inner thoughts: “I don’t want to die…”

Duck's inner thoughts: “But I can’t live here…”

Duck's inner thoughts: “I don’t want to pick either choice.”

Duck's inner thoughts: “Why did Akio give me this hope if I was just going to die anyways?!”

Duck's inner thoughts: “I-I…”

Duck's inner thoughts: “I have to believe in hope, right?”

Duck: “I pick neither.”

Duck: “You say there’s not a third option, but I know there is.”

Giichi: “Then what is it smartass?”

Duck: “Hope.”

Giichi: “What?”  
Giichi: “That’s the stupidest choice I’ve ever heard of!”

Duck: “No, there’s still hope for me!”  
Duck: “I might not get out of here alive, but I refuse to give up!”

Giichi: “Aw, that’s adorable.”

Giichi: “Too bad your fans literally don’t care if you die!”

Duck's inner thoughts: “I was looking around.”

Duck's inner thoughts: “The signs of my dead friends was slowly getting to me…”

Duck's inner thoughts: “They were all dead.”

Duck's inner thoughts: “And I’m the only one left?”

Duck's inner thoughts: “But why?”

Duck's inner thoughts: “Why was I the one chosen to survive?”

Duck's inner thoughts: “I’m not special…”

Duck's inner thoughts: “I’m a coward.”

???: “A-Am I in?”

Giichi: “What?’

Giichi: “Who’s there?”

Duck: “Who are you?”

Duck's inner thoughts: “I looked behind me, and saw them.”

Duck's inner thoughts: “Three pillars of pixels.”

Duck's inner thoughts: “This was it.”

Duck's inner thoughts: “I knew who they were.”  
Duck: “They’re here!”

Giichi: “Who?”

Duck: “The Future Foundation is finally here!”

???: “I’m sorry I'm late!”

Duck's inner thoughts: “A boy with brown hair…”

Duck's inner thoughts: “He looked to be about my age, but yet…”

Giichi: “Oh my god, you again?”

Giichi: “Makoto Naegi, you’re ruining Junko’s plans again?!”

Duck's inner thoughts: “Makoto Naegi…”

Duck's inner thoughts: “He stepped out of the middle pillar, and all 3 of the pillars disappeared.”

Duck's inner thoughts: “I didn’t know who he was, but…”

Duck's inner thoughts: “I could tell he was The Ultimate Hope.”

&amp;#x200B;

Duck was the sole survivor of the Killing Prison Life, and he was now the traitor of the Killing City Trip. He only had Chuya and Hakaku as people who trusted him, and now he was afraid to admit he was the traitor to the rest. Everyone else didn't understand that the traitor was on their side, and started blaming the Future Foundation for them being there.

After surviving the Killing Prison Life, Duck had three ultimates now. The Ultimate Actor, The Ultimate Hope, and The Ultimate Survivor. 

He doesn't believe he deserves to be the Ultimate Hope, because he hasn't saved anyone from the Killing City Trip, and now, he doesn't know what to do. He believes Akio should've survived, not him, she should've been the Ultimate Hope, not him. But now, he has to carry on the burden of life, and now he's back in a similar situation.

&amp;#x200B;

Alright, this is the twist of chapter 4. Duck is revealed to be the traitor to Chuya and Hakaku, and gives them both a little more of his backstory. Did I do well with writing this? Does this reveal make Duck a more likable or less likable character? Please, respond with honest criticism, or correct my grammar. Also, I know the names aren't that good. I will probably consider fixing all of them when I finish the entire thing, so for now, please live with the bad names.

Thank you for reading!"

I am currently a student who has been chosen for an internship to produce podcasts. I'm an English major, so they're generally English based. I pulled off the first one okay because it was live, I was obviously nervous, and had never done it before. 
But now I'm about to record one and I literally have no idea how to talk to guests. It's like my speech skills go out the door and all I can do is laugh awkwardly, pause for way too long, and say ""cool!""
Has anyone else had this problem? My podcast is going to be on the evolution of the English language, which I love to discuss. Only problem is, I know I'm going to freeze up, stutter, etc because I'm recording with two of my professors. I guess what can I do to make myself not look like an idiot? If there's advice for that?"

I hated my home life, it was rough, and whenever I stayed in a hotel I was overjoyed. It was my happy place. The hospitality workers were always kind to me even if they were paid to be it was a nice change of pace from being treated like crap. I know that loving hotels doesn’t qualify me to work in the industry or mean that I should but it certainly helps a little, right? Plus I did have an internship over the summer where I had to do customer service and liked it.

1. I want to work my way up to management eventually. How does one work their way up?
2. How difficult is it to work your way up nowadays?
3. Is it hard to get an entry level job in this industry? Job hunting seems terrifying to me, but they’re always hiring service people, right?
4. How important are social skills? Mine are pretty mediocre right now but I’m definitely working on them. Once I get introduced to someone I usually get along with them pretty well. In fact, I like people. I know I’ll eventually “learn to hate people” but I generally have a positive view of others. I am on the more quiet side, though.
5. I know majoring in hospitality management is a bad idea(even though I want to do it), so what are alternative things to major in if I plan to work in hospitality? Accounting? Marketing?
6. What do you like about working in the industry? Any positives? I hear a lot of negativity in TFTFD but it hasn’t made me lose interest. I just want to hear nice things about hospitality work for once.
7. What’s working in San Diego and California like? How big is hospitality here? It’s where I live so I’m curious. 
8. How often do you have to move in order to progress? I’m willing to move if it means I can get ahead in my career and already have a job lined up there, but I’d prefer to stay near home. 
9. How is automation going to affect this industry? Is it going to get rid of everyone’s jobs? Are hospitality workers screwed? Will they all be replaced by those AI hotels from Altered Carbon? I know I can’t do much about this, I’m just kinda worried.
10. Any general tips? What can I do now to prepare?"

At first I was planning on going to IS program. But after reviewing the curriculum and talking to some guys in the program, I realized while the program is great, it doesn’t hold the same weight as CS when it comes to development.

My question is how is CS program in BYU, what is the placement like, and how does the program help and prepare you get an internship or job at company like google or Microsoft? 

The information I found on their website hasnt been updated since 2014. So any information and advices will be appreciated. Thanks."

initially, i only viewed him as an “office crush”, but as time passed, i gained a friend who i coincidently seemed insanely compatible with and i wondered if i should pursue something more. to my surprise, he reciprocated these feelings.

unfortunately, just as that developed (a month into my internship), he transferred (from state 1) to another office in (state 2). regardless, he and i spent the next 2 weeks exploring the possibility of a relationship with him and potentially being long-distance (i currently reside in state 3). when he returned to state 1 for a half-week to celebrate his birthday, he asked me to be his girlfriend. just before i left to return to state 3, he returned a 2nd time to state 2 for proper “goodbyes”.

he and i just passed the 3-month mark (coincidentally, also when he and i exchanged “i love you’s”). i never realized how happy i could be when in a healthy, loving, and always-evolving relationship. and he’s absolutely psyched for a future with me. i’ll be moving from state 3 to state 2 in 2 months for work (if that isn’t the stars aligning, then shit). but he and i know that relationships can always improve, so i’d like to ask for some advice.

he and i rarely fight, argue, or disagree. but all fights to-date involve him crossing a boundary or failing to deliver on a promise. he genuinely wants to learn how he can not do those things anymore. for me, i sometimes feel frustrated and get a bit manipulative (e.g. threatening, for a lack of a better word, to break-up). i realize that to be a terrible habit that’s translated from my previous relationship that i need to eliminate completely.

he and i honestly just want to achieve a healthy and secure relationship with each other. can anybody offer any advice on how to combat these problematic behaviors?

tl;dr
i want to eliminate all of my manipulative behavior and tendencies and my boyfriend wants to deliver on promises to me. how can he and i work together to achieve that?"

---------------------------  
***-FOUR MONTHS AGO-***  
----------------------------  

Andrew was getting really tired of having absolutely no clue what was going on.  
  
First his touring is interrupted by probably the 200th talking bird he has ever come across. A majority of a year had passed without any demigodly disruptions here in the Galapagos, and to end the radio silence a finch named Acanthis had just informed him of his life being in immediate danger and then requested his help. Which was of course the last thing he wanted to hear after distancing himself from camp and the painfully supernatural. All while standing here in the sweltering, overwhelming heat of Equatorial summer? Suffice to say he was not in the best of moods. That and the fact that at over a dozen finches, which are most certainly not owls, were currently growing out talons, irises and plumage characteristic not only of monsters, but of a strain that ordinarily manifests in monstrous owls. Except they aren’t owls. This cannot be stressed enough. Finches are not owls. Not by any stretch of logic. 
  
“Oh.” Andrew said aloud, assuming a wary stance and waiting for his assailants to make the first move. Pondering the events that have led up to this unexplainable set of circumstances would have to wait in line after being torn apart.  
    
The newly transformed bird beasts quivered and arched their spines as they crawled. Their frenzied eyes were trained solely on their prey, forming a tightknit circle of claws and teeth – since when do birds have *teeth* inside their gold beaks? – around the son of Athena. Andrew was no stranger to this variety of monster. It’s true he’d never encountered one other than Polyphonte, who was a special case, but prior knowledge did nothing to quell the uneasiness bubbling in his brain as the pack tightened their trap.  

 Looks like he’d have to consider it later.    
 They leapt.  
    
“Glaukopis!” Andrew shouted and his muscles tensed as the two birds directly in front of him were suddenly blinded by the bright cones of pale light that burst from his false eyes. They were halted in their charge and writhed around, screaming and squinting their beady eyes. Andrew sprinted through an opening between them and ducked to avoid the swipe of talons from the assailants on all sides, exiting the ring of death before it could collapse on him. As he fled he turned his wrist, extended his arm and brought down his sword onto the incapacitated strix on the left, causing it to sputter sulfur from its wound and screech in anger. It flailed with its wings in the air, like a helpless tortoise stuck upside-down on its shell, bleeding out the ugly dust and gnashing its beak until nothing remained.  
      
Drawing the Sword of Sophia close to him again he scoped out the cart lot to determine the best course of action while adrenaline began to wrack his body and surge him onward. Part of him was elated that after months of hiatus, the old battle instincts had not left him, or else he would be feed already, mere seconds into the fray. Sure, he wasn’t a total beast of combat like some War kids he knew. Adequate at not dying, though, he could at least be satisfied with that. Besides, there were fourteen of them, maybe more if his counting had been off, and as easy as one might be to distract and dispatch, an entire flock would be trouble all by himself. Unless he thought of a plan. Twisting a heel into the dirt and dashing underneath one of the parked ranger carts, he tucked his limbs in and let the angry cloud of feathers storm past him none the wiser. *Let’s see. What do we know? What do I know about them?*  
  
Strixes. Birds of ill-omen. Devours of viscera that target weakened prey and prefer to hunt in packs, since if one strix is killed, more will appear to avenge it. That or they are simply attracted by the scent of death, regardless if it’s one of their own. Deep black feathers, check. Golden eyes and beaks? Check. Teeth? Erm…. Citation needed. Scarlet talons? Check. Paralytic toxins laced in all of their attacks? Bad news. All morbidly splendid in theory, but there was one potent detail, the source of Andrew’s unease, and it wasn’t just their unusual appearances, or their conversion from the common finch. Strixes *burn in the sunlight.*  
    
And burn they did. With his stomach on the warm pavement and head turned sideways could smell their fetid decay from seven yards away, and the roasting sunlight did not help. The harsh rays seared deep into their marrow, slowly disintegrating them from the inside and causing their feathers to molt and melt into the asphalt. The scent was grossly familiar to the Mother Stryx herself, but she was thousands of years old – she had an excuse. There are no self-care products sold in Tartarus. Probably.  
      
What made it so unsettling was that despite the agony, they did not seek shelter. Instead they roamed the parking lot, separating and searching for the demigod, ignoring the burning of their flesh. Andrew couldn’t tell if this sort of behavior was common with bloodthirsty strixes. Then again, nothing about this situation was common. Monsters don’t just pop out of thin air. So what next?  
    
As comfortable as hiding under the ranger cart was (read: it wasn’t) sweating to death against the heated ground, the sun was acting too slow to completely exterminate the avian terrors – another irregularity Andrew would have to correct in some of those old books. They should have all burned up by now. But they hadn’t, so he had to think. Even if he could somehow isolate one and slay it, the killing would draw the other twelve unto him in an instant and he would be overwhelmed. He couldn’t risk luring them into a crowded area or else they might hurt the mortal tourists. Heavens only knew what these creatures looked like to the viewer unequipped to see through the Mist; turkeys, maybe? Angry geese?  
    
A chilling gurgle coming from his behind his head caused the hairs on his body to stand on end as alarm bells flashed in his brain. He flung himself to the left and rolled out of cover, leaping up onto the vehicle as the strix barged out from underneath, peering out next to one of the tires. He let go and brought his full weight down on the back of the unsuspecting bird, crushing his heels into the neck and ribs and splintering the poor thing into dust, or at least it should have. Andrew shivered when instead of feeling the monster disappear into sulfur, the bones crumpled and the strix was left twitching and roasting under the sun as its skin bubbled away. That’s not good.  
  
The delayed expiration of Strix Number 2 was all it took for a dozen screeches to erupt across the lot, followed swiftly by the sound of stampeding talons. A stealthy process of elimination was out of the question now. His heart pumping, he turned to the ranger cart and was struck by a spark of devious glee.  
  
“That’ll gonna work.” He blinked. “I- wait, no, I mean, that’s *gonna* work. I-“  
    
Reminded of his predicament by the harsh, guttural kaw of death he climbs into the cart and fumbles for the keyring tucked deep into his right pocket. Plucking them from his side he jams and twists the correct key in. His internship position at the station technically wasn’t authorized to use these unless it was an emergency. He briefly wondered by mortal standards if this would quality. *’But sir, I was chased by burning geese!’*  
    
“I meant to say *’That’ll do’*,” he grumbled to himself, stashing the sword haphazardly in the passenger seat and putting on the seatbelt. Safety first. “But I also thought about *’That works*’, and I mixed the two and – ugh. How.. How did I mess that up? Gods. I bet Jay wouldn’t have -GAHHHH- ok! Shoo! Die!”  
    
Lucky Strix Number Three had grappled onto the front of the cart, pounding against the windshield and digging its maw into the cracks formed by its punches, spurring Andrew out of his awkward stupor and into action. A reckless stomp on the gas and a twist of the wheel flung the strix off of the cart and onto the hood of a parked car with a gleaming black paintjob – the heat cooked the bird from both sides and the impact shattered its wings. It slid off and flopped face-first to the ground, moaning as strips of skin were left on the Honda. Eleven left.  
    
Fortunately for Andrew, a squad of four were perfectly aligned approximately thirty feet, directly ahead. Blinking away nausea from the rapid spin, he reoriented the steering wheel and barreled towards them at top speed, which admittedly wasn’t much on this old pile of junk, but it did the job. He braced himself and winced as four ugly bumps in the road were quickly dealt with. Seven to go. He was running out of lot, though.

A mad slam on the brakes brought the contraption grinding to a halt to the sound of cracking glass. Andrew was thrown forward and the loose, probably-not-up-to-regulation seatbelt did little to prevent his forehead from striking the windshield. His head spun and light exploded in his eyes as the pain vibrated in his skull, but threat of death pounded like a drum in his ears and reminded him that if he did not move, he would be eaten. Unfastening the belt and reaching for his sword the demigod was greeted with the unpleasant realization that the sound he had heard earlier was the sound of his sword plunging through the windshield and disappearing into the grass. How a blade was able to pierce and travel through glass, hilt and all, was beyond him, but hey; he hardly understood half of the Sword of Sophia’s metallic properties in the first place. Dumb thing does not obey the laws of nature, but only when it inconveniences him. Lovely.  
    
Ejecting himself from the cart and shrugging off the possibility of concussion he looked over his shoulder to watch two strixes fly in through the passenger window and descend on where he had been seated barely a moment ago and dig their talons into the upholstery, tearing it to ribbons. Sword. *Sword*. He needed the sword. Go get the sword.  
    
Ignoring the aching in his head he dove into the thorny boundaries of the parking lot and parted the shrubs in a desperate search. The dull green of the alloy camouflaged nigh-perfectly with the tall grass. All he could spare was a quick second of scanning the ground before diving out of the way and delving deeper into the marsh to avoid the slash and hack of metal-tipped talons. Stepping over boulders and elbowing vines out of the way his mind worked overtime to assemble a new solution.    
  
No sword. That was a problem. With the lot still crawling with at least ten wolf-sized evil birds of prey - or was it six? Seven. Remember that or die. Seven - and no weapon in his hands all he could do was search for another way out. They had his trail now – he could only run so far before the adrenaline stopped working its miracles and left him exhausted and within their reach. He had to use *something*. Anything. His surroundings had to provide something. A river to lose them in? A pit to lure them? A tree to climb up?  
  
Instead he planted his feet, skidded to a halt, turned around, stood his ground, and reached for his face to transform his glasses into his Imperial Gold Staff of Athena and swing it like a club. A flying, burning strix received an ugly face full of metal and half of it exploded into dust. The torso-less body arced through the air and faded into a puff of sulfur.  
  
Rather than dwell on the fact that he had totally forgotten he was carrying two demigodly weapons he prepared to strike another home run. The next strix, not getting the memo from its deceased pal, was greeted the same way. Splat. Five to go.  
  
Five that refused to show their faces, however. Evidently after enough corpses they were capable of learning from the mistakes of the fallen, and the quintet now stalked Andrew out of sight. Keeping his stance narrow and forcing his flight-or-fight engine to stall he waited and listened, eyes darting frantically to spot the shadow of the next monster. He could hear their cries of bloodlust and the sizzling of their hides under the daylight but every sign of movement was masked by the swaying foliage or hidden behind the trunks of trees. Not an optimal location. What if they were surrounding him again? Dealing with a group in an open area was difficult enough. Was five enough to confront all at once? He doubted it.  
  
He’d have to reach into their minds.  
  
Strixipathy was not an ability he enjoyed using. Not when robbed him of his own senses against his will, or invited the voices of dozens of animals into his head, or gave him a glimpse into the feral, incomprehensible mind of Polyphonte. But if he could sense their presence and impose his own willpower into their brains with a little bit of voodoo-control oddity then he may just slip out alive, so that’s what he did. Closing his eyes and fighting every instinct to charge blindly into the jungle he reached out and searched. There they were, alright: sche^**λ** ming and twitching and slowly surro**εθ**unding him just like befo**οσ**re, albeit with fewer numbers. Five was too many to **λ**ttempt to c**σ**ntrol at once, but mayb**ε** if he only targeted one and used the…  
    
λεθοσ    
Hold on.  
λεθοσ    
What was that?  
  
Andrew had suddenly become acutely aware of a fuzzy λεθοσ  blur in his vision, which he quickly remedied by rubbing at his eyes. Fake or not, they *λεθοσ* behaved like real ones, quirks and all. Except it didn’t go away. Was he hearing something? “Focus,” he murmured. “Focus. Focus on them.”  
But he couldn’t. Pain seared inside his head and he doubled over, dropping the staff and clutching at his face as the fight was completely forgotten. The sensation was very unpleasant, and very real. It gave the uncanny impression of a sharp knife being dragged through the inside of his skull, carving words he could not understand. After all this time fighting against monsters to stay alive, apparently an aneurysm was going to do the job instead.  He squeezed his eyes shut as the sunlight filtered through the leaves was suddenly overloading his senses.
  
There it was. Emblazoned against the background of darkness and surrounding him like a mirage, flashing and blinding him from every corner even as his eyelids were shut.   
*λεθοσ*  
#**λεθοσ**
  
A word? A spell? Heat stroke or hallucination? Whatever it was, Andrew fell to his knees and prayed it would stop. It was too intense; he could not think, he could not speak, and he could not move. Slowly, lights danced across the Celestial Bronze of his eyes and a red-hot brand in the shape of that infernal code etched itself all over the insides of his eyelids. He forced his eyes open. It was dancing in the air, the word, the symbol, the mystery, taunting him and assaulting him. Wherever he looked it burned itself deeper into his core and did not relent. The trees and wind and sun faded away. There was nothing. He could see nothing except the letters that shouldered and killed him slowly.  
    
After an eternity and a half the pain faded and Andrew was left huddling against a tree with his arms over his head and his breathing shallow. He wasn’t sure how much time had passed. He reached out once again with his power and found not five, but one remaining. The other four were gone, somehow. For some reason they had not torn him to scraps during his little episode.  
  
His head swam and pulsed with fatigue as he lurched in the direction of the final foe, dragging his staff behind him. He’d sort everything out later. He wanted answer and he’d have no choice but to get them once the last strix was defeated. Trudging past piles of bones and ash he made the connection that some other force had swiftly dealt with four-fifths of his problem. Maybe they had waited too long and succumbed to the sun.  
  
The last one had fled back to the parking lot. Andrew made it there just in time to watch it roll around on the ground as smoke poured from its eyes and it wildly swung its own wings around as if fighting an invisible opponent before placing its wings on its head, shuddering, releasing an eerily calm sigh, and dissolving away. The fight was over. Whatever had attacked Andrew had taken its toll on the strixes as well.   
  
Reeling from pain and confusion he bent down in the grass, searched for his sword, and less than a minute later dragged himself over to the shade of a tree with both staff and blade in his hands. Collapsing into the support of the trunk and feeling the ridges and hasty carvings made by vandals on the trunk prick his neck he slid down and let his limbs turn to lead.  
  
“What….” It was only after several minutes did he catch his breath and deign to break the silence, only now noticing that his head was bleeding.  
“What was that? What were they?”  
  
Acanthis the finch was waiting for him on one of the branches. “I don’t know. But they are precisely what I came to warn you about, Spawn of Polyphonte,” the bird spoke softly.  
  
  
--------------------------------  
  

λεθοσ. It was not a word, according to his studies. In fact it was not anything at all.  
  
Andrew’s unceasing sessions in the Camp Half-Blood library were all in a feverish search for answers to whatever had abruptly ended his stint at the Galapagos and the long period of no contact with the safe haven in Long Island Sound. On some level he had anticipated this result: nothing. Not a single tome or ruined scroll had an answer. Even combing the Internet, which he had consulted prior to arriving back at camp, proved fruitless.   
  
The strixes were still coming, though. On the way back from the islands he was attacked twice – a pigeon and a seagull. Acanthis had told him that there was something behind the phenomenon, but had seemed just as surprised at their transformations as he had been. And the books were just-  
  
“-Completely useless. Nothing!” Andrew’s head smacked the dusty hard cover of the umpteenth book that failed to contain anything, a single source or citation or anecdotal primary account or myth or legend or *anything at all* about the symbol, or the notion of birds turning into strixes. He had pored over Polyphonte’s creation story at least a hundred times before and a hundred times more by now. It didn’t add up. And on top of that, his Occulospheres had begun to fail and the dark spots appear. There’s no way it could have been a coincidence; whatever had occurred during that skirmish, that hellish assembly of ancient Greek symbols, must have damaged his vision in a way he could not fathom or repair.  
  
Andrew knew in the back of his mind that the longer he stayed here the longer it would be inviting the inevitable.   
  
One night he accepted the course of action he would have to take. He had to go to the one place where he could find the answer to any question asked, find the meaning to any word, solve any problem, provided the question had an answer, or the word actually had a meaning, or if the problem actually had a solution, and also provided the source didn’t slice, crush or pummel him into oblivion. The guardian of a sacred cathedral on the other side of the world, a site of reverence and wisdom that spanned several cultures and centuries. The three meter tall six-winged angel of Hagia Sophia. The creature whose sword he had taken, and probably wouldn’t be too keen to see him return. The Hexapteryga.  
  
He slammed the book shut and swore aloud in the empty confines of the library, causing the dark splotches in his sight to curl and wobble like the interior of a lava lamp tainted with ink.  
  
“I have to go to Istanbul.”

**February 22nd 2019, 5:45 pm, Jade Spring Hill Residence, Beijing**

President Xi sat on a small sofa in his study, watching one of his most favorite movies, [Saving Private Ryan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping#Personal_life), with his daughter, [Xi Mingze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Mingze). The two do not have a lot of personal time together, especially due to how busy President Xi is, but he tries to make appearances in her life when he has the time. She is his escape from the busy politicking at Zhongnanhai.

&gt; Dad, do we have to watch this movie again?

---

&gt; What do you mean *again?* You don't like this movie? We have only watched it together a few times...

---

&gt; This is the sixth time we have seen this movie... It doesn't get better every time you watch it. There is too much violence.

---

&gt; Is this the kind of thing they taught you to complain about at Harvard? Four years of studying for a Bachelor's of Arts in *Psychology*... I'll have you know, this is a fantastic film. Tom Hanks is a brilliant actor.

---

&gt; Come on, Dad, no need to get angry about it... How about we watch something with a little less violence?

---

&gt; I have been very busy these days, and things have not been easy. You are right, watching this violence is not going to help my mood; this is time with you after all. I'll tell you what, you can put on something you would like to watch then, and I'll watch it with you. How does that sound?

---

&gt; Okay! I have just the show in mind. I never had the chance to finish it.

Mingze clicks through her saves list, and puts on her show.

&gt; You want to watch *[this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Mom_(TV_series))?*

---

&gt; No fair! You said I got to put something on that I wanted to watch!

President Xi puts his hands up defensively

&gt; Don't shoot! You win, you win! I was just being sarcastic! *chuckles*

---

&gt; I think [Zhao Wei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhao_Wei) is just fantastic. You know she won that Xining FIRST International Film Festival Award last year, she has not made a new film in two years! You know someone is really good at what they do when they can keep winning awards long after their film came out.

President Xi takes a look at his phone, and receives the text he had been expecting.

&gt; She is a good actress, you are right, but she is also in some deep water too. Please excuse me a moment, I have to get the door. There is someone here I think you would like to see that I have to meet with at short notice.

---

&gt; Sure, but Dad who could that be?

President Xi stood up from where he was sitting and tapped a small button on the tea table. A small bell rang. Shortly after, the door to the study opened, and an MSS agent entered the room.

&gt; President Xi, Miss Zhao has arrived

The MSS agent stepped aside, leaving the doorway open. Just as he stepped aside, Zhao Wei emerged from the hallway and entered the room.

&gt; Good Evening, President Xi, it is a pleasure to be invited to your residence

She makes a slight bow

&gt; Miss Zhao, welcome to my Jade Spring Residence. I trust that you were treated well on the way here.

---

&gt; Ah, Dad! How could you not tell me Zhao Wei was going to be here? It's almost 6:00 pm and I'm still in my pajamas, I look like a disgrace! *Switching tones* Sister Zhao, it is always a pleasure to see you. *takes a slight embarrassed bow* I apologize for my informality, I was not aware you would be coming, I would have prepared something for you. You know its always so great to have you aro....

---

&gt; Little Sister Xi, no need to apologize, I have invaded your residence. The apology falls in my arms.

---

&gt; Mingze, I need to have a quick meeting with Miss Zhao. Do you think you can give me a few minutes?

Mingze, quite embarrassed, nods her head slightly and quietly leaves through the open door behind Zhao.

&gt; Miss Zhao, please, take a seat over by my desk

President Xi motions for her to take a seat, and then moves to the other side of the table and takes a seat himself. He notices Zhao Wei look at what is on the TV as he sits down.

&gt; Oh! *chuckles* Don't mind that, my daughter put it on. She is a big fan of your's. She is always watching the television or on her phone these days.. you know how kids are. I'm trying to find something for her to do, but given my position it has been difficult for everyone.. Speaking of phones...

President Xi scrolls a few times on his phone and taps, and the TV turns off.

&gt; Technology is such a wonderful tool, Miss Zhao... Sorry for the informality, once again. I only received your request earlier today and unfortunately it ended up cutting into time with my daughter, but I know this is an immediate issue, which I am really glad you contacted me about.. Now, what was the issue?

---

&gt; My Husband and I would like to appeal our [five-year ban from the securities market](https://www.scmp.com/business/money/markets-investing/article/2119207/actress-zhao-wei-and-husband-banned-securities). We both feel that the decision was both unfair to us, and largely unpopular.

---

&gt; Unfortunately, Miss Zhao, in regards to this issue, my hands are tied.... There is really only one option remaining.

---

&gt; President Xi, please, reconsider the decision... There must be another way. The way things are going with the film company, if we can't get back into the securities market, things might heat up a bit on Weibo. Besides, I see that you are already in a bit of a predicament. 

She pulls a sheet a folded news paper out of her purse and set it on President Xi's desk.

**Sichuan Daily: Vice President Wang Qishan suspended from office and stripped of party rank, under investigation for sexual misconduct**

&gt; You are right about that one, *he picks up the article, and turns the cover* it seems I've opened up a can of worms with Miss Fan. Bringing her in has become necessary, but troublesome. It has the party members split in half. Some approve of bringing her in, the influence could do wonders, as I knew, however the others think that she may be too influential and too out spoken.

---

&gt; Well, Mr. President, what do you think? ""Even if such ideas, and opinions, come from avenues not previously considered, as we face a future with uncertain events that will require a united, cooperation, not a single option can be left unconsidered or unheard. It has become increasingly important, more-so now than ever, to let the Chinese people be heard, especially when a great future lies before us."" - those are your words, are they not? I watched it, and I thought it was very new, especially for you, but very motivating for out future. This could go very very well for you, President Xi.

---

&gt; I'm stuck in the crossroads, between a rock, and a hard place. I did mean we need to seek more opinion and guidance from society and the younger generation, but I am still not sure to what ends I am comfortable with it. The idea is new, but looking around at our economy, the state of our people, it is becoming necessary. The old are become older, the Old Guard is on the way out. I may be the last Mao-era President. I need to prepare China for its future, so I think I ought to listen to them. On the other hand, touting our core values, the stability of the party is very important. Although, I did call you here today for reasons of my own... and it is not something that comes easy to me, but because I know it is necessary...

President Xi pulls out his desk drawer and takes out a manila folder, with the Communist Party Seal on it. His hands are shaking, his forehead profusely sweating. It is clear to anyone that these recent decisions have put him at the crossroads.

&gt; Miss Zhao, while I am stuck in a very difficult position these days... I have thought greatly on the future outlook of the Communist Party, and our nation. And there is only so far down one road we can go until we start running into some very serious problems, 1946-kind of problems. I am just doing my job to make sure those kinds of issues never torment our society and history once again. At some point, benefiting society, benefiting the people, further reforming our nation, is going to become the only path we can take. If change is going to be made, I have already brought sweeping amounts to our country, and I feel it is my job to do it again.

He sets the manila folder on the table and pushes it over Zhao Wei.  He takes a tissue out of his suit pocket and wipes his head with it. He then takes out an order for the Ministry of Public Security.

&gt; See, Miss Zhao, I knew what you were going to bring up as soon as you requested a personal meeting with me. And I was really glad that you did... Although it has made me very stressed too. I'll tell you what the option is: If you take these documents, sign the first one, it will make you a member of the Communist Party, by my hand. The second document, is my already signed appointment for you to go to the Director of the General Office of the [National Radio and Television Administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Radio_and_Television_Administration), under the [Ministry of Culture and Tourism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Culture_and_Tourism_of_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China). Based on your extensive qualifications and work you have done for this country, especially in famous government-sponsored films, I think this would be the best spot for you, especially given that the incumbent Director was taking bribes and was sacked from his position. I know you would use your influence from this position in good ways, and it would be well received from your fans, from the international media, and from the party. It would also put you in the ideal position to conduct change. As you know with Miss Fan, I have been working on bringing female talent into the male-dominated government, to bring about change, and I know you would cover that extensively and be one of the leading faces for a growing movement. If you take this position, I have this form, already signed for the Ministry of Public Security, silently pardoning you and allowing you to operate in the securities market again, just as a forewarning should you try something like that again, we have increased our watch, especially for corrupt practices.

---

&gt; President Xi, what did you give Miss Fan, I must ask?

---

&gt; Other than a large platform, which is turning out to be extremely powerful, nothing.

---

&gt; You are aware of her capabilities, right?

---

&gt; Yes, and her influence, that is what scares me, and especially now that her voice is coming from the state. I have reason to believe she is setting herself up to become one of the most powerful people in the country.

---

&gt; Powerful, how?

President Xi turns back to the cover, which displays Fan Bing Bing's face, next to a photo of the Vice President being swarmed by cameras and being stuffed into a car.

&gt; I think we are going to find out a lot sooner than I wanted to...

---

&gt; Well, President Xi, it has been a pleasure doing business with you.

Zhao Wei takes out her own pen, and signs the documents. President Xi, still sweating, puts her position pin on the desk, which she takes from him.

&gt; A pleasure, and now slightly a relief, to do business with you to Comrade Zhao. Serve well, and let me know if you are given flak for it, I'll need to have a talking to with the Old Guard and outline our plan with them, especially if Comrade Fan is going to do what I think she is going to do.. I suppose the future lays ahead of us, and we are all making our decisions. Decisions... that reminds me...I've placed my daughter as your intern, I just need to give her something to do and get her out of the house. Have her do whatever you would like, she just has a degree in Psychology, and a fixation for music, movies, and television. Make her a professional, and I will be very grateful to you.

---

&gt; Oh, I see... Well President Xi, I consider it a challenge. I think it could be fun having her work alongside me. I think she would like if I told her myself.

---

&gt; She most definitely would like that. Thank you Comrade Zhao. You are dismissed.

Now-Director Zhao, takes a slight bow, and exits the room. President Xi loosens his tie, and wipes his sweat from his face. He then looks down at the newspaper again.

&gt; Here we go, Jinping, here we go.."

I was a second year intern at the hospital you worked in, or basically ruled. You were one of the top surgeons in the world, you specialized in plastics and could make any scar disappear, not to mention you worked on a lot of very attractive women wanting breast or ass implants. You were quite attractive too, very tall and well cut, you had a square jaw and killer blue eyes. Your hair is a salt and pepper black, with a bit of stubble on your chin and upper lip. Girls went crazy for you, patients, nurses, doctors, and yes, even interns like me and my fellow interns. Your name was Mark, or Dr. Sloan, and as my second year of my internship began, you claimed me as yours, which most doctors did with their favourites, but I was nothing special, I just passed my first year. 

“Hello, Pet.” You smirked at me as we walked down the hall, and I held my clipboard against my chest, covered in my light blue scrubs. You had assigned me the nickname ‘Pet’ halloween of last year, when I showed up in a cat costume, with a collar and all. All of the interns dressed up, but the doctors found it hysterical and nicknamed all of us after our costumes, most called me ‘Kitty’, but you stuck to something more humiliating. We walked into your office and I stood at your desk. “To be honest, Pet, your stats last year where shit. I’m surprised you made it this far, and boy am I glad you did. You see, I’m going to teach you everything I know. Every cut, every stitch, every surgery, you’re going to be perfect, a ‘Mini-Sloan’ even, but you’re going to do something for me, in return.” I looked at you and nodded slowly.   
“Anything, Sir.” I begged, absolutely needing your offer, I would surely flunk the program without a good surgeons help, and you were better than good. 

My name is Lennon, but I usually go by Lennie. I am 20 year old, with long blonde hair and a nose piercing. I have a tattoo of a triangle on my left wrist, and below my belly button I had a tattoo that says‘SLUT’ in a pink fancy font. My breasts are 36C and I have a decent sized ass- not too big but not too small. I have bright blue eyes, thick eyelashes and a cocky smirk/smile. 

You will be playing Mark Sloan, a plastics surgeon who is rich and completely gorgeous. If you want a photo reference, please ask me and I’ll provide a link of the actor I’m thinking of, asides from that, play him however you want!   
Please start with what you expect of me to do for you, yes be as dirty as you want. 

I will NOT reply to anything but a response to my plot, and then I’ll create an OOC chat for us, if you’d like to get to know me more. If you need help coming up with a starter, just start telling me all of the rules you expect me to follow, how I should be behaving, what you have planned, whatever you want! x

9wcfgi,2,2018-11-12,22 Years old and Very Unsure of Myself,grprncs95,DecidingToBeBetter,https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/9wcfgi/22_years_old_and_very_unsure_of_myself/,"I moved to a big city from a small town three years ago. I've had a really hard time, struggling with depression and anxiety since I hit puberty, and had a lot of family troubles when I was in high school. I suffered really bad panic attacks right as I finished high school and wasn't able to attend college right away because I was recovering from some traumas I experienced in high school.

Growing up, I played the piano, sang, and I loved to read and write in my free time. I was always really shy and quite insecure but I had big dreams. My plan for college was to study journalism and become an entertainment journalist so that I could combine my love of music (and pop culture) and writing. As soon as I got to college in the big city and started taking journalism classes, I realized that I hated it. I hated how many rules there were in journalism, the fact that I could never really be my own boss (I'm a very authoritative person), and definitely wanted to do something  that would make me more money (I like nice things a lot). So, about a year and a half into the journalism program, I changed my major to creative advertising. I decided that I wanted to be a creative director or at least work in branding or advertising because I felt it fit my personality more.

Long story short, I fucked up in school along the way. While I was still studying journalism, I basically failed all of my classes one semester because I was too distracted by the newfound city life. I also took some time off because I didn't have the money to keep paying for school. Due to all the time I had taken off, my school basically dismissed me and is making me take classes at a community college so that I can transfer my credits back over.

Over the summer, I was lucky enough to have an internship at a very famous music venue where I gained some great experience but in the meantime I haven't made it back to school.

I'm now 22. I moved here when I was 19. I was already behind from taking a year off college, and now I'm even more behind. Everyone my age is graduating and getting their life together, and even people younger than me are becoming more successful than me. Due to some of the hardships I've faced in my life,  I've found it very hard to keep my head on straight. Yes, there are things I love. I love being alive. I love the opportunities I've been given. But also, I'm very obsessed with the idea of success and I've been comparing myself to others a lot.

I still have big dreams. There are things I really want for myself but I'm not sure how to get them, and I'm not sure what exactly I want to do. I'm currently working in the restaurant industry, which is something I grew up in as well, and I love fine dining and hospitality as well as music and art. I want to do something that combines all of those things but I'm losing hope in myself and I fear growing older.

Anyone been in a similar position that can help? Thanks."

Just wanted to start off by saying I had my dog since he was a 9 month year old (purebred GSD) and I spent a lot of my time in the earlier years training him and being with him every single day. Wherever I went he had to follow me and watch me. If I went to the washroom he would either wait infront of the door or make me let him come inside whether it be business on the toilet or taking shower. (maybe too much info) Everywhere I went around the house he would follow me no matter what, it would take treats from my parents or sister to get him to come to them, but at the end he ends up by my side. Even when i leave the house he would wait by the front door or in my room rather than wandering around the house.

&amp;#x200B;

Moving to a more present time I recently had an opportunity for an internship in Asia for 4 months and like anybody, I took it. After finishing my work term and coming back my pupper stopped doing the things that he used to do around me and now he's moved on to my dad. At first I was like maybe it will take time for him to come back to me but fast forward to current day 5months later he still hasn't been the way he used to be. What happened here? I did what I used to back in the day still put in the time to give him affection and training/walks but it's just not the same anymore. Anyone else ever experience this? It's like now he can't leave my dads side and it sucks now because he was and still is my dog and I plan on moving to Toronto which is across Canada from where I'm at now. I'm torn between the decision to bring my dog with me due to the fact that he has a strong affection and bond with my dad now and I don't want him to have separation anxiety from being away or maybe just him not liking me as much as before might not be fair for him to come with me. 

Any advice/tips will be greatly appreciated."

The theme of this dungeon level is **storytelling**. Tell the world about a game that tells an exceptional story, or tells a story in an exceptional way, or allows the player to create something unique and interesting by their actions.

You can request any number of games. First come - first served, aggregated by day. Starting the next day after the offer is posted, if you're the only person who requested a particular game, you get it and aren't eligible for any other games that day. If multiple eligible people request a game the winner is selected randomly. People who put some effort in their comment will have more weight in the selection. This repeats until all games are distributed. For Humble Bundle games, I will be asking whether you want a gift link or a key (unless you specify it in the comment). A few offers have multiple copies. Locked games will only be sent out after a significant delay, which is shortened when unlocked games get claimed."

Now, I can't seem to get any jobs/volunteering roles and I am not sure what to do. I'm not even being choosy at all, I will work as a cleaner if I have to. The lack of something to do means my mental health is deteriorating very quickly. I have tried to be resourceful by contacting charities that help young people into employment (Prince's trust, uprising) but to no avail.

I'm in a fortunate position where my parents are letting me live without paying rent.

 Do I?

1. Keep applying to things until something sticks (I just fear huge gaps on my C.V if unsuccessful)
2. Do an internship (non paid/paid) for 6 months - Year
3. Do an apprenticeship 
4. Volunteer for a year

He said  “oh so front-end” very confidently and kind of dismissed me.  Was he just ignorant or is it common for people in the industry to treat Node.js as a mostly front-end technology? He wasn’t the only person who said this before.

At my last internship, I worked with a team that was responsible for specific services on the company's website. They were officially called a front-end team. We didn’t interact with any database (at least not directly), we used backend services for that. We also used Node.js since the team saw it appropriate for the new micro-service architecture they were adopting.
Now that I want to intern at other places as a back-end engineer because my team was officially a front-end team, I’m kind of “pigeon-holed” into the front-end, even though that’s not something I enjoy much. I loved working with Node and the things that seemed more “back-endy”.

Is it common for the separation between front-end and back-end to be this “blurred”? 

TLDR; I always thought Node was a backend tool. However, it seems some people have a different opinion. Also, at my last internship I worked with a “front-end” team that used Node.js (no, not like Browserify), we actually ran a server, except no direct interaction with the database, just HTTP requests (express) to our back-end services.

This has been on my mind for quite a while, in matter of fact, it started when i had to abbandon my studies because of attention problems. I've talked to my wife (not really ""wife"" as the definition, more like legally living together. but ""wife"" is shorter than ""partner with who i legally live together"", also raises less questions in conversations.) about it and she wants a husband either in the military or the police (a childhood dream of her). At time of writing i've done a lot of jobs, mostly office jobs. because i only have a secondary school degree and no master (have the brains for it though, but my attention span is very bad. taking medicins for it, but still nothing good) and because i've worked as a call agent for 9 months, getting an interesting job in Belgium is rather hard. I know that when i quit my current home office job i'll have phone calls from intern offices swarming towards me for call agents jobs, which i won't be doing ever again because of lack of contracts and good salaries. but in the meanwhile i'm sitting infront of a desk being distracted as per usual, barely contributing to my company and thinking of other jobs. but what job? ""do what you like to do, do what you're good at."" is what people say. but i don't know what my strenghts are, i don't know what i like to do. (well, i suspect i have a gaming addiction, but i can't make a living out of that.) 
I've visited someone who should send me in the right direction for a job, but i left those conversations as i primarily used them to get in a job i was going for at that time. 
Another thing i find so annoying about me: on monday i can say: ""boy, a private detective would be cool, let's inform ourselves about that!"" and on tuesday: ""on second thought, studying insects is also very cool. let's look up more details on that."" wednesday: ""oh? does a private detective needs to follow specific rules? interesting...""

I feel kind of lost, I don't know what ""path"" to take in my life. If there's one thing which is certain: the longer i'm staying in my freshly bought apparment all by my self, tied to my desk, working to pay of the loan &amp; bills (no problem with that) with no other faces than my own and a telephone to talk to. I might end up going insane. (already turned on the TV for background chatter, and those jazz 24/7 streams on youtube.)

The only friend i have recently went off working in portugal for a year, i'm glad for him, i really am. 

Wish there was someone i could have conversations with, someone with a lot of experience in jobs and tell me: ""oh i see, have you considerred doing XY for a job?"" 
on which i'd say: ""no, haven't considerred that yet, why would you see me doing that job?"" 
him or her: ""well, because of ABC of you."" 
me: ""okay, how would i start doing that?""
him or her: ""1,2,3""

No, not going to intern offices. In Belgium I consider them the filthest of the filth, the most ineffecient desk jobs in the country, in fact i consider the daily activities of an ape in the zoo being more time well spent than the average intern office employee. They don't listen to you. I suspect they have instructions from their manager ""today we need to have 5 call agents. get them.""
on the phone you say you want administration work with a decent pay, contract after 6 months. ""well we have just the job for you in call center blah blah blah"". That's when they're being honest. once i felt in one of their traps: ""you'll keep customer contacts and perform 80% administration work.""
me: ""is it a call center.""
them: ""you can't really see it as such.""
*day 1 at my new work place* me: ""it's a fucking call center.""

Hope this helps lifting a few kilograms off my mind. maybe even some advice, who knows."

9wfvvd,1,2018-11-12,I don't feel like a normal person.,awky-dawky,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/9wfvvd/i_dont_feel_like_a_normal_person/,"I'm 22 years old and I just graduated with an honours film degree from the highest ranked university in my country last Tuesday. I am also unemployed and have been for the past eight months. I am extremely depressed as a result.

I have been applying to ten jobs every day, and last month I went to fifteen interviews. I want to work as a screenwriter or researcher, and I have freelance work coming up as a researcher on a documentary in a few months, which I am incredibly proud of. I'm just waiting until the production company making the film reach a conclusion on the funding and get back to me so I can get to work and create again, but until then I am without work and money, and will need a steady job anyway if I am to work freelance. 

I know that it is incredibly difficult to find your ideal job straight out of university, and I accept that. Finding work in film isn't a top priority at the moment anyway as my main longterm goal now is to save money for my screenwriting masters degree. All I ask is for a regular income from a minimum wage, retail or restaurant-based job so that I can have money again, can do fun things again, wear clothes that aren't more than two years old again, take my boyfriend out on dates again, and really just to feel like a normal person with a normal, healthy life again, not to mention save for my masters. But I can't even find that.

The only money that I have right now is child maintenance from my parents' divorce that my dad is paying me, €175 every two weeks ($197), which gives me just about enough money for groceries and public transport to travel to interviews. My dad will stop paying me that on my birthday when I turn 23, which is in less than a month's time. My boyfriend is currently working at McDonald's and has a good salary as a result. He says that he doesn't mind helping me out financially until and even after I get a job, because he loves me and what's his is mine, but I can't help but feel like a parasite when he shares money with me or buys me things, and besides, it'll never be as good as having my own money in my own bank account that I earned with my own hard work, just like everyone else.

I feel like a massive failure in every way possible: I'm fat, ugly, unpopular, and unemployed. I feel like a burden on my friends and family and that they would be much happier if I wasn't here. I try so fucking hard not to be so hard on myself, but it's so difficult not to, coming home every week from the umpteenth interview and telling my mother ""Yeah, it seemed to have gone well!"" knowing deep down that it probably didn't and that I'll probably not get a call back. Trying to escape this feeling on social media only makes it worse, because then I see all of the people I know out at their jobs, buying things, having fun, doing things that would make the people in their life proud of them. I sit there and ask myself: ""Why can't I have that? What's wrong with me? Why should I be so different?""

I don't deserve this. I have worked so hard for my entire life: I have sacrificed time, energy, money, friends studying and keeping my shit together, only to be greeted with either closed doors or employers who want to abuse my labour through unpaid trials and internships. Christmas is coming soon, and if I don't have any money in a few weeks' time, I won't be able to buy any presents for my friends and family, yet again. Last year was excusable, as I was too busy in my final year of college to work, but now I am perfectly able to work and will feel incredibly ashamed if I let the ones I love down again. 

I feel so scared. All my life so far, I found it so easy to stay ahead, follow a goal, work hard, achieve it, and feel proud of what I did. Now, that sense of security is crumbling beneath me, my world is changing, as my life approaches a new stage of transition. I'm scared of growing up, I'm scared of leaving everything I used to be familiar with behind, and I'm scared of the prospect of being a failure to the ones I love and to myself. My boyfriend being in my life is the only thing that is helping me through this incredibly rough period in my life, and if there were a God I would thank them every day for him. He says that he's always here for me and that he's not going anywhere, but sometimes I worry that I overwhelm him with my emotions when I get upset like this. We are incredibly close, but he has his own problems and his own life too, and it's not fair on him that he should come home to such negativity, and at my worst, I feel like he deserves better than me. I want to make him happy, and I want to make myself happy, but all I can feel right now is sad, sad, sad."
9wg6rs,6,2018-11-12,"Updated diagnoses from ReA to AS (also hi, I'm new)",GoodGod_GetAGripGirl,Thritis,https://www.reddit.com/r/Thritis/comments/9wg6rs/updated_diagnoses_from_rea_to_as_also_hi_im_new/,"This is kind of long, so I'm sorry in advance. I'm actually brand new to reddit and signed up when I found this subreddit because I'm **so** tired of not knowing whats going on and feeling alone in the dark \[melodrama\]. If anyone could help me out with any of this or provide any nuggets of wisdom I would be really, really grateful.

So I'm a 22 year old female and I was diagnosed with ReA in August 2017 after a fairly dramatic case of food poisoning. I think I got it from gone-off rice, but I have no idea. A week after that I got conjunctivitis, which sorted itself out within a few days, and then a few days after that I started with symptoms of ReA. I woke up on Monday morning with what felt like a stiff left knee, and by Friday I was in total, unbelievable agony. I was in Spain at this point working abroad and had 3 weeks left until the end of my internship placement, so for some reason I decided to stick it out. When my dad brought me home a few weeks later (with 40kg of luggage in tow) my entire left leg was swollen and several of my toes had gone purple and extremely swollen. I could barely wear shoes. We went to A&amp;E the day after I got home and they put me on Clexane because my D-Dimer count was off the charts, so was my CRP. My dad had had ReA in his sacroilliac around 10 years prior to this so he knew the score and got me diagnosed really quickly, which I know is unheard of. I started etoricoxib and predisolone and within a week could walk again, just about. 

That was September of last year, and since then it's been a slow recovery process but by no means a straight line. I've had flareups in my hands that materialise within half an hour and a back problem since December of last year. When I finally got referred to a rheumatologist, he rarely listened to my pain complaints and put me on Sulfasalazine in February 2018 when I said my back was getting worse. My knee got better, but my back got worse, and my fucking toes still flare up when they get the chance. At one point in June I took MDMA after reading up about it in experiemental trials with RA sufferers and I actually had the most relief for the first time in almost a year (I know this was stupidly risky, at this point I was desperate for relief, and bizarrely enough it worked). 

I took the plunge and moved to Argentina in August for work, with my doctor telling me that ""a course of sulfasalazine over the course of 2 years will iron you out and you won't have any more problems after that, you'll be cured"". I meet a new rheumy here who tells me that 1) sulfasalazine is almost actively detrimental for back pain with arthritis and 2) that's not how it works, the condition is life-long, I've essentially been lied to. He looks at my x-rays and says there's clear evidence of ankylosing spondylitis in my sacroilliac which is probably the source of my discomfort. He also says the inflammation has spread to my hands, elbows and ankles. Whats puzzling for him, and most of my doctors, is that a lot of the symptoms don't neatly correlate - I have swelling in my toes, a lot of fatigue, no psoriasis, back stiffness and some pain but mostly just stiffness and discomfort. He recommends I go on biologics to nip the solution in the bud, but I travel a lot for work and taking a minifridge with me isn't really a viable option. 

I'm currently taking etoricoxib alongside my sulfasalazine (max dosage) with the recommendation to do pilates at least 4x a week to see if this alleviates inflammation and symptoms. I can't say its doing much, to be honest. I'm going to have an MRI done in a few days for more clear answers. Does anyone have experience of this? Does this sound familiar to anyone?

TLDR: 22F with ReA has progression of symptoms and no one knows what to do. "

Hey there! I'm a 8+ years experienced Generalist IT Professional who has faced Help Desk/ Service Desk Team Lead, System/ Server Administrator and currently an IT Manager role. I'm looking to go back to work with a team, since my current role is a little lonely and under-appreciated.

I have broad experience working in customer-satisfaction roles, as well as Desktop troubleshooting whether is physical computers or Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (Terminal Servers, VMware Horizon View, AWS WorkSpaces), Windows Servers maintenance, troubleshooting and implementation (needless to say but just in case, experience with Domain Controllers, Active Directory, Group Policies, DNS, DHCP, IIS, WSUS) as well as administration of Office 365 and Exchange Online, (some implementation but mostly) administration of Virtual environments such as VMware ESXi, vSphere, vCenter, AWS VPC's, EC2.

I have also worked with RHEL/CentOS servers, Monitoring through LogInsight, N-able, Datadog and AWS Cloudwatch, Veeam Backup Solutions, Asterisk PBX servers but also faced Cloud-based solutions as Mitel and Vonage, I know a fair bit of scripting with bash and Powershell. I might be a little rusty but have also worked with Cisco ASA, Brocade Switches and other firewalls.

9wghnq,2,2018-11-12,my relationship with alcohol,aintgonnafindme,stopdrinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/9wghnq/my_relationship_with_alcohol/,"I am writing this mostly for myself. My drinking has slowly been increasing the past couple years and now I am at an all time high. It was not until recently that I realized that I have a problem. I just want to detail the journey of how I got to this point in my life. 

I began drinking in high school as you do (well not everyone), mostly to ease social anxiety. The first time I drank until I was drunk was a euphoric moment, but still relatively harmless. That was my freshman year of high school, by the end of which I could drink a bottle of wine by myself. Sophomore year is when the drinking really picked up. I could chug an entire four loko in less than 20 seconds, and during the summer my friends and I would get drunk for weeks on end. I started to cut back after this year because I had picked up 5+ underage drinking citations (as well as other citations) and the fines were increasing drastically. The final two years of high school I drank, and could drink a lot, but it was not really comparable to my sophomore year. Freshman year of college I barely drank anything, as I was busy studying. Sophomore year of college I drank maybe three beers on a Friday, nothing extraordinary. The summer after my junior year of college I started to drink more. I felt isolated at my internship even though there were other students. Some days I would wake up with temporary nerve damage on my right arm, and it would feel numb the whole day. My senior year of college I really picked up the habit. I mean I had done well with my coursework and had been accepted into graduate school, so I basically viewed it as a vacation. I guess I have never really done well on the weekends or longer breaks, I need work to keep me occupied. Now in graduate school I have finally realized I have a serious drinking problem. I haven't told anyone except ya'll, but it has been fucking insane trying to stop drinking. The withdrawals are intense, and who the hell would think those nightmares would be so vivid?

Here I am, rock fucking bottom. Day 1, again."

9wgtnb,0,2018-11-12,22M Not sure I can do a relationship,throwawayaccountqw,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9wgtnb/22m_not_sure_i_can_do_a_relationship/,"I've been in a relationship for 1.5 years with my girlfriend \[19f\]. It's a long distance relationship. We are both in college about 2 hours apart. I love her a lot and would do anything for her. She is a very likable person. I'm a really introverted person and I think I have social anxiety. She is my first serious girlfriend and I believe I care about her more than anyone. Before I started dating her I was always wanting a girlfriend. I thought if I got one I would be happy. However, I still feel the same (no surprise). Before I would hook up with girls, every 2 months or so. I did enjoy it but I did want a girlfriend. Now that've I've had one I don't know how I can keep doing this. I've told her that this, and it did freak her out. I just feel trapped in any relationship, when we I see them every time before bed and when I wake up. 

&amp;#x200B;

While I was on an internship she lived with me during the summer. I didn't initially want her to come with me, but she convinced me to let her. It did go better than I expected. I didn't resent her or anything. I just wanted sometime to myself though. I was working 40 hours a week and taking a 5 credit class. So I was busy. She had nothing to do all day, so she would sleep while I was at  work and then wake up around the time I got home. This is the part I don't think I can do a relationship. I like a very strict rigid schedule. I really really really prefer going to bed at the same time and waking up at the same time. Like pretty early to (9:30-5:30). I used to protect my sleep so much before I met her. I would follow this easily ever weekday, but miss a few weekends. I liked being able to go to bed when I wanted. Some of my friends said it was strange but they also go to bed early, but they just don't stick to it as strict. I like to get up early to knock out somethings like exercising. That summer I was in the worst shape of my life. I like to be alone before bed and alone when I wake up, an hour or two for both. I'm weirdly opposed with sleep. I read books on it. But now I call her late everyday. I tell her I don't like it but she will agree to not to do it and then the next day she does it. Like I don't get mad, I just say I'm tired or something and then she will bring it up later. In the begging of the relationship I did however make her think I didn't bother me. The first two months we spend probably 5 hours on the phone every night. From like 8pm to  1am. A lot of times longer.

&amp;#x200B;

Also I like having my own space. I loved high school. I went to a small school. I was somehow 'popularish', so I had friends to talk to at school, but my favorite part was going home and being alone. It was two separate lives. I saw friends durning the day and could read, learn, and/or exercise in the afternoon/night. My mom owns a veterinary clinic and works a lot and my dad is farmer so he was busy or sleeping a lot. If I did need to see them I could, but if I didn't want to I didn't have to. But now that I'm in a relationship, every break I get she wants to spend it together. Like get a month off for Christmas, she wanted to spend everyday together. But lucky I have to work in a different town. I enjoy visiting my family alone sometimes too. Now every time I see them, it's with her. Now I know that you could tell me to find someone else, but like I would just like to spend maybe one night every other weekend with someone. Like I don't even want them to text/call me asking how I'm doing or what I'm doing. It just drains me like crazy. Like when I'm with her that night and spend the next day with her family I barely talk (I barely talk anyway). I just feel so drained. I need the morning to myself before going to meet other people. I just don't get that anymore. This summer I lived alone, I was working a ton though, 70 hours a week, for the first half. I enjoyed it so much, besides having to call her before bed and when I woke up. We still saw each other on every other weekend. Which I enjoyed.

&amp;#x200B;

Like I barely text my friends. 95% of the time if text it's because we need to know something or something similar. It's not like 'how are you'. I have one friend that lives far away and we probably text each other 2 times a month. And we just talk about our projects and stuff. I like that.

&amp;#x200B;

It sounds like I just don't like her, but I really do. I feel the same way about my friends. I like them, but I can't spend every second with them. I like her more than them too. I know I'm coming off really selfish and I probably am. I don't dislike people, I actually think everyone is interesting I just don't want/care to know everything about them I guess. I have four siblings, two of them are half. My full siblings are similar I think. I'm the youngest. They are 26 and 28, female and male. They don't really like giving up their free time. I think this derives from my father. It's a pretty social person when he's out, but at home he doesn't talk much and he would go to bed at 8 when I lived at home. Both my parents are pretty independent and don't really spend much time together. My mom is gone a lot and my dad will be outside or something. There is just something about spending so much time and telling them everything that drives me crazy. It's like a small hum that won't go away. I like it sometimes, but I can't deal with it all the time. Not just romantic relationships, but also just friends that I see all the time makes me feel this way.

&amp;#x200B;

The reason this worries me is, I could put up with this. But it does bother me. Like I could get married and make it though it, but I don't think I would truly be happy spending everyday with someone.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR

I enjoy my free time too much and like to have full control of my time. Being with people too much drives me crazy. I think something is wrong with me. I don't think I can do relationships and actually be happy."

9whnxi,7,2018-11-12,25 and completely stuck with how to ascend further up the career ladder,lef93,UKJobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/UKJobs/comments/9whnxi/25_and_completely_stuck_with_how_to_ascend/,"Hi,

I am 25 and completely and utterly stuck with trying to progress, and I suppose I just want a little advice or insight.

I completed a Masters in History of Art (BA First class) (MA Upper second class) at an (at the time) top 20 university, graduating in winter 2016. Since graduating, I really had no idea what to do with myself and honestly did not choose a degree with regards to its potential job prospects, but with the idea in mind that I simply enjoyed studying art. This meant that when I left I did not have a clear idea of what I wanted to do, so I started interning as a writer at an arts magazine. The magazine did not pay me and the internship was extended for about a year (long story short, they were very disorganised) but I got a decent amount of writing experience, from articles, to interviewing people, to transcribing interviews, to reviews etc. I then interned at another (more reputable) place over the course of London Fashion Week to write some reviews. After this I got a customer service job at a big gallery, and I worked (and still work there) part-time in the hope I may be able to gain some experience alongside that may get me into a job closer to my degree . Over the course of the year of having worked there, I have been trying to find some sort of experience relating to press, as I have decided that I would like to be working in press/media, preferably within an artistic context but obviously right now I am not fussy as I understand that beggars can't be choosers, so I have been looking at all press related experience.

I have not had much success over the year, I did a bit of freelance writing (paid) for an arts website and that is as far as my search has gone. I have also come across a number of problems and it is making me feel like I am having a quarterly life crisis as it were! When I look at many press roles, they desire somebody who is still at university, which obviously does not apply to me. Other intern roles (unpaid) expect a years worth of experience in social media/admin etc, despite being unpaid, and again I do not have this experience so I wonder how I am supposed to obtain experience to obtain more experience. I have tried contacting the press office of the gallery I work at to no avail, I have contacted local galleries and some further out with speculative CVs, and have applied to various intern roles to no avail, and in the past I have been met with the 'lack of experience' response. With all of the places I have applied to, I don't even get into the interview stage.

I just feel completely and utterly stuck. I know people do apply for tons and it takes lots to get one eventually, and I haven't applied for tons, but that is simply because there aren't many opportunities available. I looked at journalism diplomas but they cost a lot,  (around £5000) and I suppose I am sitting here wondering if I am wasting time applying for simple internships as I am 'not qualified enough' or whether they are simply being highly selective and eventually if I am patient something will come along....or am I kidding myself and should I be going and getting another degree? I guess I am just asking if anyone has been in this kind of situation and if it all panned out in the end, because it does get to me at times."

Last Month, I created an open source repository to list all most resources for students.  I believe that there are lots of opportunities for college students apart from the academics like involvement in developer communities, hackathons, conference, Internship, startup conclaves, student programs, Campus ambassador programs, open source communities and many more.

But due to lack of awareness, many of us fail to grab these opportunities.

&amp;#x200B;

This motivated me to compile this list of all the imp resources for students at one place.

There are about 100 girls living here right now and each room is shared between 3 girls. Each floor (6 rooms) has a shared kitchen, bathrooms and a laundry room. It's not a situation I'm comfortable with, but it's what I can afford for now. I have to say I'm really shy, introverted and have social anxiety, meaning it's hard talking to people in general, and having to share a bedroom is specially difficult for me.

Currently, in my room, there's only me (19F) and B (23F), as the other girl moved out recently and new ones will only enter the house in March.

B has been in the house for 6 years, and will graduate in December, same month she'll get married and move out. I entered in February of the last year. We lived in the same floor, but in different rooms. The first roommates I had were in their senior year and practically lived with their boyfriends already. It was awesome being able to have the freedom to turn the lights off whenever I wanted to and all that. They moved out definitely in August 2017. Yay, even more freedom *and* closet space.

In past November or around that, B asked to move into my room, because she was alone in hers too. It wasn't really something I wanted (gosh, how I wish I could have the room to myself until graduating), but having new roommates would happen sometime or the other, and I figured it'd be okay.

When B asked to move in, I told her that my classes end very late, that I'm only able to get home around 11 PM and that I'm a night owl, so staying up past 2 AM was normal for me. She said it was fine as long as the lights were off at a reasonable time and that I didn't make too much noise. 

To my surprise, a reasonable time to turn the lights off was 11:30 PM. B also said she liked complete darkness, so the blackout curtains were closed and she wore a mask too. She also needed complete silence and, because of that, our windows are usually closed at night.  Don't get me wrong, it's fine by me. It was just surprising - she never told me any of those details, but, to be fair, I never told her how much I stayed up late. I'm a heavy sleeper and never needed complete silence or darkness to sleep well, but I understand how others have different needs to feel well rested.

I go to work at 10 AM and, from there, head straight to my classes on campus, until 11 PM every weekday. I like to stay up and study at night and early hours of the morning - it's the time I feel the most productive and the reason I chose to take only night classes. So, most days, I'm still working on assignments by 3 AM. I know my laptop is a bit loud when it heats up and the keyboard is almost like a mechanical one in terms of noise, because it is a really old laptop I'll be abandoning next year. I never thought it'd bother someone that much.

B and I rarely talk with each other. I guess that we're just very different. She's a really active Jehovah's Witness and I'm an atheist. She's very friendly and social and, outside of colleagues at work and college, I don't have a big social life. I'm very interested in international politics and she doesn't even know who Duterte is. We don't have a lot in common to talk about. I never got her phone number, because it was never needed - we talked through Facebook and that's all. It was awkward at the start, but now I'm used to it. 

Fact is, Friday, I got home from my internship, at around 5 PM, and decided to go to bed, instead of going to my classes - I was feeling unwell since before leaving to work and needed to rest my head. I woke up at 2 AM, feeling hungry and a bit weird from the medicine I had taken. In that state of ""awake, but not functional"", I grabbed the first thing I could eat from my backpack, a bag of peanuts. I know, it's not the best idea to eat peanuts at 2 AM when you share a bedroom, but, again, I wasn't thinking straight. B just grabbed her pillow and covers and went to sleep in the floor's common space. I didn't understand what was going on at that time, as I couldn't see much, and just thought she went to the bathroom or something. I dozed back to sleep with the bag of peanuts by my side, not one minute later.

This Saturday morning, I woke up with a Messenger notification - B wrote: ""Hey, I don't want to be a dick or anything, but I have to say, it's been hard to sleep with the noise when you're eating or typing at 3 AM. Last night I went to sleep on the couch. It's my last month here and I'd really like to get some sleep"". I replied apologizing and promising to be more careful with my clumsyness.

I don't know why I'm bothered by that. I guess I just wanted to have it put in a way that the anxiety I'm feeling makes sense to my brain - it still doesn't.

I'm planning to get quieter things to snack on, maybe have a stock of ramen noodles to eat in the common space. I'm also going to study in the computer lab on the first floor. I don't think that'll be a lot of work. I'm really going to try to be more accommodating, but I don't know how far it can go with the end of semester hell.

In December, I'll go into vacation from college and will try to stay with my great-aunt, that lives in the same city, but is closer to my internship (god help me, my only break from work will be on Christmas week). I guess it'll be easier than being uncomfortable with B there - I wasn't invited to the wedding, which I'm okay with, and she'll start moving out, meaning her fiancé will be in the room for long periods of time.

I hope that, with the next roommates I get, I can make it different. I'll try to be more friendly and open and communicate better with them. Maybe I can get some friends out of the awful experience of having to share every space.

Meanwhile, I really can't wait to have the room to myself after December, even if it's just for a few weeks."

I am a current masters student set to graduate in December, and start a job as a school SLP in January.  I found out today that I will be working at two schools -- helping with a caseload at an elementary school, and being the sole SLP at a middle school.  I am excited and nervous!  None of my internship experiences in grad school were in the school setting, so I'm a bit nervous as far as getting the hang of that setting.  Also, I don't have a ton of experiences with middle school students (primarily Pre-K and Elementary levels).  So all that said, does anyone have any tips for:

1) Working with middle school students?

2) Starting as a CF in the schools partway through the year? (Versus the beginning of the year?) 

3) Building relationships/rapport with teachers? (I feel like this might be harder starting in the middle of the year)

4) Priorities for my first year as a CF?  (I know I'll have A LOT to learn/get accustomed to!) 

Thank you in advance for all of your help! "
9wjaho,0,2018-11-12,I went off on my mother and now I regret it,theevensteven,family,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/9wjaho/i_went_off_on_my_mother_and_now_i_regret_it/,"Having yet another awful semester in college. I’m currently a sophomore majoring in accounting. My gpa currently isn’t good. I’m struggling yet again in my classes despite doing all the right things. I failed two midterms and lost my temper so badly that I slammed my dorm room door and kicked my bookbag multiple times against the wall. I then yelled at my mom during a phone conversation cursing and shouting at her.

This is my phone conversation with my mother:

Me: Where are you?! Are you on your way?! I need to talk to you about something.

Mom: I just left. Whats up?!

Me: What do you mean you just left?! You’re supposed to have left like 30 minutes ago. What the fuck is taking so long?!

Mom: I was at work Steven. Is there that you'd like to talk about?!

Me: “You can’t be this fucking self-absorbed to put your laptop down for one second to realize that you have to come pick me up?! We could have been on our way back home by now. Hurry the fuck up and get your fucking ass over here.

Mom: Steven calm down.

Me: What do you mean calm down?! I’m so sick and tired of dealing with fucking idiots like you who can’t even be bothered to show up on time because they don’t even have the common sense to check the clock on their god damn computers. See this is why I need to get my own car that way I don’t have to wait for you all the damn time. Life would be so much fucking easier.

Mom: Ok Steven I'm going to ask you one more time. Whats going on?!

Me: I'm struggling in my classes yet again this semester. It just seems like no matter what I do, it never seems to work. I'm so fucking tired of this shit. I'm just gonna drop out of school and take out loans. Maybe I should just jump into the Kiskwaukee River and end it once and for all. I'm so fucking done with life.

Mom: You're gonna kill yourself just because you're doing bad in a few classes?!

Me: Do you fucking not get it? I'm studying accounting with the hopes of getting a job after graduation. I need a 3.0 GPA in order to get internships. Right now my GPA is 2.8 and with the way classes are going, its gonna drop to a 2.6. I’m so fucking fed up. Tell dad that I’m not coming home. 

Mom: Steve I'll see you when I get to NIU we'll talk more. I'm in the middle of a construction zone. Hangs up the phone.

I continue my angry screaming rages. Now I’m worried about how she’s going to react. "
9wjom2,3,2018-11-12,Unemployment is depressing me,awky-dawky,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/9wjom2/unemployment_is_depressing_me/,"I'm 22 years old and I just graduated with an honours film degree from the highest ranked university in my country last Tuesday. I am also unemployed and have been for the past eight months. I am extremely depressed as a result.

I have been applying to ten jobs every day, and last month I went to fifteen interviews. I want to work as a screenwriter or researcher, and I have freelance work coming up as a researcher on a documentary in a few months, which I am incredibly proud of. I'm just waiting until the production company making the film reach a conclusion on the funding and get back to me so I can get to work and create again, but until then I am without work and money, and will need a steady job anyway if I am to work freelance. 

I know that it is incredibly difficult to find your ideal job straight out of university, and I accept that. Finding work in film isn't a top priority at the moment anyway as my main longterm goal now is to save money for my screenwriting masters degree. All I ask is for a regular income from a minimum wage, retail or restaurant-based job so that I can have money again, can do fun things again, wear clothes that aren't more than two years old again, take my boyfriend out on dates again, and really just to feel like a normal person with a normal, healthy life again, not to mention save for my masters. But I can't even find that.

The only money that I have right now is child maintenance from my parents' divorce that my dad is paying me, €175 every two weeks ($197), which gives me just about enough money for groceries and public transport to travel to interviews. My dad will stop paying me that on my birthday when I turn 23, which is in less than a month's time. My boyfriend is currently working at McDonald's and has a good salary as a result. He says that he doesn't mind helping me out financially until and even after I get a job, because he loves me and what's his is mine, but I can't help but feel like a parasite when he shares money with me or buys me things, and besides, it'll never be as good as having my own money in my own bank account that I earned with my own hard work, just like everyone else.

I feel like a massive failure in every way possible: I'm fat, ugly, unpopular, and unemployed. I feel like a burden on my friends and family and that they would be much happier if I wasn't here. I try so fucking hard not to be so hard on myself, but it's so difficult not to, coming home every week from the umpteenth interview and telling my mother ""Yeah, it seemed to have gone well!"" knowing deep down that it probably didn't and that I'll probably not get a call back. Trying to escape this feeling on social media only makes it worse, because then I see all of the people I know out at their jobs, buying things, having fun, doing things that would make the people in their life proud of them. I sit there and ask myself: ""Why can't I have that? What's wrong with me? Why should I be so different?""

I don't deserve this. I have worked so hard for my entire life: I have sacrificed time, energy, money, friends studying and keeping my shit together, only to be greeted with either closed doors or employers who want to abuse my labour through unpaid trials and internships. Christmas is coming soon, and if I don't have any money in a few weeks' time, I won't be able to buy any presents for my friends and family, yet again. Last year was excusable, as I was too busy in my final year of college to work, but now I am perfectly able to work and will feel incredibly ashamed if I let the ones I love down again. 

I feel so scared. All my life so far, I found it so easy to stay ahead, follow a goal, work hard, achieve it, and feel proud of what I did. Now, that sense of security is crumbling beneath me, my world is changing, as my life approaches a new stage of transition. I'm scared of growing up, I'm scared of leaving everything I used to be familiar with behind, and I'm scared of the prospect of being a failure to the ones I love and to myself. My boyfriend being in my life is the only thing that is helping me through this incredibly rough period in my life, and if there were a God I would thank them every day for him. He says that he's always here for me and that he's not going anywhere, but sometimes I worry that I overwhelm him with my emotions when I get upset like this. We are incredibly close, but he has his own problems and his own life too, and it's not fair on him that he should come home to such negativity, and at my worst, I feel like he deserves better than me. I want to make him happy, and I want to make myself happy, but all I can feel right now is sad, sad, sad."
9wjzat,90,2018-11-12,6 things I wish I knew during this past recruiting season,Tominuuss,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/9wjzat/6_things_i_wish_i_knew_during_this_past/,"**Background:**

* An international student at a large state school (mid-west)
* Mediocre GPA 
* Accounting major, applied mathematics minor 
* Two B4 internships (international, so they  mean nothing to most recruiters TBH)
* Accepted offer at B4 in a large city 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my list of things I wish I knew:

1. **Your GPA Matters** \-- This is most likely going to get you in the door, especially if you don't have relevant internships, so don't let it slide below 3.5. If it's lower than 3.5, there will be an increased emphasis on your networking abilities and relevant experience. If your accounting GPA is higher than your overall GPA, then put both. 
2. **Conversational Skills Are Key** \-- There are a lot of smart accounting students at these recruiting events. Most differentiate themselves not by accounting knowledge, but by being able to hold conversations which aren't boring and dull. Don't sound rehearsed! You wouldn't believe how dry some of the questions I hear are. I can immediately spot the boredom on the 1 yr associate's face while he/she hears ""what's busy season like at 'Kool-aid Corp'?""
3. **Don't Sound Too Eager** \-- This might sound like an odd statement, but often times students will take a monopoly of speaking-time during group conversations at recruiting events. This isn't a good look. I'd suggest making sure you've been heard and make the time you do speak more meaningful, not cutting off others. 
4. **Ask Informed Questions** \-- Frame your questions to show that you've done the research but would like their input because they have an inside/unique perspective. Suppose, for instance, you're interested in learning about training. Instead of asking ""What's training like?"", ask something like ""I've recently been reading about xx and that all new hires get xx type of onboarding. Did you personally find it a valuable experience?"" The latter question brings their own personal views into it, and shows that you've done the research. This will help you connect with them on a more personal level -- they'll remember you for it. 
5. **Don't Make Significant Mistakes --** I know this sounds stupid, but if you have a good GPA, are decent at having conversations, show passion/genuine interest, you will likely have a very good shot at an interview. That being said, don't make any mistakes like not going to career fairs, sending e-mails with typos, being rude even as a joke, not being dressed appropriately (there's no excuse for this), not speaking to the head recruiter when at events, or trying to apply late. Avoid these and other basic mistakes, and you're set. 
6. **Interviews Needs to be Conversations --** Often times during interviews with B4's, you'll find that the experience is more of a back-and-forth conversation on why you like audit/tax, ""why 'Kool-aide Corp'"", how your skills and relevant experience apply and make you well suited, and what issues/transition/disruption is the industry currently facing. Don't be afraid to ask questions, but make sure they're open-ended, substantive, and conversational. Instead of ""what is your opinion on blockchain technology?"", ask ""You mentioned blockchain is a disruptor in the audit practice, how do you think it will influence audit quality in the future?"" Yes, these examples are contrived (forgive me), but the structure behind them -- open-ended and informed -- makes interviews far easier for everyone.

&amp;#x200B;

I would have wanted that information going into my recruiting season, so I hope it helps some of you. Please let me know if anyone has any disagreements with the list above.

This is not a problem however-- there are 8 different post templates that display the posts. So posts 1 through 8 all look different.

    if (wp_query()-&gt;post_number == 1) : { &lt;div class=template-for-post-1&gt;&lt;     content &lt;/div&gt; &lt;?php endif; ?&gt;  if (wp_query()-&gt;post_number == 2) : { &lt;div class=template-for-post-2&gt;&lt;     content &lt;/div&gt; &lt;?php endif; ?&gt;

I understand that the reason it's generating the same 1-8 posts is because I have hard-coded the post number into the if statement but I do not know how to change this code to be more dynamic. "

Dear Sir, Dear Madam

I am currently studying CS, BA, and IT Project Management at Univeristy of Paris X Nanterre. Highly interested in English language and living in the US, I would like to spend my 2nd year of Master there. I already passed on 1st year of Master MIAGE last year at University of Picardy Jules Verne (with a 2.34 GPA) but there was no partnership with any English-speaking university and I deeply wanted to study in the US (or UK). So when I have been admitted at Paris X Nanterre I chose to register again in 1st year of Master only for having 1 year to prepare my exchange in the US.

Wishing to work in the United States in the future, this experience would be a major asset for me. I also worked in an English speaking environment this year from April to September 2018, at Euronext Paris (Paris European stock exchange). I completed an internship at the Finance department in Project Management. I have had to deal with both native English speaking and non-native English speaking co-workers and partners. I did well on being able to adapt to different kind of English accents, but I would like to have a deep experience with US English speaking people."
9wlgna,44,2018-11-12,"With Rafale and allegations of crony capitalism being thrown around, YSK about the crazy heights of thuggery and crony capitalism that birthed Maruti",RajaRajaC,IndiaSpeaks,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/9wlgna/with_rafale_and_allegations_of_crony_capitalism/,"all starts with Maa ka Ladla, Sanjay aka Sterilization king Gandhi returning back home from a 3 year internship stint at Rolls Royce in the UK. Even this must have been only because of Maa ka influence because, in keeping with family tradition he never completed college. In case you are wondering, Indira, Sanjay, Rajiv, Sonia all at some point in their life joined some college or uni, but never completed it. In Rajiv and Sanjay's case, they just sucked at studies. Indira, was supposedly a very good student, but ill health came in her way. Anyways, moving back to the topic, Sanjay bhaiya returns from the UK, all full of ideas for a People's Car!

Now, the small hitch is, Indira had pretty much nationalised everything, and the few private companies left, like Hindustan automobiles or Premier automobiles or even Bajaj of the Chetak fame had stringent licensing norms, and buying even a chetak meant at least a year in queue after paying the money...if you were lucky. No matter, what Ladla wants, he gets.

In 1971, with ZERO experience in this field, no degree, no nothing, the GoI awarded a contract to this unknown entity to produce 50k cars (when even as late as 1991, India had a total car sales of some 100,000, in the 70's, this was around 30k units per year). No tender, no competition...nothing! Cronyism max...and it is just the start.

The moment this was done, everybody had to fall head over heels to satisfy the Prince. So, the Congress CM of Haryana promptly offered all the land the Prince wanted. But it was in a sad place in Haryana...our Prince had his eyes set on prime farm land and land belonging to the ordinance factory....Land Acquisition bill you say? Naw, rules didn't apply to his empress son. Land was acquired at dirt cheap prices, the army made to give up its land and the factory was put up.

Now, they offered a prototype for testing...it failed all the tests, but no matter, safety mafety....the contract was upheld!

Bad? It gets worse.

Industrialists were literally extorted into buying shares of this company...if you didn't, you had family members thrown into jail till you paid up. Listing rules for the share market were outright broken to allow special provisions to this company. If you had applied to be a dealer, you were shit out of luck as you were threatened to buy shares (literally using goons and threat of violence) in the company...or else. Even if you were not applying to be a dealer, you were fucked. Some random guy, applying with the Harayana Govt to buy some land...was told that he had to buy shares in the company, or kiss his licenses good bye...he got the shares!

Businessmen who complained...including to the then Minister of state for finance, our Hon President Mr Mukherjee (who did nothing) were then arrested under various acts, including the infamous MISA. Yes, if you protested, you saw jail time bitch!

Cement, Iron and Steel procured to build the complex (strict quotas were in place for anybody without the Gandhi surname) were then promptly resold in the market for a profit, and more quotas kept getting alloted to this company.

This is just the tip of the iceberg. Many share holders listed never existed, huge monies were laundered through this sham of a company, many of Sanjay Gandhi's official documentation and requests were never dated or signed. Minutes of shareholder meets either were manipulated or didn't exist at all....it boggles the mind what the Gandhi family could do and still can tbh in its solo, singleminded quest for power and money.

After the Janata Gov took power, they rightfully scrapped this company, established a commission, whose report you can read here.

This is why when Rahul Gandhi or his supporters talk about crony capitalism, I launch a full blown belly laugh! Indira, Sanjay, Rajiv (our man was the lead negotiator for an aircraft fighter deal...talk about being brazen), Sonia (Augusta) are all the biggest crony capitalists of them all."

9wmjjz,40,2018-11-13,"Idiot Alert! Or, ""Blood is a biohazard.""",54EqualsUnity,TalesFromThePharmacy,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromThePharmacy/comments/9wmjjz/idiot_alert_or_blood_is_a_biohazard/,"It's Sunday night in my 24 hour grocery store pharmacy. Things have mostly settled down for the evening (before the midnight rush of ""fill on/after x date"" controls appear), and at this point the only pharmacy employees present are myself (the intern), the overnight pharmacist (OP), and the overnight technician (OT). 

I finish helping a patient at the register when OP and OT call me over to the drop off counter. ""Come here,"" they said, ""We need your *professional opinion*."" Curious, I wander over, only to have OT point to a spot on the floor just outside the pharmacy and ask, ""Does that look like blood to you?""

It did, in fact, look like blood. A small splatter, maybe 2 inches in diameter. That wasn't it, though. There were similar splatters leading away from the pharmacy into the health and beauty section. A nearby customer who had noticed the far-flung fluids chimed in to let us know that the trail continued several aisles over, where a more sizeable pool had been left in one of the aisles. 

Now, this mystery fluid/blood being outside the pharmacy is not technically our responsibility. Still, I asked if we should grab our spill kit from the consultation room to safely mop up the mess. It was at that point that I was told of a recent email that was sent out to pharmacy staff, informing us that our spill kit had been removed from the pharmacy and placed at the customer service desk. A short call later, we were told that a manager would come over and evaluate the situation. We'll call him Senior Manager, due to him being in his mid-50s or so.

SM: ""Yep, yep, I see what you're talking about. That looks like blood to me, too.""

It's safe to say that whoever was having the issue was nowhere within our reach (we looked), but he then paused, looked around as if he might occupy himself with something more urgent by spotting the bloody bastard in our nearly-empty store, looked back at me, and said:

""You could just clean that up with some paper towel, right?""

Me: ""...no. If that is blood, then it's a biohazard, and you'll have to go get the spill kit.""

SM: ""Well, the cleaning crew is coming in tonight, so..."" He looks at me and shrugs, like he's saying, ""Yeah, this can wait, right?""

Me: (again) ""No, blood is a biohazard. You're going to need the spill kit to clean and sanitize the floor.""

SM: ""Well, I'm more worried about where they're at now...""

With that closing justification, he ambled out of sight. As soon as he was gone, all three of us exploded. ""What an idiot!"" ""He's been here forever! How many times has he done the Bloodborne Pathogens training??"" ""Is get actually getting the spill kit?"" ""I don't know! It doesn't sound like it!""

There being nothing we could do, we simply went back to our tasks and waited patiently for his return. After 10 minutes or so, when it became apparent that he wasn't coming back, OP called the service desk to reinforce the need for sanitation.

After another minute, young manager (YM) comes over, shoulders slumped in defeat, carrying the spill kit.

Me: ""Hey, YM! What happened to SM? We thought he'd be back to clean this up.""

YM: ""Oh, he went home. Hey, do you guys have paper towel or something? They gave me everything I need in this kit except for something to soak this up.""

The rest of the story is uneventful. Thankfully YM was able to successfully contain the potential biohazard, and we were all able to rest easy knowing that our customers (and ourselves) were not being exposed to who-knows-what. As it came to be my time to leave, my heart was warm as I walked into the cold November night. The last thing I heard as I left the pharmacy was OT saying, ""The night store manager comes in soon. I'm definitely going to give her a call.""

Here's to hoping that SM had his ass chewed out today! Bloody bastard. "

I love someone man or women to make me give then consent forever. Their slave. Their pet. Too many people try to turn me into a mindless obedient slave. That is no fun. I'm into obeying every command and instruction as if they're perfectly reasonable requests or stuff like that. Ideally the request tap into something about my character's personalty. Other kinks are public sex, pet play, daddy/mommy play, making me a nudist, corrupting a religious girl.

I love playing new scenarios so I would like you to send me the scene in your mind already. I will share some of the things I have been sent and liked. Don't think these are your choices. You can try, but I do love originality. What I would love to hear is twist on these or completely new ideas.

Also make sure to make your title related to your scene.

Your slut's daughter: While I was away for college, you hypnotized my mother to be your sex slave and wife. She was so lost on your spell that she never brought me up. Well now I'm back for summer. You have a nice nudist wife always ready for your biding. You are not going to let me get in the way of that. You may make me join.

Stuck out of my house: I lost my key. My thankfully I have the nicest of neighbors and he will let me stay till tomorrow morning. I don't know what he is planing thou. If he gets what he wants I will never be leaving. How could I leave my daddy after all.

Finding my friend: A friend of mine has disappeared. She wasn't kidnapped, she told me she was leaving, no explanation. After weeks of trying to reach out, she tells me to come over she has a new home. She would love for me to meet her master. I look up an address and see it is a mansion. I can't resist but to accept the invitation.

My new personal trainer: This is what I needed to do to lose weight. A pesonal trainer. You gave me a dvd to watch so I know what to do. I don't remember what was in it anymore, but since I did I eaten better and worked out everyday. It is like you put a spell on me. Today you are coming for our first one on one meeting. I'm so exited.

Free use internship: The guys in the company were getting too stressed till the boss decided to make one of the female employees into a free use slut with hypnosis. Of course the other girls were hypnotize to think this was okay. Slowly every hot female employee was turned. Now you need more. Help Wanted. I apply.

The perfect saleswoman: Sex sells after all. Your business is not doing to well, but you have a solution. Me. You have made me into your slave and I'm willing to do anything to sell your product.

Group orgy: This is the vague one. I won't play more than one character at the time. I will respond as whoever your character is paying the most attention at the time. We will both play the other girls and the crowd. Still your words are truth, so where will you do your orgy. Are you a teacher in an all girls school, are you in a first class plane ride, yoga class? Anywhere you want.

Everyone is welcomed. Men, woman and futa's. (I will only play a women or a futa). Will love to hear from all you lovely people.

Please, don't be scared to pm me all of today. Also if you have tried before don't be scared of trying again."

My boyfriend, on the other hand, got this intern job in a freaking hugeass company. Meanwhile I’m just sitting here doing nothing trying to cope with feeling so horrible, feeling useless and worthless. I feel so bad about myself. I get upset over everything. I’m scared of losing him (also majoring in finance, an environment with a lotta females), scared of failing classes, failing health (I have physical, and probably mental issues too.). Everything just sucks at this point. And my relationship is not great anymore, with such low self-confidence of mine, I’m insecure about EVERYTHING. 

I don’t know if I suffer from some kind of mental illness or not, but counselling and help are something we can’t have here cause every mental issues are just a myth here. People don’t believe in them.

Although it is a singular major, is a BA program, and isn’t officially listed under the engineering school, it is recognized by our CS honor society, Upsilon Pi Epsilon (UPE). I was hoping it wouldn’t disqualify me from consideration or put me at a large disadvantage. I have a decent GPA (&gt;3.5), some side projects, and am in UPE so I’d hope they’d still consider me.

Are the internships heavily geared towards juniors in hopes of converting them to full timers?

Although that all changed 30 minutes into the filming when I realised just what kind of movies they made. It was hot at first. Totally life changing experience to watch 2 amazingly hot pornstars rut, 5 feet away from me. 

Then the cut card happened. The male was not exactly performing well.. he couldn't get hard. Nothing was helping the absolute stallion get his lead out. 

Then him and the director had words with each other and I stood there getting stared at. One point of the directors finger my way and all of a sudden I was down on my knees cradling his forearm long cock between my fingers. Stroking him until his cock was fat and bloated and ready to go. 

Well...at least I have a job now...

9wneif,2,2018-11-13,The horrors of co-sleeping,parentanon2,Parenting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/9wneif/the_horrors_of_cosleeping/,"Reddit, I'm here under an anonymous account to get some issues off of my chest. These are the things I want to say to my wife, but can't say to my wife, so I'm going to share some contrarian advice to parents who are thinking of co-sleeping with their children.

&amp;#x200B;

I have an established career and make practically all of our income, while also working through an engineering degree on a part-time basis to build long-term career growth. My wife is starting a less demanding career, so she works a low-income internship from home and handles 90% of our kids' needs.

&amp;#x200B;

Three years ago, we had our first of two children. My wife had done a lot of reading about co-sleeping and was dead-set on it. I trusted her judgment. I wish I hadn't.

&amp;#x200B;

As it happened, our first son had colic for six months, causing him to wake up in the middle of the night shrieking in pain, repeatedly, every night. It quickly became apparent that I couldn't keep serving as the primary income source \*and\* maintain any progress in my studies on chronically low sleep. I bailed out of our bedroom and moved to a basement couch so I could sleep through the night and keep our income stable.

&amp;#x200B;

Our sex life essentially vanished. My wife was dealing with ongoing health issues and experiencing low libido. Our loss of regular physical contact at night created a loss of emotional connectedness. And our bed was almost constantly occupied by our son at night, which put a big dent in our usual spontaneity.

&amp;#x200B;

My wife had decided that our boy would be co-sleeping until he was ready to move into his own room. I expected our split sleeping arrangements to be temporary... but we didn't really talk about a specific timeline... so this temporary arrangement turned into a year, and then two years, and then three years. We argued frequently, which always ended: ""We committed to this together, and I think that stopping now will cause bigger problems, so our best choice is to continue."" She's done all the reading, so again, I have to trust her judgment.

&amp;#x200B;

Our second boy was born shortly before our first boy turned three. Again, my wife was dead-set on co-sleeping. I figured it would just be more of the same, and not much would change, right? Wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Our older boy apparently isn't crazy about sharing his mama. He began exhibiting severe boundary issues - constantly cramming up against her at night, pushing his feet into her, pulling her hair, touching her face. My wife was already coping with postpartum depression, and his behavior provoked episodes of rage. Nothing serious came of it - just full-volume shouting and slamming doors - but it created some scary moments.

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually, she caved on co-sleeping... a little. She bought a child bed for our older boy and put it next to the master bed. But he refuses to sleep in it through the night; he frequently crawls into the main bed. He won't take ""no"" for an answer. She's now trying to move him to his own bedroom next door. It's not working.

&amp;#x200B;

As a result of all this, our oldest boy has developed severe sleep issues. He cannot sleep through the night without waking up, crying (waking up everyone else), and demanding to sleep with mama. He has no circadian rhythm: some nights he's out by 7pm; other nights he absolutely \*will not sleep\* until midnight or later. When he's tired - which occurs often, including midday - he becomes frantic: will not stay in bed, will not listen to instructions, cries constantly, and sometimes resorts to throwing toys and hitting everyone, including his six-month-old brother. And we absolutely \*cannot\* get him to stay in his room through the night, short of locking the door from the outside.

&amp;#x200B;

My wife is massively strung out. Every night is an enormous struggle to get our son to bed, in addition to feeding our younger son when he wakes up through the night. She's under-slept and exhausted. She's also dealing with chronic pain and health issues from the birth - it's been seven months, and a battery of medical tests has failed to reveal a cause.

&amp;#x200B;

And I've been stuck in a moderate depression for over a year. My productivity is way off, which reduces our income, leading to mounting credit card debt and financial anxiety. Sex happens only when her libido and health issues cooperate, and she's absolutely not interested if she isn't able to participate. Sex happens less than once per month for \*over three years now\*, with no improvement in sight. My own sex drive has been strong for decades... I can feel it ebbing away from non-use.

&amp;#x200B;

I've reached the conclusion that most of these problems resulted directly from our commitment to co-sleeping. I don't know whether she mis-applied whatever techniques she learned about it, or whether we've just had an awful run of bad luck compounding bad luck. Obviously, now is not the best time to share that realization with my wife - but I'm having severe regrets about the trust I placed in her judgment. I feel like I've been just hanging on, waiting for things to get better... but it seems like we're years away from any kind of resolution.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I'm open to advice, but mostly just needed to tell my story.

Masters, DIY post bacc or Second Bachelors?",trippingdownlife,premed,https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/9wobnm/next_step_masters_diy_post_bacc_or_second/,"Hey everyone. I'm 22/F from NY going to a private university for a BS in Bio and double minoring in Forensic Science and Rhetorical Studies. I'm going to graduate with a 2.8/2.9 overall GPA. My main reason for this low gpa is because I was forced to keep my major in biology and was not allowed to transfer (with the threat of financial cutoff and the more dramatic disownment) even though the department at my uni is completely unsupportive and unorganized; some professors clearly state their apathy towards premed students and prefer research students instead. Due to my emotionally/physically/financially abusive family, I have continued to commute to this university from over 40 miles away by train+buses for four years now. That pressure, coupled with various personal (accidents leading to chronic injury, mental health) and familial health issues (paralysis from stroke, cancer, several deaths), led me to barely hang on by a thread each semester.   


I was able to keep up various ECs that are health-based, continued to volunteer, completed a 240+ hour shadowing internship at a Crime Lab (yup, in the morgue assisting autopsies), and did almost two years of research in a lab as well. I know am capable of succeeding as I achieved a good overall gpa in my minors, but being tied down to my abusive family and being forced to sacrifice hours of my days commuting led me to the hole I'm in now.   


I need to figure out my next step. I know I want to continue on the path to being a MD and I know I will have to cut ties with my immediate family for my next school if I want any chance of doing well. Is it wise to go for a second bachelors elsewhere and retake classes I did poorly in since I need to move away from them ASAP?  I doubt I will be getting into a SMP or even a regular Masters of Science with the gpa I will graduate with unless I do a diy post bacc. I have also seen that people apply to schools as a second bachelors and do not complete it and are able to use it for diy post bacc credits? Should I give up for US med and go for foriegn schools or just cut all my losses now? 

Any input would be helpful. "
9wp4k7,2,2018-11-13,Debating career change from ME to MSW,trillizos08,infj,https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/9wp4k7/debating_career_change_from_me_to_msw/,"22/F/clear as day INFJ/ Living at home with parents

I recently graduated with my bachelor's in mechanical engineering and I've been interning for three months. I also had a previous internship that was also three month. I am enjoying the people and the place but I can't stand the work. What I loved most about both places was being able to interact with the employees, hearing their life stories and being a source of strength and support to each person. 

I don't get that with my job and sitting in front of a desk, my projects are so unfulfilling, and I'm slaving away for a large corporation, but I got the job at the company doing what I thought I  wanted to do. Yet there no way to impact anyone in such a way that I help them grow and fight through their battles. 

I told my parents about it and they believe I've given up on the job too quick, and that if I hold on longer I'll like it. They say that I'll get used to it after a few years. 

I'm thinking to go into an MSW program in the spring of 2019, I've narrowed down to the few schools that are still open with applications, but none of them are in my home state TX. I have some money saved up, but I'll also be applying for scholarship and financial aid. But I don't know what specific route I should take in the program, so I assume it will take 2+ years.

What should I consider before making this jump?
Has anyone else here made that jump and if so, what did you do?
What has been the most difficult in the transition?

Thank you for your help!"

I will be meeting with AP to end a half year affair since we met at my work internship last spring.

Ever since I met him, it turned my world upside down. He knows I am dissatisfied with my marriage. He hang around because he's willing to wait. We had a deep connection.

We went on trips together. We went on a lot of adventures. He introduced me to his family and even to his kids (he's divorced).

AP and I - We've been texting nonstop and daily ever since I left. We've made plans for the future . We've imagined our life together.

I was this close to ending my marriage. 

The thing about the Philippines is that we don't have divorce. And so my intentions of leaving dragged on and on.

But I have to stop now before I explode. My husband is devastated. My son is neglected. My business is in shambles. 

AP doesn't know this is my intention - to end what we have.  He doesn't know that  ever since my husband found out, we have been trying to fix our marriage since.

Deep in my heart, I want to choose him over husband. Because I will never feel this way about someone ever again in my lifetime.

But I need to do what's right for my family. My happiness does not matter.

I will miss him dearly. He made me feel alive. He made me feel beautiful. He gave me an illusion of a future that I wanted to believe in. And now it is ending. I  am about to wake up. I do not even know if this is the best decision given what we feel about each other.

I am traveling again to the USA to bring my heart back home again to the Philippines."
9wp9i2,6,2018-11-13,My girlfriend (22F) of 5 years has suddenly cut off all contact with me (23M) and I don’t know what to do.,throwaway91728,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9wp9i2/my_girlfriend_22f_of_5_years_has_suddenly_cut_off/,"I love this girl dearly and our relationship has been tumultuous to say the least, but mostly amazing. She has been very suicidal in the past and has been diagnosed with various mental illnesses but she has always been the best girlfriend I could ask for and supported me in everything.

The last year has been especially hard for us because while she has been juggling college, a job, an internship, and her mental health, my brother was involved in a serious crime and I haven’t talked to him (or my family really) in over a year.

Things started going bad when I basically shut out all my emotions and refused to talk to her about it whenever she asked. I would inadvertently take my stress out on her and have been distancing myself ever since. We decided to separate and she moved out two months ago but we were keeping in touch with hopes to restore our relationship.

Then after not speaking for a couple days Instagram recommended me a new profile she had made and when I reached out to her to ask what was going on she responded saying that I was being controlling and fabricating an issue and making it about me. I was just curious and somewhat scared because until then we had left our social media the same so that’s why I asked and I even stated that I was fine with it but wanted to know what’s up. She blocked me everywhere and I had no way to contact her.

The reason we hadn’t talked in days prior to this conversation was because we got in an argument about how she thought it was fine to walk home alone drunk after nights out with coworkers. Although I did tell her that I was fine with it I was obviously pretty scared about it. I admit that because of my brothers long history with trouble I’ve developed severe anxiety about my loved ones being hurt or getting in trouble so I had been subconsciously asking her ridiculous questions about how she was taking precautions to stay safe living alone and stuff.

She had left one last important item at my place so this last weekend I waited outside her work at closing time (two minute walk), in hopes that I could just ask her what all this meant. When I gave her the item and asked to talk for a couple minutes she said that I wasn’t being fair and that it was stalker-ish of me to do that and to treat it like it’s over for good. I let her go but then I realized that I just couldn’t take care of our cat that was still with me so even though it was stupid I followed her to her place (also very close) and she said that she would after refusing to roll down the window and calling a friend over.

I called her parents that night and went to see them in the morning. They told me that they didn’t think I was being crazy and that they thought it was ridiculous that she was afraid I was going to hurt her which she has been telling everyone. They also said that they like me a lot and don’t understand why after sticking with her through her worst she didn’t do the same for me. I know that I’ve been really horrible to her this last year but it was good most days and we did love each other a lot.

She wouldn’t really talk to them either when they reached out to her so their advice was that I should just respect her wish to not contact her and that maybe in a couple months she would turn around and reach out to me. I know that she’s probably not thinking about other guys right now but she said she would not tell me if she decides to start dating again or hook up with anyone so my mind has been racing nonstop that she’s already intending to do so.

When I brought the cat over yesterday I asked to speak with her outside because she had a friend over. After hashing things out a little we both said that we loved each other but she kept her stance on ending it.

Everyone has told me to just get over her but it’s not so easy with the way things have been left and her refusal to give me solid closure. I’m obviously not going to think about other women or dating for a very long time but should I really just give up on all our history over this?

TL;DR - my girlfriend cut off all contact with me over what I would consider a small argument and says to treat it like it’s over for good. I have no way to get the closure that I need and don’t know what to do.

Edit: I wasn’t planning to contact her again before this post, my question about giving up was about if I should wait like her parents suggested. I left out that when I last saw her she said I could write her which has made me really confused... I will definitely work through this in therapy though and remember this experience well for future dating. Thank you all for commenting and talking some sense back into me because I really needed it."

When I saw the hub bub about this incident, I had a feeling they went too far. Not in the removal of the Press pass but the whole "" Jim Acosta inappropriately handled a WH Intern"" thing. And then of course the video the WH posted.  CNN may have a case here. I discussed this in other post in this subreddit, and did not find any immediate legal holes in the argument.

Of course, that is not exactly what the article addresses, they explicitly mention the removal of the press pass. We will have to see how to the case plays out.

Sorry for the huge WoT and any grammar/spelling mistakes.

&amp;#x200B;

**HUGE WALL OF CONTEXT**

I come from a country where moms are overprotective and criminality is not negligible (Not as safe as Japan, but also not war territory either, 3rd world issues).

I still lived with my parents at the time (i was 18ish) because we could not afford me moving out for college, so I would go to college everyday by car.

I had a car of my own, it was more than 10 years old back then but 'twas well taken care of; it was nearly a necessity having a car where I lived (not having to take the bus was a huge plus, no trains/subway over there).

My daily routine would consist of driving to the campus, classes, internship and gym, all which were in the campus' vicinity.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward 3 years and I was in my last years of college/university and I could afford (with moms help and my part-time job) to finally replace my old faithful companion.

We managed to get a good second-hand car from an acquaintance and she agreed that i would pick up the car at a dealership (the details are not relevant).

On the day itself, i show up, get the keys and documents, everything is ok, I call my overprotective mom and let her know it's all good.

I do the usual route after, classes, internship and gym. But because i had to do extra car stuff, I was a little late on my schedule.

&amp;#x200B;

By the time i leave the gym, it was already 8-9ish pm and i noticed that my phone was on top of my wallet, where one of my badges (probably internal university's id or something) triggered the NFCwhatever on the phone over and over, causing the battery to dry completely.

&amp;#x200B;

No biggie right ? Here comes the second part of the huge wall of context with another key info:

My mom had her car stolen, at gun point (something very, very uncommon in our city) a couple of years before that, and since then, she was a bit paranoid with the whole driving-alone-after-7-8pm-thing,

asking me and my sister to always reply SMS and/or pick up the phone/call back within 30 minutes.

&amp;#x200B;

When I get home, I see my mom, my dad and my sister all waiting for me in the living room, with their faces representing a mix between relief and WHERE THE FUCK WERE YOU, YOU SON OF A \*\*\*\*\*\*

I get my ass chewed hard by my mom, because I (supposedly) turned my phone off on purpose and she thought that I was kidnapped with the new (second-hand) car.

She called the university, their security department, the police, a couple of friends of mine and the gym (the person working at the front-desk also made sure to tell my mom ""I didn't see him here today"").

yadayadayada, she made me promise that i would tell her whenever I'd leave the gym, class or any other place that i might be late home.

&amp;#x200B;

**HERE IS WHAT YOU WERE LOOKING FOR, THE MALICIOUS COMPLIANCE**

I said ok, if that's what she wants, shes getting it. My dad, in a mix of ""do as your mom says"" and ""its not really my problem"" agreed with her.

Smartphones were a thing, and so was an app fresh out of the oven called *Tasker*.

I used tasker for little things like, switching to silent mode when inside the campus, switching on and off all kinds of stuff you can imagine based on time/place/battery level, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

You can already imagine where this is going right? Yes, i added a few extra rules that would send an SMS every time i would go in or out of one of those areas. To all my family members.

Enters gym, SMS mom, dad,sister ""Im at the gym"". Out of the gym SMS mom, dad, sister ""Im out of the gym"", for all the locations i mentioned previously (campus/classes, internship, gym and home).

&amp;#x200B;

An important detail is that sometimes the phone's GPS signal jitters/wobbles a little, so the texts would be sent sometimes 2-5 times per location as the phone's location would alternate between in and out of the specified areas.

&amp;#x200B;

After 5 minutes my sister texted me back: ""Please stop, i get your point"".

After half an hour, my dad texts me back: ""I am at work, can you please stop texting me all the time, just text your mom""

Two hours later (not following the 30min rule btw), my mom replies (thinking it was not an automated message): ""Hi son, thanks for letting me know, xoxo, mom""

&amp;#x200B;

On the second day my mom figured it was an automatic system in place, and after seven days she also got tired of it and just asked me to inform her whenever something extraordinary happened instead.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: as a lot of ppl pointed out, i was a senior and not a freshman :)

**TL;DR: College senior me living with parents got ass chewed by overprotective mom for not picking up the phone the day i got a new(ish) car, developed flow with Tasker to spam her with SMS with my location.**"

Long time lurker first time poster here on a throwaway account. I am a Senior in college and just accepted a job offer for a $75k salaried position as a Data Engineer in an extremely low cost of living area and now my head is starting to spin. I have questions around a few things:

Student Loans:
I have around $11k in Student Loans and was planning  on aggressively paying them off before the end of 2019 to not have them hanging over my head, is this a good plan or is making a lower payment not a horrible idea to keep more cash in hand?

Budget:
I currently work for the company I accepted my offer from and pull in around $2000/month as an intern. I pay $500 a month in rent, which I prepaid for the rest of the school year so there shouldn’t be any additional living expenses. My question is what budget should I aim for when I start my full time salary, and where should I allocate the additional income? I believe I can get a nice place to live for around $600/month and keep my monthly expenses around $1300 which will be much lower than my take home. What is the best use of that additional income? 

Car:
I will need to buy a car fairly soon after graduating. My grandparents have loaned me one of theirs while I have been in undergrad, but my grandma will need it back. How much money should I feel comfortable spending on a vehicle? I had in my mind the idea of putting $10k down on a $20k used car and financing the rest with about a $250 a month payment, but is that too much money for what my income will be? I don’t want to end up a slave to the vehicle I drive, however the vehicle I’ve targeted at $20k is something I have wanted since I was 16 (Used 2013 Lexus GS). If its not an irresponsible decision it would be really great to finally be able to afford it. 

Engagement:
I have been with my girlfriend for about 3 years now and want to get engaged briefly after graduating undergrad. What costs should I prepare for on this front and any general advice would be much appreciated. How much should I spend on her ring?

Grad School:
I also plan to apply to MBA programs in the northeast, how should I go about preparing for this financial beast. If that means no car and finding a cheaper place to live I am all for it, I am just unsure what to expect from that process. 


Basic background Info:
Savings: $6000 (untouched unless in case of emergencies)
Roth IRA: $11000 (fully funded for 2 years)
Current income: $2000/mo
Age: 22
Credit Score: 757 (not much history though)


I appreciate each of your time for reading and I really look forward to your feedback. I will try to reply to comments quickly if any additional info is needed!

I'm currently a junior (suppose to be senior) studying computer science. I fail a couple classes but i was able to retake them and earn a better grade. This has set me back from graduating on time. Majority of my friends will be graduating next semester while I will finally become a senior after this semester. I know i shouldn't feel bad because everyone goes at a different pace, but i feel like l let my parents down because they thought i would be graduating on time. Not only that but I've hear from many friends who had gotten good jobs or had landed internships while I have no internship experience at all. I will be applying to some soon (11 i have in mind) but i feel like wont be ready for the task because I've fail some of my cs course and so I haven't take the senior level courses yet. Thank you for hearing me out hopefully there is someone who share the same experience and could give me some insight."

The company was made to ""advance the bettermant of mankind"" well that's what my boss Mr. Shaw a fiery haired ginger says. I recently started working there and let me tell you that place is weird like super weird, they should call it the interspecies experimentation association.

Like the other day I'm pretty sure I saw a four foot frog sitting down in a chair with its legs crossed getting interviewed by one of the head scientists, like I said weird, anyway I just started working there and I'm basically just a glorified intern, I mean I am an intern but when I signed up I though that it would be really cool to work for the secretive science place but it's just been a lot of work I thought that i would just be getting coffee for people but they got me feeding some of the ""specimens"" writing up bios for them keeping track of there habits I mean I am getting paid pretty good so it's not all bad but its just really tiring either that or I'm just lazy, probably both. 

After I started working there it's gotten pretty hard to sleep so lately I find myself just watching vids on YouTube until i fall asleep, so here we are I'm going to be late for the third time in a row and I'm about to get an earful from Mr. Shaw then I'm going to lose my internship, I realize all of this after I hit the snooze button on my alarm for the fourth time in a row, so I jump out of bed with a new found energy that I never knew that I had and slip into my cloths like I'm Mr. Fantastic. There was not nearly enough time for me to make a sandwich for breakfast so I just grab to apples and I'm out the door forgetting to lock it, I live pretty close to the IEA facility which makes it so much worse that I'm late but, on the bright side if I were to run I could get there in five minutes.

You ever heard someone say you cant even walk and chew gum at the same time well what they should have said is you cant run at full speed and eat an apple at the same time because that is really tough, but some how I made it through one apple without choking to death on the run to work, so I'm running and I turn the corner and I see the building, now I know that I'm screwed but maybe if I'm not exactly thirty minutes late I can somehow save my job, so I put a little extra speed into my run even though it feels as if my lungs are going to implode and my heart is about to explode and my legs feel as if they are on fire.

I make it to the door with two minutes to spare and I clock in, in victory I take a bite out of my second apple feeling the satisfying crunch then taking another bite, but as soon as I did I felt my teeth glide straight through the apple like a hot knife through butter and the off taste of a bad apple, I spat it out into the nearest trash can then I looking down I saw that the apple was in fact bad with the flesh being brown and soft but something caught my eye, because of how soft the apple was when I took the bite it tore out the layer that separates the part that you eat from the seeds, but instead of the telltale black apple seeds there was something like a thick white cloth type substance, it looked like it lined the inside where the seeds were.

Being the curious person I was I poked it it was soft and stretchy and as I pulled my finger back it stuck to it, then all of a sudden the stem of the apple was gone it had retracted into the apple, I gave a short yelp then dropped the apple it rolled for a bit then stopped, cautiously I approached it then pushed it with my foot so that the part that I bit was visible, when I looked the cloth looking thing was writhing and wiggling like something was under it then it tore and as I stood there staring at my apple eyes wide, as eight beedie eyes staired back at me.

I recoiled back stumbling as an ivory white spider untangled itself and came sprawling out of the apple, the entire thing was white except the eyes which where a pitch black like I have never seen and one of its legs which was shorter than the others and half an inch of it was brown then it transitioned upward into the ivory white, stunned I just sat there staring at this thing that was inches away from my mouth recently then it moved it a started crawling towards me, I just sat there like a deer in headlights horrified, this thing was massive it was about the size of a kitten I was trying to figure out how the hell it fit in the apple, then i realized I should be asking why the hell it was crawling towards me and picking up the pace.

Before I could even move to back up it was already crawling up my leg needless to say I screamed like teenage girl in a trashy slasher flick and ran around like an idiot slamming myself on the floors and walls to try and crush this demon spawn that was crawling all over my body with little success I might add, then I heard someone shout ASP-55 stop that this instant and as fast as this albino hellspawn was on me it was off crawling towards the voice, I looked up and it was Mr. Shaw he stood there stone faced staring at that thing what's name was apparently ASP-55 I don't know if I had hit my head one to many times or not but the spawn of satan himself actually looked sad at the fact that Mr.Shaw was angry at it.

Oh how could I be mad at you, I though I had lost you forever Mr. Shaw said come here. Then the thing crawling up his leg then onto his shoulder, now as for you he said this is your third day in a row of being late normally we don't accept that type of behavior but you did get back my beautiful baby so you have one more chance and seeing that she didn't bite you she must see something special in your future, what do you think of working here full time and as a bonus you will be able to live in the facility so no rent, no extra bills and you're a lot less likely to be late if you live here, ummmm sure but just keep ""her"" away from me please.

 What would have happened if she had bitten me, oh you don't need to worry about her this strain of spider is very docile and friendly they have great instincts to, but if she had any reason to bite you, um let me explain what would happen, her diet consists of apple seeds and seeing that apple seeds have trace amounts of cyanide usually it's not enough to kill you but enzymes in her body heighten the toxicity, so if she was to bite you would feel like you are instantly being suffocated then you would die slowly eyes bulging throat tight like a vice is wrapped around it you know the usual, it is a horrible way to go but like I said this strain is very docile so you have nothing to worry about, so why did she attack me I asked, how would you feel if something bit a chunk out of your bedroom and started poking around, I don't know but I wouldn't start crawling all over them, well she did so I guess she has more guts than you. 

So that's how it went I don't know why the hell I said yes to a full time job offer but I did they also made me sign this contract it was super long so I didnt read it, so that's about it I will keep you posted, oh yeah and what I learned from this whole thing is that I'm pretty sure my boss doesn't have a soul, not only is the guy a ginger but I saw him kiss ASP-55 on what ever is the spider equivalent of a forehead and if there are two sets of people on this planet who don't have souls its gingers and people who have spiders as pets.

9wqmi7,7,2018-11-13,Contemplating haircut after 2 years of growth,sesame-yeezy,FierceFlow,https://www.reddit.com/r/FierceFlow/comments/9wqmi7/contemplating_haircut_after_2_years_of_growth/,"Hi guys. I’ve been growing my hair since the fall of 2016 &amp; have been considering donating it. After some quick research, Pantene Beautiful Lengths seems like to be the best to donate to. However, they are no longer accepting hair donations after Dec 31 2018 due to patients preferring synthetic wigs over real hair wigs. I emailed them asking if my donation that would come mid-late December would still be used for a wig. 

I am torn on whether I should cut my hair or not. I really liked having long hair so far. I’ve created a pros &amp; cons list...

Pros:
- Unique; not as many guys have long hair. I like the idea of not conforming to gender rules &amp; norms although long hair on men is generally accepted nowadays (and historically speaking has been for centuries).
- Variation of style. Wearing it down, buns, ponytails, braids... it’s fun to wear it different ways and have such flexibility.
- Progress. Going through awkward stages of growing it out to having it 12.5” in a ponytail is cool to see. 
- If able to donate, would go to someone who needs it more than me.

Cons:
- Maintenance/upkeep. Longer to wash, dry, style than traditional short hair (obvious).
- *personal one* Sometimes when I have to dress up for school &amp; internship, I find it hard to make it look “professional”. Although I am entering a pretty lax and accepting career path (appearance wise), sometimes I just feel goofy with long hair and a dress shirt &amp; pants. I tend to tie it up during these times but still. 


I’m sure there are pros and cons but that’s all I can think of currently. I’ve also been wanting to dye my hair recently too (a gray-ish blonde) &amp; I know how much more maintenance I’d have to do with that. My girlfriend loves my longer hair and she’s part of the reason why I want to keep it. She seems to the one who really adores it while others either don’t say much about it or (my parents) always badgering me to cut it. 

I don’t plan on making a decision until I know Pantene would still take my hair. Even then, I might still keep growing it out. I want to put this out here to hear anyone else’s experience of making drastic changes to their hair &amp; if any regrets resulted. I know this sub is pretty pro-long hair (obviously from the nature of the sub) but wanted to get some input regardless. Thanks!

9wqqlq,2,2018-11-13,Why I don't eat apples anymore (I.E.A series part 2),OnyxTheMadMan,clancypasta,https://www.reddit.com/r/clancypasta/comments/9wqqlq/why_i_dont_eat_apples_anymore_iea_series_part_2/,"I hate being late, like seriously I hate it but I cant help it, I get so caught up sometime just binge watching YouTube videos, it's the closest thing to therapy I've got, ok let me start with my name before I get into to much detail my name is Jason Stanfield and I work for the interspecies exploration association better know as IEA they are a privately owned company you might have heard of them. The company was made to ""advance the bettermant of mankind"" well that's what my boss Mr. Shaw a fiery haired ginger says. I recently started working there and let me tell you that place is weird like super weird, they should call it the interspecies experimentation association.

Like the other day I'm pretty sure I saw a four foot frog sitting down in a chair with its legs crossed getting interviewed by one of the head scientists, like I said weird, anyway I just started working there and I'm basically just a glorified intern, I mean I am an intern but when I signed up I though that it would be really cool to work for the secretive science place but it's just been a lot of work I thought that i would just be getting coffee for people but they got me feeding some of the ""specimens"" writing up bios for them keeping track of there habits I mean I am getting paid pretty good so it's not all bad but its just really tiring either that or I'm just lazy, probably both. 

After I started working there it's gotten pretty hard to sleep so lately I find myself just watching vids on YouTube until i fall asleep, so here we are I'm going to be late for the third time in a row and I'm about to get an earful from Mr. Shaw then I'm going to lose my internship, I realize all of this after I hit the snooze button on my alarm for the fourth time in a row, so I jump out of bed with a new found energy that I never knew that I had and slip into my cloths like I'm Mr. Fantastic. There was not nearly enough time for me to make a sandwich for breakfast so I just grab to apples and I'm out the door forgetting to lock it, I live pretty close to the IEA facility which makes it so much worse that I'm late but, on the bright side if I were to run I could get there in five minutes.

You ever heard someone say you cant even walk and chew gum at the same time well what they should have said is you cant run at full speed and eat an apple at the same time because that is really tough, but some how I made it through one apple without choking to death on the run to work, so I'm running and I turn the corner and I see the building, now I know that I'm screwed but maybe if I'm not exactly thirty minutes late I can somehow save my job, so I put a little extra speed into my run even though it feels as if my lungs are going to implode and my heart is about to explode and my legs feel as if they are on fire.

I make it to the door with two minutes to spare and I clock in, in victory I take a bite out of my second apple feeling the satisfying crunch then taking another bite, but as soon as I did I felt my teeth glide straight through the apple like a hot knife through butter and the off taste of a bad apple, I spat it out into the nearest trash can then I looking down I saw that the apple was in fact bad with the flesh being brown and soft but something caught my eye, because of how soft the apple was when I took the bite it tore out the layer that separates the part that you eat from the seeds, but instead of the telltale black apple seeds there was something like a thick white cloth type substance, it looked like it lined the inside where the seeds were.

Being the curious person I was I poked it it was soft and stretchy and as I pulled my finger back it stuck to it, then all of a sudden the stem of the apple was gone it had retracted into the apple, I gave a short yelp then dropped the apple it rolled for a bit then stopped, cautiously I approached it then pushed it with my foot so that the part that I bit was visible, when I looked the cloth looking thing was writhing and wiggling like something was under it then it tore and as I stood there staring at my apple eyes wide, as eight beedie eyes staired back at me.

I recoiled back stumbling as an ivory white spider untangled itself and came sprawling out of the apple, the entire thing was white except the eyes which where a pitch black like I have never seen and one of its legs which was shorter than the others and half an inch of it was brown then it transitioned upward into the ivory white, stunned I just sat there staring at this thing that was inches away from my mouth recently then it moved it a started crawling towards me, I just sat there like a deer in headlights horrified, this thing was massive it was about the size of a kitten I was trying to figure out how the hell it fit in the apple, then i realized I should be asking why the hell it was crawling towards me and picking up the pace.

Before I could even move to back up it was already crawling up my leg needless to say I screamed like teenage girl in a trashy slasher flick and ran around like an idiot slamming myself on the floors and walls to try and crush this demon spawn that was crawling all over my body with little success I might add, then I heard someone shout ASP-55 stop that this instant and as fast as this albino hellspawn was on me it was off crawling towards the voice, I looked up and it was Mr. Shaw he stood there stone faced staring at that thing what's name was apparently ASP-55 I don't know if I had hit my head one to many times or not but the spawn of satan himself actually looked sad at the fact that Mr.Shaw was angry at it.

Oh how could I be mad at you, I though I had lost you forever Mr. Shaw said come here. Then the thing crawling up his leg then onto his shoulder, now as for you he said this is your third day in a row of being late normally we don't accept that type of behavior but you did get back my beautiful baby so you have one more chance and seeing that she didn't bite you she must see something special in your future, what do you think of working here full time and as a bonus you will be able to live in the facility so no rent, no extra bills and you're a lot less likely to be late if you live here, ummmm sure but just keep ""her"" away from me please. 

What would have happened if she had bitten me, oh you don't need to worry about her this strain of spider is very docile and friendly they have great instincts to, but if she had any reason to bite you, um let me explain what would happen, her diet consists of apple seeds and seeing that apple seeds have trace amounts of cyanide usually it's not enough to kill you but enzymes in her body heighten the toxicity, so if she was to bite you would feel like you are instantly being suffocated then you would die slowly eyes bulging throat tight like a vice is wrapped around it you know the usual, it is a horrible way to go but like I said this strain is very docile so you have nothing to worry about, so why did she attack me I asked, how would you feel if something bit a chunk out of your bedroom and started poking around, I don't know but I wouldn't start crawling all over them, well she did so I guess she has more guts than you. 

So that's how it went I don't know why the hell I said yes to a full time job offer but I did they also made me sign this contract it was super long so I didnt read it, so that's about it I will keep you posted, oh yeah and what I learned from this whole thing is that I'm pretty sure my boss doesn't have a soul, not only is the guy a ginger but I saw him kiss ASP-55 on what ever is the spider equivalent of a forehead and if there are two sets of people on this planet who don't have souls its gingers and people who have spiders as pets.



Carter: Briggs why the hell are we staking out a IEA facility?

Briggs: because the place is fishy 

Carter: listen man I could be doing something a whole lot better with my time but instead I'm in this hot piece of trash you call a car.

Briggs: hey watch it man, this car is a beauty and we are going to leave soon just a few more minutes.

Carter: we have been here all ni- 

Briggs: hold on what with that guy, hes running like a bat out of hell.

Carter: he must be late.

Briggs: there's got to be something.
.
.
Briggs: what the hell why is he slamming himself against the wall like that and who's the ginger, the guy looks heated.

Carter: I will admit, that was pretty weird but not weird enough for us to do anything with.

Briggs: wait what the hell is that thing on his shoulder?

Carter: who's shoulder?

Briggs: the ginger here use the binoculars.

Carter: I don't see anything.

Briggs: the other shoulder.

Carter: I still don't see any- holy gigantic albino spider batman.

Briggs: ok we're going to just walk past how cringey that was and focused on the giant spider on the guys shoulder. That ain't normal, I knew that there was something wrong with this place.

Carter: so what are we going to do?

Briggs: we need more proof, then we can get a full investigation on this place and find out what's really going on behind those walls.

9wqsa8,9,2018-11-13,Blindsided by breakup,magnolia_924,MedSpouse,https://www.reddit.com/r/MedSpouse/comments/9wqsa8/blindsided_by_breakup/,"My M4 ex SO ended our 1.5 year relationship Friday night. We've done pseudo-long distance (2 hours by car) since just a few weeks into our relationship. 

All last week I could tell he was a little distant, but that happened sometimes on busy weeks and last week was a busy one. He had interviews, rec league sports, his radiology rotation and practicing for Step 2 CS. He still was in contact every day/night.

Friday night, he drove in for us to hang out and as we got into bed he broke down crying saying ""I can't do this anymore."" He said that he's not ready to move in together (I'm not surprised, I'm his first serious relationship) and he feels very surely that he will end up out of state for his residency and just can't do long distance his intern year, it will be too hard. That he loves me but he just needs to end it before it gets too hard. I asked him if he's been feeling this way long, and he said no, only since he had spoken to his roommate during the week about not be able to commit to a least for the next year. He said his roommate asked about me and he didn't know how to respond, so I guess that spiraled into him feeling strongly that we needed to end.

I am absolutely heartbroken. I didn't see this coming at all. We'd spoken about residency and where he'd like to go and how easy it would be for me to travel to each place. Last week we spent the weekend together and he told me how much he loved me and that he was going to miss me this week and would try to make it to town during the week if he had an early night.

I feel like maybe he's just panicking because of all the stress, but I'm too scared to give myself any kind of hope. I've started no contact and it's so so hard.

I'm sorry to post another sad story, but my friends don't really understand how hard these relationships can be sometimes. I guess I was just looking for someone to understand how bad this hurts. It's not that we did anything wrong, it's the circumstances and I think that may be worse."

CNN, who has nearly 50 additional hard pass holders, and Mr. Acosta is no more or less special than any other media outlet or reporter with respect to the First Amendment. After Mr. Acosta asked the President two questions—each of which the President answered—he physically refused to surrender a White House microphone to an intern, so that other reporters might ask their questions. This was not the first time this reporter has inappropriately refused to yield to other reporters.
The White House cannot run an orderly and fair press conference when a reporter acts this way, which is neither appropriate nor professional. The First Amendment is not served when a single reporter, of more than 150 present, attempts to monopolize the floor. If there is no check on this type of behavior it impedes the ability of the President, the White House staff, and members of the media to conduct business.”"

9wsfdg,1,2018-11-13,thanks mom.,JunoW123,SketchComedy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SketchComedy/comments/9wsfdg/thanks_mom/,"A little about myself. So, Im 25, completed med school, finished most of my internship and am now currently studying for my board exams. I also have two jobs, one in retail and one in hospice care. Im not upset with how busy I am what so ever, in fact, when I'm productive thats when I feel the happiest. okay so my life in a sense has felt like a check list my parents created before I was even in kindergarten. NO JOKE. they sent me to this elementary school that also turned into a middle school, the catch...YOU KNEW THESE KIDS SINCE FIRST GRADE AND ITS THE SAME DAMN 20. so we all kinda knew.. a little too much about one another. Some kids were nice, like me. and some kids came straight out of the devils butthole. I got teased A LOT. and okay, I kinda was an easy target being the only Indian girl with wolverine hair from head to toe and also being socially awkward af. BAM! easy target achieved. So I got bullied, got called an emo..and the worst part was I started to believe it. That I was mentally unstable and just not happy all the time. .... BUT WHO WOULD BE?!? BEING CALLED CRAZY OVER AND OVER AGAIN...eventually you might just become that. ... which i did. and i was the worst kind of emo too, the winey ass one. Now Im a winey ass adult. anyway...going back to where it all began. MY MOTHER. she knew all this shit! she knew i was getting bullied, that the school was crap and i used to literally have aniexty about who i would need to sit with at lunch because i couldn't pull a lindsey lohan and hide in the bathroom ... middle schoolers smell like a mix of crap and the cheapest bottle of victoria secret. anway. my mom knew. what did she do? nothing. SO middle school is a blackout repressed memory. Highschool, went to an all girl school. thought I would hate it. LOVED IT. By senior year girls would be carrying tampons in their white, tide washed, downey scented, expensive victoria secret perfume, blouses. THESE GIRLSSSS would straight up throw tampons across the hall, room, and foyer..if they thought for a second, some damsel was in distress. women's intuition at its finest. Anyway, i loved it. Girls are so amazing. I was going to say except my mom after that but..i thought that would be too mean..but since i said it anyway... So I'm done with med school studying for boards and its really difficult, which is a no brainer. It takes a lot of concentration and caffiene to get me to sit the fuck down and study herpes, OKAY. i studied this shit over and over again, but it still amazes me till date how messes up this virus is. AND MY MOM NEVER WARNED ME ABOUT IT. The day i learned about herpes was the day my i became a women, because i started to care about myself. anyway, my mom...piece of work. she's been in the medical field since the sands of time, and never told me anything...about...the medical field. I learned everything on my own. Flashback to that Fresh prince of bellair episode where Will Smith did, in my opnion, the most admireable and iconic thing. He went off script and truly expressed how he felt. It was the episode where his father, Lui came to visit and acted as if he really gave a crap about Will but at the end Lui was only looking out for himself and was ready to abandon Will again. And by the end of the episode it was just Will and Uncle phil and what he goes on to say next and how he delieverd it, I can feel his pain. And that to me is an outstanding actor. The whole reason why this was brought up to begin with is, the feeling of having a parent who is physically there at times but never emotionally. Which is terrible. I applaud every parent who makes an attempt to be in their kids lives to build their confidence and help them become a contribution to society. Unfortunately, that aint my parents. I was supposed to be my own worst enemy...turned out my mom beat me to it. The whole reason for this massive vent with a twist of my sense of tragic humor, is to say that currently I don't have a good connection with my mom and I feel like its really ... her fault. Usually I blame my self right away, being a former winey ass emo, so whenever shit hits the ceiling I would say its my fault out of habit. I've learned to stop doing that..and shit hit the ceiling for my mom. Because now she can't blame me for her smelly poopy ceiling shit. She needs to clean that on her own with the tide and downey she never used on my all girl school uniform blouse. My armpits were stained yellow by senior year and I had to wear a cardigan in summer...in SO CAL. She is always putting me down. regarding my study habits, 6 hours a day is not enough.. my eating habits because either im too fat at 115 or too skinny at ...115. and also ME SMOKING WEED. ... ITS LEGAL NOW AND IT GETS ME NOT TO BURN THIS HOUSE DOWN. I don't smoke in the house, I got to a different street in a bordering city to smoke my . I literally go on my bike, down a couple streets..in a bordering city. To Smoke My Weed Without Judgment. I would choose smoking pot over drinking and or doing some next level drug. Thats just me. Also I'm a mean drunk. So I mean its a win win if I just smoke. So my mother always is sniffing around the house trying to play it off as allergies just to find where my stash is…my stash is outside in the shed. I WOULD HAVE TO BE AN IDIOT TO HAVE IT IN THE HOUSE. so basically, I know she’s lying when she says she smells it in the house. at first if was HILARIOUS, but then it became ugly. Because not only was it her ... she got my aunt to join in on the weed bullying and got one of my cousins who just landed from india to pester me about the non existent weed smell in the house. Eventually I lost it, and everyones little dirty secrets that I held onto for about 6months, i blurted out...and you know what happened..THEY TURNED ON EACH OTHER. And thats where i am right now..sitting in my room..drinking my coffee and listening to them. anyway I hope it made you laugh and also you can relate to this. peace, love, respect..smoke that weed till I'm dead &lt;3 SG"

I was never an academic student growing up but was enjoyed programming a lot and was decent at it.

I  planned to spend at least half my time programming, learning computer  science theory, doing hobby projects, relevant extracurricular and  trying to find some internships i guess.

Though  I don't enjoy my time here, I'm quite miserable. My entire day is  consumed by courses that I do not take any interest in (Calculus,  Discrete Math, Psychology) and I'm not doing anything of what I planned  to do above because I'm trying to pass my courses and meet the GPA  requirement.

I'm so tempted to drop out  at this point, it's only been 2 months and half and i got 3 quarters of  the academic year to go, and 3 more years afterwards. I'm really not  enjoying this. The typical response would be ""If you're struggling and  not enjoying your degree, then the degree just isn't right for you""  though I'm not spending time doing Computer Science, I'm spending all my  time on the required side courses and even my electives.

Time  is going by so fast that I feel like I can just sit down and watch a  clock for 15 minutes and It wouldn't be that bad. It's easier than  stressfully trying to understand Linear Algebra.

It  takes up all my time and only few hours a Friday night I'd give myself a  break and be slightly happy. Life is short and 4 years is a decent  fraction of your life. Will it really be this way for 4 years?

Any advice?"
9wssey,4,2018-11-13,Need help with private project,splunkzilla,Splunk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Splunk/comments/9wssey/need_help_with_private_project/,"I'm working with my city to create a data analytics program that is student ran. Today the mayor called me and asked what are my requirements for the students to be candidates in the program. I was at a loss. Here is what I said:

1. No more than 15 students. Any more would require additional IT resources, and we wouldn't be able to personalize the instruction.


2. Students interested in the areas of Math and Science, Engineering, Art, Computer Programming, and/or Business Management as a career path. I'm less concerned about grades. In fact a program like this may get students to get better grades, as it may make them look forward to building a better career path and college outlook. I wouldn't personally make a certain GPA a requirement; but as a caveat, if grades were to decrease then they would have to be let go from the program.


3. Students would have to understand how important data analytics can be. They have to take it seriously. They would have to understand that what they are doing may change how the city runs and that ALL people in the city would be affected based on their inferences.


4. The environment would need to be immersive. To which I mean that it would have to feel like they are working for the city. Which they would be. But the instruction and expectations of the students would need to convey that fact. So it becomes more of an internship and less of a classroom environment.

### CNN believes this jackass’s constitutional rights were abused when they took his hard pass to attend press briefings.

**CNN sued today to get Acosta’s White House hard pass back so he can harass the president and take over a press conference.**
   
 Imagine if ANY reporter treated Obama with such disrespect?

A few CNN reporters told me that they’re embarrassed by Acosta &amp; CNN. A WH correspondent from a major network (not Fox) told me “This isn’t the Jim F*ing Acosta Show. We all hate him. He’s an asshole and he actually is disrespectful to the president.”

**CNN really is fake news.**

[The Daily Mail](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6384825/CNN-sues-Trump-demanding-return-Acosta-White-House.html) reported:

CNN filed a federal lawsuit Tuesday against the Trump administration after the White House suspended White House correspondent Jim Acosta’s ‘hard pass’ press credential. Acosta clashed with President Donald Trump and a press office intern during a November 7 press conference.

The networks’ suit, filed by a team that includes former George W. Bush solicitor general Ted Olson, demands the immediate return of Acosta’s credentials. The White House fired back at CNN, one of the president’s favorite targets, for ‘grandstanding.’

Acosta lost access to the building last Wednesday night, hours after refusing to give up a microphone when the president said he had answered enough of his questions.

White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement that Acosta ‘physically refused to surrender a White House microphone to an intern.’ That appeared to be softer language than her earlier claim that he placed ‘his hands on a young woman just trying to do her job.’

CNN vigorously disputed the implication of anything more than minor physical contact.

Attorneys for CNN sued Tuesday in Washington, D.C. in U.S. District Court.

Eons ago, Bor clashes with Malekith's father. Malekith himself is a child at this point. Malekith's father attempts to use the Aether but is killed by a young Odin before he can. The Asgardians themselves cause the Dark Elf ships to crash while Malekith's father's lieutenant Algrim takes Malekith to safety.  


In the present day, Loki is imprisoned for his crimes in the 1st *Avengers*. Thor, Fandral, Volstagg, Sif and Hogun repel enemies on Hogun's home world Vanaheim. We have Hogun stick with Fandral and Volstagg instead of staying in Vanaheim. The Asgardians soon learn that the Convergence is imminent.  


Jane Foster isn't dating anyone, she's focusing all her time on her research. We're also taking out Darcy Lewis' intern. Jane and Lewis go to the abandoned factory where portals have opened, disrupting the laws of physics round them. Foster is transported to another world where she is infected by the Aether. Heimdall alerts Thor, leading him to Earth. He finds Foster and returns her to Asgard. Odin recognises the Aether and says it will kill Foster and it heralds the return of the Dark Elves.  


Malekith is awakened by the Aether's release. He turns Algrim into a Kursed and attacks Asgard. Malekith kills Frigga himself but is forced to flee without Foster. The reason I'm having Malekith to the one to kill Frigga instead of Algrim is because I'm gonna have Loki actually betray Thor and one of the Warrior's Three kill Algrim. Since Thor kills Malekith, it makes sense to make this avenging Frigga's death.  


On Earth, Lewis returns to the factory and attempts to go through the portal to where Foster had ended up but it has closed.  


Now the sensible thing for Thor to have done is leave Foster in Asgard where she's protected and bring Sif and the Warrior's Three with him. So, lets make the Aether unstable and destructive. We have a scene where it ends an Asgardian and we know leaving Foster in Asgard is not an option.  
Thor would still bring the Warrior's Three. Sif would stay behind to protect Asgard as her actor was apparently injured, making it impractical for her to go with them. Thor and co enlist Loki's help because he knows a secret portal to Svartalfhelm.  


Lewis turns to Erik Selvig who hasn't been instituted. Instead Selvig is still working for Shield.   


In Svartalfhelm, Loki really does betray Thor and hands Foster over to Malekith. Malekith reveals that the conflict between his father and Bor was actually caused by Bor who attacked Svartalfhelm.  


Malekith merges with the Aether and leaves in his ship with Loki while one of the Warrior's Three kills Algrim. Thor, Foster and the Warrior's Three reach a cave Foster recognises as where she found the Aether and the portal back to Earth but find its closed.  


Selvig and Lewis use Shield technology he had developed with the Tesseract to open the portal to Svartalfhelm. Thor, Foster and the Warrior's Three get through. Together, they learn that Malekith is planning to unleash the Aether at the centre of the Convergance in Greenwich.   


Foster, Lewis and Selvig run around setting up the portal stick things. The Warrior's Three fight the Dark Elves. And Thor fights and kills Malekith.   


Thor returns to Asgard, declines Odin's offer to be king and warns Odin that Loki is still out there. As Thor leaves, we find out Loki is impersonating Odin. "
9wtsq0,3,2018-11-13,How likely am I to be able to find a job out of undergrad with only Exam P?,Sunbears_,actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/9wtsq0/how_likely_am_i_to_be_able_to_find_a_job_out_of/,"I am in the Chicago suburbs. I'm currently a senior at a smaller liberal arts college and will be graduating in May. I started college as Math Education, but then felt that the pay and lifestyle of a public school teacher wasn't what I was looking for. I kind of floated between subjects, and am now going to graduate with a math major and minors in Spanish, business administration, and computer science. I have particular interest in statistics and have really struggled with the programming part of my education.

&amp;#x200B;

I've briefly used R, have some experience with Python, HTML/CSS/Javascript, and C++. Again, I really struggled with computer science. I've looked into Data Science, but am afraid my programming skills won't suffice. I wouldn't say learning more languages or improving my knowledge is completely out of the question, though. 

&amp;#x200B;

I kind of always assumed I could just get a job with my math degree, but I've been realizing that many graduates with math degrees have trouble finding jobs. I've been looking more into actuarial science. I think I could definitely have Exam P under my belt by graduation. How likely am I to be able to find a job with just Exam P?

&amp;#x200B;

I've done a programming internship at an after school program in which I taught elementary schoolers to work with hardware and learn coding basics, and I have leadership experience as an RA for two years and an undergraduate hall director for one year, where I supervised a staff of RAs, if any of that is relevant either.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Panicking math major wondering if they can get a job with only Exam P."

9wuoag,1,2018-11-13,Not sure if I [24F] should break up with my boyfriend [25M] of two years,t_h_rowe_away,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9wuoag/not_sure_if_i_24f_should_break_up_with_my/,"Soon after college, I broke up with my then-boyfriend of 3 years [also 25M] purely because we were in an open ended LDR after graduation and didn't know how long that would last or where we would be going. It was a really hard choice then but the LDR life was too painful for me to continue. I had a year long internship where, part way through, I started dating my roommate who is now my current bf, not long after ending it with the ex. We had an expiration date for the end of that year because he was moving to NYC and I didn't know yet where I would be. The expiration date came, we broke up despite still having feelings for each other, and spent that summer in limbo as I decided where I would end up. Surprise, at the end of that summer I got a job in NYC and moved in to a shared bedroom with current bf and some roommates. We spent about a year like this and were pretty happy, but hated our roommates and moved out to a one bedroom together still in NYC. This is around 1.5 years of dating. 

So things have been moving pretty fast because we had already been living together before dating, and because of the high housing cost in NYC necessitating some form of cohabitation, with or without separate roommates. I've thought about the ex from college, as we got along very well and were very happy together, but was able to keep from feeling like I was missing out on being with him because I had been happy with the current bf for this time. But now that we're living together just the two of us, I feel like things have been more strained. We spend most of our time with each other and have had a hard time making friends in such a huge new city, and I'm really not enjoying living here. He is sick of the cost of living, and we have been talking for a couple months about moving somewhere cheaper together which I have been excited about until maybe the past month.

The ex boyfriend from college has just moved to NYC in that time (not to follow me or anything, it's just a very common place to live in our industry) and I have since been feeling like I miss having him in my life. (He is only planning on being here through the end of September, and I will be moving in May. He doesn't know where he wants to move after this.)  I think we got along better than my current bf and I do and sometimes when bf and I argue lately, I know my college ex would be handling things better. College ex and I have kept in touch a little, current bf knows and is fine with me wanting to retain a friendship, but lately I've been craving more than friendship with the ex. I'm guessing because of him reappearing in my life in a way that is harder to ignore (same city as me vs him touring/moving a lot the past two years) as well as the recent increased strain on the current relationship. 

I don't know how much of our current strain is a lack of healthy contact with other friends, or my desire to be out of this city for good putting me in a worse mood, but this past month when I think about moving with current bf if makes me more anxious than excited. Our relationship is good but has it's issues: he is less responsible than me at adult tasks like keeping the apartment tidied, taking out trash, cooking dinner, saving money, etc and sometimes I feel like I'm responsible for dragging him into adulthood. There are plenty of times where we're laughing, having great conversations, and enjoy doing the same things, and we're pretty good at talking through issues. But he's more comfortable with the pace things have been moving at, since this is his longest relationship. It feels like a serious adult relationship to him and I feel like I'm still testing the waters a bit.  I can't help but compare things to my last relationship which lasted a year longer than we've currently been together, and I feel like current bf is trying to lock things down too fast. 

Part of me wants to move with current bf and see where it goes, as I've been happy with him for the majority of this relationship. But part of me is somehow still hung up on my college ex (who has been single the past 2 years as I've been dating current bf) that I'm still friends with and has re entered my life for the time being. I also worry if the more serious this gets, the more I notice that current bf is less responsible than I would like.

 It's not fair to my current bf to want to trade up, and its not fair to ex bf to reopen something he has mentally accepted to be done, even if we have no bad blood. I feel very selfish and lost making this decision, and I'm so afraid of wasting both my current bf's and my time, or of having false hope that ex bf and my lives will ever line up again. I want a family someday and I'm afraid I'm wasting my time biologically if I throw away this relationship that I've been happy in just because I'm scared I might grow to resent current bf for his current habits, even though he has been working on them and showing some progress. 

Should I give up on ex bf for good, since who knows the odds of that coming together perfectly ever again?  Should I talk to him about if he ever thinks about us dating again, since he hasn't dated anyone else since we were together and he's still more than happy to have me in his life as a friend? And since I'm turning our relationship into my dating standard, and we broke up for purely distance reasons, not fiery explosion of hatred reasons...

Should I move with current bf because things are pretty good, even if I have some issues?  Will I never have a family if I keep running from relationships like my current one and comparing exes to current bfs...

Or do I burn it all down and stay single for a year to figure out my shit?

Thank you for reading, if you got through all that. I really don't know what to do.

Tldr: Bf and I had been planning on moving across the country together, but my ex (on good terms) has re entered my life and I'm now second guessing my current relationship"

#**Government Arsenal Official Sponsorship, and Defense Research University**

---

*February 2020*

The Government Arsenal, and the Department of Science and Technology, recognizing the importance of the intellectual development of Philippine domestic industries will appropriate $225 million for the construction of the Defense Research University (DRU) near the Government Arsenal. This University will specialize in defense-related engineering and complementary disciplines with multiple laboratories, and testing facilities. 

An additional $30 million will be set aside to offer a sign-on bonuses for a global recruitment drive to staff this University with professors and other capable instructors in the fields listed below which will bring expertise and know-how to Philippine shores. Sign-on bonuses will be proportional to the agreed length of teaching contract, and all individuals who accept will receive full access to the Philippine Universal Healthcare system, a waiver to join the Philippine government pension program with the same terms as current government employees, and housing on campus. 

The University will specialize in the following:

* Aeronautic Engineering

* Naval Engineering

* Sensors

* Electronic and Digital Control and Management Systems

* Remote Systems

* Machine Learning 

* Metallurgy

* Chemical Engineering

* Computer Engineering

* Optical Engineering

* Power Engineering
* Astrophysics

* Meteorology

* Intelligence

* Mechanical Engineering, especially towards military pursuits.

* Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence

* Directed Energy and Optomechanical Engineering

* Radiology

* Health Technology

* Nuclear Physics

The Sponsorship section of the program will provide funding to public and private Philippine universities to assist students and schools in providing a top-quality education. This will extend as far down as secondary school with high school students receiving grants and scholarships on a merit-first basis. Funds will be apportioned to schools based on how specific the programs are and how closely they match the requirements of the Government Arsenal and the Department of Science and Technology at large.

A further part of this program is the screening and selecting of prime candidates of excellent standing and ability to intern at the GA and DSAT, and to fast track employment opportunities upon graduation. Admittance to the DRU will automatically grant a student a head start in the process of eventual employment by the GA and DSAT.

The University will be constructed in 3 Phases each taking two years to build, with the first Phase opening in 2022. The University administration will use the two years following the start of this program to organize the general administration, curriculum, and seek and hire staff. 

(M) The following second roll outcome will be used to determine success of foreign professional poaching for each of the 6 years going forward, assuming the main roll of the program is successful. 

|Roll|Effect|
|---|---|
1|Less than 3 professionals. 
2-5|4-8 professionals. 
6-10|9-15 professionals.
11-15|16-22 professionals
16-19|23-28 professionals.
20|30 professionals."
9wvrsk,2,2018-11-13,My [25/M] GF [22/F] is thinking about taking a break for herself and to know other people after some fights (lots of background in the post),trouauei00,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9wvrsk/my_25m_gf_22f_is_thinking_about_taking_a_break/,"This is a throwaway account. Sorry for the huge wall of text. Even if no one takes the time to read and answer, just writing it all down already helped a lot.

**Personal backgrounds:**
---

I was very into parties when in college (graduated about 3 years ago). I just liked to drink, dance and have fun. I never hit on girls. In fact, I've had sex with 2 other girls and probably didn't kiss 15 in my 25-ish years. I'm telling this to make the point that I was never into the concept of ""having to know other people"". I either want to try a real and long lasting relationship with them or I just want to be friends with no kissing or sex involved whatsoever. Currently, I'm not into parties or anything that happens too late, i.e. after 10pm.

My girlfriend is about 3 years younger and was always controlled by her parents. She barely went out to parties when in college, she didn't drink a lot and had maybe 2 or 3 boyfriends before me. She still doesn't like to go to parties and prefers restaurants and such


**Relationship background:**
---

**Point #1: Her jealousy**
---

We started dating about 1 year and 3 months ago. Long distance relationship. She was always very jealous. Throughout our relationship she stalked my past on Facebook, asked about previous girls I've been involved with (even just kissing in a random party) and other girls I've liked/loved. Many of those girls I still had contact with at the time. Very sporadic contact. 100% as friends, at least by my part (I can't talk for my friends, but I've never felt anything other than friendship coming from them). She then proceeded to be against me going out to anything where one of those previous girls might be. This led me to stop attending to friends events of all sorts and, therefore, those friends are not exactly my friends anymore.

On my part, I always let her do whatever she wanted when it came down to going out with friends from her internship or college friends. It was mostly restaurants or bars and she was never the kind of girl to drink a lot and let other men hit on her. I've never had the slight interest in her exes because I think that kind of stuff doesn't matter. Everyone has a past and past relationships. I always had the mindset of ""no point in having a relationship if I'll live suspecting my girlfriend might cheat on me, I have to trust her fully""

In hindsight, is it ok to assume she was very abusive? Was I too soft on her when it came to her going out?

**Point #2: My lack of presence in the weeks we were not seeing each other personally**
---

We live about 1.500km from each other. I'm not the kind of guy to be hanging on his phone the whole day, even on weekends. I like to play games on PC, do other stuff, do nothing. So sometimes, during weekends, I would go about 1-2 hours without answering her messages. Most weekends I didn't call her. I never liked calls or video calls, I always preferred messages.

Also, on weekdays, I work full time, i.e. 9-12 hours per day which translates to 10-14 hours away from home due to commute times. During the day I mostly spend less than 1 minute using my phone to answer her messages, so I basically give her statuses about my day. She does the same. She would call me before we went to sleep and we would talk for about 1+ hour almost every single day (this was very tiring for me and one of the main reasons I didn't like to call her any time)

To compensate on my lack of presence when we were away, I made her a promise that I'd fly to see her every 2 or 3 weeks. Basically, I paid about $100-$200 every two weeks to fly and see her. We live about 1.500km apart and she only studies. Since I work and have a paycheck, I'm the one with the money to pay for those trips.

On the two weeks we were away, she constantly said I didn't care about her. This happened mostly when she said she was not feeling well (mostly emotionally) about something and I answered her message asking about what happened instead of stopping my work and calling her in the middle of the day. This also happened when she achieved something and I congratulated her via message instead of calling her. In my defense here, it was never a huge issue or a huge accomplishment. When I was not seeing her I was visiting my parents since we don't live in the same city anymore.

From my point of view, the fact that I walked around a very busy city with luggage every 2 or 3 weeks and paid thousands of dollars throughout the year to see her personally could be considered enough to show I care. I do understand that I could have done more when we were away, but wasn't the rest enough? Am I wrong? Did I neglect her this bad?

**My current situation:**
---

She started studying very hard for job interviews about 3 months ago. She would solve cases via Skype with random people that were studying too. These sessions took place in the evening, mostly in the time we used to talk to each other. After about 1 or 2 weeks, she started claiming again that I didn't care about her. She told me a guy she was studying with regularly cared more, that he called her when she appeared to be feeling down. I never even knew what she was feeling since she didn't tell me and we didn't call each other anymore because she was in call with another person to study.

After that, she became increasingly distant. She says she's in a lot of doubt. For the last two or three weeks I've tried to sit down with her to talk about what she's feeling and about our relationship, but she's been evasive. Until now.

Today I confronted her (again) about the issue and she said she's in a lot of doubt about what she wants in the present. She says she's not sure she's ready for a relationship right now because she's graduating and having to focus on her professional life will take up most of her time. She also says she's not sure if she wants to get to know other people. In spite of that, she says she loves me so much and that she truly believes she wants to spend the rest of her life with me, that the break would be temporary.

To be completely honest, my once blind trust in her is corroded by all of her hypocritical behavior: how she controlled me about not going out but the few times I got mad about her going out, she didn't accept it. How she always demanded more attention, blind to how much I had already sacrificed for her, how much effort I've put in the relationship. How much she demanded that I was in the relationship for real, thinking about us in the future, and now she comes with this ""let's take a break"" stuff. I could go on and on about specific cases of explicit hypocrisy.

Every time we fight, her image as a spoiled, abusive/manipulative immature girl comes to my mind, and every time it gets harder to get rid of this image and take her for the woman I first fell in love with.

I don't know what to do. I love her too much and I know I'll be happy if I spend the rest of my life with her, but these past fights changed my view too much. I'm starting to wonder if she was very abusive and demanding while I was just a good boyfriend that just went out of my way to try to make things right with someone who doesn't deserve it.

I was thinking on the following options: 

1) If she chooses to take a break, then break up with her for good and never intend to get back together. I'm very serious about relationships and even though I understand she might be confused, I'm not into waiting undecided people push me around until they think they've made up their mind.

2) If she chooses to take a break, try to enjoy the break and see what happens

3) Break up with her if she doesn't give me an answer the next time we see each other because, as I said, I'm not into getting pushed around anymore by her. Maybe get back if she makes up her mind after that.

4) Break up with her no matter her decision. This one is here mostly because I'm not sure what I think about her right now. The fact that I'm starting to have my doubts about her current and future behavior is already a very big red flag for me concerning the relationship.

**TL;DR - Bad fight, GF might want a break to have some time to her and know other people. After analyzing girlfriend behavior throughout the year, I think she might have been abusive and wondering if I should break up or not**"

I've read that the whole department is in a complete mess currently (reddit post from ~1 yr ago) so if anyone knows if that's still going on or if they fixed the department yet, that would be great to know. I'd prefer knowing how the department is before any major decisions.

I'd also like to know how UAB's internships are for CS majors. For example, if UAB helps students reach out to large companies (or vice-versa) in order to pair students with internships. Doesn't matter if it's local or in Birmingham itself. I've read up that they do well but again I'd prefer if any current or recent students could inform me.

That's all I can think of right now but any input would be helpful! Thank you!

9wvvbg,1,2018-11-13,A friend(M/30smth) asked me(F/20) for a drink,confusedweirdo87587,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9wvvbg/a_friendm30smth_asked_mef20_for_a_drink/,"I(F/20)  met a bunch of new people 2 years ago in this hobby club. It's quite  variable in terms of ages and vocations, although it's dubbed a student  club, as a lot of the alumni tend to hang around occasionally. Along its  traditions it's normal to buy novices/friends drinks (doesn't usually carry a sexual connotation).

Among  them, I've met a handful of older guys(it's mostly guys), who seem  concerned, caring and friendly. So far all the older people have been  treating me very well, although never overstepping friendly boundaries.  One of them's explicitly stated he perceives me as a daughter. A lot of the others are either married(and have kids) or have been in a relationship for a couple of years, so it feels like a pretty safe, non-sexual space. 

In April I was asking one of them(M/30something) about what are the required skills to get an internship in the field he works. He gave me some pointers and left it at that. A couple of months later he asked  whether I had gotten an internship, and I hadn't. He offered me an  intern position in a company he was moving to, had me apply with a cover  letter and a CV. I was supposed to have an interview that never  happened after it got postponed a couple of times. It felt like the  position was sorta made up, as once he mentioned ""I'll have to find you a  place to sit"". The company seemed to be in turmoil, so no regrets on  not getting that internship. As he pointed out later ""it might have been  a stain on my CV"".

He's  seen me once hurry after a club meeting, asked me whether I'm in  trouble to be in such a hurry. I wasn't (late for a date), so I said no,  and went away.

In  the summer he had me look for a house broker on the seaside and  mentioned he had a work trip to the country I live in. I offered a  broker, and didn't go to meet him as the place he was visiting was far  from where I live.

When I got back, there  was a club social.  He bought me a drink. We had a banter about what  exactly he got me. I mentioned I had trouble with uni administration. I  told him about giving up on the girl I had told him about liking a few  months ago, and having fallen for a guy (""As any straight guy would say  you're finally going in the right direction"") At the end of the social,  he kinda waited for me to know which way I'm going, walked with me,  offered me a jacket, as I was shivering a little, told me about a place  he lived a while ago(close to where I currently lived). Asked me where I  was going (because we passed the place I told him I lived) and how I  was getting there, checked if I got there.

Ever  since then, he's been asking me what's up with uni, as I've been  skipping club meetings. He even asked if I had stopped going to the club  entirely, as I hadn't been there in a few weeks, sounding almost upset.

My  uni situation was resolved, as I informed him in detail. He hasn't been  to the club in 2 weeks. Yesterday evening(when the club usually meets)  he didn't show up, but requested to meet up for drinks.

My  dilemma is this: so far, he's been acting very much like a father. He has a wife and a young son he loves telling me about. He's warned me against advances at another married person(it was a genuine  misunderstanding about smth I said to that person, that got quickly rectified).

However, it's really odd that he'd set up a meeting outside the club. He has been having some physical trouble, and he may have grudges against some club members/decision but that has never before stopped him from going.  
I gave him all the details on my current uni situation, so that's sorted. I don't know why he's asking me to drinks.

What do you make of this? Should I be worried or am I reading too much into it?  
(My assumption is he just cannot meet me at club times, but that request sounded urgent)"

He's got Nog, he's got interns, Bajorans 

Proud to work for him

They fear serving him, ordered to serve him 
They're just lousy with leaving please ... from Bashir, Prince Bashir!)

Prince Bashir!

Tries to seduce! It causes a stir...

Heard your Trill just was a sight lovely to see

And that, good people, is why he quit his tasks and then dropped by

9wwwpm,3,2018-11-13,I feel like a mess,collegerejectee,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/9wwwpm/i_feel_like_a_mess/,"My college career has been quite a mess ever since it started. I have switched majors a couple of times unsure of what to study and even switched academic institutions. I am currently studying computer science but, because most of the universities don’t have a decent program, I find myself studying in an international program where I can get an Associates in Arts degree from a college in Florida, American teachers and all (not online) without leaving my country, in hopes that with that degree, I could transfer to an American university to finish my CS degree. I transferred over a bunch of credits from my previous university so the two year college should have only taken one, but due to some complications here and there I ended up staying for an extra semester.

At the end of the month I am graduating from the college and I would have to transfer to an actual university now. Last semester I had applied to the University of Florida where one of my friends is studying but due to some problems with the fact that we use two last names in Latin America (the transcripts from my local university listed both while the Florida College only listed one so they were assigned to different profiles) and due to some miscommunication with the college I ended up staying an extra semester at the college and my application to UF was moved for Spring 2019 with the paperwork corrected.

My dad wanted me to apply to more than one college for Spring, in case I didn’t get into UF despite the partnership it has with my college, but I don’t know why I couldn’t bring myself to do it. It’s not like I forgot or that I didn’t want to, there was just something deep inside me stopping me from doing so and as time went on the deadline passed and I hadn’t applied to any schools other than the UF application that rolled over from last semester. I didn’t worry to much at the beginning because from my understanding, I had guaranteed admission to UF from the partnership it has with my college. But months passed and I had no news, called plenty of times but was told I just had to wait. My parents started pressuring me about it, they thought I had been rejected and didn’t want to tell them, and I slowly began to stress about it. 

Now around a month ago, my grandfather who had been sick for a couple months now, entered his final stage of cancer. The doctors didn’t give him till the end of the year, and he was now stuck at his house in a hospital bed. When this happened my day to day was reduced to going to class in the morning, the office in the afternoon and once I left work at 7, I would go to my grandpa’s house to see how he was doing and to support my dad who was having a rough time.

With a schedule like this, the only thing I had to look forward to was playing golf on the weekends preparing for the end of the year national tournament, before heading to gramps’ in the afternoon. I had one this tournament for the last two years, each tine going down a handicap division so this year I was aiming to conquer another division. It was the only thing that could take my mind off of college and my grandfather’s health.

Two weeks ago my grandfather’s condition got even worse. He could no longer process solid food; his vitals were so low they had disconnected the machines that keep track of them saying it would only depress us more seeing them slowly go down. Last week he entered a coma. Every single day for 5 days in a row I was told he was going to die in a couple of hours. We stayed by his side for hours in end only for him to stabilize once again, I would get home around midnight, finishing up essays for class, going to sleep at three in the morning only to get called at four saying he wasn’t getting enough oxygen and that he wouldn’t last for longer than two hours, only for him to stabilize one again. It was on the fifth of these days, the one were he had looked the best, not even an hour after we had left his side when he passed away.

A couple days have passed now and things started to look better. We had known of my grandfather’s condition for a long time so his death wasn’t as much of a hit, it was mostly relief that he no longer had to suffer. I had gotten ahold of the advisor in charge of reviewing my application and got to fix the problem that was keeping my application from being processed which meant I would get a reply soon enough. The stress of not getting a reply from the university started to lift off and the tournament I was looking forward to was just around the corner.

I left the office early today, I wanted to go to the driving range to get rid of some of the rust as I had missed the last two weeks of practice to be with my family. I was an hour into my practice when I got an email with the final team for the tournament and my name was not on it. I never considered not being called to the team; for the last two years I had been undefeated in all my matches and helped my club take two titles, I had ranked the best out of anyone in the last tournament we played a month ago, but for whatever reason, I was not called to play. There was nothing that could be done as the teams had officially been submitted. The only thing that had kept me going for the last couple months, taken away from me in but a second.

I went home took a shower and jumped into my pc, I had another unread email. It was from the advisor in charge if reviewing my application, I thought maybe he needed me to provide additional info like when he had asked for the list if courses I was currently taken. But when I opened the email the first line read “Hey, I just rejected your application, it should show up in your status page shortly”.

My heart sank and I started having a panic attack. I was rejected by the university I was supposed to be guaranteed into; the only thing that motivated me was taken away, mix that with the recent lack of sleep and the fact that my internship and my college were done at the end of the month and I was completely disoriented. I ended up curled up into a ball in a corner of my bathroom for the last two hours. When I left I had received a text from my friend at UF telling me to hurry up with the application because he needed to rent an apartment for the new semester and we were supposed to room together. That was a couple hours ago and I haven’t replied yet, I can’t bring myself to. 

I don’t even know how I’m going to tell my parents about this. I can’t imagine the disappointment they will feel. My sister despite being only three years older than me is graduating with her Masters from a top 10 university at the end of the year, just like she graduated friom her undergrad from another top 10 school. The friends I went to high school and started college with are graduating next semester as well. But me? Back to square one. I just feel lost, without motivation and without an end goal.

 I just needed this to be out there, I would usually talk with my college’s psychologist but I am swamped at the office and until the month ends it is the only concrete thing I have so I at least have to try my best at that. Sorry for long post or if I didn’t make much sense, english is not my first language."
9wxwqt,1,2018-11-14,Having concerns about getting the first internship as a junior,nonusedname,supplychain,https://www.reddit.com/r/supplychain/comments/9wxwqt/having_concerns_about_getting_the_first/,"I am a Junior majoring in Industrial Engineering. I have transferred twice, and because of that I had no experience in real workplace. I had to spend my summers taking classes to transfer as soon as possible. I could have tried getting a job in the past summers with different plans but I was unaware of the importance of internship experiences. As of now, I achieved my academic goal and started taking a few major classes, but I have no related working experience.

For the Spring 2019, I am trying to get an internship or co-op in supply chain (possibly any jobs related to IE) and it doesn’t seem going well. It is more likely that I will be taking major classes such as Quality Improvement, Optimization, Regression, and Simulation. I will have to apply more companies in spring as I’ll be having more stuffs to talk about with companies by that time. 

Since I do not have any professional experiences, I was thinking to get some certificates; CPIM, MOS Master, etc. 


Where can I get experiences? What should I do? I would love to have experience in a company but the company wants experience for being not experienced. 


Looking forward to hearing some advice for this poorly experienced IE student.

9wyido,1,2018-11-14,I’ve been seeing this girl for a over a month and half. The way how things are now I feel very lost. What should I do?,italiansspeaksoftly,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9wyido/ive_been_seeing_this_girl_for_a_over_a_month_and/,"Let me tell you a bit about myself. I am a 26 year old dude and have never been in any sort of serious relationship before. All of my past relationships were based purely on physical attraction (merely sexual partners). As much as I wanted to have a meaningful relationship with someone, I just couldn’t find anyone who I felt comfortable enough to even dare to connect with. Every time I slept with someone, while it felt good at the moment, it felt like I was only feeding my need for a deep connection with meaningless sex; felt like a I was burning my insides for fun. 

Over a month and a half ago I met this girl at a bar/club. We ran into each other three times at the same place  before going out on a date. The third time when I bumped into her (outside of the bar), that night we decided to go for a walk together and chat for a bit. The more we talked that night, the more I realised that she is somewhat different from the other girls I had come across before. We made a connection. We kissed that night and it felt like the best kiss ever (even though we had already made out once in the club the week before), at that point I decided: I am going to give it shot. 

A little background on her. She is from overseas doing her internship here till end of December and then going away to check out the rest of the  country. She works full time and goes out clubbing or partying a lot. She has been in two relationships where the guy cheated on her. Her last relationship was like that. She got out of that relationship around the beginning of this year. She is very soft spoken and generally very comfortable with herself, which is something I like about her.  Another reason which draws me to her is since she lost one of her immediate family members, just like myself, I figured she would be able to understand me better than most people I have come across.

Now enter our relationship. The dates were amazing. Even after 4 dates, although we hadn’t had sex (only makeouts), it felt a hundred times better to be just able to talk, connect and be comfortable in her presence and even do love-dovey stuff like holding hands and hugs (I almost never do that). First time ever feeling like this and sex wasn’t even the top 5 things on my on my list with her!  I know she is going to leave soon and this is just like a dream I am going to have to wake up from eventually. I figured even if/when it came to that I’d be alright knowing I get to go on this journey with someone who I think is special and kind. What I wanted was to experience these new feelings, learn things about myself, learn about what it takes to connect with someone and to be able to do things I enjoy with her. Enjoy our limited time together and leave each other in a place better than how we both were. 

My feelings for her grew when she told me during one of our conversations, “you already stole my heart when you kissed me in the rain”. At that point I began to think she genuinely likes me a lot, specially given how her past relationships were, she would have to be very brave to say that. After that I decided I would talk about how I truly feel towards her and where I see this going on our 5th date. It seemed to go great at the time! But then after that date things changed. It felt like I was the one carrying the conversations, her replies became dry and short and she began taking her sweet time to reply. I suggested we could meet up and chill after her work but she bailed on me to go clubbing with her friends. 

An entire week went by and she still didn’t say at any point that she wanted to see me. I grew frustrated because it felt like she was ghosting, specially after I had told her how I felt. I wanted to meet up with her again but then she told me she was out clubbing with her friends (third time in the same week to the same club). After that I just got fed up and told her that she isn’t right for me, and that we are not on the same page, and that we should stop seeing each other. But she said she still wanted to keep seeing. She admitted that she must’ve “subconsciously” began to put some distance between us but insisted that she still wants to keep seeing me. 

Our conversations are just via text messages now replies are short and far apart. We barely talk now. I expected her to take more initiatives, but nothing improved. Initially, I tried to make the conversations but saw no effort from her side, and eventually gave up on it. From good morning and good night messages every day to exchanging  few messages once or twice a week now. I hate the way how it turned out to be;  no closure. Maybe i tried to rush it and put her under pressure by telling her how I feel; I should’ve taken it slower. However, I still feel like I deserve some explanation from her. We weren’t even close to a long relationship but we spent enough quality together and shared a lot about each other, invested fair bit of time and effort to make me feel like that I deserve to know her truth, so that I can find some closure. 

I feel like calling her to ask her to meet up so that we can have a chat...or should I just leave it as it is and just let it fade away. 

Tell me what I am doing wrong and what should do about this. 

Thanks a lot for reading the whole thing.

9wyoem,1,2018-11-14,Four Things To Do After You Receive Your Acceptance Letter,Calcuttaschool2-9,u_Calcuttaschool2-9,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Calcuttaschool2-9/comments/9wyoem/four_things_to_do_after_you_receive_your/," 

Are you looking to improve your business knowledge? Perhaps you want increased flexibility in your career? Or are you simply looking to receive a fatter paycheck? There are a million different advantages of earning a degree from top [**PGDM colleges in India.** ](https://calcuttabusinessschool.org/pgdm-overview)

However, getting a PGDM degree is not the only thing that counts. How you spend the next two years of your life as a PGDM student is what will determine how your career will unfold in the future. Here are four things you can do during your PGDM programme that will set you up for success down the road: 

**1. Get Uncomfortable** 

There may be various things and subjects that you are afraid of doing or studying because you have never done them before. However, to survive in the dynamic world of business it’s important that you possess an array of skills that you can draw upon as and when required. 

For instance, if you opted to study marketing in your undergraduate degree, choose to study finance in your PGDM. This will ensure that you are well versed with two different aspects of a business, thus increasing your overall demand in the market. 

**2. The Big Events**

Conferences, workshops, guest lectures, college fests - all of these events are essential if you want to build a strong network. It may feel extremely uncomfortable and awkward at first but networking is the key to success in the business landscape. Your network is your long-term mutually profitable relationship. Putting in the effort to grow your network can only be profitable for your future. 

3. **Study Groups**

Study groups are notorious to be a major waste of time. However, a study group can teach you how to work with and lead a team of diverse people with different personalities, beliefs, and work ethics. Leadership is crucial if you want to find success in the world of business, therefore, taking the time to improve your leadership skills during your PGDM programme is never a bad idea. 

4. **The Perfect Mentor** 

Mentors can play a huge role in your success as a management graduate. Don’t hesitate to reach out to alumni who are working in your area of interest or even professors in your business school. They can help you find internships and even jobs. Furthermore, a mentor is someone who can help you navigate difficult subjects like salary negotiations, career setbacks and more. 

Two years of studying in [**PGDM Colleges in Kolkata** ](https://www.calcuttabusinessschool.org/)or other cities will be an experience you will never forget. Along with the classes, events, and festivities; it is also important that you take the necessary steps to add to your experience. Ultimately, taking extra steps now will only make reaching your career goals easier later. "

&amp;nbsp;    
Kent u het bericht ‘Inspecties uiten kritiek op begeleiders van pleegouders baby Hannah’? 1&amp;#41;  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 1:  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ja  
&amp;nbsp;    
   
&amp;nbsp;    
2  
&amp;nbsp;    
Hoe kan het dat uit de rapportages blijkt dat er gedurende de opvangperiode en daarna veel fout is gegaan, maar er niet is ingegrepen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 2:  
&amp;nbsp;    
Voorop staat dat kinderen goede zorg ondersteuning en bescherming verdienen. Daarbij is het van belang dat alle betrokken instanties het belang van het kind voorop stellen. Zo hebben we dat ook beschreven in het actieprogramma Zorg voor de Jeugd. Dit kan echter zeer complex zijn, aangezien betrokken instanties constant afwegingen moeten maken tussen het belang de veiligheid te verzekeren en hechting tussen het kind en zijn pleegouders te bevorderen. Dat zijn complexe afwegingen waarbij &amp;#40;pleeg&amp;#41;ouders en betrokken instellingen zo goed mogelijk betrokken moeten worden. Als hier fouten in worden gemaakt is het van belang dat deze fouten goed worden onderzocht en dat de betrokken partijen hier lessen uit trekken om herhaling in de toekomst te voorkomen.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Jeugdbescherming Brabant &amp;#40;JBB&amp;#41; en Combinatie Jeugdzorg &amp;#40;CJZ&amp;#41; hebben de calamiteit bij de Inspectie Gezondheidszorg en Jeugd en de Inspectie Justitie en Veiligheid &amp;#40;hierna inspecties&amp;#41; gemeld en hebben, ook op verzoek van de inspecties, een intern onderzoek naar de zaak uitgevoerd. Uit dit onderzoek komen verbetermaatregelen voor de betrokken instanties naar voren. De betrokken instanties erkennen dat er fouten zijn gemaakt in deze zaak.  Een van de leerpunten is dat in complexe casuïstiek meer aandacht moet worden besteed aan overleg met direct betrokkenen &amp;#40;pleegouders, Raad voor de Kinderbescherming , politie&amp;#41;.  
&amp;nbsp;    
De  inspecties stellen eisen en toetsen de kwaliteit van het onderzoek &amp;#40;zijn de juiste vragen gesteld, is er gesproken met de betrokkenen, trekt men de juiste conclusies, etc.&amp;#41;. De inspecties zijn van mening dat de kwaliteit van het onderzoek aan de verwachtingen heeft voldaan  en dat CJZ en JBB de juiste verbetermaatregelen aan de conclusies van de inspecties hebben verbonden. De inspecties verwachten van CJZ en JBB dat zij in het eerste kwartaal van 2019 een gezamenlijke audit laten uitvoeren naar de implementatie van de verbetermaatregelen en de inspecties informeren over de uitkomst.   
&amp;nbsp;    
3  
&amp;nbsp;    
Zijn er volgens u meer tekortkomingen geweest door de betreffende jeugdzorginstanties?  
&amp;nbsp;    
4  
&amp;nbsp;    
Bent u bekend met het zwartboek over Jeugdbescherming Brabant?2&amp;#41; Wat vindt u van de reactie van de Inspectie Gezondheidszorg en Jeugd dat de klachten niet afwijken? Betekent dit dat de genoemde problemen zich ook binnen andere gecertificeerde instellingen voordoen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 3, 4:  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ik ben bekend met het zwartboek. Ik vind het van belang dat bij elke melding de betrokkenen met elkaar in gesprek gaan, zodat alle kanten van het verhaal kunnen worden belicht en men samen kan achterhalen wat er is gebeurd en hoe men in de toekomst beter kan handelen. Ik heb van JBB begrepen dat zij de bij het zwartboek betrokken ouders &amp;#40;opnieuw&amp;#41; uitnodigen om daarover in gesprek te gaan &amp;#40;zie ook verderop mijn antwoord op vraag 5&amp;#41;.  
&amp;nbsp;    
De Inspectie Gezondheidszorg en Jeugd &amp;#40;IGJ&amp;#41; heeft aangegeven dat de hoeveelheid meldingen/klachten per jaar bij JBB bij de inspectie geen uitzonderlijk beeld geeft in vergelijking met andere Gecertificeerde Instellingen &amp;#40;GI’s&amp;#41;. Dit betekent niet dat alle GI’s met dezelfde soort klachten en meldingen te maken hebben en dat de tekortkomingen uit deze zaak zich ook bij andere GI’s voordoen. Klachten kunnen over een veelheid aan onderwerpen en gedragingen gaan &amp;#40;bijvoorbeeld de beslissing van een instantie, de bejegening door een medewerker, informatievoorziening, etc.&amp;#41;. Elke klacht heeft daarom zijn eigen verhaal en achtergrond.  
&amp;nbsp;    
De IGJ weegt het aantal en de aard van signalen mee bij het bepalen van de instellingen waar toezicht wordt uitgevoerd. Ten aanzien van het toezicht bij de GI’s speelt daarbij mee dat het beleid is om in het toezicht te steunen op het werk van het Keurmerkinstituut dat zorgt voor verstrekking van het certificaat. Dit betekent dat de inspecties in aanvulling daarop en als daar aanleiding toe is thematisch onderzoek uitvoeren bij GI’s. De inspectie heeft dit jaar, doorlopend naar het volgend jaar, een toezicht gepland dat gericht is op alle GI’s. Uiteraard wordt JBB hier ook in meegenomen. De uitkomsten van dit toezicht worden openbaar gemaakt en betrokken bij de prioritering van het verdere toezicht. De wethouders van de jeugdregio’s in West-Brabant kunnen de uitkomsten gebruiken om hun bestuurlijke en uitvoerende verantwoordelijkheid te nemen.   
&amp;nbsp;    
   
&amp;nbsp;    
5  
&amp;nbsp;    
Wat is uw mening over de reacties van betrokken instellingen die aangaven zich niet te herkennen in de uitingen in het zwartboek? Klopt het dat zij op dat moment al op de hoogte waren van het oordeel van de interne onderzoekscommissie en de Inspecties, waarin deze zorgen van pleegouders zijn bevestigd?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 5:  
&amp;nbsp;    
De betrokken instanties gaven in eerste instantie aan zich niet te herkennen in het geschetste beeld van het zwartboek. Het begeleidend schrijven zou een te eenzijdige benadering hebben gegeven van het functioneren van de betrokken instellingen.   
&amp;nbsp;    
JBB heeft de verantwoordelijke wethouders over het zwartboek geïnformeerd, waarbij ze aangeven de betrokken ouders &amp;#40;opnieuw&amp;#41; uit te zullen nodigen om in gesprek te gaan. JBB kan &amp;#40;uiteraard&amp;#41; niet in het openbaar reageren op casuïstiek beschreven in het zwartboek, omwille van privacy. Ik vind het dan ook goed dat JBB met de ouders in gesprek gaat, zodat ze samen de zaak kunnen bespreken.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Het interne onderzoek dat door JBB en CJZ is ingesteld heeft betrekking op de specifieke casus van baby Hannah en niet op het zwartboek.   
&amp;nbsp;    
6  
&amp;nbsp;    
Waar kunnen pleegouders terecht als er fouten worden gemaakt in de begeleiding? Wat gebeurt er met een dergelijke klacht?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 6:  
&amp;nbsp;    
Zowel pleegzorgaanbieders als gecertificeerde instellingen zijn wettelijk verplicht om een klachtenregeling vast te stellen. Pleegouders kunnen een klacht indienen, zowel tegen de instelling zelf als tegen een persoon die hier werkt. Deze klacht wordt vervolgens beoordeeld door een onafhankelijke klachtencommissie. De klachtencommissie informeert de pleegouders en de persoon op wie de klacht betrekking heeft over de beoordeling en over wat er aan de klacht gedaan kan worden. Pleegouders krijgen in dit proces ook de mogelijkheid om hun klacht mondeling toe te lichten.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Daarnaast kunnen pleegouders en pleegkinderen zich wenden tot het Advies- en Klachtenbureau Jeugdzorg &amp;#40;AKJ&amp;#41;. Wanneer pleegouders of pleegkinderen klachten hebben over de pleegzorgbegeleiding kunnen ze via het AKJ advies vragen bij een onafhankelijke vertrouwenspersoon.   
&amp;nbsp;    
7  
Zijn er bij u meer signalen bekend over pleegouders die onvoldoende worden begeleid? Is dit een incident?  
   
&amp;nbsp;    
8  
&amp;nbsp;    
Bent u bereid gedegen onderzoek te doen naar de begeleiding en de positie van pleegouders?  
&amp;nbsp;    
   
&amp;nbsp;    
9  
&amp;nbsp;    
Gaat u extra actie nemen om dit in de toekomst te voorkomen? Zo nee, waarom niet? Zo ja, wat gaat u doen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 7, 8, 9:  
&amp;nbsp;    
In het actieplan pleegzorg is nadrukkelijk aandacht voor het verbeteren van de positie en de begeleiding van pleegouders. Alle betrokken partijen werken binnen het actieplan samen om de begeleiding van pleegouders te verbeteren en de positie van pleegouders in het hulpverleningsproces te verstevigen. Om de positie van pleegouders te verstevigen worden er binnen het actieplan pleegzorg verschillende acties uitgevoerd.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Momenteel wordt, in opdracht van VWS en JenV, een evaluatie van de Wet verbetering positie pleegouders &amp;#40;welke grotendeels is overgenomen in de Jeugdwet&amp;#41; uitgevoerd. Het doel van deze evaluatie is om na te gaan of maatregelen ter verbetering van de positie van pleegouders, zoals een verplichte pleegouderraad, medezeggenschap, informatierecht, etc., hebben bijgedragen aan het verbeteren van de positie van pleegouders binnen het hulpverleningstraject. De evaluatie zal ingaan op de vraag hoe tevreden/ontevreden pleegouders zijn over de positie die zij innemen en hoe eventuele verbetermaatregelen doorgevoerd kunnen worden. De verwachting is dat de Kamer begin 2019 over de resultaten zal worden geïnformeerd.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Daarnaast werkt Jeugdzorg Nederland samen met de Nederlandse Vereniging voor Pleeggezinnen &amp;#40;NVP&amp;#41; en de VNG in het project “versterken van de kracht van pleegouders” aan het ontwikkelen, verbeteren en verbreden van het leer- en ontwikkelaanbod voor pleegouders. Ook heeft de NVP een onafhankelijk informatie- en belangenbehartigingspunt voor pleegouders en pleegkinderen ingericht. Pleegouders en pleegkinderen kunnen hier informatie, advies en ondersteuning krijgen rond hun positie.

The next session is exit counseling and I’ll be done. I think I was doing it for 8 weeks maybe? Can’t remember lol. It was great. Got new coping mechanisms, I’m not cured but I’m doing better. My internship started this and we discussed it ad-nauseam. Found out it was a culmination of a few things, but that I really just hated my internship and I let my anxiety be the scapegoat. 

Summer 2019, I get my next opportunity to do an internship (classes full load in spring). So we shall see. "

I know this doesn't matter AT ALL but I am 29 and I've had sex with 18 girls. Just setting the stage that's all.

Anyways this girl at my work we've been office friends for a while and I actually hooked up with her intern friend over the summer. Anyways all the sudden there was just this tension between us sexually.

Almost every day I feel like it got worse and worse or better and better depending on how you look at it.

Now we are just blatantly saying we wanna fuck each other and it's hot. Now shes so horny she is basically throwing herself at me which is fine by me.

 I just feel like there is pressure to perform and for the first time in a long time ima lil nervous about sex.

Not real sure how to combat that. Usually to make sure they are satisfied I'll go down on them for as long as they can handle but she mentioned she doesn't like that. So idk.

9x0p35,1,2018-11-14,The Same Liberal Media Defending Jim Acosta BLOCKED Breitbart and Gateway Pundit From Obtaining Senate Gallery Press Pass,peterboykin,TheRightPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRightPill/comments/9x0p35/the_same_liberal_media_defending_jim_acosta/,"Last Wednesday CNN’s Jim Acosta once again took over the White House press briefing, started screaming at the President of the United States, refused to sit down, refused to turn over the microphone, hurled insults at the US President and took a swipe at a young female intern.

In response to this latest outburst Acosta’s hard press pass was revoked.

### The liberal mainstream media then uniformly defended Acosta’s right to harass and abuse the US president and hijack a press conference.

The media even invented [a COMPLETE LIE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RrSfMiAErc) that the White House “doctored” a video of Acosta taking a swipe at the female intern.

**This is modern liberal journalism in the United States.**

### ** These same liberal reporters actually BLOCKED The Gateway Pundit and Breitbart.com from accessing a Senate Press Gallery pass in 2017.

As TGP previously reported, on Monday, June 12th 2017, The Gateway Pundit’s founder and EIC **Jim Hoft** along with D.C. Correspondent **Lucian Wintrich** and Media and Ethics Lawyer, **Charles Glasser**, counsel to Gateway Pundit, met before the Senate Press Gallery Executive Committee.

**The Senate Press Gallery Executive Committee is a group made up entirely of liberal journalists and pseudo-journalists.**

We argued the implications and the necessity for alternative voices in the room – voices that aren’t financed by special interests – but voices that are a specific and genuine reflection of the voices of America and every day Americans.

**The Gateway Pundit was one of the largest and most vocal pro-Trump websites before the November election.**

We later received a call from a liberal reporter that we did not win our appeal.The committee’s decision was leaked to the far left Daily Beast — They didn’t even contact us.

**We went into the hearing with good faith and with the expectation that we would be treated fairly and that the committee would listen to our arguments.**

But we were told by Lloyd Grove at _The Daily Beas_t that the committee rejected our appeal the minute we left the room.

They accused us not reporting enough original content. Have they even read their own websites?

**Our readers would take offense to that.**
   
 The Gateway Pundit has over 20 million page views a month.
   
 Has over 19 million unique visits.
   
 The Gateway Pundit is listed in the top 10 of most commented websites.
   
 The Gateway Pundit breaks national stories that are regularly cited by The Drudge Report and FOX News.
   
**The committee’s arguments just don’t hold water.**

### And yet NOT ONE media outlet came to our defense or to the defense of Breitbart.com — the largest and most influential conservative website next to The Drudge Report.

**Now these same people are defending jackass Jim Acosta.**

So I'm currently a full time student with two part time jobs, one with my abuser. BUT NOT FOR LONG!!! I'm finally about to get out. I just had a phone interview for an internship that it beyond perfect for me, and that will hopefully lead to full time employment. I don't want to give out too much identifying info, but it's a small company in my field of study, and passion, with the most wholesome sounding work environment. I'm nearly biting my nails just waiting to hear back from them. They said that if they bring me on, it'll be within like two months!! Even if I don't get the internship, I'm going to quit working for my dad. I'm going to try to make a sort of script so I don't falter in front of him. I know he'll yell. I know it doesn't matter. I can feel myself becoming stronger, despite him. Next semester is my last, I'm graduating a whole year early and I'm so thankful for that. I couldn't have lasted another year. I'm almost free!!!"

&amp;#x200B;

I purchased a Razer Blade 15 late august this year and I've been enjoying it as much as possible. But, now my battery is 99% full (and not charging, this is what windows says) and when i unplug my AC adapter it just shuts off immidiatly, which as you can understand is a big problem. I'm an intern at a company and I need my stuff to work since I'm not only an intern I also have exams starting next year. So I really can't send away my laptop for 2 weeks or more. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also my internal microphone stopped working a while ago, but I care less about this issue since I can finish my school/internship without it and fix it after that. But the battery issue is the worse. 

Hopefully someone can help!"

I love learning about new algorithms and about how languages work. It's something I do every day because learning new things and increasing my skills gives me a lot of satisfaction.

I'm still in university and haven't started looking for a real job yet, but back when I was a freshman/sophomore and was on that internship grind, the competitiveness was insane. There was palpable tension between everyone I knew who was in CS and was trying to get in at Google, Amazon, etc. I'm not a competitive person and feeling like I had to flex and sell myself to outdo other people made me very uncomfortable and was terrible for my mental health. I made it pretty far into a couple different interview processes, but I never got an internship.

I'm graduating next year, and I am genuinely terrified of going through that again. I worry that I will be unable to find success because I just cannot perform at a high level when I am doing it for the purpose of appearing more capable than others.

Recently I've made the decision that, since I'm not competitive, all I will be able to do is present myself for who I am and what I know, and then let the cards fall where they may. Since coming to this conclusion I've been more productive than ever before and have been in a really good place when it comes to mental health. I've progressed more in the past year than in the first 3 years of university combined, but in the back of my mind I'm still worried. I'm worried that my attitude will make me less employable than others because it puts me at a disadvantage when it comes to performing in a corporate environment.

Has anyone with a similar mindset been able to make it? If so, how did you do it? Are you happy?"

While I love the work we're doing, I've been struggling lately. My current contract was ""put on pause,"" after I'd received an official offer and copy of the contract to look over prior to signing. It was frustrating and really hurt. Anyway, a new stipulation was added to the contract stating an extension has to be decided by 11/21, which is next week. Since coming back after my week off the office feels weird. I'm half on one team and half on another (if that makes sense), but my previous team seems like I no longer fit in. It feels like I don't fit in anywhere here anymore. I'm quiet as is, it takes me a minute to feel comfortable with people.

&amp;#x200B;

Today it feels like I've done everything wrong and it's really stressing me out as I'm worried this is going to be counted against me. I also don't really know what happens next.. It's hard to find other work when I'm in this limbo place. I have four jobs, which total about 50 hours a week, but it's only Monday through Friday. One job ends next week, which I've known since the beginning (it's seasonal) and find out my fate, per se, at this gig.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm starting to feel like I'll never fit in here even though there are times where it feels like home. I'm frustrated and want to cry. Went from fine to like -45 on my -50/50 range of emotions. I just want to have some stability in my work.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT// It's been exhausting living in  somewhat chaotic financial situation. It's been giving me huge swings all summer."

&gt; CNN filed suit against the White House on Tuesday seeking the return of correspondent Jim Acosta&amp;#039;s press credentials, which were revoked last week after a testy exchange with during a press conference.

&gt; &amp;quot;FOX News supports CNN in its legal effort to regain its White House reporter&amp;#039;s press credential. We intend to file an amicus brief with the U.S. District Court. Secret Service passes for working White House journalists should never be weaponized,&amp;quot; Wallace said.

&gt; ADVERTISEMENT.NBC News, The Associated Press, Bloomberg, Gannett, The New York Times, Politico, USA Today, The Washington Post and other outlets also plan to file briefs supporting CNN&amp;#039;s lawsuit, according to a release from Ballard Spahr LLP, a law firm representing the outlets.

&gt; &amp;quot;Whether the news of the day concerns national security, the economy, or the environment, reporters covering the White House must remain free to ask questions,&amp;quot; the news outlets said in a joint statement released by the firm.

&gt; The White House dismissed CNN&amp;#039;s lawsuit on Tuesday, accusing the network of &amp;quot;Grandstanding.&amp;quot; White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that Acosta &amp;quot;Is no more or less special than any other media outlet or reporter with respect to the First Amendment.""

&gt; The White House has argued that it was justified in suspending Acosta&amp;#039;s hard pass after he did not allow a White House intern to take the microphone from him during a press conference when Trump cut him off after he asked several questions about the migrant caravan and federal Russia probe.

I'm senior eletronics eng student looking for a carrer on aerospace. Since I'm brazilian I have work restrictions(ITAR, etc) around the world. There aren't many opportunities here in Brazil, because of that, I have plans to do a masters abroad (CS, Computer Eng or Electrical)  find a job and switch to aerospace position after a proper visa.( I thought about doing MS in aerospace but I don't want to stay in academia and this subreddit made it clear how difficult is to find an internship as an internacional)

In my city, there are a lot of CS jobs. Today I'm working with Data Science. I've tried something related to embedded but none of the jobs paid enough to afford a minimal/decent life (I don't live with my parents).


About Embraer:

They are the most related company to AE. I've applied to the intership program and pass through the hiring process. But the jobs (verification and intrumentation) did not fit my profile (SW, Embedded or control). They said that they really liked me and the HR would allocate me to other positions. 
Today I received an offer to general SW Eng position for the support team. Tasks are to help them to integrate the CRM with other data, create graphs and other stuff to take better decisions, or to act beforehand.

Finally the question: 

Is it worth to accept that just due to the name Embraer in my resume?

I have to commit to another city (500 miles) that is far away from my family, friends and 7-y GF.
I rejected the previous offers but this last one is ok for me. I mean, it isn't what I want but I'm used to do the activities. However, if it is to keep the same type of job I could stay where I am, right?

They, said also that once I'm there I could change to other positions. But idk how feasible this is.

What you AE guys think?"

The story and the events are based on real life, while the conversations and personal details have been suitably modified for a better flow and in the interest of anonymity. 
---------------

I used to work at a big finance firm a few years back. Our company hired many junior undergrads as summer interns who were invited to work on certain projects for a few weeks. Based on their performance and abilities, they would be later extended a full time position (or not). One of the things I used to love about this program was the eagerness and enthusiasm of those young undergrads to please their superiors. I have always had a dominant streak in me, be it inside the bedroom or otherwise. Setting up rules for someone to achieve their goals, training them with the discipline they need to develop in themselves, pushing them out of their comfort zone, are some of the things I have found that I enjoy that naturally come to me. Being a mentor for a small team of these summer interns would mean taking the responsibility to guide them through their project, and cultivating these skills in them. Besides, their willingness to learn was the cherry on the cake. 

This one particular year I was supposed to handle a team of 5 interns. 3 young men and 2 young women : David, Tyler, John, Diane and Susan. They were intelligent, smart, and ambitious young students who wanted to make their mark. It was obvious from their interactions with me as well as with each other that these weren't your typical spoilt and entitled college kids, but people who were willing to work hard and put in the effort to achieve what they wanted. 

I must admit, even though I was always professional with them in our meetings and discussions, there was a great deal which I could've never openly admitted to any of my colleagues lest it was interpreted in a way that could damage my reputation. However logical the human brain might be in its rational moments, the primal part of it can't help but feel the emotions that naturally arise. Looking at Susan you would say it was no surprise that I fell for her charms and feminine beauty. A petite brunette, naturally beautiful breasts, a rather supple derriere, she was the object of desire for every male set of eyes on the floor and the object of envy for every female. Smart and sweet. Giggly and friendly. She was a breath of fresh air for anyone she came to interact with. The geeky glasses she used to wear and the way her eyes turned wide when she was confused when I talked about some intricate concept in detail were only some of the little things that added to her delightful presence. 

The interns went back to their hometowns to finish their senior year in college at the end of summers. David, Diane and Susan had made the cut. They received their full time position offers a few weeks after the internship ended, and all three of them had accepted it. That evening Susan texted me saying how excited she was to get the position and thanked me for the mentorship and how it wouldn't have been possible to get there without me. This was the first time that we talked after the internship was over. I replied her back saying all that she achieved was due to her own effort, my role in it was minimal. We texted back and forth for a while that night, before she had to go back to her assignments and we said our goodnights. 

Over the next few months, the frequency of texts from Susan increased. Initially it used to be about logistical issues, questions pertaining to the position of new hires in the company, or something related to moving to the new city etc. Over time, it gradually proceeded to more personal happenings from her life, like how she was having a bad day or if the new assignment was giving her a tough time or how Kelly was being a mean bitch to her. Conversations with her were always interesting. She was a curious young mind who wanted to know and experience as much as she could about the world. At the same time, she was still the naive and innocent young one, who was still in the phase of that delightfully carefree adolescence when you had very few responsibilities which burdens so many adults from being fun. We texted about inconsequential things, yet nothing sexual so far. It was my self imposed policy to never initiate a relationship of that nature with anyone in my workplace. 

The year passed and the fresh hires were ready to join. Our team had planned of throwing a little house party to welcome them to the new job. It was decided that for the sake of convenience of everyone, the party would be held at my place. My home was the nearest to the office, and that way no one would have to travel much. Sure, I didn't mind.

That Friday we (4 of my colleagues, the 3 new hires, and I) headed back to my apartment after office. We had ordered food and some drinks and were generally having a good time sharing some of the stories from our first year experiences working at the firm. We were sitting in the living room all this time. About an hour into the stories Susan had the urge to go to the washroom. When she came back, she looked at me with a confused look in her eyes and at first I couldn't figure out why, nor did I bother to find out more. She took the seat nearest to me and after a few moments, leaned in to whisper something into my ears

""I have so many questions! Why do you have that *inscribed* dog collar in your room, when you have no pets?""

Her emphasis on inscribed made it clear that she had read what the collar said. That was the moment I realized what had just happened. When she went to the guest bathroom, Diane was already using it, and so Susan had went to the one inside my bedroom. Unfortunately, (or fortunately?) I didn't get the time to clean up my room after a regular play session with one of my subs the previous nights, and Susan had accidentally stumbled upon that collar. 

From the tone of her voice, it was clear enough that she was as yet not exposed to this world of kinks. I had to make a crucial decision at that time. I could either brush off the question, or take this as an opportunity to take a curious mind and introduce it to an interesting world of perversions. Her eyes were looking into mine, waiting for an explanation, while I was taking my time to contemplate how best to answer it.

This was getting too long and I had to break it at this point. Let me know in comments/PMs if you'd like me to take this further. If this generates enough interest, I will continue with the rest of the story."

The geeky glasses she used to wear and the way her eyes turned wide when she was confused when I talked about some intricate concept in detail were only some of the little things that added to her delightful presence. 

The interns went back to their hometowns to finish their senior year in college at the end of summers. David, Diane and Susan had made the cut. They received their full time position offers a few weeks after the internship ended, and all three of them had accepted it. That evening Susan texted me saying how excited she was to get the position and thanked me for the mentorship and how it wouldn't have been possible to get there without me. This was the first time that we talked after the internship was over. I replied her back saying all that she achieved was due to her own effort, my role in it was minimal. We texted back and forth for a while that night, before she had to go back to her assignments and we said our goodnights. 

Over the next few months, the frequency of texts from Susan increased. Initially it used to be about logistical issues, questions pertaining to the position of new hires in the company, or something related to moving to the new city etc. Over time, it gradually proceeded to more personal happenings from her life, like how she was having a bad day or if the new assignment was giving her a tough time or how Kelly was being a mean bitch to her. Conversations with her were always interesting. She was a curious young mind who wanted to know and experience as much as she could about the world. At the same time, she was still the naive and innocent young one, who was still in the phase of that delightfully carefree adolescence when you had very few responsibilities which burdens so many adults from being fun. We texted about inconsequential things, yet nothing sexual so far. It was my self imposed policy to never initiate a relationship of that nature with anyone in my workplace. 

The year passed and the fresh hires were ready to join. Our team had planned of throwing a little house party to welcome them to the new job. It was decided that for the sake of convenience of everyone, the party would be held at my place. My home was the nearest to the office, and that way no one would have to travel much. Sure, I didn't mind.

That Friday we (4 of my colleagues, the 3 new hires, and I) headed back to my apartment after office. We had ordered food and some drinks and were generally having a good time sharing some of the stories from our first year experiences working at the firm. We were sitting in the living room all this time. About an hour into the stories Susan had the urge to go to the washroom. When she came back, she looked at me with a confused look in her eyes and at first I couldn't figure out why, nor did I bother to find out more. She took the seat nearest to me and after a few moments, leaned in to whisper something into my ears

""I have so many questions! Why do you have that *inscribed* dog collar in your room, when you have no pets?""

Her emphasis on inscribed made it clear that she had read what the collar said. That was the moment I realized what had just happened. When she went to the guest bathroom, Diane was already using it, and so Susan had went to the one inside my bedroom. Unfortunately, (or fortunately?) I didn't get the time to clean up my room after a regular play session with one of my subs the previous nights, and Susan had accidentally stumbled upon that collar. 

From the tone of her voice, it was clear enough that she was as yet not exposed to this world of kinks. I had to make a crucial decision at that time. I could either brush off the question, or take this as an opportunity to take a curious mind and introduce it to an interesting world of perversions. Her eyes were looking into mine, waiting for an explanation, while I was taking my time to contemplate how best to answer it.

The story and the events are based on real life, while the conversations and personal details have been suitably modified for a better flow and in the interest of anonymity. 

---------------

I used to work at a big finance firm a few years back. Our company hired many junior undergrads as summer interns who were invited to work on certain projects for a few weeks. Based on their performance and abilities, they would be later extended a full time position (or not). One of the things I used to love about this program was the eagerness and enthusiasm of those young undergrads to please their superiors. I have always had a dominant streak in me, be it inside the bedroom or otherwise. Setting up rules for someone to achieve their goals, training them with the discipline they need to develop in themselves, pushing them out of their comfort zone, are some of the things I have found that I enjoy that naturally come to me. Being a mentor for a small team of these summer interns would mean taking the responsibility to guide them through their project, and cultivating these skills in them. Besides, their willingness to learn was the cherry on the cake. 

This one particular year I was supposed to handle a team of 5 interns. 3 young men and 2 young women : David, Tyler, John, Diane and Susan. They were intelligent, smart, and ambitious young students who wanted to make their mark. It was obvious from their interactions with me as well as with each other that these weren't your typical spoilt and entitled college kids, but people who were willing to work hard and put in the effort to achieve what they wanted. 

I must admit, even though I was always professional with them in our meetings and discussions, there was a great deal which I could've never openly admitted to any of my colleagues lest it was interpreted in a way that could damage my reputation. However logical the human brain might be in its rational moments, the primal part of it can't help but feel the emotions that naturally arise. Looking at Susan you would say it was no surprise that I fell for her charms and feminine beauty. A petite brunette, naturally beautiful breasts, a rather supple derriere, she was the object of desire for every male set of eyes on the floor and the object of envy for every female. Smart and sweet. Giggly and friendly. She was a breath of fresh air for anyone she came to interact with. The geeky glasses she used to wear and the way her eyes turned wide when she was confused when I talked about some intricate concept in detail were only some of the little things that added to her delightful presence.

9x3i8r,3,2018-11-14,It's sucks to be so poor you can't even afford to graduate,GuiltyFeelThrowaway,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/9x3i8r/its_sucks_to_be_so_poor_you_cant_even_afford_to/,"I feel like giving up. Sorry, for the long post, but I have no other place to vent. 

Recently I found out I won't get to graduate my uni, because I financially cannot afford to do an internship, which is a hard requirement for my degree. It would require 3 months, full-time hours, unpaid work. And, I don't qualify for financial assistance, nor have I managed to save up enough to get by. 

I thought of asking my parents for some money, but we have problems with the house. Only now we found out that it has not been received in exploitation since it was built in 1916, nor also when it was enlarged in 1976. The house itself is shit - bathroom outside, no hot water, no shower. But, now my parents will also have to pay a significant fine for this issue. Besides, it's not like we are on good terms. I have really talked with them since I moved away, couple of years ago. But, I'm desperate. 

Nowadays, I live in other country and together with my girlfriend. But, she has a lot of issues on her own. Maybe she's bipolar (sort of diagnosed in another country, but not treated, I've been urging her to go to see a specialist), addicted to oxycodone, and often struggling with controlling her emotions.

I feel left rather alone, and I don't know how to talk to her about it. We tried before, but it ended with us getting into arguements. First, I was speaking really harsh and negative things about myself, which made her feel like I'm just giving up on life and our relationship. Second, my emotional outbursts further facilitated her feeling edgy, and to tip off about seemingly random things. And, those ended up overly hurting me, because I was already feeling low.

Maybe I should also mention that, technically, my girlfriend is married to another guy, but he's 1000s miles away, in another country. Their relationship have a history of drug abuse and domestic violence, and I doubt they'll ever even end up in the same country, let alone back togerher. However, they still talk. Mostly, from what my so has shared, she's been just using him to get money or things out him. And, it has to do with making him pay for hurting her and taking back control from that asshole. I can respect that. I'd, probably, would also be looking for a revenge. But, it seems the revenge has maybe consumed her a little too much, making her so short-tempered towards me, and maybe at times not fully being present in our relationship.

I know that her mom also got some bad news recently, which shook my so. She's also rekindled with an old friend / love affair of hers (it's a girl and my SO is bi-). It's also adding to me feeling sort of neglected.

At the same time, she says she loves me a couple of times a day. Even though, when we argue she seems to be taking it back in a way, if that makes sense. So, I just don't know. Maybe I'm personifying some personal insecurities towards her? 

Also being stuck in a dead-end job sucks. I get paid mimimum wage, and it was good while trying to graduate, but now it seems I'll just be stuck over here for a while, if I won't get fired for my performance dropping, because of all the anxiety and stress.

It's also made me self-medicate with smoking a lot of weed, which is further impacting my budget. But, I just get so sad and so low, if don't smoke, and my anxiety starts to get the best of me. However, it means I don't have enough left to pay for a health insurance myself, and see a specialist. 

I just can't deal with my life being in shambles. I escaped the poverty growing up, moved to another country, gained my Bachelors, and was looking forward to my Master's. But I cannot afford to graduate. And, I don't really have anybody to talk with. Fuck, I just feel like I want to dissappear. And, I can't seem to find the strength to turn a corner."

&gt; Fox News announced on Wednesday that it supports CNN&amp;#039;s efforts to restore Jim Acosta&amp;#039;s White House credential after the network filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration.

&gt; &amp;quot;Fox News supports CNN in its legal effort to regain its White House reporter&amp;#039;s press credential. We intend to file an amicus brief with the U.S. District Court. Secret Service passes for working White House journalists should never be weaponized. While we don&amp;#039;t condone the growing antagonistic tone by both the president and the press at recent media avails, we do support a free press, access and open exchanges for the American people,&amp;quot; Fox News President Jay Wallace said in a statement.

&gt; CNN filed the federal lawsuit against the Trump administration on Tuesday demanding that the White House restore the press credential of star reporter Jim Acosta.

&gt; The administration suspended Acosta&amp;#039;s &amp;quot;Hard pass,&amp;quot; which provided expedited access to the White House grounds, after he broke protocol by refusing to surrender his microphone during a press conference last week.

&gt; &amp;quot;CNN, who has nearly 50 additional hard pass holders, and Mr. Acosta is no more or less special than any other media outlet or reporter with respect to the First Amendment. After Mr. Acosta asked the President two questions - each of which the President answered - he physically refused to surrender a White House microphone to an intern, so that other reporters might ask their questions. This was not the first time this reporter has inappropriately refused to yield to other reporters.""

&gt; Acosta&amp;#039;s press pass to access the White House was suspended &amp;quot;Until further notice&amp;quot; after he engaged in the contentious back-and-forth last week over the migrant caravan working its way up through Mexico.

9x3tlu,10,2018-11-14,Worried about my next depressive episode,princesslunaxxx,bipolar2,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar2/comments/9x3tlu/worried_about_my_next_depressive_episode/,"So I’ve been coming out of a weird state where I guess I was recovering from hypomania and dealing with an extreme depressive episode. I feel mostly stable right now aside from heightened anxiety and issues with my libido, and I’ve been taking wellbutrin pretty steadily over the past couple months, but I haven’t taken latuda since August because I haven’t made any follow up appointments with my psychiatrist.

I’ve been taking on a lot of stuff—I go to university full time and work part time. I have musical rehearsal almost every day and I’m planning on auditioning for another one next semester. I’m also planning on becoming a TA next semester and I have to start looking for internships. I’m able to handle this all now, and I want to do more, but I’m worried that when my next depressive episode hits I’m going to stop doing everything and let a lot of people down.

Also writing this I realized I might be on the verge of hypomania because I’m doing a lot of stuff, staying up late, waking up early and still partying a lot.  I just needed somewhere to get this out because I still don’t feel totally comfortable talking about this with my boyfriend or my friends.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!! Should I not do the musical next semester? Should I not apply to be a TA? should i say fuck it and do it all and deal with the depressive spiral when it comes?"

\---

 **Highlights**  


**Professions**  
Artisans

* Many new opportunities have arisen for alchemists on the Sword Coast, and as a result, their applications are no longer the most common ones to appear.

Workshop and Quest Flow

* Bolden and Tress now appear in the player's workshop after completing The Grand Upgrade.  

* Players can no longer unexpectedly end up in (or intentionally visit) other players' workshops.  

* Players can no longer manage to have their own workshops ranked up early by being in someone else's workshop when they upgrade--and, as a result, get stuck in the quest line.  

* Players in a broken state can now turn in their upgrade quest.  

* Players no longer become stuck in the ""Order an item at the Dispatch Board"" or ""Wait for hte Gathering Task to Complete"" steps of the tutorial quest, Running a Workshop.  

* Running a Workshop: This quest now recognizes a wider variety of gathering tasks for credit.

Crafting and Crafted Items

* Brightsilver Talisman is now item level 495 at Uncommon rarity, up from 435.  

* Recycle: This skill now correctly affects items that have been Ordered. (Note that if it's a repeat assignment, the refunded materials will immediately be used to start another assignment.)  

* Supplements no longer sometimes affect multiple repeats of an assignment through a single use.

Exchange

* The Exchange prompt now properly appears if the player has only Bills of Labor in their toolbox.

**Release Notes**  


**Content and Environment**  
Acquisitions Incorporated

* Manycoins Bank Heist has been removed from the Random Queue rotation for now.  

* Retrieval Operation: The ""Talk to Jim Darkmagic"" step of this quest no longer automatically completes for players when one player completes it.  

* The repeatable quest ""Basement Investigation"" is now infinitely repeatable instead of just weekly, and now gives fewer acorns per run.

General

* Collecting rewards at the end of a queued instance no longer has a chance to prevent others from collecting those rewards.  

* Illusionist's Gambit no longer gives Bronze success after clearing the first wave of enemies. And is once again selectable in the queue UI.  

* Players are no longer blocked from completing the quest Doomguide's Duty and Clockwork Tomb.  

* Tomb of the Nine Gods: Players who gain the Temp HP buff in the Avatar Orcus encounter no longer keep it after the encounter ends. (We're looking into other reported issues with this encounter.)  

* Various queued instances should no longer have a chance to break if the player re-queues directly from within the map.

Events

* Wonders of Gond and Tymora's Gift have been re-added to the event calendar, and we've scheduled a Wondrous Bazaar discount this coming weekend too.

**Combat and Powers**  
Classes and Balance

* Guardian Fighter: Griffon's Wrath can no longer be used infinitely.

**Items and Economy**  
General

* Hunter Expedition Pack has been removed from the Zen Market.  

* Merchant Prince's Folly once again drops Chult campaign currency.  

* Weird tokens, e.g. ""Mission Perk Tracker - Tomb of the Nine Gods,"" will no longer take up inventory space.  

* Wiggins the Undead Intern now gives bonus acorns as appropriate.

Consult Expedition Pack

* Profession Packs are now properly in Questionably Procured Goods.  

* Players who claimed the Questionably Procured Goods should now have a Profession Pack in the mail for each of the goods they claimed.

**User Interface**  
General

* Chult maps, and other similar interactions, once again properly allow the player to view them multiple times.

Character Sheet

* Item Level calculations no longer go super out-of-whack in level scaled areas.

Rewards

* Claiming a reward choice pack, such as an artisan pack from your retainer, no longer prevents other reward popups from showing up for the rest of the session.

Stores

* ""Sell All"" in sell-only stores (such as the Profession exchange or South Seas Trading Company) no longer sells items that are equipped.  

* ""Sell All"" in sell-only stores no longer sells items with enchantments or armor kits.

**Art, Animation, Effects, and Audio**  
Animation

* Player characters riding a manticore no longer T-pose to assert dominance.

**Localization**  
General

* A fix pass has been made to various French and German text.

**Remaining Known Issues**  
We know there are more, but here are some of the highlights.

* Acquisitions Incorporated repeatable quests are only repeatable weekly, preventing the player from reaching the campaign currency cap on the first week.  

* Companions and Soul Puppets snooze after a while of standing idle; this will be reverted in a later build.  

* Cotton Petasos don't hide a character's hair, leading to egregious clipping.  

* Crafted capes and mantles currently do not change the character's appearance when equipped.  

* Feathered Ilhuilli is lower item level at Uncommon quality than expected. It is currently 455, and will be 515 after this is addressed.  

* In French, Lady Begum has a line of voice-over that doesn't make sense in context. This will be updated in a later build.  

* Legendary tools for the Gathering profession have Recycle, which doesn't help with Gathering tasks.  

* Profession coupons do not currently apply to items in the Professions category.  

* Requirements for certain items at the Stronghold Bloomery and Goldsmith structures currently require outdated Masterwork ranks.  

* ""Second Chances"" can be accepted multiple times, though it cannot be completed multiple times.  

* Text in certain artisan recruitment packs incorrectly claims the contents will be alchemists. The names of the packs are correct.  

* There are two Fleeces. The one from Illusionist's Gambit will be renamed to Enchanted Fleece in a later build."

I've been practicing Leetcode/algorithm type entry-level interview questions. Is there any club at MIT that goes over these kinds of questions? I would be super interested in doing these questions with a group of people.

9x6z3d,3,2018-11-14,Power Trippin? Or Seriously Trippin?,kobebeef18,bossfromhell,https://www.reddit.com/r/bossfromhell/comments/9x6z3d/power_trippin_or_seriously_trippin/,"So let me begin by saying that this is so not how expected my first job to go and sorry for the long post. Everyone begins with this enthusiasm about doing their best and making a legit change... welp I kind of did, but at great cost. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Background info:** I started working at ""said place"" almost a year ago. I had previously interned there when I was a student. When the opportunity to hire someone for my position arrived, I got an email from my mentor suggesting I apply. First job application, first interview, and I landed the job. It was a position of quite a bit of authority, but due to the amount of experience I had from internships and so on, they thought I would be a good fit.  I thought it was going to be great, because I already knew a lot of the people and had built really wonderful relationships, or so I thought. Especially since I am seeking to pursue a Ph.D in Organic chemistry. I met really nice colleagues and the work seemed really cool. I was also really excited to work with my boss because they were so amazing. Or so I thought.

&amp;#x200B;

**Fast forward to a week into my job:** My boss needs to leave on a two month break, which let me begin by saying was completely necessary and is not the reason that I am upset at them. The person who was supposed to train me, up and quit without any notice. I was left treading water basically alone. I kept connection with my boss via email, but basically had to figure out a lot of things out on my own. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Fast Forward again two months later:** My boss is back. I somehow survived and made the department function even better than it was previously. I made trainings for things that we didn't have before. Made a system to organize everything. Began designing a website to be as efficient as humanly possible, and to the point everyone was happy. Except my boss, it seemed that everything I did annoyed her. When I got into the room, her behavior would change completely. Also, she began trying to micromanage everything I was doing, as far as to tell me that I had to tell her who I spoke to about things and when. They also mentioned that I must refer to everyone by saying Mr. or Ms., never refer to them by their first name, regardless of how the person wanted me to call them. This seemed a little weird, so I told her that I wasn't trying to be disrespectful. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Couple weeks later:** My colleague who was like my guardian angel throughout this entire process of figuring this out, said they needed to take a 3 month break due to health reasons. This same co-worker was also the person who basically did my bosses work on the down low. The reason things worked well, was because of my co-worker; granted my boss got all the credit. When they left their work and my work all get piled up onto me. My boss starts taking days off, without letting anyone know. Gets extremely agitated when I take on responsibilities that my co-worker did, but then piles up work they don't feel like doing. Our relationship gets a little better, but now I am working more than the hours I should, by at least more than half. Don't get me wrong, I lovee to work. I'm a slight-workaholic, but I don't like leaving things last minute. My boss left everything for last minute, and would then push the work onto me and expect to get it done the next day/ due date. I somehow always got everything done. Instead of making them happy, they started treating me even worse. But they had to continue using me because my co-worker is still on leave.

&amp;#x200B;

**Vacation**: a month and a half in advance I request a week off to go visit a friend. During that month and a half, I prepare everything and leave all the work that needs to get approved by them neatly organized using excel sheets. During my week off, they call me multiple times because they didn't know how to authorize things and I had to do their work for them before the deadline. Basically I spend the entire week working again, this time remotely. Now I am annoyed. I come back and I receive no thanks, not even an acknowledgement of anything, on the contrary they get mad because they didn't submit a form I had prepared but that needed to be sent out via their email. They expected me to somehow send it on their behalf without giving me access to their email... Idk how unless they wanted me to hack their account. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Coworker returns**: They return, and my boss basically tells me that I have to go back to doing only my work. Prior to their return, I had been planning this event that we need to do yearly. I had prepared an outline and worked with people to get things done for this event. My boss tells me, this is not my job, even though they assigned this to me, and for me to not touch anything. They become micromanaging even more so now and then starts sending me rude replies via email. They then belittle me in front of other faculty, and if their is a mistake I get thrown under the bus, even if I wasn't on the project. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Today:** They come into my office and introduce me to future patrons ""this is the woman they gave me"" and when they try to introduce themselves to me, my boss says "" oh don't worry about her, she is absolutely nobody important"". I try to smile as the situation gets a little awkward, and they obviously feel bad. I let them continue the tour and focus on the presentations I have to give today. I give 6 back-to-back presentations for new members of the facilities. After not even taking lunch, I get back to my desk (almost to the end of the day), I see my boss leaving with the patrons and 4 of my co-workers. My boss asks me how I am, and I tell them very good and I tell them how the presentations went. They nod and turn to my co-worker and says see you soon ( I thought nothing of it, at first). Then my co-worker, who is amazing (not sarcastic, they really are), tells me that I should hurry up, I ask why? They say, to make drinks! Apparently, my boss had sent out a memo to everyone in the department (except me) to get together for drinks after work. They also went ahead and made sure everyone got the email by confirming with each person (except me). At first I thought, oh I didn't check my email, I am sure I received it. When I check there is nothing. I thought that they forgot to add me to the email, but they saw me as they were leaving. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ultimately, I tell my worker that I wasn't invited. You can tell they feel bad, and are slightly shocked. I waved it off like it was nothing. But deep down, that really hurt. I know I shouldn't care about such little things, but this felt horrible. Now I'm not sure how to act tomorrow. I don't want to complain because I know that will only feed into my bosses ego and power trip. 

&amp;#x200B;

What should I do?

9x7ky5,1,2018-11-14,Looking for advice,Eezyville,freelance,https://www.reddit.com/r/freelance/comments/9x7ky5/looking_for_advice/,"Hey guys. I'm not sure if this is the right place for this so please forgive me. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL/DR: I know I'm being underpaid by my friend as he builds his company and he's demanding more from me.

&amp;#x200B;

I am working with a college friend on his startup company. He sells drones and he needs someone to build the machines. We met in college, majored in engineering, and both worked at a large company. I fell on hard times, got imprisoned, and I'm now trying to get back on my feet. His business partner had to leave the company for personal reasons and that person was the technical head. When I got out I contacted him just to catch up and he asked me to work with him on his company. Basically for the past few months he's given me $200/week to build a drone that he can sell to other companies, mostly utilities and construction. I agreed to build a drone that can do certain things, fly, hover, waypoint, video streaming to nearby pilot. Now this machine can basically do what a DJI can do and I felt that I've done it for a very low price.

&amp;#x200B;

Now the problem is he wants me to add in a ton of features. AI obstacle avoidance, video streaming over the internet, infrared and heat sensing cameras, and a ton of software integration. I know that $200/week isn't nearly enough to do this work. He offered $400 but no that isn't nearly enough. I feel that I am making a product that competes with the products from a multibilion dollar international company (DJI) and I'm being paid like some 3rd world help desk intern. I try to put in no more that 20/hrs a week on this but I'm the only one in his company building this and I'm making peanuts for the amount of research and engineering that goes with this. I'm also working in a restaurant to have money to spend but I am not happy. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure what to do about this. I will finish the device with the original features because I keep my word but I don't want to do all that extra stuff. That will require me to get at least a basic understanding in a few new fields of science like AI and network programming. I was planning to learn some programming languages and set myself up as a freelance programmer. This project is time consuming and he demands alot. I think I should be paid at least an engineer's salary for doing engineering level work. What is your advice? Should I continue to work with him on his company with the promise of more money in the future or should I just focus on me and let hime build his own robots?"
9x7swn,2,2018-11-14,Me (23M) and my girlfriend (23F) have been fighting a lot recently. Is it just a phase or does it show something has changed?,DW4isGod,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9x7swn/me_23m_and_my_girlfriend_23f_have_been_fighting_a/,"Throwaway account just because.

&amp;#x200B;

So my girlfriend and I have been together for around 2 years now. We are both in our last year at University in which we met, we live about 2 minutes away from each other. We went through a lot of hard times about a year ago but the last six months have been great and amazing for the both of us. She recently has picked up a new job which she works at 3 days a week but it's cool because I've been working at my job for the last 3 years and I've had an internship on top of that. 

&amp;#x200B;

The problem that we have been facing is that we have been fighting a lot more than we usually do recently and we are both starting to get concerned with it. We have had talks about the possibility of us maybe breaking up but both of us also find this to be troubling because we both still love each other very much. 

&amp;#x200B;

She is extremely busy, like I said she picked up a new job that has her working until around midnight around 3-4 days a week, and then on top of that she is in a sorority so she feel likes to spend a couple nights of the week with them. Recently we have gotten to the point though were we've only been able to see each other for maybe a couple of hours each week and over the last 3-4 weeks we've been fighting almost every weekend. The fights are usually centered around how much we get to see each other and while we both understand that we've both been busy, it still sucks not being able to see each other with free time.

&amp;#x200B;

The last week we've probably had 4-5 serious conversations about whether or not we should continue to see each other. It's hard because we leave for Thanksgiving break this weekend and she is going back to Tennessee while I'm going back home to New Jersey. Does this sound like the certain type of thing were the fighting is just a phase and we can work this out or does this sound like the type of thing were we are finally coming to a point where we are realizing that we shouldn't actually be together?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR Girlfriend and I of 2 years have been fighting a lot recently because of busy schedules and we are not sure whether we call it quits or stick it out."
9x973a,26,2018-11-15,"I watched the Leah Remini A&amp;E Special last night, it made me realize that I was never alone in this.",[deleted],exjw,https://www.reddit.com/r/exjw/comments/9x973a/i_watched_the_leah_remini_ae_special_last_night/,"  

I've been checking this subreddit for a while. Last night after watching the Leah Remini A&amp;E Special  I decided to subscribe and share my story with you. 

(Please excuse any language errors, my first language is Afrikaans.) 

I am a 23-year old girl. I grew up as a Jehovah’s witness, my mom got to know “the truth” through her grandmother, my dad found a publication while doing military service on the border of Angola and subsequently refused to carry his weapon into battle. He was sent home. He met my mom at the kingdom hall...

By the time I was 11, I was an unbaptized publisher, around 12-13 I started realizing that something was wrong. I noticed that people did not think things through for themselves that Jehovah was the answer to everything that they only had compassion as long as you lived by the rules.  I stopped going out in field service and tried to distance myself as much as possible, but at that time, the Tuesday bible study was being held at my parent’s house, most meetings I would just be sitting there planning my life and what I needed to do in order to leave the organisation. 

Fast forward a few years

I went to university with a bursary, against my parents’ wishes. I wanted to study computer programming. The compromise was me studying plant science, something that would be useful after Armageddon.

Even with the mindset that I did not want to be part of the organisation, I lived with constant gilt, whenever a classmate asked me to go drink coffee or to study together I would feel like I should not be there. That talking to the people around me was wrong, that my Dad wouldn't approve.  

I intentionally lost my bursary after 1 year at university, realizing that I needed to get further away and not be dependent on my parents at all. I found an internship as a programmer in a small town and started furthering my education through my job. After a few months they gave me a permanent position as a programmer. I met a “worldly man” who is the most caring and honest and trustworthy person I have ever met. 

My parents constantly discouraged my success, saying that I would not have time for the truth. That a worldly man had no place in my life and if he didn’t except the truth, I was not to see him anymore. I don’t drink. I don’t smoke. I didn’t have any other friends at the time, and I have not set foot in a bar or club in my life. I still felt guilt every time I left my apartment, like I should be calling my dad and asking for his approval to live. I went to work and home. And sometimes dinner in a public place with my now boyfriend, then only friend. This was considered to be an unacceptable worldly life. 

The first memorial service I did not attend with them, when I told them I was not going, that I did not believe and don’t want to be a part of it anymore. They shunned me. They made me feel like I was the one causing the end of our relationship. That I was ungrateful, and disrespectful and that I will not receive everlasting life.  This made me feel worthless, how could my parents, who know me, who said they love me, do this? How worthless must I be for my family to be okay with turning their backs on me? 

It was a very difficult time, but as time passes the gilt is getting better. Life gets better.

I watched the Leah Remini A&amp;E Special last night and it made me cry, it made me realize that I was never alone in this, I’m not the only person who still deals with the indoctrinated mindset. 

…I’ve had an amazing man at my side for the past 2 years, he reminds me constantly of what I am as a person and that they were losing me. I was not losing them. He showed me a love that is truly unconditional. 

This year I had my first birthday celebration. Today we are buying our first Christmas tree. I’m experiencing a level of happiness I don’t know existed. A feeling of freedom to think for myself.

 I'm finally living and not just existing."
9x9kje,7,2018-11-15,Help me understand my career options,Guy_M0ntag,DigitalMarketing,https://www.reddit.com/r/DigitalMarketing/comments/9x9kje/help_me_understand_my_career_options/,"Hello everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I have thought about writing this post to ask for opinions for weeks, not sure if it make much sense but here I am now...

&amp;#x200B;

I have over 13+ experience in Digital Marketing, I have started in the Webspam team at Google where I was, towards the end of my tenure there, a program manager of sort, addressing the quality issues in the Google index through the actions of the then EMEA Webspam team. Furthermore, during my time there, I applied manual and semiautomatic penalties, helped with webmaster communication and liaised with Eng teams, among other tasks. 

&amp;#x200B;

After getting a good view (8 years) of what others can generate with online traffic, I wanted to give it a shot myself and first I got Adwords and Analytics certified, then I created my own consultancy, helping a couple of SMBs. Then I landed a job at one of the Expedia brands as part of their SEO team. I became SEO Manager after 18 months and lead that team for another year and a half, managing in the meanwhile the social media channels of the brand via an intern.

&amp;#x200B;

I kept being a freelance in the meanwhile and, when Expedia decided to shut down the brand, I thought it was the perfect moment to go 100% solo. Things have gone very well, especially during these last 11 months, where work has come my way through word of mouth, without any need for promotion.

&amp;#x200B;

If I think about the future, I'd want to keep being a freelance for a while more, and enjoy the freedom that comes with it, but I'd have a few questions for the community:

&amp;#x200B;

1. would you not be afraid of becoming ""obsolete"" by keeping the freelance thing on while the industry progresses and new trends/tools/approaches are being spotted/applied within this professional context? I have a feed where I keep myself updated with what happens in the industry but I am afraid that, if I ever get tired of doing this on my own, the more time passes, the harder it will be to land again a job with a company
2. by working on my own I mostly get to work on things I am very comfortable with (SEO, SEM, Analytics); how can I keep working and at the same time fill the gaps with other professionals, who get their hands on many more marketing channels (e.g. programmatic, email marketing) than I do? 
3. can someone with my experience rightfully apply for an Ecommerce|Digital Marketing Manager role, knowing that there are channels I have zero o little experience about, the yearly Google ads budget I currently manage is just above 100K€ and I have never held such role within a company?
4. Do you think companies will still be hiring for exclusively SEO roles in 5 years from now?

Thanks for reading thus far!"

The stairs to this level were quickly found, but the trail of discarded loot has grown yet again. Once again, a door blocks off the rest of the level, but this one doesn't even have a keyhole - you're going to need to clear a path for a battering ram. It's unfortunate that such an ancient portal would have to be destroyed, but that's a small price to pay for the riches stored behind it. There are stories being told about unprepared adventurers coming down here and returning emptyhanded. Hopefully, such tales will encourage future delvers to heed the guild leader's instructions...

The theme of this dungeon level is **card games**. Tell the world about a card game they might not have heard about, or suggest some interesting house rules that change the way a popular card game is played.

You can request any number of games. First come - first served, aggregated by day. Starting the next day after the offer is posted, if you're the only person who requested a particular game, you get it and aren't eligible for any other games that day. If multiple eligible people request a game the winner is selected randomly. People who put some effort in their comment will have more weight in the selection. This repeats until all games are distributed. For Humble Bundle games, I will be asking whether you want a gift link or a key (unless you specify it in the comment). A few offers have multiple copies. Locked games will only be sent out after a significant delay, which is shortened when unlocked games get claimed."

So, long post warning. I'm not known for my brevity and I write posts for these subs the same way I tell stories aloud. So just uh...bear with me.

My mother (Mad Hatter on JNMIL) is questioning if my new boyfriend is a rebound, and it has me angry. She doesn't listen or pay attention to me very deeply, so I'm not surprised she hasn't paid attention. Instead of JADEing to her, I feel like explaining the history of why he's not to you guys. Bonus that it gives the background on my ex that iI need to let go of. 

\---

I met The Leech in freshman year of high school. We were in band together, but in different instrument sections so I didn't really get to talk to him until December for a Christmas fundraiser. He was annoying and obnoxious and I was infuriated by him, but on some level I liked him (for those of you who were teen girls once, I'm sure you understand to some degree or another). I had this crush on him all through high school. I asked him out to school dances twice--both times he turned me down for flimsy reasons. Finally, the year after he graduated, we started hanging out more. Eventually we started dating (by him texting me one evening before our weekly game night with my friends--""Wait, are we dating now?"" Sigh. 😒)

I thought I was so lucky. But we were long distance all through college. He kept failing and taking semesters off from his school 3 hours south from mine. He has still not finished college but he is going back this coming spring.  Thankfully neither of his classes will be in the same building as mine next semester. Anyway.

Spring of...2013? I was off all of my medications for one week due to a pharmacy error and it messed my brain up. I ended up catching feels for one of my friends at school and we kissed. Now *that* fucked me up hard. I nearly broke up with The Leech over this, but he forgave me and we never talked about it again. But the seed of doubt was planted--what if there was someone better?

A bunch of shit happened after this, but it's not very interesting to anyone other than me. Let me just summarize it with Leech never really listening to or respecting me.

Now on to the ""fun"" parts of that aspect of the story. 

**Sensitive content starts here**.

\---

I never enjoyed sex with him. It always hurt and it was always just waiting for it to be over. I rarely enjoyed it.

But he claims one of the symptoms of his illness that he enjoys is hypersexuality, or so he claims. He would ask me in crude ways if I would have sex with him, at least on a twice-daily basis. If it were up to him we probably would have done it three times a day. I, without knowing why, had almost no interest in him or sex or anything. At one point I debated labeling myself asexual.

The Leech, upon hearing this, didn't accept it and try to help me figure out what I was feeling. No, no. That's too self-aware for him. No, instead he told me something like ""You aren't asexual. We just need to bang more to get you to like it again.""

Eventually I got him to barter down to a blowjob 3x a week and sex after showering. I nearly always bowed out of both, claiming not feeling well. This frustrated him.

After several months of this, he mentions to me that maybe we need to try something different to get me to enjoy things again. I agree. I had wanted to try BDSM stuff for a long time but was too scared to bring it up. So I did. He was very excited about it. He also had his own suggestion: anal.

Early on in our relationship, we both agreed that we weren't interested in that. And while I understand that people grow and change over time (especially as young as we were), it was still a total shock.

And, I agreed to try it. Because who knows, I might like it?

(Narrator: She did not.)

My biggest mistake was not flat out refusing him every single time after I found out I didn't like it. But he would wheedle, and whine, and beg, and badger, and etc. until I gave in.

For example. In the shower, he would pinch my nipples. Which I hate out of context. So I would tell him to knock it off. So he would, for anywhere from 5 seconds to a whole minute...then he would stick a finger in my asscrack. Or poke my clit. Or something. Rinse and repeat until he got out of the shower, or got pissy and told me he was just trying to get me in the mood for our scheduled sex.

\---

**Sensitive content ends here**.

I thought hetero relationships were just like this, though. I thought I was just destined for a life with a man who could not problem solve enough to figure out how to feed my cat her wet food while I had food poisoning and a 103 degree fever. I had to coach him through it. That same day, I asked him to go to the store and get me some applesauce because I needed to eat something. He said, ""Okay, if I go out to get dinner I'll get you applesauce."" I begged him to please do it. He looked confused, and repeated himself. 

He did get it for me and to this day insists that he said he would definitely go. 

 Sit-coms and parents and his parents and etc. had taught me that it was normal for the woman to be naggy and mean and ""mother""-like to a clueless, pointless, sex-obsessed man. 

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't understand why anyone enjoyed relationships. I thought there was something wrong with me.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Then I started my second, current degree. I started doing things for myself, not for ""us"". This spring, I got confirmation I could start an internship which would define the first decade of my career if i chose to let it. And with that I realized that he was holding me back. I fought this idea for months, but couldn't refuse it anymore.

Finally, our anniversary in the late spring. I was getting over being sick, as was he. But I insisted we go out to dinner anyway, thinking we would be fine. We got to the restaurant, ordered, and as soon as we ordered he felt immensely ill and we had to get our food to-go and leave.

I was hugely disappointed. In my head, this was his last real chance. I graciously mentally gave him the ""last chance"" to make it up to me once he felt better by taking us out again or just doing *something* together, but it never happened.

Unfortunately, we signed the new lease during this period. We moved in, and as soon as we did I knew I would be leaving. Right before mother's day in the US, I tried to break up with him. He broke. He was quiet (rare for him), withdrawn, etc. Again, worried for his safety, I agreed to give him another chance.

Then I started my internship. I met new people that I shared interests with for the first time in years. Since I was not romantically attached to The Leech (heh), I became quickly attached to my mentor/project partner. (Most of the people in my office are around my age due to reasons). Eventually I knew that I couldn't pretend with The Leech any longer, and had to break it off for real.

The second time I broke up with him, he begged me to give him more time to fix it.  So I did. I gave him one week.

During that week, I noticed my other coworker our age was cute. I didn't find him as attractive as my mentor, but in the 'If he asked me out I would say yes just to see how it goes' kind of way. Yeah, Dormouse, this relationship was long dead.

The end of that week, after no effort on Leech's part, he actually sits down and watches a tv show with me!!!  At the end, he turns to me, all excited, and says ""So, do you like me more again now?""

I told him the truth. I said, ""No. I still want this to be over.""

He got up, went to the office, shut the door, and didn't come out again. I don't remember if he slept that night.

Either way, the next day when he got home from work he asked me if I was telling my parents the next day.

Somehow, *THAT* time it stuck.

I told my parents. I was crying and sad because he was sad and I felt bad for hurting him. Not for leaving him. Not for myself, but for him.

Two weeks later, I hung out with my mentor/friend and at the end we ended up calling it a date. When he kissed me, it was somehow *even worse* than kissing The Leech. Like a dried, dead fish.

Literally the day after that, I went to other coworker's house for game night planning and had him look at my computer for some issues after everyone else left. He walked me to my car in the rain to help keep my computer dry, and when we got there he asked me on a date.

I initially said no. Well, I said ""I don't know right now. I'm not saying no, but I need some time to give you a good answer."" He said ""I figured as much."" and walked back to his house. As soon as I sat in my car, I realized that A: I was single, B: I wasn't beholden to the first guy for one date just cause he liked me, and C: this guy had the nerve to actually ask me out himself. So fuck it, why not? I leapt back out of the car and called out to him as he got to his walkway and said I would go.

The next weekend we went out, and it was the best date I've ever been on in my life. He put effort into it. He thought about my comfort and my needs. He did everything right. And at the end, I told him ""The only way this date could be any better is if you kissed me."" And he said, ""Oh, well, good, cause I was going to do that anyway."" in a cheeky, self-assured way. And then he kissed me. (Note that I knew if I had asked him not to, he wouldn't have.)

And holy shit guys. I finally understand why people enjoy kissing. I have never been kissed like that in my life, not once in the 7 years with The Leech.

That second guy is my boyfriend now. After seeing him I realized that my mentor at work is a lot like The Leech. Not in all the narc-y ways, but in enough mindsets that it was weird that iI found him so quickly. I consider him my rebound. New Boyfriend is everything iI wanted Leech to be that he never understood how to be. 

. . ing 

But this isn't a sub for excellent SOs so I'll limit my gushing about him, I promise.

The most important difference in their behavior is that New Boyfriend just holds me when I cry. He encourages me to let it out, and that it's okay to not be okay. He acknowledges that things are hard for me.

Leech? He would awkwardly hold me and say ""What do you want me to say? What can I do to help? I don't understand why that upsets you."" etc.

Honestly, it's no wonder my self esteem was in the negatives. For two years I had to micromanage myself, the house, my cat, and a manchild while in school and working part-time!

&amp;#x200B;

I think my next post will be why I believe that I should be calling him The Leech.

9xbdfm,36,2018-11-15,2018 STATE OF THE CLUB.,oops1989,NYCFC,https://www.reddit.com/r/NYCFC/comments/9xbdfm/2018_state_of_the_club/,"Another year, another STATE OF THE CLUB I'm writing with a heavy heart. The team did not deliver the results we had hoped for but ultimately got the ones they deserve. When we look back on this year we will remember the unbridled optimism of the early season, the 1-1 Red Bulls game, and the disappointing run of games to finish out the year. The official calls of progress because of a playoff ""win"" don't feel significant at all because they didn't come against a top 3 team but against the lowly hapless and possibly lower division Union. However, even as I write this from a dark place, there is a light at the end of the tunnel. 

&amp;#x200B;

The biggest question going into the season was the team's ability to change tactics under Viera. The darkest marks of the Viera tenure wasn't the Arsenal talismanic central midfielder's ability to navigate the table but the 7-0, 5-0, 4-1, and 2-0 scorelines seared into every supporters memory due to an inability to adapt to a distinctive style. 

&amp;#x200B;

The team's plan to address this issue was to bunker down on the same exact style by bringing in a Paraguayan wunderkind midfield dynamo, a Swedish veteran striker, an Austrian poacher striker, a pacy Swedish defender out of Malmo, and a gaggle of random defenders seeming to be plucked from the depths of Football Manager. An important loss for the club was Jack ""Golden Boy"" Harrison (as we would see later the new arrivals did not provide enough to replace this giant hole in the fanbases' heart and on the flank.) The signal to the fanbase, at the time, was very much: our way is the best way and it seemed like the team would be proven right by earning a decisive 3 points away at Kansas City followed by an impressive unbeaten run. However, everyone in the club knew that the true test would be on 5/5 against the dreaded cross-town Red Bulls. And so, finally on that beautiful afternoon, with a national audience, some snide remarks in the media beforehand, 4 minutes in, and two goals down, the away section knew that a change would need to be made. 

&amp;#x200B;

The team tried to repair and prove to the fanbase that everything was fine and shockingly they delivered by participating in what proved to be a top 5 match of the year and earned a 2-2 away tie against the upstart LAFC. They then beat a hapless Colorado team 4-0 at home, lost away to Houston, and crushed Orlando 3-0 at home. The sex wasn't good but it was happening. At this point, it seemed like the family would stay together. Then came another match against the Red Bulls and well... we know what happened. The last game of Patrick's career as the coach of NYCFC was against the darlings of the league, Atlanta, and it personified the coach's 2.5-year tenure - an inability to adapt to the situation at hand and an inability to secure all three points at home with a 1-1 result. 

&amp;#x200B;

This 1-1 was followed by the biggest change of the year with the midseason coaching appointment of Dominic Torrent, affectionately known as Dome. From the face of it Dome's resume is unmatched in the MLS (gtfo here Tata) - 3 La Ligas, 2 UEFA Champs, 2 Bundes Ligas, 1 EPL titles. Even if you're hating on the hardware, it's hard to say that that Dome wasn't a part of some transformational teams. The playing style under the new coach had immediately changed - everyone in the building could feel that something was different. At the time it felt like this was going to be our secret weapon; finally, someone who wouldn't just guide the horse to the water but make it drink. The initial results were good - we beat Toronto 2-1 and the boys LOOKED GOOD DOING IT, a fan in 237 was quoted as saying ""Citylona"", the steak was getting peppered and we were eating it too. Finally, it came time for any NYCFC coach's litmus test, another match against the dreaded Red Bulls but this time at home. We won. 

&amp;#x200B;

This was it. This wasn't our first win against the Red Bulls but this was our first where we dictated the pace. We were the ones pressing. We were the ones asking the questions. The 85th-minute mistake from the Red Bulls defense seemed as unthinkable then as it does now but it happened and we believed. Quickly Dome followed up and delivered another 3 wins. We were playing well, everything worked, Shradi was quietly in the race for the golden boot and things were clicking and the last matchup with the Red Bulls awaited. One of Dome's hired guns put City down to 10 men but this delivered the NYCFC match of the season as the team was miraculously able to dominate the match with 9 men and rescue a point. At this point, we thought we had it. We had figured it out. Even Berget was playing well. 

&amp;#x200B;

But then inexplicably, things started to fall apart and NYCFC earned 8 points out of a possible 24 and narrowly escaped the embarrassment of having to play as the away team in the first round of the playoffs. This portion of the season is the most confounding. I don't understand what changed. I don't understand why it happened. Anyways, by the narrowest of margins, we avoided disaster; we quickly disposed of Philly and now we were back in the spotlight against Atlanta. It was time for Dome to work his big game magic. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure what happened in the first leg. We had the intensity. We just weren't sharp at all. We couldn't finish. We were completely flaccid. While we had the hopes of a better result away, Atlanta is a tough assignment and frankly, it just was not our day. We did a good job of weathering the initial onslaught but a series of errors did us in, but honestly - this is why you fight for the higher seed during the regular season: to get the calls, to get the crowd behind you, to press the issue and we just didn't get it done. The season was over.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, the state of the club is strong. The team is playing it's most attractive soccer to date (scored more goals this year than last year) but it is likely that Dome's dream is also what did them in. The initial infusion of the Catalan's blank check for a pragmatic creativity was like a breath of fresh air; there was a renewed willingness to attack AND press. Callens began taking touches on the ball and driving it to the opponents 18 (??), Ring was being involved in the attack, and Maxi became a box to box midfielder. But I'm afraid that this has been too ambitious for the players that we had. Dome was instituting a style suited for players like Xavi, Iniesta, Puyol, Lahm, and Busquets. Players where a single name defined a position. Now look, I love Ring. Is Ring a generational talent? No. In a way, the Red Bulls 1-1 game showed us the best version of NYCFC can be because it forced Dome to tell Ring ""you- you defend"", Villa - ""you, you attack"", Maxi ""you - attack don't track back"". Ring was unbelievable in that game. I thought it was the best single player performance I've ever seen in person. Just absolutely dominant against the most potent attack in the league. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now when we look at the away game against Atlanta. Maxi was a box to box midfield. I love Maxi. Is Maxi Steven Gerrard??? I don't think so. Should Maxi help in defense? YES! Should he be defending in the box?? No. Same with Shradi. How was Shradi 1 on 1 in the box? I don't blame his slide tackle; I blame the positioning. Lastly, for the last goal - why is Castellanos in the last line of defense when we need two goals?? Okay yes, it sucks that he kept him onsides. Why is he even in that solar system??

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I DO think that Dome's dream is the future. I just think that trying to implement that system in mid-season is incredibly difficult. I also do think that we're going to see A LOT of departures; it won't be as drastic as the reset button Claudio pressed after 2015 but it will be a system refresh for sure. I do also think it is important to understand how much can be done in the winter, not just from a transfers perspective but from a coaching perspective as well. Even getting the current squad under world-class coaching for three months and understand responsibilities will be a huge boon for the club.  

&amp;#x200B;

As was previously documented I believe that on the defense the gaggle of random defenders Patrick signed this offseason will all be gone. Tinnerholm will likely be gone - I have no idea what happened here but it just seems like he really struggles with the newer breed of newer and younger strikers the MLS has been importing, conversely, these matchups seem to take him out of his offensive zone as well as he hangs back much more. If Ben and Tinnerholm survive the roster purge, I believe that Nashville or Cincinnati will pluck one or both in the expansion draft, frankly, they would be stupid not to. I don't know why, but my gut tells me that Dome will turn Mata into his personal project and will try to restore him to 2016 Mata levels at the least (RIP my Mata to EPL takes.)  

&amp;#x200B;

Chanot and Callens are the best you're gonna get in the MLS I believe. I don't think they're going anywhere. In regards to Sean, if it comes, the team traded him for a draft pick or Garber bucks or picked up in the expansion draft I would okay with it; his decline from early season form has been dramatic to say the least. Also, I wouldn't think it would be crazy to see Sands start here next year. Sands is miles ahead of anyone on our defense in terms of pedigree. You have to remember that Dome was part of coaching staffs that fazed out Ronaldinho, Schweinsteiger, and Puyol. Sands likely has had the quality of youth coaching that Dome expects and likely has had more instruction in modern formations and development than any other player on the squad. Sands and Scally were part of academy squads that stood toe to toe with Real's academy and part of youth USMNT that are much more successful than the senior side. Look out for this as a potential development next year. 

&amp;#x200B;

I do also think that the outside defender position is likely where we're gonna see the splashiest acquisitions, especially considering how much Dome emphasized that he would want to see wingers that understand his system. I would look for the City scouting network to deliver some gems here whose YouTube highlights we will be watching on repeat very soon. 

&amp;#x200B;

For the midfield, I still trust in Ring. I think an offseason with Dome will be good for defining what he CAN and what he CAN'T do. Also, Ring is only 27, which is young for a CDM - these positions usually blossom around 32-34. As far as Herrera goes, I believe that the Venezuelan will be on the squad next year. I believe that the spring injury hurt his value and now he needs to recover it. Especially, if Almiron &amp; Martinez get the fees the media is expecting I believe that his agent will tell him to stay in the MLS before heading back. Maxi will stay. Medina I believe will stay not because they want him but mostly because I don't think anyone would pay for his contract. He will need to become significantly more physical; his skill is obviously there but he just gets pushed off the ball way too often to play on our smaller field where contact is frequent. Everyone else is obviously fired. 

&amp;#x200B;

For transfers in the midfield, I expect them to bring in someone who resembles a Herrera type and not a Maxi type. I think Dome prefers a Ring-type player that has more attacking prowess but has a defensive feel for the game. I would expect an older player here - not someone from a City academy. 

&amp;#x200B;

In attack, I want to believe that Lewis will stay but I can't imagine his agent allowing that given the playing time he saw. Again, I think Dome is going to be a rational person and try to rescue the situation in the offseason but I think that the Generation Adidas and agent money will prevail here and Lewis will be somewhere in Europe. Shradi is a killer and is only 24, obviously keep. Berget and Wallace, get the fuck off my team. 

&amp;#x200B;

When it comes to Villa, I don't know what to say. I don't understand why the media keeps pushing the narrative of his retirement especially when he put out a ""fake news"" statement but the narrative being face fucked into my face makes me face some obvious realities. From a data standpoint, Villa had originally expected to be here three years and is already playing on an extension contract. It really feels very similar to how the club dealt with Patrick's departure from a communication standpoint. Lastly, the last contract extension was signed in May, why are they stretching this out till he's off contract?? 

&amp;#x200B;

One ominous thing that I didn't want to mention is that during the Atlanta home game right after the squad photo what looked to be Villa's kids came on the pitch and took a photo with just Villa; it certainly had the ""this is my last game"" feel. Again, I wasn't gonna spoil the mood and I was focused on the match but it's something that's lodged in my brain that I've kept to myself until now.

&amp;#x200B;

What would a potential Villa departure look like? I'm not sure. Again, I'm just doing this as a hypothetical because I believe that the club will figure it out. If he does decide to hang them up he's going to be impossible to replace. Villa's resume is unmatched. WC winner, Euros winner, Champs League winner, and Spain's all-time scorer by a wide margin (he has 59 and the next one is fucking RAUL at 44 and Torres at 38). Dragging the 2016 version of this team to a 2nd seed finish is one of the greatest sporting achievements in US Soccer history.  It is arguable that in terms of winning, he's probably a top 5 most accomplished striker of all time. I look forward to us flying to Barcelona for his testimonial match. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't believe that the club will chase a ""Pirlo"" or a ""Lampard"" to replace him. I think that it's likely that the striker role will be homegrown from City ranks or from the academy. The future of the ""DP"" spot will be handed to players that look a lot more like Medina than like Villa. If the inevitable happens this year I wouldn't be surprised if Dome puts his money on Castellanos and Shradi. Again, this is someone who was on the coaching staff when some massive names were phased out in order to develop the future. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any NYCFC STATE OF THE CLUB wouldn't be complete without a stadium take, so here is mine. They're going to announce a done deal this winter. There's just too many irons in the fire, where there's smoke there's fire. This parking garage situation seems perfect, any of the 6 billion different revitalization projects going on in the Bronx and Queens seem perfect, and the fact that they did a solid for the state and made the Islanders hockey arena thing at least ""look"" competitive with a bid designed by an intern (the NYCFC bid didn't even have parking associated with it - total joke bid). 

&amp;#x200B;

Whatever reset there was after De Blasio took power needs to be addressed as he is also coming up on the end of his administration; I don't want the club to try to figure it out with a new administration. My feeling here is that they want something that will be special and something that can only be built once - this is likely a thirty-year decision so you don't want to fuck around and get something stupid. Something is gonna happen - there's simply too much money in it for everyone; they're gonna figure it out.

&amp;#x200B;

The club is playing the best and exciting soccer it has ever played. The reality is that we did not improve as much as our rivals did. It is the most exciting time to be an MLS fan with a rabid Cincinnati fan base coming, a revitalization of a sleeping giant in DC, LAFC pushing the standard of excellence in the west, and Atlanta making the old elite top 3 of NYCFC, Toronto, Red Bulls a top 4. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, it is this competition that will drive this club to new heights. I wish that in five years the MLS is at the level where NYCFC is getting invited not to CONCACAF Champs Leauge but to Copa Libertadores and we see our boys in blue play in the Bombanero, the Maracana, or the Estadio Monumental. I do not wish to be a Celtic team that wins the treble every year. 

&amp;#x200B;

It is these worthy foes that will make following this team the more special. From a facts perspective, I believe in the direction of the club because the base that they have built is incredibly strong with the best academy in the country (this is a fact not an opinion), a global scouting network, and leadership that believes in a progressive style of play. That's what makes me so hopeful about our future. That's why I stand here confident that the STATE OF THE CLUB is strong.

9xc9uf,26,2018-11-15,Burning out in CMH,WunderQueer,psychotherapy,https://www.reddit.com/r/psychotherapy/comments/9xc9uf/burning_out_in_cmh/,"Hi all, I could use some support from you today. I’m a masters level clinician 4 years post grad and waiting for my application for LMHC to be approved. Turned in the app in May; I finally asked the Board about the delay and got confirmation they’re massively behind in application reviews, and are working on catching up. So I wait. 

The issue is that I’ve been in CMH since day 1 of internship. Over the past 6 years (internship and after graduation), I’ve moved from group therapy/day treatment to program management of a TAY program to FFS individual therapy, all in the same agency. Loved aspects of all the jobs, and grateful for the experience. However, I’m cooked, and I’ve known this for several months, and I’ve had my exit strategy ready to go (There’s a private practice I’ll be joining once I’m licensed and get on insurance panels).  

Working with the sickest of the sick in community mental health has just totally and completely drained me. I’ve reduced hours and I’m working the bare minimum I need to in order to pay the bills - which still results in seeing 8+ clients per work day. The rate of compensation for masters level without LMHC is abysmal, especially given the energetic output required for acute/chronically ill clients. I love my clients, my autonomy, my cozy office... but I’m so very burnt out, and so ready for the next phase of my career. 

I’m stuck here until my LMHC arrives, which could still be a few months - I don’t even know yet if there are corrections I have to make to my application.  In any other job, I’d have left long ago, but there really isn’t much out there for masters level AND I’m theoretically on the verge of being licensed, so I don’t want to start something new in MH. Tempted to quit and work at Trader Joe’s for a few months just to regain my sanity! 

I need encouragement to keep going, that it’ll get better once I’m licensed, that I’m not a bad person for feeling like I can’t work with this population much longer even if I do like my clients. Just reading this subreddit has helped tremendously in learning that I’m not alone in feeling worn out from working in CMH. Thank you for that ❤️"
9xcbot,8,2018-11-15,"[M4FFFFF+] Overwatch on Glassdoor: “Internship went great. Good food, great boarding. Tracer gives head like a vacuum cleaner.”",SuckMyDPPenis,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/9xcbot/m4fffff_overwatch_on_glassdoor_internship_went/,"Of course, that’s not the review I actually left, but maybe if Hana begged a little harder I would have. I’m kind of getting ahead of myself, though, so let me explain what’s going on here.

Two years ago, when I was sixteen, I went to the museum with my little brother. The poor kid broke his wrist like a week prior and was cooped up inside the whole time while he ‘recovered.’ Frankly, I thought the whole thing was bullshit; he wasn’t torn up about the whole thing since it was his off hand, and within a day of getting the cast he was already flying around the house like a maniac, but Mom *insisted* that her little baby boy not risk it by going to school for a while. It wasn’t all fun and games, though. Like I said, he was forced to stay inside, and Mom practically butchered Timmy’s lessons when she tried to teach him to keep him caught up. Lucky for him, I went to the same school, and I saved my notebooks, so it wasn’t life or death for him.

Anyways, not the point. The point is I felt bad for him because of everything that was happening, and to make it up to him I brought him to the Overwatch Historical Museum. I half expected Mom to object, but of course she was *thrilled* that I was ‘spending time with him’ and ‘getting involved in his hobbies.’ I sort of just rolled my eyes at the time, the way she was gushing over it like it was some big deal, but I never realized just how much it would change my life.

If you’ve seen the security tapes that got released all over the news, you know what happened next. Lots of guns, lots of spandex. I did a lot of staring at butts on the side as a hormonal teenager, then I did some punching, the robbers fucked off and Tracer made Timmy’s day. I did a lot of bragging after. I thought that would be the highlight of my life, too; not many people get to say they saved the day by punching a Talon sniper in the gut. Of course, if I was right, the story would’ve ended right there. So, yeah, I was wrong. My highlight was about to get a whole lot highlight-ier.

Maybe it was luck, destiny, karma paying off or the butterfly effect in action, because I saw a whole lot more of Lena Oxton after that. She spoke at the school district, showed up at restaurants, I saw her in the park, and each time we recognized each other and spoke. Somewhere along the line we traded contact details, and chance encounters turned into planned ones. I learned that she was in state for a while on unofficial Overwatch business. She learned I was on the chess team at my local high school (riveting, I know). It didn’t take long for me to realize that this was what having a role model felt like. She was always there to listen, always eager to answer questions. It felt weird to have a peer that wasn’t a peer.

I guess at some point she began to feel a little differently, because on my eighteenth birthday, after all my plans for the day were exhausted, she sent me a text. In it, she apologized for calling so late, but she had a gift for me and needed me to come as soon as possible. I, of course, was only too happy to oblige, not realizing what the gift was. Yeah, this is going exactly where you think it is.

Lena mounted me like an animal. Perfect, perky tits, tomboy locks that made for perfect sex hair, and a bush so well trimmed you’d swear she took a clippers to it every night. We must’ve gone through two boxes of condoms, each one filled just a little less than the previous one as I mustered up everything in my balls for her— and when we ran out, we switched to anal. The whole time we were doing it, she talked about how she’d been waiting for my eighteenth birthday, how the way I carried myself made her buzz inside, how she was screaming my name for the past month as she fingered herself to this exact scenario. I, on the other hand, was too busy working her holes to talk.

The morning after was... well, surreal to say the least. I thought it was a dream, but that theory went out the window as quickly as it came, because when I tried to sit up another hundred and thirty pounds was keeping me down in a fancy hotel bed. Not that I was complaining; I just rolled over, held the woman as tightly as she held me, and went back to sleep. The next time I woke up, she was up too, eyes locked with mine and smiling like a devil with a soul to claim. I was too busy watching those eyes to notice her reaching under the pillow and pull out an envelope, labeled with the words: **URGENT. OVERWATCH INTERNSHIP DETAILS ENCLOSED.** I guess she noticed when I stopped looking at her and started looking at the envelope, because she only had one thing to say to that.

“There’s more where this came from, luv.”

- - -

**TL;DR:** In which an Overwatch agent gets frisky with a barely legal teenager and invites him to get frisky some more. At the Overwatch HQ. With other Overwatch agents.

The scene we’ll be playing will kick off a couple months after this prompt. Tracer’s just invited Brian (from the cinematic trailer) to serve an internship with Overwatch after he finishes his senior year, all expenses paid. He knows Lena’s ready to get down and dirty with him, but the British brunette’s been very vocal about her opinion on Brian back home, and a couple other agents want their fill of teenage dick— and if they don’t yet, all it takes is a little convincing. Luckily, Tracer is all too willing to share.

I’m typically completely limitless, but I’d like this roleplay to be a little more lighthearted. That being said, I’m more than willing to redefine what that means, so if you want to put a specific fetish into this, feel free to ask.

I’d like to put some focus on these particular fetishes.

**COSTUMES/COSPLAY:** ‘Tis the witching season! Could be one of the alternate skins, could be a new costume altogether. Who doesn’t want to see Mercy in a ‘sexy nurse’ costume?

**IMPREG:** Everyone’s a consenting adult with a lot of money. No reason Brian can’t leave everyone with a bundle of joy in their bellies!

**WATERSPORTS:** Urine’s just hot. Shower in it, pour yourself a glass, or just drink straight from the tap; that golden glory is just *divine.*

**FUTA/TRAP:** I don’t mind if certain heroes are packing beneath their suits. D.Va’s a trap, Mei’s a futa, change my mind.

Of course, four fetishes doesn’t nearly encompass my list. I’m also into BDSM, latex, drugs, consensual abuse, pet play, toys, tattoos, piercings, exhibitionism, and foodplay. But again, that doesn’t cover everything. Certain fetishes may apply to certain heroes.

I can’t wait to see those orange envelopes, guys. Don’t disappoint me!

I intended to use this card for only small recurring purchases (utilization under 30%) to build up my credit. I make ~$30,000 a year from an internship and a seasonal job, and have been an authorized user on my parents credit card for over 2 years now. I have no loans of any kind or anything else that I know of that would affect my credit. As far as I know my parents have fairly good credit although I know that they do carry a balance on their card. After approval, I received a $1500 credit limit. 

When I got my card, I checked my credit on Chase’s app, and it was ~730. After using it for 2 months as planned, I noticed that it went down to ~715. I looked into the details of my credit report and noticed that it states I have ~$30,000 in current balances, 92% utilization, and a 27 year depth of credit. Clearly this is not from me as I had just opened my first credit card account. There is nothing that would lead me to believe I’m a victim of identity theft, and the credit report states that only 1 account was opened in the last year as expected.

I asked my father about this and he said that I’m most likely pulling in his credit since I’m an AU on his card. When I was applying for my card, being able to pull in his credit helped me get approved. But now that I’ve been approved, it seems like being an AU is hurting me, since it’s impossible to keep my utilization low when it’s combining his with mine.

What do you guys think I should do, should I ask to remove myself from being an AU on his card to help build up my own credit and remove any kind of ‘bad credit’ he might have from my report? And if I do that, will my credit report balance/utilization/etc go back to their normal amounts considering just my own accounts or will his credit still he pulled into mine?

I’m still new to all this, I appreciate your help. Thanks!"

It works miracles for my anxiety, however, it takes a toll on me when it comes to my levels of energy, and this chronic lower level of energy, or chronic fatigue, has been troubling me a great deal because I go to university, I have an internship and also I have to go for a run 3 or 4 times a week to stay thin.

&amp;#x200B;

At first, sleeping got harder and also my sleep lost quality so I started taking Clonazepam to have deeper sleep. In spite of that, I'm still having this chronic fatigue/constant lower level of energy and when you have to study, work and exercise, having low energy because a burden.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm wondering how has anybody else dealt with this situation. Is there some sort of standard thing to do/take in order to keep high levels of energy? Here are the things I have tried:

&amp;#x200B;

1) Take caffeine pills. I had the idea of taking 100mg caffeine as soon as I woke up to have higher energy throughout the day, but then I have a harder time sleeping at night and need to take more Clonazepam, then I wake up sleepier, then need to take more caffeine, and this stupid vicious cycle goes on. So I stopped with the caffeine pills.

&amp;#x200B;

2) Sleep more. I already need a a little over 8h of sleep per day. If I sleep more to compensate for lower energy, I'll end up sleeping like 11 hours a day and that's just impractical, so I need another solution.

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone has suggestions on how to deal with this problem, I'm very much listening. I imagine there must be (legal) substances that have that effect of giving you energy without messing with your sleep.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance.

Tonberries traumatized me in my youth.  I first encountered them in FFVI (FFIII US at the time...) and they were called pugs.  As you all know, Gau's ability, rage, requires finding enemies on the Veldt, leaping so he'd leave your party, go about looking for random encounters hoping Gau would be there, avoid hurting him during that battle (also have an empty spot in you party and not be in a back or pincer attack), and only then do you get his rage for the monsters you encountered in the battles he left and when he returned.  Well, you can encounter tonberry/pug in the Veldt so naturally I tried to get it.  Unbeknownst to me, Squaresoft decided to nerf the US version of the game a bit and you can't get Tonberry/Pug or Protoarmor.  

Do you have any fucking idea how many hours I spent trying to get those two rages?  I was a kid in high school so my precious time was limited.  Don't they know I had much better things to do with my time like avoiding going to parties (it's still avoiding if you weren't invited, right?) or deriving a formula for pi (just because).  I know you're all so anxious to find out what my approach was: I used limits and the assumption that an infinitely sided polygon's circumference would asymptotically approach the circumference of a circle.  I know what you're thinking: how did Testmonkeyalpha fend off all the ladies  in high school.  Best I can tell, they were just too intimidated with how [cool I was](https://frinkiac.com/video/S05E18/bDIcryEgF_c09_awcaSFJCNPNm0=.gif).  

I now look forward to similar levels of trauma from using all 480 of my lapis and all 5 of my tickets and somehow coming up short getting a Beryl.  I'd run the numbers but obviously I have no affinity for math.  

Let's SIFT through this week's GLEX loot!  

*****  
##Wave Battle Event Loot  

**Torn Dress**  
[clothes]: 12 ATK, 30 DEF, boost (100%) petrify resist.  

12 ATK isn't anything special but it's also good enough for newer players and those that don't TMR farm.  Ignoring rainbow S/TMRs and limited gear, the only better flat ATK gear is Training Clothes (Goken's TMR) with 20 ATK but limited to males only.  Looking at limited gear we also have Guide Clothes at 14 ATk which are limited to females.  For rainbows, we have Hyoh's at 28 ATK, Jensen's (limited) at 35 ATK and Luneth's STMR at 45.  

For units that can wear light armor they have better ATK options with Cloud's Uniform and Sephiroth's Longcoat (both limited ant 15 ATK) and Monster Breastplate (Lawrence 3 star TMR) also at 12 ATK.  

Heavy armor usually isn't the first option for ATK (especially with a lot of the newer conditional TMRs requiring clothes) but you have a couple trial options (Demon Mail+ at 18 ATK and Iron Colossus at 15 ATK), and STMRs from the rainbow Veritases (Flame @ 38 ATK, Dark @ 34 ATK, and Light at 30 ATK).  

The DEF is respectable but not high enough to be excited about (for when trials shift to the point where cover + provoke tanks aren't enough anymore).  The petrify resist is the real reason you'll want to keep one of these around.  As it gets harder to gear for damage, you may not be able to rely on a ribbon or equivalent and we're long since past the point where active buffs for status ailment resists are 100% dependable (due to pre-emptive attacks with status ailments).  

**Metal Earrings**  
[accessory]: 18 ATK, 3 DEF, enables Sharp Metal -&gt; boosts ATK (20%) when equipped with a katana, Ellesperis only.  

A good option for new players that got Ellesperis but not particularly useful for someone with plenty of ATK gear.  Plenty of ""free"" accessories with higher ATK from trials (Omega Medal @ 35 ATK, Bomb Engagement Ring @ 30 ATK, Ifrit's Claw @ 30 ATK.  The list of event gear and non-rainbow TMRs are so long I won't list them all here.  

Looking at the passive for Ellesperis, that 20% will give a fully leveled and potted Ellesperis 53 ATK, so assuming 300% TDH (she gets 250% just from reaching level 120 and equipping her TMR...) that's another 72 ATK for a total of 125 ATK from this accessory.  A 30 ATK comes up a tad short at 120 but that's close enough to not really matter.  Needless to say anything higher beats this handily.  FYI - if you don't have any DH/TDH gear at all, pick up doublehand from the MK event ending today.  That's all you'll need to cap her eqATK.  

Basically, this is only good if you have an immediate use for it.  

**Eternal Flame**  
[accessory]:  3 DEF, 3 SPR, +15% DEF, enables Flame of Vitality -&gt; +15% HP, Beryl only  

This should give similar phys eHP to Arsha's Talisman (+20% HP, +10% DEF, +10% SPR) but the latter is better thanks to the SPR boost too (and not restricted to one unit).  That said, if you have Beryl, this is great item until you can farm out something better.  

**Ruined Shield**  
[light shield]: 25 DEF, 15 SPR, +15% dark resist  

Looking at all shields, this lags behind Demon Shield (key reward, 43 DEF, +50% dark resist, +5% phys evade), Hero's Shield (trial reward, 48 DEF, +20% resist all elements), and Impervious Shield (trial, 50 DEF/SPR, +20% all elements) but those are all heavy shields.  The only light shield with dark resist is Ramza's STMR (60 DEF/SPR, +15% HP, +20% all elements).  Looking at JP, the only other shield with dark resist comes from the Bravely Default event which we might not get.  Either way it is also a heavy shield so not 100% comparable to this one.  

As the only light shield with dark resist that is easily accessible, you should get this and keep it for the day darkness consumes us all.  

**Katana Proficiency**  
[materia]:  Boost ATK (20%) when equipped with a katana  

Low stat boosts with conditions is terrible.  Newbie gear only.  

**Spiritual Proficiency**  
[materia]:  Boost SPR (20%) when equipped with a robe  

Unlike the katana materia, the vast majority of units that need SPR also use robes so the gear condition isn't that big of a deal.  The real problem with this is that the units that can really utilize SPR often don't need to stack it that high.  Magic tanks (when taking non-elemental damage) will prefer HP to handle the physical attacks thrown their way (or better yet a mix of HP with SPR and/or DEF).  The good healers often need utility or survival stats rather than raw SPR.  Bards definitely want SPR so this is worth considering if you rely on bards.  

SPR is one of the more neglected stats (then again EVERYTHING is neglected compared to ATK) but 20% or better isn't too hard to come by.  So check your inventory to decide if this is a good item for you (it probably isn't).  

*****  

##(S)TMRs  

**Beryl's TMR**  
Light's Vengeance  
[materia]: +30% MAG/SPR, +20% HP  

Pretty good tank gear with the SPR and HP combo.  A Rain's TMR is better with 10% more SPR and Crowe's is better with 10% more HP.  But pretty much every materia with similar or better HP and SPR can't be stacked so you'd want to consider getting this anyway even if you don't use Beryl.  

The MAG/SPR is a nice combo if you enjoy using summoner abilities or build units like Rem for both stats.  

Overall, I'd say this is a solid TMR, but nothing worth pulling specifically for (Beryl on the other hand...)  

**Beryl's STMR**  
Fallen Angle (acute name for this STMR)  
[dagger]: 10 ATK, 142 MAG, 142 SPR, +40% light/dark resist, Sines of the Father -&gt; Beryl only, +50% eqMAG when single wielding any weapon (technically the skill would work for any weapon but it is on this weapon so it only works for this weapon.  Not good for my OCD...).  

Obviously awesome juice for Beryl.  Rem would love this but would probably get stabbed in the eye trying to take it away.  Summoners would love it too but I think the real solution here is getting a tonberry esper so Beryl can keep the dagger.  

If you manage to convince Beryl to lend it to another unit, that light and dark resist is just amazing to have on a weapon.  We'll soon be encountering trials where we need huge elemental resists on multiple units.

**Ellesperis' TMR**  
Onimaru  
[katana]:  140 ATK, 30 SPR  

So are they just randomly tossing SPR on gear these days?  It's not like SPR plays a major role in her kit.  If you happen to have Sephiroth's TMR, fuck you.  I still don't have him.  Also, that katana will be better for every katana wielding unit other than Ellesperis (unless they happen to absolutely need that absolutely amazing 30 SPR).  Sasuke's Katana only trails a little behind at 130 ATK (anywhere from 10 to 40 ATK less depending on TDW/TDH bonuses) but it can potentially free up an equipment slot if you are trying to DW and your unit doesn't have innate DW (if you're in that position I hope you're new because if you aren't then you probably have terrible luck pulling units).  Murasame+ is a relatively distant second for ""free"" gear at only 111 ATK (and 14 MAG to make Jiraiya cry like the little bitch he is).  

Basically, get this if you can get Ellesperis to 7 star.  Not really a wise TMR investment otherwise.  

**Ellesperis' STMR**  
Vampyrism  
[materia]:  +40% ATK when equipped with clothes, +40% ATK when equipped with a katana, boost damage (25%) from physical and hybrid attacks when fighting humans or demons  

Oooohhh.... +80% ATK!  Oh, katana.  Wake me when Akstar or Sephiroth's enhancements arrives (so I can cry that I have neither).  Barring the somewhat rarer use of katanas these days due to a certain ""mysterious"" character that is finally starting to become rarer in my friend list, this is still a solid materia when fighting humans or demons as long as you aren't hitting the killer cap.

*****  

I'm using this section to be 100% serious for once.  

My cousin recently had a heart attack and open heart surgery.  He is expected to make a full recovery (as much as a person with bypass surgery can) but this has been weighing heavily on my mind the past dozen or so days.  This has me reflecting on my own health which makes it difficult to do these SIFT posts (it's hard to try to be humorous with my current mental state).  

I don't plan to stop playing FFBE or writing these gear reviews but I might just outright skip writing up a couple events or make them pretty barebones (I got a few events partially written up already) until I can work through this.  

Someone not too long ago asked me if I had a Patreon or something.  Getting paid for a hobby isn't my style (no offense to others that do) but if you want to thank me for these writing up these posts, please do something to take care of yourself and let me know in the comments.

9xd3xo,1,2018-11-15,I [22F] am getting constantly stared at by guy [2?M] at work who I don't even know,Ancient_Shock,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9xd3xo/i_22f_am_getting_constantly_stared_at_by_guy_2m/,"I started to work in a big exciting company 2 months ago and I love it. Sadly there is one guy who is really annoying me. I believe he started a few weeks after me and is probably an intern. All I know is that he's French and he's in another department but one my department frequently comes in contact with/has meetings together.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically I started noticing that there was this guy who would just constantly stare at me whenever we were in the same room due to team events/meetings/whatever. He has never attempted to contact me in any way and doesn't even really come close to me. But he stares and there's no mistaking it. When I meet his gaze he instantly looks away like he's shy but then stares again the second I look somewhere else. Idk if he has a crush on me from afar or whatever but it's really getting on my nerves. I feel constantly watched whenever he's somewhere around (because I am). But I feel like I can't really walk up to him and be like 'hey dude stop staring at me k'. I don't even know the guy's name.

&amp;#x200B;

Do I just hope his internship ends soon?

Where have all the tentacles gone  
And where're the elder gods?  
Where're the experiments with genetic mods?  
  
Isn't there a monster with an intense drive to breed?  
Late at night I fap and I nap  
And I dream of what I need...  
  
[hit-it.gif]  
  
I need some hentai!  
I'm holding out 'til a tentacle hentai's in sight.  
It's gotta be long  
And it's gotta be hot  
And it's budget better not be too tight.  
A tentacle hentai!  
I want a slime with a sexy elf wife.  
Or a trainer's mom  
And some pokemon  
And she's having the time of her life!  
Time of her life...  
  
Somewhere after midnight  
In my wildest fantasy  
Somewhere just beyond my reach  
There's a studio animating each scene.  
Lemmy is there posing and fucking the interns  
They're working on the art piece for which my desire burns!  
  
I need that hentai!  
One with an eldritch horror and a cult full of girls  
And they're in high school  
And standing by the pool  
Initiating the new girl tonight.  
A tentacle hentai!  
With vines that feed off of wet human sex  
Or a witch still in school  
Lying in her own grool  
As her extra credit attacks.  
I dream of hentai!  
I pray that ZONE-sama gets funded each night.  
  
Maybe a crowd-funding campaign scheme  
To build a perfect hentai team  
Could end up producing something of quality?  
In the air held up for all to see  
Characters we've invested in  
Eyes roll back, limbs go slack, as they're cumming again.  
  
I need more hentai!  
A brand new hentai for a brand new day.  
With more orgasms than  
The palm of your hand  
And more pussy than 80's Broadway.  
More tentacle hentai!  
One with a yuri succubus queen.  
Or a mad scientist  
And her robotic tryst  
That halfway through starts malfunctioning.  
I need that hentai!  
I need to watch her start to realize  
That something is wrong;  
Her invention's too strong  
And it's gonna be a really long night.  
Tentacle hentai!  
Forced orgasms for hours until they pass out.  
Clothes tearing away  
As appendages play  
Can't remember what the plot's about.  
We need new hentai!

9xe1t7,60,2018-11-15,F4M - Showering with my Intern,Gullible_Individual,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/9xe1t7/f4m_showering_with_my_intern/,"Since becoming a junior executive my work/life balance has become ever more challenging. With the long office hours, regular travelling and an on-duty phone I’m never truly switched off. All my past hobbies, friends and relationships, even sexual ones, have become a forgotten footnote of my personal history.

Time management has become a finely tuned art form. Instead of shopping for groceries they are delivered to my door at a scheduled time; instead of cleaning my own home, I’ve hired a maid; and instead of post office gym sessions I get my exercise cycling to and from work. This last sacrifice comes with a bonus at work shower, lest I stink out my meetings with clients.

Today my hectic schedule is no different with a client meeting at 8am. Yet before I’ve even reached the office, my entire schedule is blown like the rear tire of my $2,000 road bike. After a quick repair at the side of the road I manage to get work at 7:50. I slide my bike into the stand without securing the chain and quickly make my way to the staff showers.

To my dismay each of the private stalls are fully in use. I pace back and forwards for a few seconds waiting for one of the culprits to hurry out the shower. The clock on the locker room wall tells me its 7 minutes to the hour. This meeting was with our most important and least understanding client.

With the bold decisiveness which had elevated me to my lofty position I poked my head into the nearest of the stalls. A slender, young and firm derriere stared back at me. I traced the slightly fluffy cheeks upward, over a very slim waist and broad wide shoulders before recognizing the short hazelnut hair of the young office intern. Unwavering I dropped the hanging towel from around by person and stepped into the shower behind the young man.

His torso swivelled in surprise as I stepped close behind him in the shower. My hand against his boyish waist prevented him from fully turning. Instead he could only swivel his neck to see my face over his shoulder. Nothing more, nothing less.

“I’m running late for a very important meeting” I whispered in his ear. “I won’t be more than a few moments. You just keep facing towards the wall and I’ll be out before you know it.”

The aghast nod of assent was enough of an approval for me and I edged him closer to the wall so I could drench myself in the warm stream. Quickly I soaked my skin, washing the sweat and roadside dirt from my skin with the young man’s own shower gel.

Throughout my companion was deathly silent and frozen stiff. I whispered a thousand soft apologies into his ear to make him feel at ease. In an attempt to share the facet we were perilously close.

Continually his firm little buttocks pressed against my groin and my soft soapy breasts squished against his swimmers back. There was no doubt he could feel the sharp excitement within my nipples.

The longer I stayed the longer I considered the young man. His body was so young, so fresh. I was little past 30 myself yet I’d never been with someone so young, at least not since I was so myself. He was a perfect young specimen and I was curious just how experienced this man-boy was.

Time was getting away from me however and I sadly must go. A devilish idea came into my head just before retreating.

I slid my arm around the minuscule, yet iron waist of the youth and whispered one last time in his ear.

“Shall we say, 7:30 tomorrow?”

I asked before I licked the lobe of his ear and nibbled gently between my front teeth. I then stretched for his shower gel once more, pressing firmly against him as i did so, and then placed the bottle in his hand.

“Enjoy the rest of your shower! Take all the time you need.”

________________________________________

Hi all,

Please take the time to respond with a continuation of the prompt. First to finish is not an admirable quality for us girls. To help you along below are some ideas of how you could continue:

•	Write about you and your background. i.e. company and/or sexual.

•	Write this prompt so far from your perspective.

•	Write about the rest of your shower thinking of me.

•	Write about the remainder of the day in the office.

•	Write about the anticipation for tomorrow.

None of the above need to be followed and creativity is encouraged. Just trying to give you an idea of what I'm looking for.

Hope to hear from you soon! xoxo

How do I even begin to get a IT support/Helpdesk/first-line support job it seems even entry level jobs are asking for atleast a year of experience?

Stuck in the experience catch 22 but even worse as it seems once you've graduated your trapped.

9xeqp1,2,2018-11-15,Am I asexual or do I have a problem?,Unusual_Table,asexuality,https://www.reddit.com/r/asexuality/comments/9xeqp1/am_i_asexual_or_do_i_have_a_problem/,"Hi there. I feel like there were whispers about this reddit place in college but I just recently found out it was a website. Who knew! Moving on...

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 25 years old, female, African American, raised Baptist, but ended up being more of a conservative Agnostic person who enjoys Christmas, Easter, and anything that involves family/friend together time and food. Growing up, sexuality was never really a topic of conversation amongst my friends or family. At home we focused on goals and at school we focused on common interests. It never occurred to me to do things like go on dates. I never had crushes on people. Some in my wider social circle had boyfriends in high school but I only ever really heard about them when they announced they had a boyfriend and when they announced that they no longer had a boyfriend. It was an all girls school so I rarely saw the boys in question. I was informed in the years following high school that back then there really was a lot of drama surrounding sex and romance but I struck people as odd so no one ever bothered to include me in those conversations. The only time sexuality was ever discussed in my house was one time my parents approached me saying that I might be getting ideas that I am lesbian but that I'd be wise to not entertain such inclinations or else I'd have a hard life. 

&amp;#x200B;

In college I learned that not only is it common for people to have sex before they are married but that women have the ability to masturbate and enjoy having sex. I learned this through a TV show playing in the common room one day where the main character ruined a custom dildo by putting it in the dish washer. As far as women enjoying sex, in sex-ed it was talked about like... boys get erections and they get rid of it by masturbating or having sex. In order to have sex with a man you lay down, provide a condom, and wait until the erection goes away. I assumed that erections were bad and sex made them go away for longer periods of time so in that way sex was good. Any of this being an enjoyable activity never came up. My only run in with descriptive erotic content up to this point was a wrong turn taken on the internet when I was in middle school regarding an anime I liked at the time. It was a fanmade story where a male character forced himself on a female character. Lots of blood was involved but at the end of sexual activity the woman accepted him as a lover. I didn't know what stuff like consent was back then but it served as my only example of how sex typically worked all the way through adolescence. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think the main reason my friends and family never bothered talking to me about sex is because I never liked physical contact. I'd always shrink away when family tried to hug or kiss me but only felt like I was allowed to verbally tell them not to once I turned 16 and even then it's considered a rude thing to do. At school people found my reactions funny so they'd sneak up behind me and hug me. Physical contact doesn't hurt me but it just feels extraordinarily wrong or invasive. Like if water sprung from the ground and vanished up into the sky that is just incorrect. It shouldn't happen. I don't know how to interpret touch and the sensation of it just feels so wrong that when prolonged it's just scary. To this day I compensate with layers. I leave as little of my skin exposed as possible. In school I favored boys clothes because they were less form fitting creating more of a buffer. I also was a fan of having functioning pockets. 

&amp;#x200B;

It was also in college when people who weren't my family began to call me pretty however my experiences with people who were actually interested in me left bad impressions. The first was at an internship. He was nice to me and encouraged me to talk about my interests. I have a pretty narrow range of interests and obsess over them quite a bit so it's rare someone wants me to talk more than I already do about them. Then one day he approaches me when I'm in a supply closet asking me if I was a virgin, got way too close and said things that weren't right. After I realized what was happening I rejected him. Next thing I know he's spread rumors about me to everyone we worked with. The second was someone who approached me at a party. We talked for about ten minutes about soccer since we found out we both played soccer. He asked for my number out of the blue and when I wouldn't give it to him he got really angry talking about how I was leading him on and wasting his time. He starts grabbing my face, touching me all over, grinding on me at which point I just go into complete meltdown mode.

&amp;#x200B;

After that I avoided people altogether for a little bit. I didn't want to experience even accidental physical contact. Despite never having developed an interest in dating at that point I was already in my twenties and started to worry about how I could maintain a marriage like this because I thought getting married was mandatory. That was three years ago. I've still never had a crush, never been on a date, never had the urge to pleasure myself. I'm repulsed by the sight of my own skin. I'm terrified whenever someone calls me pretty. I still love talking about goals and common interests. I love talking to people I work with about new ideas and things we'd like to accomplish in our lives. I love getting updates from my friends about their life journey. The hormones I thought would hit me when I was younger still haven't come. I tend to habitually avoid men. Having a life partner seems like an abstract concept. Sure I hope to maintain my friendships and I'm sure I'll meet more interesting people along the way but... I don't think I'm attracted to men. I don't think I'm attracted to women either. Is it possible I could be asexual or is there something wrong with me?"
9xexbw,38,2018-11-15,Brother Wastes Bro-Hun's Time (Long),13707892,antiMLM,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiMLM/comments/9xexbw/brother_wastes_brohuns_time_long/,"My baby brother is a freshman in college and killing it. He's working really hard right now to get a good summer internship so he can start building his resume and network. A few weeks ago, he called me really excited because he met a guy at Starbucks who worked for a well-known employer in the area. This guy said my brother would be a really good candidate for the summer internship program. For context, the guy was an account executive (salesperson, but whatevs) for a reputable local company that I personally have friends at. I looked him up, and sure enough, he's been with the company for five years. Seems legit. Brother promptly schedules a coffee meetup with the guy for a few days later. I promptly forgot about it until brother Facetimed me last night and told me what happened.

He showed up to this coffee meeting dressed super nicely and very excited. It was an hour meeting where they guy gave him a book and two DVD's. (From my brother, ""I don't even have a DVD player!"") All of a sudden, this internship was an ""offshoot"" of his really reputable primary company and the pay was ""whatever you want it to be!"" Brother is a smart kid, so he directly asks the guy if this is an MLM or some sort of network marketing. The guy adamantly denies that it has anything to do with it. ""It's a privately owned company, so you've probably never heard of it before."" And he gives some generic marketing group name that returns no Google results. My brother leaves knowing that it's some sort of scam, but he's curious as to which particular scam it is since it's not MLM. Since he's a hungry and curious college student, he accepts the dude's invite to attend an info session with the CEO that will include dinner. 

Spoiler alert, there was no dinner at this event unless you eat popcorn, chips, and Sierra Mist for dinner. 

The info session is at a small local event space and there are about twenty people there, all accompanied by a ""mentor."" Apparently this random Starbucks guy is now my brother's mentor. An older dude in a suit stands up and starts giving the presentation. He's the CEO of this vague marketing group.  Third slide in: AMWAY. My brother dramatically closes his notebook and begins packing up his bag, to which his ""mentor"" asks if something is wrong. Brother is pissed. Proceeds to explain how the guy lied to him about this being an MLM. 

""Oh, I didn't lie to you. This MLM is \*different\*."" To which brother aptly responds, ""AMWAY IS THE ORIGINAL MLM!"" He is promptly ushered into a side conference room with his mentor and some other head honcho Amway dude where the pitch is laid on him heavily. You know how it goes, ""You could make $100k every month! Isn't that something you want? Don't you think you should just give it a chance? See how it's working for us?"" I'll let you guys guess what brother's sarcastic response to that was. He left shortly after, much to the chagrin of his mentor.

Next day, he gets a text from the mentor (this is my favorite part).

""Hey, sorry our company wasn't the right fit for you. Can you mail the book and DVD's back to me?""

First of all, what the hell. Second of all, no. 

After going back and forth several times, brother finally says that he'll be at the same Starbucks they met at on Friday between 3 and 5.  The guy could meet him there to get the materials back. 

""But what if I'm not able to make it?"" Bro-hun asks.

""Then I will deposit the books in the trash can at the front door for you to pick up later."" 

No response back, unfortunately. 

Brother was most disappointed that he thought he was getting an interesting scam to troll and just ended up being with a pathetic Amway-Bro instead. And he didn't even get a good dinner out of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; Brother knew guy was trying to scam him, found out it was Amway and was very disappointed.

9xfei6,4,2018-11-15,Advice Needed: Should I Go Back to School for Professional Writing/Editing?,supermario3868,writing,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/9xfei6/advice_needed_should_i_go_back_to_school_for/,"Hey everyone! 

Like most of you here, I've loved to read and write since I was little. When I started college, I initially became a journalism major because I wanted to be a reporter and travel the world. I'm the first to admit, though, that I let fear of failure get me down and I ended up switching majors. I was told that print journalism (what I wanted to pursue specifically) was dying out and that I'd be better suited in more of a communications field. So I switched my major to public relations, and that decision has ultimately put me in the position I'm in now. I'll explain a bit more.

Throughout college I had a job writing for a honeymoon registry company - just basic research and copy work but I loved it and I got to work from home. Then when I started looking for internships, I began writing blog entries, social media content, and press releases for a small business I worked for. All of this led me to get an internship in internal communications with a company in my hometown, and while that job let me write a lot of copy, I didn't enjoy it nearly as much. I felt like something was missing.

Well, after my internship at hometown company was up, I began to panic because I was having the hardest time finding another job. Apparently, public relations is a very competitive field. Anyways, when the company offered me a job to stick around with them and do proposals writing, I was elated and accepted almost immediately. I figured I'd had enough experience with writing (almost 3 years tucked under my belt by that point) and I liked that company, so why not accept?

That's when I learned that proposal and technical writing is a *completely* different ballgame. I was awful at it; I was absolutely abysmal at all the tasks handed to me. I managed to keep floating for about a year until I found another job working as a Marketing Associate at another company that we will call ""OC"" for ""oh crap"". I left on good terms with hometown company and started my job at OC shortly after.

At first it was amazing - I was writing newsletters, blogs, newswires, articles, the works; I was even put in charge of managing and scheduling the company's social media. It was demanding work but I really loved everything I did. Everything changed, however, when people began to leave OC and new people were hired.

To make an extremely long story short, I found myself discussing legal options with a lawyer because OC was doing some very shady things and the culture became toxic. After going through my options I realized that OC was preparing to fire me and I essentially couldn't argue with them because state laws basically give all employers the right to fire at will. For my sanity and to ensure that I wouldn't be jobless and broke, I found *another* job, this time as an admin for a company in the city. Miraculously, I was offered the job within three days of applying, and I put in my two weeks at OC. 

That was almost two years ago, and while I enjoy working with the people I'm with here at CC (current company), I feel like I've missed out on my calling. I loved my writing and editing jobs that I had, and I think I've fallen off the path I'm supposed to take. Now I'm looking at all my options and trying to decide what to do. I'm looking at job postings and it looks like I'd probably have to take entry level jobs because I'm so out of touch with what's current. I think I'd need to start from scratch. Do I have enough experience to try and get a new job on my own, back in the writing/editing field, or should I go get my M.A. so I can be caught up with what's current in the industry and make connections with professors and other students? This would be a huge investment and I just want to know if I'm doing the right thing. I really don't want to mess up yet again and prolong my future any more than I already have.

Tl;dr I messed up my career and want to try again after being out of the writing/editing industry for 2 years. Should I try and apply to jobs or get a fresh start by going back to school?"
9xfpee,1,2018-11-15,CNN's Lawsuit Against President Trump Will Fail.,gonzopod12,u_gonzopod12,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_gonzopod12/comments/9xfpee/cnns_lawsuit_against_president_trump_will_fail/,"**by**

**Julio Gonzalez, M.D., J.D.**

On November 7, 2018, a testy [exchange](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8rXqqLPbo4) took place between the President of the United States and an arrogant, disruptive CNN reporter, named Jim Acosta.  The exchange took place when Acosta asked a question of President Trump during a White House Press Conference.  Acosta asked, after being recognized by the President, why he used the term ""invasion"" when referring to the actions of Central American migrants making their way to the United States.  

The President curtly responded that he used the word invasion because that's what he thought it was.  

Acosta then continued by lecturing the President on the definition of an invasion, to which the President responded by maintaining his position and observing that Acosta and he obviously had a difference of opinion.

Nevertheless, Acosta persisted, reiterating the same answered question of why the President insisted on using the term ""invasion"" and continuing with his dissertation holding that it was not an invasion.  

By this point, the President was done with this exchange and told Acosta as much while actually uttering the words, ""Enough,"" and ""Put down the mic.""

Acosta neither stopped nor put down the microphone, and when a White House intern reached to retrieve it, Acosta tugged back against her, at one point pushing back against her left arm with his forearm.  

Later that day, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders tweeted the decision to have Acosta's hard pass revoked. And later, when Acosta went to retrieve a hard pass, as he normally does, the Secret Service told him he would not be receiving one.

Shortly thereafter, the world ended, at least according to CNN.  

Members of the press have viewed the President's revocation of Acosta's pass as grossly intolerant, even oppressive.  They call the action an affront to Freedom of the Press, to Freedom of Speech, and the Freedom to Due Process under the law.  They have also claimed that President Trump revoked Acosta's hard pass because Trump does not like Acosta.

The White House, on the other hand, views the action as falling well within its powers to address the unruly and disruptive behavior of an out of control journalist who refuses to follow directions and to cooperate with the President's attempt at conducting the fair and orderly proceedings of a press conference.  

With neither side blinking, the argument is now heading to the Federal District Court of the District of Columbia as CNN and Mr. Acosta have filed a [complaint](https://www.scribd.com/document/393131269/CNN-Complaint) against the President and others.  Of course, the White House has filed its [response](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5113299-Trump-CNN.html).  

The bottom line of the situation is this: neither Acosta nor CNN have the inherent right to attend a White House briefing nor to force their attendance upon the President of the United States.  In the meantime, the President has the *full*authority to engage any reporter he wishes and to conduct the White House Press Conference in whatever manner he desires. Neither CNN's nor Acosta's rights have been infringed, and neither the First Amendment right to Freedom of Speech nor Freedom of the Press may ever be construed to give a reporter, or anyone else for that matter, the right to force themselves into the White House for any purpose.  

Some argue that the conduct of the President runs contrary to convention.  Specifically, they cite other presidents who have had confrontations with correspondents like Sam Donaldson, Dan Rather, and Helen Thomas and have done so without revoking their passes.  This may be so, but neither of these reporters has refused to hand over the microphone when specifically told to do so.  They also cite tradition and decorum, but the argument can equally be lodged at Acosta regarding his conduct.

These arguments, although interesting, speak to public relations issues, statesmanship, and collegiality, and are largely immaterial because the argument before the court is purely a legal one, not a political one (at least in theory).

The legal arguments are more complex, but lead to the same fruitless conclusion.  We have already addressed the non-argument of the First Amendment.  But how about the Fifth Amendment and Due Process? 

Here, the plaintiffs rely on one case: *Sherill v. Knight*.  In that 1977 case decided in the Circuit Court for the District of Columbia, a reporter named Robert Sherrill was continuously denied access to the White House press conference by Secret Service.  When he inquired why, the Secret Service would respond with a vague excuse of presidential security.  

In reviewing the matter, the court [held](https://www.leagle.com/decision/1977693569f2d1241686) that the Secret Service owed Mr. Sherill some sort of due process.  From this, CNN argues, the White House has violated Acosta's due process rights.  

However, Acosta's circumstances are clearly distinguishable from those of *Sherrill*.  First, Acosta *was* given access, and he abused it. 

Second, even if one were going to make the argument of notice, the White House has met it.  The Supreme Court has held that in order for someone to demonstrate a breach of his or her due process rights, the plaintiff must demonstrate that he or she had an interest that was being infringed, that the government did not give him or her notice of the infringement, and that there was no opportunity to seek redress.  Crucial to the understanding of Acosta's due process rights is the concept laid out by the Court, that the sophistication/formality of the ""process"" is related to the degree of importance of the interest.  So, for example, if the government is removing your access to a specific parking space that you previously used, such an act involving a relatively minor interest would require a lower level of formality in procedures than if it was taking away your social security benefits.  

In Acosta's case, his interest in being able to continue to access the press conference is relatively insubstantial. For example, he can still exercise his First Amendment rights to free speech regardless of whether he attends. Similarly, for CNN, the White House lists 50 other CNN reporters with hard passes, so CNN isn't really dependent on Jim Acosta in continuing to cover the President.  Second, and most importantly to the court, because CNN has not fired him, Acosta has not lost a single dime in wages because of the decision. As a matter of fact, one could argue that his position as a journalist has actually improved!

Having established Acosta's less than monumental interest in accessing the White House, what about the procedures?  Well, he received notice when Sanders tweeted out the White House Press Office's decision to withdraw his pass and again when Secret Service told him upon his presentation to the White House for access. Then, he and CNN exercised their rights to redress when they wrote Sanders asking that the matter be rectified.  And they received a ruling on the redress when Sanders, in writing, responded in the negative.

Finally, consider all the things CNN is asking the court to do in order to satisfy Jim Acosta.  First, it is asking the court to create a new right; the right for a reporter to remain in the White House press corps once given access despite a presidential decision against it.  Second, it is asking the court to intrude into the President's authority on how to run a press briefing by limiting his ability to determine who does and who does not attend.  Third, CNN is asking the court to further muddy the separation of powers doctrine by intruding into another branch's purview and direct it on how it should perform its internal functions.  Although admittedly, the court has done so many times, such a move, in this case, would be particularly brazen.  And finally, it is being asked to disturb the comity between the branches to appease the misbehaviors of one arrogant, pathologically narcissistic journalist.  

Put simply, the destination to which CNN is asking the court travel is a number of bridges too far.  Even if CNN's lawsuit were to pass the scrutiny of some activist judge, such a ruling would surely fail either in appeal or to at Supreme Court where it would surely go.  

Either way, CNN's lawsuit will fail.  They're much better off reprimanding Acosta for his inappropriateness, like they should have done from the beginning, and drop this case before it finishes blowing up on them.

9xfqci,3,2018-11-15,Why might someone self-sabotage and fear success ?,Throwawayboss11,askpsychology,https://www.reddit.com/r/askpsychology/comments/9xfqci/why_might_someone_selfsabotage_and_fear_success/,"I'm interested in understanding why people who feel they have potential, sabotage themselves in the process of getting what they want to achieve. 

I was in a lecture today, and since people were preparing for a difficult exam and applying for internships we were all pretty stressed out and under pressure ,the professor decided to tell us a few stories about different people in his life who had potential but let stress and fear get in the way, usually I don't think about the stories we're told in class, but this one peaked my interest, due to it involving the psychology of people that want to succeed but sabotage themselves. He said that one of the people he knew was a biochemistry student who wanted to succeed in his work/field and be given more leadership opportunities in projects he was apparently one of the best/most organised students in that year group, he was good at managing himself, tutoring others occasionally, and even gave ideas to lecturers about changes people would like. However, as soon as he got a leadership position, he would be riddled with self doubt about his judgements,  thinking about everything that could go wrong, such as people trusting him and him letting them down, eventually he made mistakes he wouldn't usually make, spread out power that he should have had, and the team began to lose faith in him, despite him having the potential. 

The professor then went on to talk about one of his friends who he graduated with and how he was able to get a job at a good corporate company, which paid him well enough to live comfortably in the UK, however he struggled with his relationships; he wasn't too bad looking, could talk to most people, was funny and was interested in a breadth of things such as philosophy, eastern religions, and archery etc, he wouldn't have issues with dating, but once things got serious and showed potential, his mind would start playing negative scenarios on repeat, and thoughts such as  what if we get bored ?, what if they don't feel the same in a few years ?, what could end the relationship?, or what if they think I am someone I am not ? almost as if he would be stressed out about things that could go wrong, and this would cause him to bring those things into reality and do things that could ruin the relationship, which would then cut the relationship shorter than it had the potential to be. 

He then finished by telling us the story of his son ( who is a grown man by now, but was a teen in this story), and how he was a quiet but not shy young man, he would have no issues observable issues talking to other people, but would never really talk to them again or have a relationship with them, he would have friends, but most of the effort came from the side of the friends, he talked to his dad about this and it was the same pattern, he wouldn't necessarily stress out about talking to other people, but he would also think about how he could gain a few new friends only to lose them, or do something bad to them, so unconsciously he would do things to stop the relationships from getting to the point where they could let down, or stop the conflict. 

The professor said all of these people had a lot of potential to achieve the success they wanted, but it was something about their thinking and psychology, that made them fear the success, their fear caused them to sabotage themselves, sometimes in ways that they didn't even understand themselves, they allowed stress to get to them, despite having the abilities needed to achieve what they wanted, I understand the moral of the stories, but can anyone explain the root cause of this type of thinking ? and how it can be handled ?

9xg1ut,1,2018-11-15,Is it even possible to ask out someone in an office without being creepy?,stanceycivic,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/9xg1ut/is_it_even_possible_to_ask_out_someone_in_an/,"So I work in a pretty large building, I'd estimate 1,000 people work here. I only directly meet and really talk with people in my department. But this girl that works in HR, who I've only interacted with twice from this past summer with an intern I had, has me stuck. 

She is just crazy beautiful, and even though after a really bad instance dating a coworker a long time ago at another company and vowing I'd never do that again...I reconsider that hard when I see her walking in the halls. That said it's always at a distance. She sits in a totally different part of the building and normally if I see her its in the cafeteria at lunch and I just see her taking food back to her desk. 

Besides the fact that I just can't seem to ever find a scenario to meet women outside of work, I also can't see how I could do this either. It doesn't seem as bad to me, dating at work, if you are in different departments, but if you never have meetings with them. Don't know anyone mutual, etc, how do you even get to the point of asking them out without being a complete creep? I guess rules 1 and 2 apply but still. I can't imagine it going well if I just strolled up to her desk, tried to chat her up and ask her out. 

Is there any real way that I can do this? Is there a way to slowly engage with someone you have zero interaction with? If I do walk past her she is always giving new hires tours of the office so its not usually the best chance to try and strike up convo, it just never occurs. I've just never had someone cause my brain to just literally freeze when I saw them like she did. I immediately knew I had to try and talk to her and I've only been able to briefly introduce myself once and say a little ""hi how are you"" besides the occasional pass by smile. 

Looking internally, I guess posting this in itself is weird on my part, I just don't know how or if you even can, successfully approach someone in a large office for dating purposes without a mutual friend or working closely together. "

I'm a Danish student looking to be moving to Pristina during spring (February until mid-June) to do an internship and I've started looking for accommodation, something like a studio apartment that is. From searching online, it seems that the average price-range for studios is somewhere in between 150-300€ - is that right?

Thus, I turn to thy fellow redditors; where can I search for long-term accommodation in Prishtina? And how does the housing market work? Will I need a contract when it's only 4,5 months? And what neighbourhoods are the ones to aim for?

Anyways, I am extremely excited about getting to know Kosovo from the inside. So far, I've only met people who've had an amazing time while visiting your country.

Greetings from Denmark!"

She didn't get much sleep but has to go into work on. An important project for her job she is starting to move up the tanks at work and doesn't want to call in a screw that up. Kelly hops into the shower she needs to wake up. She drank a little and as the hot water is running over her very sexy body she thinks about the man she met and how good he fucked her in the ladies room with other woman in there. It was so fucking hot she came so hard and didn't get his name. Kelly had never let a man fuck her she didn't know for a couple of dates. This man made her wet as soon as she saw him and she made sure he used a condom.

The shower feels good as she is rubbing her big breast but she hears her alarm shit she is running late. She hops out dry's off and is so fucking horny. She puts on her sexy purple bra and matching panties they make her feel so fucking sexy when she wears them. Kelly is a very sexy woman, young is very beautiful and has a very hot sexy body. She slips on jeans that hug her sexy ass and a button blouse. Puts in a little make up which Kelly doesn't need and some perfume and she is out the door.

Kelly walks into the office and she sees Pete. The young intern working there for the summer. He is 19 and cute she ask him where is everyone he says he got a text and said it was only going to be us to. Kelly looks at her phone and finds the text. Shit she says I'm sorry Pete I didn't mean anything but this is an important project he says we can handle it. Kelly smiles and says ok.

Kelly way he's Pete take over and is very impressed his dominanting attitude has Kelly turned on and she feels her panties getting wet and her nipples starting to get hard. She undoes a couple of buttons on her blouse and hopes Pete notices her sexy big tits. During the rest of the time they are working Kelly is really flirting with Pete but he doesn't seem to be interested. Kelly's panties are soaked by the time Pete says last thing. 

Kelly says what's that I thought we just did it. Pete says nope and grabs Kelly kisses her and says what didn't you think I wouldn't notice how fucking sexy you was and how much you were flirting. Kelly says the way you acted you didn't seem to be. Who do you think called everyone and talked the boss into letting only me and you work on this. I noticed you the first day I started here.

That's why I wanted to gets this done now I have the rest of the day to enjoy your hot fucking body and his dominanting attitude is still there and he tells her to strip out if her clothes right fucking now. Kelly slips off her blouse nice and sexy revealing her favorite sexy purple bra. She start to remove it and he says not yet get your pants off Now I want to check out your hot ass. 

She unbuttons her jeans as she does she sees Pete rub his cock through his jeans. She slips off her come fuck me boots and slides her jeans down to reveal her sexy purple panties that are soaked from her very wet hot pussy. Pete says that's nice and walks over to her place his hands on her panty covered pussy and kisses her feeling the heat and wetness of her pussy.

He steps back after kissing her and tells Kelly to come over to him and suck his cock Now! He says and she walks to him and kneels in front of him. Pete looks at her and says it's not going to get out by itself. Kelly has never been treated like this but it's really turning her on. She takes his cock out and she starts to suck him. Yes that feels nice! She is really turned on and sucks him hard but then she thinks I am going to make this man do what I want not do what he wants.

She pulls his cock out of her mouth and he looks at her and says I didn't tell you to stop. Kelly stands up and says little boy I will tell you what to do and grabs his cock and squeezes she says do you understand. As she twist his cock he says Yes! What was that she says Yes Mistress! That's better she says. Kelly let's his cock go and she sits on the table she tells him to get crawl over to her and lick her pussy! Now it's not going to lick itself!

Pete gets down and crawls to her he pulls her panties down and off of her. They are soaked from her wet pussy and he sniffs them she smacks him on the face did I say you could sniff my panties? No mistress then lick my pussy like I said. Yes Mistress. 
Pete sticks his tongue on here bald hot pussy lips and taste her very sweet pussy. He kicks it deep and hard Kelly is guiding his tongue and she tells him he is a good slave boy for following directions. 

Now make me cum he starts to lick her clit and all of a sure he pushes a finger inside her ass and she SCREAMS Fuck! Yes ! Yes! I'm CUMMING as Kelly covers his face with her cum she goes limp she has never cummed so hard. Pete decides he is taking back over and slides his cock into her very wet very tight pussy. 

When Kelly comes to she feels her pussy getting fucked and it feels good. Pete's cock it nice and thick and it's going to make her cum she tells him she is going to cum. He says yes slut cum on my fucking cock them I'm going to fuck your tight little asshole. Kelly starts to cum and when he feels her pussy contract he pulls his cock out of her and pushes her legs farther up and pushes his cock into her ass. 

Kelly Scream's out in pleasure as he starts to fuck her ass she continues to cum and Pete just keeps fucking her when he is ready to cum he pulls out of her ass and shoves it into her hot mouth and empty his load into her mouth. Kelly is still CUMMING and swallows it all when he pulls out of her mouth he lets her stop CUMMING and then start to suck on her big sexy tits he tells her he wants her to cum again he sucks her nipples and bites them he spends 20 minutes on her tits and she starts to cum from it. She goes limp again when she wakes he is dressed.

Hi sexy he says to her as she awakes he smacks her ass and tells her to get dressed and if she would like he would be over tonight to fuck her again. She says yes ok see you then and he leaves. Kelly gets dressed and leaves her panty and bra off she just wants to get home and rest before he comes back over

9xga3a,6,2018-11-15,Technical Writing Options,merryroversrule,technicalwriting,https://www.reddit.com/r/technicalwriting/comments/9xga3a/technical_writing_options/,"Hi everyone! I am currently a second year university student (UK) studying computer science but the course isn’t great (I don’t particularly like programming, don’t ask why I chose CS).

I have been thinking, and seeing as I like writing reports etc, that I might want to be a technical writer (or something similar). Could anyone give me any ideas of how to get started please?  What should I start creating for a portfolio? Any companies, internships or apprenticeships I could try to get? I’m in the UK and I would be very grateful for any advice you can give. 

Cheers, Ryan. "

I'm currently still looking for internships still (I have two more phone/video interviews next week) and they gave me a deadline of the 26th of November. This is my only offer so far though, so I'd like anyone's advice who has interned there. "

9xh7l3,4,2018-11-15,For CS/ECE majors looking for embedded software experience,manystorms,uichicago,https://www.reddit.com/r/uichicago/comments/9xh7l3/for_csece_majors_looking_for_embedded_software/,"As a Qualcomm Accelerator alum, I have the ability to nominate 5 students to be considered for a Summer 2019 internship at Qualcomm. 

The internship will be focused on embedded software. If your nomination is chosen, Qualcomm will fly you to San Diego all expenses and hotel paid to participate in their conference and interview in person.  This usually occurs in January before the Spring semester begins. I went to this conference and thought it was pretty fun. It’s a little hail corporate but they treat you right, including a small cruise. 


Requirements:
CS/ECE majors

Above 3.0 GPA

Sophomore standing or that far from graduating

Some project experience - doesn’t have to be a previous internship. Student org projects count!

Not a requirement but participating in hackathons are a huge plus


Qualcomm includes housing expenses (two bedroom apartments) AND they pay pretty generously for an intern. Check out Glassdoor for an idea. 


Nominations close tomorrow. If you think you’re qualified, message me ASAP and we can coordinate how to forward your resume. "

9xii4x,1,2018-11-15,How do you find happiness?,FlyHiDipLo,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/9xii4x/how_do_you_find_happiness/,"This is a serious post so please be understanding. 

A little bit of background, I didn't grow up in a family that could pay for my education and was about turned down for every student loan I applied for - so in order to pay for school I had to work full time and go to school half time. 

I worked from 7-4 Monday through Friday and had school in the evenings and weekends. I always looked forward to graduation because I thought that would make me get the happiness. Anyways on my last year at school I quit work and started an internship for half the pay because I wanted the experience. That internship led me to an internship at a top ten firm, the firm needed people since the department is small; so I assumed that's why they hired me, but as an intern I basically did associate work, went to engagements and that wasn't a walk in the park because I had no idea what I was doing and received very poor guidance on how to complete a task, and I was required to work later and weekends. 

When I finally graduated I've been in school for over seven years and managed to get by with a GPA that was above a 3.0 but not stellar. I stayed with the firm when I received my offer and now about a year into everything I have done a year as an associate and a year as an intern acting as an associate. Now everyone says this is what I went to school to work for and I should be happy about it, but TBH I haven't felt it. I'm stressed every day, I get angry a lot, and have a deep feeling in me that maybe I was wrong and that I basically can never be happy about anything. I tried to go into another firm but because of the GPA I was told ""this is a competitive market..."" Which was my post a couple of weeks ago. 

TLDR: I can't get happy doing anything, and have lost hope. 

Can anyone provide guidance on what it is that I am doing wrong? What can I do to be happy? "
9xiiq1,2,2018-11-15,What can I do about my mother?,chickengodz,emotionalabuse,https://www.reddit.com/r/emotionalabuse/comments/9xiiq1/what_can_i_do_about_my_mother/,"I've had a rocky relationship with my mother for basically my entire life, leading to me moving in with my dad (they divorced when I was little) and almost going no-contact several times over the years. Since her most recent divorce three years ago, she reached out and wanted to ""mend things between us"". I was shocked but decided that if she had the balls to leave that sack of shit that maybe she had finally changed. Things have been...ok between us, but slowly I've been seeing her old self come back the more I talk to her.

This has come to a head five months ago when she helped me get an internship with the company she works for. Basically she just handed her boss my resume and I did the rest. But I have been working in the cubicle next to her this whole time, and since the first week I realized nothing has changed. She's nasty to people when shes in a bad mood, nothing is ever her fault, she brings up things from years ago and gets mad when I dont defend her perception of it. It's been small things, but they happen almost every single day. 

Last week, she went off on me for talking about my dad, when she had said months ago that she was fine hearing about him, and I finally decided I had had enough. I was going to confront her, and she was either going to listen to me or I was going to cut her out of my life. So after her outburst, I distanced myself from her. Normally I would go over and talk to her every morning, but I stopped, hoping she would take the hint that something was wrong. I knew that if I just confronted her and asked to talk, she would just claim that this came put of nowhere and I was just trying to cause problems. 

So the whole week I distance myself from her. I was pleasant when I talked to her, but I didnt talk to her much. Monday, when i didnt come over to tell her about my weekend, she confronted me, asking 'what's gotten into me lately'. So I tell her that I'd like to talk after work, as to not cause a scene.

When we finally sit down to talk, I let her know what I feel, that I'm always walking on eggshells around her because I'm never sure what going to set her off on me. That shes mean to people at work for no good reason. That she hasn't actually changed like she said she did. 

Oh boy, did that not go well. She went off on me, calling me childish for not confronting her myself, saying I had a shitty attitude for talking to her that way, calling me a robot for sitting there calmly and trying to talk to her like an adult, that I was doing this just to piss her off, and I always do things just to push her buttons, that I'm a bad person who says things just to get a reaction from people. How my dad controls me and tells me how bad of a person she is (ps, my dads been telling me for years just to try to have a relationship with her because even though he remarried a lovely woman, I can never get another mom). All very hurtful, and false, things. 

Then, when I told her that the reason I stopped talking to her as a kid was because when I was having suicidal thoughts when I was young and I came to her for help she said I was just doing it for attention,  her whole tune changed. Suddenly, all of the things she said to me weren't true, and she was just being defensive, and didn't I know how much she was going through after the divorce? She said I was more of an adult than her, and she didnt want to lose this relationship with me. 

So I made a deal with her that I'd give her one more chance on the agreement that if one of us does something that hurts the other person, we tell each other right away even if the other person wont like it. Sounds good, right? Well, the things she said to me in anger have been eating away at me. Now I know how she truly feels about me. I wanted that argument to end with me burning this bridge. She has done nothing for me but cause me pain. 

So what do I do? If I just go back and tell her that I dont want to do this anymore, then I'm the bad guy. And she can go on her merry way thinking that she has the moral high ground and I'm just this awful brat of a child. I dont want to deal with her for the rest of my life until she does something that I can cut her off for. I'm planning for a family in the near future, and I dont want her anywhere near my children. I've just been so stressed from this job and dealing with her that my patience has run thin. I have no idea what to do besides just wait it out.

9xivhu,3,2018-11-15,Should I end my LDR? Need some advice,PaistePower,LDR,https://www.reddit.com/r/LDR/comments/9xivhu/should_i_end_my_ldr_need_some_advice/,"Dear Reddit,

I’m (21) in a long-distance relationship at the moment with a girl (27) I love to pieces but I’m having my doubts if it’s all worth it. I feel like we’re both missing opportunities in life right now and things would be easier if we quit having this LDR. I don’t know what to do and a bit confused myself, so I would really appreciate it if you could give me some advice or insights.

It all started in April this year. I was working in Dubai as an intern at the time and met this amazing Philippine lady who was working there too. We had a blast and spend almost every night we had together for 3 months. Unfortunately, things came to an end and I had to go back to Europe in July. But before I left we made plans to see each other again in August. 

We traveled in the Philippines together for a full month in August before our ways separated again. We decided to keep our relationship going because we had such a great time together. 

It has been almost 3 months now since the last time I saw her but I’m having my doubts if this long-distance thing is still worth it. I’m currently studying in Canada and she’s working all over Asia so it’s not easy to catch a plane and see each other for a couple days. We still talk daily via Facetime and she’s planning to come visit me in January. 

The thing is, I’m still young and want to experience many of things in life while she wants to settle in a couple of years. I feel like I need to experience a bit more in life before I’m ready to settle with someone. We both have different goals in life and because of this I’m afraid we won’t work out in the end. 

This girl means the world to me and I don’t want to let her go. The months I spend with her were some of the best months in my life. But the other part of me tells me I should let go and experience more in life because I am wasting time now with this LDR which is not going to work out in the end.

Could you give me some advice or insight on my situation? I really don’t know what I should do and it’s having a toll on our relationship right now. "

The summer sun that graced the East Coast so unreliably was quickly fading as fall rolled in. Over most of the summer, Dick Grayson and Donna Troy were kept pretty busy. They fought tirelessly to protect the streets of Blüdhaven and New York City as crime surged in response to the tragic death of Superman. 

Garth, the boy from the sea, on the other hand, had only just escaped the chains that had bound him for a decade over the summer. It was safe to say that none of them took the time to relax and enjoy the sun.

That was why the Titans were more than excited when Dick suggested they took a well-earned vacation. He was only a month into his second year at college, and needed to get something out of system before his workload started to ramp up. This led Dick, Donna and Garth to the eternally sunny beaches of Coast City.

Dick and Garth paddled together in the sea. Dick squinted as the harsh sunlight bounced off the surface of the water and hit his eyes, but with his foreign purple irises, this didn’t seem to be a problem for the supposed-Atlantean. As Garth paddled, Dick noticed droplets of water run separately up Garth’s arms, tracing along the edges of his deep black scars, and seeping beneath his skin. Garth seemed totally unaware of it, but it seemed to sooth them. Curious, Dick looked to his own arms, but saw no such magic water climbing up the sleeves of the red and green swim shirt that hugged his muscular form. 

“How does it feel?” Dick asked Garth. “To be in open water again.”

Garth smiled, he seemed to float in place effortlessly in the blue, unaffected by the passing waves that knocked Dick off-balance with each ripple. “It sure beats sterilised water in a glass cage.”

“Yeah, you can —” Dick spluttered and laughed, “— You can really taste the salt!” 

“You sure you’re good, man?” Garth asked, placing a hand behind Dick and gently lifting him from where the mild waves can began to claim him.

“I’m more graceful in the air, I’ll tell you that,” Dick replied, referring to his circus days. He was a competent swimmer, but it wasn’t his favourite sport.

“You head out and catch your breath,” Garth nodded. “I think Donna’s gonna get tired of sunbathing eventually.”

“You good on your own?” Dick raised an eyebrow.

“Never better,” Garth grinned. “I’m gonna swim a couple more circuits then I’ll come out and join you.”

And, with that, Garth plunged below the surface and disappeared in an instant into the murky blue. Like an aquatic Kid Flash.

Following this, Dick breast-stroked his way trepidatiously to shore, where he then trudged up the sand, already feeling the saltwater that caked his body begin to evaporate off of him in the heavenly sun. He squinted again, walking towards the sun, while he approached their parasol, under which Donna Troy lounged on a beach towel, catching rays in her red-and-black, polka dot two-piece. People said it looked dated, but she was into that slightly vintage scene.

Donna curled her lips as Dick approached. She looked up from the sand and moved aside her red sunglasses. “If you wanna dry off you can get your own towel!”

Dick laughed. “You sure you’re not coming in for a splash?”

Her face flashed blankly for a second. A single instance of fear, before that emotion was plunged down and drowned. When Donna first arrived in the modern world, she found herself drowning in the depths of the Central Park Reservoir after being dragged down through a magical ocean of blood by demons. That kind of thing left an impression.

Dick, of course, realised his mistake immediately. “I’m sorry, Don. I didn’t think.”

“It’s fine,” Donna replied sincerely, “I’m doing good just being able to *watch* the tide roll in. I think I’ll do fine sticking to lounging and poppin’ sodas. Speak of—”

She clapped twice with a teasing grin, commanding Dick to fetch her another drink. He smiled slyly and walked off towards the beach bar. But Donna stopped him. 

“In fact, if that ID you *procured me* is still valid, make it a whiskey-cola.”

Dick nodded. Sure, Donna was technically 21 yet, but she had existed in an empty void for thousands of years. That was basically just as good.

So Dick took off, but Donna wasn’t left alone for long, as Wally West emerged rapidly from the wind, zipping in at super speed. “How’s it going, ma’am?”

“Wally!” Donna minded her head on the parasol as she climbed to her feet for the first time in an hour. She wrapped her arms around Wally and pulled him into her bosom, causing him to begin to turn almost as red as his hair. “We thought you had school.”

“Well I did,” Wally explained, nervously yet politely moving away and taking deep breaths. “Though I had a pretty… crappy day, so I skipped after lunch. And Pennsylvania to California ain’t much of a trip when you’re a speedster.”

“Aw, Wal, I’m sorry,” Donna replied. “I’d get Dick to buy you a beer but you barely pass for eighteen!”

Wally sniggered. “Anyway, I’m gonna go find a big rock to get changed behind. Hoodie and jeans is hardly beachwear!”

“Sure, just remember you can’t *Flash* around on a public beach.”

“I know,” he laughed, “I think they have special beaches for that.”

Then, as Wally jogged off across the sand and into the distance, and as she lay back down on her towel, Donna found the shadow of yet another person standing over her. This time, a woman.

Dick teetered, his feet sinking into the sand as he walked, carrying a metal tray balancing two glasses and a bottle of Soder Cola. But when he arrived back at the parasol with his and Donna’s drinks, he was shocked to find her stood talking to a very familiar face. An unfamiliar haircut, but unmistakable gold-skinned, and emerald eyes. The Face of Kory Anders.

**Gotham University, One Week Ago**

&amp;nbsp;

Dick Grayson stood in a long line at Isherwood Florists. As customers ticked by, and he grew ever closer to the counter, he nervously fidgeted, rolling a twenty-dollar bill back and forth between his hands. He smiled wide, memorising his price order. *This had to be perfect.*

Suddenly, there was a crash as the front entrance swung open. In through the doorway, of all people, blitzed Mal Duncan, sweat running down his smooth head, his wild eyes immediately snapping to Dick. “Buddy! Hey!”

Dick shook his head and snickered, utterly bemused. He then watched as Mal hurriedly shimmied his way through the queue of nervous college teens and sleazy older men until he found a place beside him. “Mal, you okay? Anyone would think you were trying to stop me from boarding a plane.”

“Yeah… man…” Mal chuckled nervously, rubbing Dick’s shoulder as he stood in the line behind him. “How’s the head? That Halloween rager was pretty rad.”

Dick thought back to the night before. Where Mal turned up to his door decked out in a Superman costume, having gotten ready at Karen’s house, only to insist Dick come along to a Halloween party as his counterpart, as Batman. *If only he knew.*


“Yeah, it was wild,” said Dick. 

“Did you see Barbara there?” Mal interjected nervously.

*Babs.* She was the reason Dick was at the flower shop. He was going to pick up a bouquet of her favourite flowers and march on over to her place. There, he’d demand she took him back, or die trying. “Yeah I saw her. Tell Karen thanks for picking out that black bunny costume.”

“Yeah! Right…” Mal replied, sheepishly. Dick raised an eyebrow. Mal continued. “And did you speak to her at all?”

“Didn’t really get a chance, it was so busy. What are you getting at?”

“Are you really sure it’s the best idea to chase after her?”

“Dude,” Dick took Mal by both shoulders. “I met Babs on the street, only a year after my parents died. We had nothing. And no-one. Nothing and no-one, but Jason… and… *each other*. I already missed my chance to make things right with Jason, so I have to tell Babs how much she means to me. Hell, she’s the only girl I’ve ever loved.”

Beat.

Mal spoke as if he were in physical pain. “At the party. Did you see that Phantom guy she was hanging with? With the tux and the cape?” 

“Yeah…?”

Beat.

“*Yeah?*” Dick repeated, his eyes wide with alarm and his heart suddenly beating a hundred times heavier.

Beat.

Mal frowned. “Yeah...”


&amp;nbsp;
  
♦ ♦ Ⓣ ♦ ♦

 &amp;nbsp;
 

*Bzzt.*

*Bzzzzzt.*


*Bzzzzzzzzzt.*

&amp;nbsp;

No reply.

Dick took a step back from the buzzer for Barbara’s dorm room. As he took a deep breath he looked up to the clouds. They were turning greyer by the second, and Dick could feel droplets of rain begin to trickle down overhead. He couldn’t stay outside her building for long, before the downpour would begin.

He pressed the buzzer one last time. *Nothing.*

Maybe she wasn’t home. Or maybe Babs was expecting him and couldn’t face him. 

Dick took another deep breath. He wasn’t angry. He couldn’t be. No, this made sense. He thought of how impossible it must have been for Babs after her accident over a year ago. Regardless of how much she pushed him away, Dick should have been there for her. At her side. But he never was. He was either too busy cowering, hiding from his shame for his part in her injury, on prowling the streets in pursuit of those responsible: Jason and Deadshot. But Dick had tracked them both down eventually, and when he did he quickly learned that it was more important to support Babs.

He wasn’t good enough. And he certainly wasn’t what Babs needed to overcome all of her pain. Not now. 

Dick thought back to the day they met, how alone he’d felt beforehand and how warm his life became just having her in it. He then looked up to what he thought was Babs’ window. Curtain drawn. Nothing to see. Sure, they’d still be friends, in the best way they could muster, but how would Dick live with the knowledge that he *almost* had the girl of his dreams. How would he hang out with her without wondering what could have been?

Would she even want to be friends with him, after *everything* that had happened? Or would their dealings with Batman be kept ‘strictly professional’? Dick couldn’t be sure. His heart ached and his mind was racing. With every single mistake he’d ever made. Every promise they’d made to one another, every dream they’d set out to achieve together. All gone. All dead. 

Many girls on campus lusted for Dick Grayson, but the young man couldn’t imagine why. He supposed they hadn’t seen all of the scars that peppered his body. They all assumed he slept with every girl he wanted, and… he did. But there was only girl he ever wanted. And now she’d fallen out of his reach.

Dick looked down the path he’d walked up to her dorm building. It was long, hilly, winding and framed with trees on either side. He took out his cell phone and pulled up Babs’ contact. He changed the contact name, saving it as ‘Babs’ instead of ‘B♥️’. He then sent her a quick and simple message.

&gt; Heard about Winn. He’s a nice guy 😊

Dick reached under his shirt and pulled out his silver chain from under it. He pulled the chain from around his neck and glared at the spade-shaped pendant closely. It was one of three pendants that symbolised the bond between three orphans: Dick, Barbara and Jason. But Jason tossed his aside when he left for the last time. And now Dick’s relationship with Babs was in jeopardy too. He tried his best to imagine the potential catharsis of dashing his necklace across the grass and walking away, too hurt by her actions to continue pretending to be friends. But Dick couldn’t bring himself to do it. 

It seemed hard right now to picture ever looking Barbara Gordon in the eye again, but Dick knew he couldn’t live without her in his life. Even just as a friend.

Dick knew the path he had to walk away from Babs was a cold and uncertain path, one he had no idea how long he’d be walking. But, as he looked down the lonely road with trepidation, something unexpected happened.

Just as the rain began to pick up in intensity, a navy blue PT Cruiser pulled up across the parking lot. Mal Duncan wound down the window and cried out “Come on, Dick. There’s no use standing out in the rain! Get in!”

And he did. 

Mal had never seen Dick like this before, so overwhelmed and unreasonable. So hurt. He told him everything was going to be okay as he put Babs’ dorm in his rear view mirror. He laughed, switching on his windscreen wipers to beat away the rain. “I guess summer’s officially over.”

&amp;nbsp;


**Coast City, Now**

&amp;nbsp;

“Kory! Oh my god. What are you doing here?” Dick exclaimed. 

Kory Anders - or rather the alien Koriand’r - was a princess from the planet Tamaran. In the light of day she seemed to use some sort of technology or magic to disguise her orange-gold skin and full-green eyes, making her skin appear a more human-looking bronze tone. 

“This is where I live now, Richard,” Kory grinned. Dick remembered her having long, flowing, cherry red hair. But now that was replaced with a restrained pixie cut, hence why it look a second to recognise her.

*Of course*, Dick remembered. After being liberated from a slave planet, Koriand’r became the protégé of Hal Jordan, Green Lantern of Earth and resident of Coast City.  “How are things working with Green Lan—”

“Green-Land Cosmetics?” Kory interrupted Dick abruptly, raising an eyebrow. “The internship is going well. Not without its hurdles of course.”

“Kory was telling me how you met at a house party in Gotham?” Donna sniggered, “The chicks really do follow you around, don’t they, Dick?”

Kory smiled at Donna. “I wanted to know if this beautiful woman was your new… *counterpart*.”

“Well, she’s not, but—” Dick caught his breath as he began to fluster. “Look, Kory, you don’t need to worry about… your secret. Donna’s actually part of the team I was telling you about. *My team*.”

Kory nodded, processing this information. Though she was hardly paying attention at the time, the Tamaranean princess had run into the Teen Titans before, in the fight against Doomsday. There, she’d met Donna and Wally, though would have recognised them out of costume since.

Donna’s ear pricked up as she placed herself between Dick and Kory. “Wait, you mean this is—?”

The air sparked with a rapid jolt of electricity as Wally West appeared beside the bronze princess, now clad in only a pair of red shorts. “Oh my God, you’re Starfire!”

But as soon as Wally could finish speaking, Kory reflectively grabbed Wally by the wrist, twisting it until he submitted. “Do you want to say that a little louder, speedster?”

Beat.

Kory let go and Wally recoiled away. At the same time, they both nervously spoke. “Sorry.”

From behind them all, Garth emerged from the sea, his long dark hair left hanging damply over his face, as to still obscured the black scar over his eye. He nervously interjected, “Is everything okay?”

Luckily the beach wasn’t too busy that day.

“Team, I want you to meet Kory. She works with Green Lantern,” Dick courteously introduced her. “Kory: I want you to meet Donna, Wally and Garth.”

“Yes, I remember running into Wonder Girl and Kid Flash before,” Kory replied. 

“Actually, Wonder Girl is someone else,” Donna interjected, only to be entirely dismissed.

“But you, Garth,” Kory turned to face the purple-eyed water dweller directly, beaming warmly. “I don’t believe we’ve ever met before.”

Garth began to silently blush.

“Aliens can eat hot dogs, right?” scrambled Wally suddenly. “I ask cos I think we should all get some, and we’d love you to join.”

Garth’s eyes flashed open in alarm.

“Oh, don’t worry,” Kory reassured him, noticing this, “They are, despite my initial confusion, not fried dog. But pig!”

“Literally how is that better?” Garth exclaimed with a laugh and a scoff.

Kory looked to Dick hesitantly. She was taller than each of the men by a decent margin, and still taller than the Amazon Donna by a fraction, but she couldn’t force her way into the group without being welcomed first. 

“Yeah, Kory, come eat with us,” Dick smiled, encouraging her. “Last one to the barbecue hut pays!”

 
&amp;nbsp;
  
♦ ♦ Ⓣ ♦ ♦

&amp;nbsp;


It was Garth who ended up paying for the teens’ meal, exhausted after swimming for hours. Not that he minded, he enjoyed everyone eating together, even if he quietly enjoyed a salad rather than the processed meat.

Garth watched as Kory lathered her hot dog in copious mustard before scarfing it down. She ate faster than Wally did. And Garth knew exactly why. She had the eating habits of someone who was never sure when their next meal was coming.

Wally seemed captivated by her, a foreign beauty from beyond the stars. Donna, however, seemed less than impressed. Though Donna couldn’t help but respect one good thing about Kory, and that was how at ease Dick seemed around her.

From what Donna could ascertain, Dick and Kory had only met each other properly on one occasion before. But as the group chatted and make jokes, Dick seemed to just be much less guarded than Donna had ever seen him. Gone was the Dick Grayson who couldn’t protect Rose Wilson from her father, as well as the Dick Grayson so wracked with guilt about how he’d left things with Vic and Gar.

Now, Dick was hardly a closed book - he confided in Donna when it was important - but the way he was acting now? Donna could almost swear he was… flirting. And she’d never seen him do that. *What had changed?*

Four hot dogs, one salad, and an impromptu game of beach football later, and the sun was setting on Coast City. The five teen had made their off of the mass of the public beach and found their way to a smaller, secluded cove. They sat in a small circle, up on some rocks, watching the sunset along with the slowly sweeping tide, the city in their periphery reduced to a slowly dwindling mass of verdant lights.

Each of them held a beer in hand, even Wally after Dick finally caved. They were all, to differing degrees, exhausted. Garth didn’t even know it was possible to exhaust oneself on such a carefree day, though he couldn’t say he disliked the feeling. It was a bizarre feeling of satisfaction, of having accomplished absolutely naught while simultaneously celebrating the fact.

Wally took a deep breath and spoke wistfully, with a wisdom before unseen by the other Titans. “It just seems like there’s never enough hours in the day to just… be kids.”

“I don’t even really even know what it means to be a kid,” Garth replied, referring to his adolescence spent in captivity.

“We aren’t kids,” Dick said plainly, glancing across the width of the circle to Wally.

“You’re nineteen, Dick,” Donna scoffed, “Don’t be such an old man.”

“I stopped being a kid when I was twelve,” Dick shot back. “When my parents fell to their deaths.”

Beat.

Kory took a swig of her drink. “I suppose none of us got to have ‘conventional’ childhoods. Dick, you were orphaned far too young. Garth spent his childhood in a fish tank. Wally…”

“My parents just didn’t give a shit about me,” Wally answered.

“Right,” Kory nodded, “And Donna grew up as a punching bag for her sister. And I relate to every single one of you.”

Donna lifted her head out of her chest and set her empty bottle aside on a rock, intrigued. “How so?”

“Well, my sister Komand’r resented me my whole childhood for getting in her way to the throne. She constantly picked fights and I was just expected to let it happen,” Kory stared off across the waves, a level of numb detachment in her voice. “Then, when I was just a girl, my parents sold me into slavery to broker a treaty to protect our planet from invaders. Because clearly *my* parents didn’t give a shit about me either.”

The Titans each looked to her, lost for words. All of them, even Dick; *especially* Dick, felt that her experiences, her past suffering, completely dwarfed each of their own. They were all humbled, and yet at the same time left sad.

“Right, so none of us had an easy childhood,” Dick spoke up, his voice carrying that inspiring, Grayson tone. “We’d be lucky if even one of us ends up having an easy adulthood. But we’ll get through. As long as we chase what’s important.”

Kory looked at Dick with subtle admiration. He wasn’t without his flaws. He was grouchy, stubborn and closed off. But he so obviously cared about his friends more than any other person ever could. “I agree. In Tamaranean culture we live by a code of hedonism. Our lives revolve around pursuing pleasure. Most of my kind see no other way of living.”

“But not you?” Dick asked, catching a glint in her eye.

“Having lived my life, I have a complicated relationship with pleasure,” Kory explained, “But it’s still something I can rely on when all else fails.”

“I’m thinking of getting a job,” Donna interjected. She held her empty glass bottle in her hands, rolling it back and forth. “To pay the bills and to find some sort of purpose beyond beating up villains and rescuing people. I was thinking I’d try selling some of the photographs I’ve been taking. I’ve already taken so many scenic shots on the beach today.”

“Perhaps you could toy with fashion photography?” Kory suggested. “I’ve been told to pursue modelling by men on the street, and I could use someone to hold the camera.”

“I just want a family that cares,” spoke Wally next. He dashed his bottle along the rocks, watching it shatter by the tide.

“You have your aunt Iris, and Barry,” Donna reassured him, placing a hand on his shoulder. 

“Iris might be my aunt, but she’s part of Barry’s family. Not mine.”

“Well, then you have us,” Garth smiled, almost affirming it for himself as he spoke. “The Titans are the only family I’ve ever known. All of you.”

Kory, Donna and Wally all looked to Garth. Together they all shared a moment of silent yet palpable appreciation. A moment of love. But Dick was notably absent, still lost watching the tide roll in and out, collecting the fragments of broken glass. Kory noticed this.

“And what do you want, Dick?”

Dick looked over his shoulder, only to find himself drawn to the deep, caring and inviting eyes of the Tamaranean princess. She had spent mere hours with the Titans, with Dick and his friends, and already she cared so deeply for them. For him. He looked to her, and in turn Kory looked back to him. His icy blue eyes were lost. The implication was clear. Dick didn’t know what he wanted. But as Donna caught Dick and Kory staring at each other, she knew was they needed.

Donna nodded knowling to Garth and Wally, and the three of them cleared out as quickly and as silently as possible.

Now alone with him, Kory inched closed to the lost Grayson and placed a hand on his knee. “What is it?” she asked tenderly. 

Dick braced himself, stilling his quivering nerves. He spoke with a tone of detachment much like Kory’s own. “Growing up in a travelling circus, you learn not to get attached to things. You come and go. Nothing lasts. Not my home. Not my parents. Not my friendships. Not even…”

He couldn’t bring himself to say her name. But he didn’t have to. Kory knew he was thinking about a girl.

She squeezed his hand tight and invited him closer. She moved down to sit on a lower rock, bringing herself down to the level where Dick slouched. “I too never had a place to call home growing up. After I left Tamaran, I was never kept in one place for too longer.”

Dick steadied his breath and began to search through her emerald irises. Kory continued.

“You’re right that not much in this life is permanent. But… even if something ends; even if it doesn’t last forever, it doesn’t mean it wasn’t importa—”

Dick pulled Kory close, and his lips met hers. He shut his lost eyes and did what she told him. Pursue pleasure. Though surprised at first, Kory eased into it, pressing her body against his. Then, as hands explored and muscles tensed, Dick found himself on top of her. He heard that voice in the back of his head: telling him to stop, telling him he didn’t want this. But as he looked upon Koriand’r’s every curve, her golden skin, her soft, rouge lips, and her fiery, enticing, eyes, Dick knew the voice was wrong. 

He did want this. 

 
&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

The sun was high in the sky. The clouds were light and fluffy. The distant city buildings were tall and pristine, and the sand was hot and white.

Dick Grayson flickered into consciousness to the sounds of the moving tide, the distant giggling of playful children and the caws of gulls. He opened his eyes and turned over to pull himself closer to the serene form of the princess Koriand’r’s sleeping, nude body, only to find himself sleeping alone.

He pulled himself up, bemused. Would she really ditch him before he woke up? Then the guilt set in, when it dawned on Dick what he’d done. He’d had sex with an alien. He slept with Kory. He had sex with a girl that wasn’t Babs. And… he felt… *okay with that*.

Dick took a deep breath. It was okay. Sure, he barely knew her, but they’d hit it off right away. Now all he had to do was find and—

From out behind the rocky wall of the cove, Kory appeared suddenly, draped in a lilac summer dress. She smiled smugly, her eyes combing up and down Dick’s nude body. “I thought I’d see if you were awake yet.”

Embarrassed, Dick scrambled back, over to his shorts, left to dry in the sun, and pulled them on. Now with modesty preserve, Dick let out a nervous sigh and twitched the edges of his mouth into a sure but uneasy smile. “Kory, that was…”

“Fun?” she replied coyly. “I agree. You’re definitely talented.”

“I was actually going to say ‘mind blowing’, but…”

“Glad I could impress.”

Dick looked at Kory, completely composed, ultimately cool. It was like she wasn’t nervous about this at all, an example Dick sure wished he could follow. “So I hate to be that guy, but… what now?”

“You were upset. I was upset. We gave each other pleasure and had an incredible night,” Kory explained, painfully matter-of-factly, “What more is there to it?”

Dick blinked twice. Had he used her? Surely not. Had she used him? Had they just used each other? “So… it was meaningless…?”

“Weren’t you listening last night, Richard?” Kory replied, taking steps towards him before planting a tender kiss on his forehead. “Things don’t have to last forever to have meaning. Personally, last night meant a lot to me.”

Dick couldn’t fathom it. He definitely was not the one-night-stand type, but… Kory wasn’t wrong. She gave him what he needed, and nothing more. He took a deep breath, and then reached down for the white t-shirt at his feet. 

“Where’s the rest of the team?” he asked, pulling the tee over his head.

“Oh they’re waiting at the barbecue hut. They’re already making *all sorts* of jokes about us.” She almost seemed proud of it.

“Well now I’m awake and… actually clothed, I guess we should—”

Dick recoiled as a screeching alarm blared directly into his right ear. An emergency contact on his comms unit. No doubt the rest of the Titans were getting the same transmission. He shot a worried glance to Kory, who stood ready to fly off at a moment’s notice, before tapping his communicator. Instantly, he heard the hurried voice of The Flash.

“Nightwing. Titans. This is Flash. A cyborg Superman imposter is headed to Coast City. He is of critical threat. Green Lantern is en route but it is imperative that you intercept before he can arrive.”

So many questions. *Who was this Cyborg Superman? Why was he headed to Coast City? Where was Green Lantern? The Flash?* But one stood out to Dick immediately. He called back into his communicator. 

“Acknowledged, Flash. This is Nightwing. How did you know we were in Coast City?”

“Bruce told me,” Flash replied plainly, before rapidly realising the implication. “Maybe it's best we talk later.”

The Flash was right. That talk would have to wait. Dick thought to the duffel bag containing his costume that he’d dumped in the back of the rental truck. He’d have to fetch that, but while he did that… “Starfire, get the Titans together. We have a mission.”

9xjgxu,4,2018-11-16,[M4F]Mild initiation of a young girl to the BDSM lifestyle,SuaveAndNaughty,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/9xjgxu/m4fmild_initiation_of_a_young_girl_to_the_bdsm/,"Let me preface this by saying that the events in this story are part fiction, part fact. The story and the events are based on real life, while the conversations and personal details have been suitably modified for a better flow and in the interest of anonymity. 

---------------

I used to work at a big finance firm a few years back. Our company hired many junior undergrads as summer interns who were invited to work on certain projects for a few weeks. Based on their performance and abilities, they would be later extended a full time position (or not). One of the things I used to love about this program was the eagerness and enthusiasm of those young undergrads to please their superiors. I have always had a dominant streak in me, be it inside the bedroom or otherwise. Setting up rules for someone to achieve their goals, training them with the discipline they need to develop in themselves, pushing them out of their comfort zone, are some of the things I have found that I enjoy that naturally come to me. Being a mentor for a small team of these summer interns would mean taking the responsibility to guide them through their project, and cultivating these skills in them. Besides, their willingness to learn was the cherry on the cake. 

This one particular year I was supposed to handle a team of 5 interns. 3 young men and 2 young women : David, Tyler, John, Diane and Susan. They were intelligent, smart, and ambitious young students who wanted to make their mark. It was obvious from their interactions with me as well as with each other that these weren't your typical spoilt and entitled college kids, but people who were willing to work hard and put in the effort to achieve what they wanted. 

I must admit, even though I was always professional with them in our meetings and discussions, there was a great deal which I could've never openly admitted to any of my colleagues lest it was interpreted in a way that could damage my reputation. However logical the human brain might be in its rational moments, the primal part of it can't help but feel the emotions that naturally arise. Looking at Susan you would say it was no surprise that I fell for her charms and feminine beauty. A petite brunette, naturally beautiful breasts, a rather supple derriere, she was the object of desire for every male set of eyes on the floor and the object of envy for every female. Smart and sweet. Giggly and friendly. She was a breath of fresh air for anyone she came to interact with. The geeky glasses she used to wear and the way her eyes turned wide when she was confused when I talked about some intricate concept in detail were only some of the little things that added to her delightful presence. 

The interns went back to their hometowns to finish their senior year in college at the end of summers. David, Diane and Susan had made the cut. They received their full time position offers a few weeks after the internship ended, and all three of them had accepted it. That evening Susan texted me saying how excited she was to get the position and thanked me for the mentorship and how it wouldn't have been possible to get there without me. This was the first time that we talked after the internship was over. I replied her back saying all that she achieved was due to her own effort, my role in it was minimal. We texted back and forth for a while that night, before she had to go back to her assignments and we said our goodnights. 

Over the next few months, the frequency of texts from Susan increased. Initially it used to be about logistical issues, questions pertaining to the position of new hires in the company, or something related to moving to the new city etc. Over time, it gradually proceeded to more personal happenings from her life, like how she was having a bad day or if the new assignment was giving her a tough time or how Kelly was being a mean bitch to her. Conversations with her were always interesting. She was a curious young mind who wanted to know and experience as much as she could about the world. At the same time, she was still the naive and innocent young one, who was still in the phase of that delightfully carefree adolescence when you had very few responsibilities which burdens so many adults from being fun. We texted about inconsequential things, yet nothing sexual so far. It was my self imposed policy to never initiate a relationship of that nature with anyone in my workplace. 

The year passed and the fresh hires were ready to join. Our team had planned of throwing a little house party to welcome them to the new job. It was decided that for the sake of convenience of everyone, the party would be held at my place. My home was the nearest to the office, and that way no one would have to travel much. Sure, I didn't mind.

That Friday we (4 of my colleagues, the 3 new hires, and I) headed back to my apartment after office. We had ordered food and some drinks and were generally having a good time sharing some of the stories from our first year experiences working at the firm. We were sitting in the living room all this time. About an hour into the stories Susan had the urge to go to the washroom. When she came back, she looked at me with a confused look in her eyes and at first I couldn't figure out why, nor did I bother to find out more. She took the seat nearest to me and after a few moments, leaned in to whisper something into my ears

""I have so many questions! Why do you have that *inscribed* dog collar in your room, when you have no pets?""

Her emphasis on inscribed made it clear that she had read what the collar said. That was the moment I realized what had just happened. When she went to the guest bathroom, Diane was already using it, and so Susan had went to the one inside my bedroom. Unfortunately, (or fortunately?) I didn't get the time to clean up my room after a regular play session with one of my subs the previous nights, and Susan had accidentally stumbled upon that collar. 

From the tone of her voice, it was clear enough that she was as yet not exposed to this world of kinks. I had to make a crucial decision at that time. I could either brush off the question, or take this as an opportunity to take a curious mind and introduce it to an interesting world of perversions. Her eyes were looking into mine, waiting for an explanation, while I was taking my time to contemplate how best to answer it.

9xk497,3,2018-11-16,I am failing at life right now (Long),longneckmcbeck34,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/9xk497/i_am_failing_at_life_right_now_long/,"Sorry for the extremely long post, but I really need to spill shit out right now and get things ""off my chest"". Seemed like the place to come to. I myself didn't realize I'd be writing a literal book. Shout out to anyone who actually finishes it. tl;dr at the end.

As I look upon my where my life is at right now, I can't be in denial about it anymore: I have failed in life thus far. Before I'd always justify my scuffling with cliche platitudes, like ""you're still young, you'll figure it out"" or ""it's just not your time yet, you'll get there eventually"", but there's no getting around it anymore; I have failed thus far. I simply don't have anything going for me right now.

Academically, I continue to vastly underachieve. I'm kind of like the guy who peaked in high school, except for me it is from a school perspective rather than a popularity perspective (I was never the cool guy in high school). I graduated in the top 5% of my class (probably top 2% with weighted grades), had very good test scores, and a solid docket of extracurriculars. I ended up getting into my dream school and did decent academically my freshman year (just below a 3.7). Since then it's gone downhill. I've had to switch my career track from pre-health to economics/applied statistics due mainly to poor grades, continued to get poor grades, taken a semester off because of poor grades, and now am taking an extra year in part to improve my grades.

My GPA is JUST above the 3.0 cutoff (3.008). That doesn't sound that bad, but for an econ major, it really is not good at all. My GPA since my first 2 semesters is a 2.75, my major GPA is around a 2.5, and I've gotten a C- or below in 3 courses during that time period. And I also feel like I know barely anything about economics. My academic confidence is extremely low right now. I got off to a decent start this semester, as I was on pace to get in the A to B+ range in 4/5 classes, but I've been struggling hard the past month. In all likelihood, I failed 2 more exams today (I'm talking like below 40% type of failing here) and am on track to receive below a B in both courses, and possibly fail them. I'm also over week late on a writing assignment (still have barely started) that is worth 15% of my grade in one class, which by the way, does not accept late assignments under any circumstances.

If my poor academic performance was due to the material or school being too hard, it really wouldn't be a big deal. I would've transferred to an easier school by now. However, this is not the case AT ALL. It's all due to a lack of effort on my part, and I only have myself to blame. I am more than capable of succeeding at my school and economics is not that difficult of a subject (really, pre-health isn't much harder tbh, I could've handled it). I've seen people from high school with similar or lesser abilities get much better grades than me in equally tough or tougher fields. It makes me sick to my stomach sometimes thinking about how much others have grown over the years while I have just stagnated. It's not that I don't want it either. It's not like I fell into a deep hole due to partying or something like that. I care about doing well in school. I sit down and try to study, but I just feel like I can't anymore. I find of feel paralyzed in some ways, and I just cannot get started on my assignments/studying a lot of the time.

After doing poorly on exams, I feel like absolute shit. And I don't really forget that feeling immediately; it's always at least in the back of my mind, if not the forefront. I think about how much I've left on the table all the time. But I just can't bring myself to take any action on it, for whatever reason. It's extremely frustrating. My anxiety is a part of this, and I've been seeing a psychologist for almost 2 years now, but nothing has really been able to help my school performance that much. Honestly, I don't think it matters at all that I'm at an allegedly difficult school; I feel like I'd get B's and C's in most classes if I went back to high school right now, let alone an easier university. At this point, school is nothing but a source of extreme stress and anxiety for me.

Professionally, I don't have much going for me either. I have been unemployed the entire year, and unlike my academic performance, this doesn't have much to do with effort. I've kept track of basically all of my internship and full-time job applications, and the results have been pretty awful. I applied to 120 internships for summer 2018 (cover letters for most of them) and got 6 interviews (all 1st round, no second round) and no offers. Did nothing but sit at home all day my last summer before graduation.

I have never gotten an offer for an internship. I've been actively applying since early 2016 for summer 2016, 2017, and 2018 internships as well as for part-time jobs throughout the year, a total of 221 applications over the last almost 3 years. This has yielded me 18 interviews and 4 offers. This doesn't sound too bad on the surface I guess. However, 3 of those interviews were for hourly grocery store jobs (as well as 1 offer), 1 interview was basically set up for me by a family friend (as well as the offer pretty much), and the 2 offers I got were only for part-time jobs. I also skipped one of the interviews due to extreme anxiety. 

Right now, I am applying for full time opportunities and have gotten 4 interviews from 42 applications, which is actually a good ratio. If you can believe it though, I skipped 3 of these 4 interviews. Part of the reason for me skipping these interviews was due to the mic on my laptop, which stopped working and didn't allow me to use the online interview platforms. However, I easily could've gone somewhere with public computers, or found some other alternative solution, but I had too much anxiety about interviewing in a public place. Instead I just let the deadlines pass without interviewing and totally squandered 3 phenomenal opportunities. On the bright side, I found out today that I am getting my first ever 2nd round interview for the one job I did interview for though, which is the ONLY thing I really have going for me right now (idk how because I thought it was one of my worst interviews ever, but I'll take it).

Physically, I've let myself go since high school. I am about 185 lb at 5'10'', which is about a 40 pound gain from high school. I't not a bad weight overall and I actually think I am better looking at this weight, especially when I see how frail I looked in high school, but the problem is that it's mostly fat. I am the definition of skinny fat, with pretty skinny arms and legs and larger torso and ass. My athleticism, which was actually at a decent level in high school, has declined a great deal as well. I've never been able to consistently maintain a workout schedule for more than a month and a half during a semester. I actually really enjoy working out and playing sports for the most part too; I just get so stressed out with school and/or work and I end up not going.

My eating habits have simply been a mess the last several years. I'm lucky to have very high metabolism, otherwise I'd probably be obese with the stuff I put into my body. I've at least limited fast food to only 2-3 times a week over the last 3 months, which is an improvement over almost every day, but my already high sugar intake might have actually increased during that time. I have been much more disciplined with sugar the last 2 weeks or so, but it's been a significant issue. This stretch of sugar discipline was brought on by an insane binge sesh that included eating 3 full sleeves of Oreo's in a day, among others. Trust me, my binge eating accounts are almost comical and it brings me stress that I sometimes feel like I can't stop or resist unhealthy food. 

My sleep schedule is also all kinds of fucked up. It's basically impossible for me to go to sleep before 3:30 anymore. Despite almost always telling myself that today will be the day I normalize my sleep schedule, I end up going to sleep at a totally irregular time. I'm in a perpetual state of tiredness throughout the day.

Mentally, I'm not in great shape either. As I've mentioned before, I have anxiety, and it really manifests itself in many areas of my life, and has for a while. I have an extreme fear of failure/rejection, and that results in me avoiding literally any situation outside of my comfort zone. I'm in a constant state of either latent or active stress, worry, and misery. I might have persistent depressive disorder as well, but I haven't been diagnosed for that like I have with anxiety.

I'm also fucked up in some ways, as I've done some extremely creepy things. I've made fake social media accounts to follow girls with private accounts, mainly either girls who I know or girls who go to my school, but sometimes random girls too. I usually make impostor accounts first so it seems like a legit account, before changing it to a generic name, picture, and profile. Doesn't take a genius to figure out what I do with these pictures. That thing I do with the pics? Sometimes I do it all day, upwards of 7-8 times. I have very little self-control over it, much like my lack of self control over a litany of other things in my life. This has basically replaced porn for me over the last few years.  I usually delete the accounts, before eventually succumbing and making another one again. The last 2 years I've made around 10 fake/impostor accounts, and just deleted another one a couple days ago that I had for around 3 weeks. I used try to get pics and videos of girls with my phone, but luckily that was a very, very short-lived habit that I rarely ever put into action and have never attempted (and rarely ever even thought of attempting) in at least 5-6 years. I can't even begin to explain how much shame and embarrassment I feel from this. Being a bum sucks, but being a bum and a creep really sucks.

Socially, I am a total wreck. I'm not totally alone necessarily. I stay with my family every other weekend, and there are people that know me and are cool with me. I'm not completely isolated, and there are people who have it worse than me for a longer time than me. I sympathize greatly with them. 

But I'm still lonely as fuck. I'm currently living in an apartment by myself, largely because I didn't know anyone who would want to live with me. I never have any plans on weekends. Since the semester started in Sept, I've only attended ONE social event, which was a birthday dinner 2 weeks ago. I have social event tomorrow in all likelihood that I'll be going to. That would be the fifth time that I've hung out with friends in the last 6-7 months. Many weekends, I don't even leave my apartment. My weekends basically consist of sleeping, laying in bed doing nothing, eating too much, jerking off, endlessly surfing the internet with my brain turned off, watching one too many games or shows, having dance parties with myself, fantasizing about an alternate life without working towards it at all (I often dream through elaborate scenarios where I am a celebrity or some other type of individual that I perceive as high status. I often pretend I'm getting interviewed on shows, talking to people about how cool my hypothetical life is, etc.), smoking an occasional bowl, and most of all, neglecting schoolwork and other things I should be doing. And of late, I've basically been doing those things every day, not just on weekends.

It's not because I live by myself either. I lived with a few roommates the last 3 years, two of whom was extremely social, and yet my social life was pretty non-existent relative to theirs. They weren't random roommates either; my two roommates the first 2 years I considered my two closest friends and after one of them graduated, the guy who replace him was a really, really nice guy and became a good friend. But even in an environment designed to be comfortable, my anxiety won. Last year, something triggered my anxiety so hard that I would lock myself up in a library cubicle all day every day. I barely spent any time with my roommates and didn't speak with them much either. Our relationship wasn't bad or anything, I just basically decided to stop existing and randomly kind of cut them off for reasons that even I don't understand. Of course, I've never said a peep about my anxiety issues or any struggles to anyone outside of my parents and therapist, but I'm sure there are people who have an idea. Anyways, since I started living solo, I more regularly have days, including today, where the only person I speak to is myself. There is an overwhelming sense within me that I'm totally wasting my youth (I'm 22). I feel that strongly basically every day and it honestly makes me a little queasy.

As for relationships, just forget about it. I've never even come close to having one. Don't talk to any girls at the moment. I've only slept with one girl, one time. I guess I'm technically not a virgin, but for all intents and purposes I am, because I couldn't stay hard long enough due to being too drunk and way too nervous. Definitely don't think it's due to my looks either, but rather due to being too afraid to try. At my age, this also brings me a great deal of embarrassment, and is on my mind a lot.

Social skills wise, I'm not that bad honestly. I put too much pressure on myself when it comes to holding conversations, but I generally speak fine and have an understanding of social cues and non-verbal communication. When I do speak I don't think I'm that awkward and I don't think I'm that boring either. I have a few jokes in me. But, awkward moments do arise because of my trouble holding conversations consistently, my apprehension to being assertive socially, and also my lack of understanding of eye contact rules, if that makes any sense (I feel like I either make too much or too little, and that I'm so focused on making eye contact sometimes that I don't listen).

I've always told myself that I'm introverted, but that's mostly BS. I'm certainly not an extrovert; I need and treasure alone time. But I'm probably closer to inhibited extrovert than introvert. Unfortunately, I'm too inhibited to do any of the things I want to do. Furthermore, I don't really have anyone to do things with. I've also driven away basically all of my friends, due to my excessive avoidance of social situations and fear of rejection/desperation/being disliked or uncool. I never had that many friends since high school, despite always wanting more. I definitely wasn't the popular type, and if anything, I was one of those totally forgettable kids. But I did have a social circle at that time. I was definitely a part of a group. That could not be further from the case now. I am really not a true part of any group. As for the friends I haven't totally driven away, I am on the fringes of their social circles. My phone is basically in a dead-zone at all times. 90% of my calls are from my mom or some scam. I also feel like some people I hang out with/meet don't have respect for me due to my lack of experience and perceived lack of personality. 

I've always struggled to make new friends, and I feel like it is going to be even harder once I graduate, especially because of my lack of life experiences. I simply don't have many stories to tell, and especially not from college. I just can't shake the feeling that I might just be completely bland and destined to be alone forever. I know that is too extreme of a thought, but I can't shake it. A lot of people who don't do well academically and professionally at least have a solid friend group and social life to fall back on and bring them pride. I don't even have that.

At least now I am beginning to see the gravity of my situation. I feel unbelievably shitty right now and I'm just tired of short-changing myself in life. I have to call it what it is: I'm a dependent bum with no goals or work ethic who is afraid of people and who sits at home all day jerking off, watching TV, surfing the internet, and eating junk food. What makes it worse is that I have been blessed with good genetics and circumstances. I have above average intelligence, great health, decent enough personality (apparently I was naturally warm even as a baby), and grew up in an extremely stable, financially sound, middle-class, 2 parent home. Hell, I even think I'm decent looking with solid muscle genetics. I just haven't even put myself in position to play the very good hand that I was dealt.

My parent's have these neighbors who are in their mid 30's-late 40's that still are living with their parents. I don't mean to imply that these dudes are failures in life; they are both decent people who have jobs and contribute to society. But, when I see them, I have this dormant, but still intense fear that that could be similar to my future; the smart kid who didn't really pan out and is now living with his parents in the same house and city he grew up in, working some totally meaningless job, no relationship, no experiences, etc. There is nothing wrong with that way of life if that's what you want, but I know I don't want that. I honestly do want to experience all that life has to offer, and be the best version of myself. Not only that, I want to work to get to that. Having success handed to you is not fulfilling at all, and I'd be the type to feel guilty about that anyways. There is NOTHING cool about being the bright burnout or the trust-fund adult-baby. While I feel totally awful now, I am grateful to still have hope intact. I do still believe I can turn this around. It may be a slow process, but I know I can still do it and I KNOW it will be worth it. I'm done with this shit man. Here's to better days ahead.

tl;dr: Doing poorly in school, little job success, unemployed the last year, anxiety ridden, pervasive avoidance of basically everything, skinny-fat, lack of self-control and willpower, isolated with no consistent friend group, lack of life experiences, often too scared to leave the house, nonexistent sex-life, no relationship history, never have any plans on weekends; addicted to the internet, jerking off, and junk food; highly regrettable and embarrassing creep tendencies, don't really have any goals. All this despite being dealt a GREAT hand in life IMO. Finding a hard time taking action to change."
9xki5s,2,2018-11-16,Recent Graduate with Questions,NoahSNIPE,CPA,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPA/comments/9xki5s/recent_graduate_with_questions/,"I recently graduated in Spring of 2018 and wanted to peruse a course of getting ready to take the CPA exam and had a couple of questions for you guys if you don't mind.  A little back story is I was a little unsure of what I wanted to do throughout college, but decided to start with getting a degree in Accounting because it is what my dad does and I didn't want to waste any time and figured I would be qualified for most entry level business positions with a degree.  While going through school I didn't love financial reporting and governmental accounting so I kind of balked with getting an internship and it cost me.  My senior year when I finally ended up taking tax I decided it was something I could really get behind and wanted to peruse, but the lack of an internship/work experience has made it rough trying to find a job (Now have a couple months of Accounttemps temp positions under my belt).  My biggest question I guess is I can't really afford an expensive training program like Becker without a job and am worried that the longer I am out of school the harder the CPA exam is going to be to pass.  Does anyone have any experience with waiting a couple months or even a year before going back and trying to pass the CPA exam, and if so what was your experience like?  "

&amp;#x200B;

**TL:DR:** Back in 2015 I wrote an album. Tried to record it solo but wasn't happy with the sound. Found out /r/BedroomBands exist. Recruited a group of very talented musicians. Today is release day and I couldn't be happier! I share some lessons with you guys. Most important thing: Don't give up. You can listen to the end result on my [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/5eAQxqtK6IfcFkOf4ZQwLK?si=5kqXtzo-QtGD9ppO89zsjQ) or [Bandcamp](https://stefanelbl.bandcamp.com/album/cotidiano).

&amp;#x200B;

**Introduction:**

&amp;#x200B;

As a way of celebrating the release of my first solo album: Cotidiano, which was recorded with the help of many, many talented redditors from /r/BedroomBands; I want to share with you some of the lessons I learnt during the process that may be of use to you. Since there were tons of hardships and complications that could've been avoided if I had the knowledge I do today.  My intention here is that those who need some guidance on how to do a big project through /r/BedroomBands can obtain some sort of help through this post. Please excuse my english. It's been years since I've written so much in english and I may have forgotten a few things about grammar, time tenses and all that jazz.

&amp;#x200B;

I could go on and on about the recording and production process of the album, however, than can be saved for another day. As of now, what's important is to give you a bit of context. As stated on the TLDR, back in 2015 I played on a rock band and we were having troubles scheduling rehearsals. Because I can't stand still, I started writing material and before I knew it, I had an album layed out. I tried recording solo, just guitar and voice but had no results. Then during 2016 I started to drift towards more electronic sounds, recording an electronic EP on the final day of 2016.

&amp;#x200B;

After sitting on this material during all of 2017, I finally had an impulse to record the tracks, knowing I could assemble a great team of musicians. If I had to say a genre for the album, I would be tempted to say acoustic rock, however, due to the various differences in cultural backgrounds and musical tastes, I'm not so sure about what is it that we've recorded. There's bossa nova, there's a bit jazz, there's a bit of hard rock. I always joke around that this album has something for everybody. However, that is up to you guys to decide (*this is where you start pressing play to the album wink wink).*

&amp;#x200B;

Without further ado, here's some of the lessons I learnt while working on this beautiful project and that may be of use to you:

&amp;#x200B;

**- You're the only person responsible for the success/failure of your project**

&amp;#x200B;

The most useful advice I can give you. Nobody will care as much about your project other than yourself. Period. Unless you hit it big time and have fans that know more about your songs than you, you're stuck with being the driving force behind your project. That is something that is both amazing and terrifying. Humans tend to be lazy and avoid effort, the temptation is something huge and it's reflected all around our media and cultural tendencies. If you want to succeed, or at least get your project out there, you have to put in effort.

&amp;#x200B;

I think that my biggest merit was being able to keep the project going. Everyday I tried to contact a new collaborator, ask how the collaborators are doing, thinking of new ideas, review tracks they sent me, etc. I think that this may be the hardest I've ever worked. In spite of that, there are plenty of things that I failed at, not because of lazyness but rather due to lack of knowledge/skill. I can deal with that. I can not deal with my project failing because of my own negligence.

&amp;#x200B;

\- **The biggest complications are in your head:**

&amp;#x200B;

Back when I saw this subreddit for the first time, a thought crossed my head: ""I shouldn't do this, there's no way in hell people are gonna want to collaborate with someone that sings in spanish and not english"", I could've entertained that thought, however, I decided I had to give it a shot anyways and discovered that the language barrier was not as big as expected. I was actually more worried about it than the people who I thought would be worried by it! It was a pleaseant surprise which helped me to progress and realize that the mind can create some very frightening thoughts that can impair your advances.

&amp;#x200B;

Whether it is the language barrier or having doubts in finding collaborators for your genre or if you're self-conscious about anything. Just give it a shot. Sure, if you don't know how to play in time or don't have a minimum standard of performance for your instrument then you're most likely screwed, but the rest of things that are subject to subjective thoughts can be surpassed by sheer willpower. Believe in yourself.

&amp;#x200B;

\- **Learn how to deal with people. Be kind, but not dumb:**

&amp;#x200B;

A trait that I've learned is one of my biggest assets when dealing with people in managing projects is the ability to be kind when dealing with people. I've always been very impulsive and quick to do things, couple that with almost always having a strong opinion and you have a perfect recipe for making people feel animosity towards you. Time and tons of introspection has taught me that there's a way to say what you mean without coming off as an asshole, specially in these times of hyper-sensibility.

&amp;#x200B;

The people who are collaborating with you are mostly doing it out of passion for art, they're giving you their most valuable asset: time, and they're giving them to you for free (well, most of the times for free, I think that money changes this dynamic in a way, but the point still stands). How could you possibly treat them in a way that doesn't exude respect when they're gifting you a part of their lives so you can fulfill your ambition?

&amp;#x200B;

One method that I love to use when critiquing something is the ""compliment sandwich"" a very old method I learnt in some internet forums back in 2004 and that has stuck with me ever since. What I always do is:

&amp;#x200B;

***1- Compliment:*** I love to begin a review with a compliment. It makes the reader/listener more receptive to what you have to say and it engages their attention. We all love receiving praise for doing something we enjoy and that facilitates the rest of the conversation. I usually begin with a compliment of the track/song in general and then add a detail that I think is important. Here's an example:

&amp;#x200B;

*""Hey man, I listened to the track you sent me. I love the atmosphere you created! The guitar tone adds the raw agressiveness that we wanted to imprint in the song.""*

&amp;#x200B;

***2- Deliver critique in a kind manner:*** Once it's been established you enjoy the overall concept of the work it's time to point out certain incosistencies and the room for improvement that you feel may bring what they sent you to the next level. As a rule of thumb, avoid the word ""but"" at all costs. ""*Yeah it's great but...""* means that in spite of it being great, there's something negative enough that it outweights the positives. The idea here is to give a different impression: the work is great, and it can become even greater!

&amp;#x200B;

*""Hey man, I listened to the track you sent me. I love the atmosphere you created! The guitar tone adds the raw agressiveness that we wanted to imprint in the song. I think that if  we substract a bit of attack on the second verse and play with palm-muting then we can create a bit of room for the song to breathe and then slam the listener with an agressive tone for the second chorus!""*

&amp;#x200B;

Note how I speak of ""we"" in parts of the message. It sends an idea of you being a team with the other person, which is nothing but the truth. You're in this together. I think that unless you're dealing with a hired gun, you guys are a team and have to look out for each other. Also note how my comment isn't about what I enjoy, but rather what I think works best for the song, I also explain why I think it works better that way. I believe that we all do things for a reason, and if that reason is ""just because"" then you may want to re-think your strategy.

&amp;#x200B;

***3- Close with a compliment:***

&amp;#x200B;

*""Hey man, I listened to the track you sent me. I love the atmosphere you created! The guitar tone adds the raw agressiveness that we wanted to imprint in the song. I think that if  we substract a bit of attack on the second verse and play with palm-muting then we can create a bit of room for the song to breathe and then slam the listener with an agressive tone for the second chorus! That being said, I'd love to hear your thoughts about my opinion so we can decide the best course of action for the project. I can't wait to hear the next version""*

&amp;#x200B;

That's it. As simple as that. Notice how I close with a declaration that I'm excited for what's to come and that I hope to hear the other person's input. Perhaps what I'm thinking is not entirely correct and they can point it out. There may be instances where you're wrong or when you're not seeing the big picture and that's perfectly key. Don't blind yourself, accept new ideas.

&amp;#x200B;

Since using the compliment sandwich I've noticed that collaborators tend to like me more than before, when I was dumb enough to demand them to perform perfectly. The key here is honesty: you can't compliment something just to comply with the checklist, that ends up being shallow flattery that will lead you nowhere. If they send you something terrible enough that has no use then be direct and tell them, don't insult them, don't attack them personally, just let them know what you think has room for improvement. If they feel slighted then, well, not much you can do. Now compare the above message with the following ones. I kid you not, these are part of the comments I received during some of my experience:

&amp;#x200B;

*""Great but you missed a note on the 1:06 mark. Please re-record""*

&amp;#x200B;

*""I don't think it's gonna work. Do it again""*

&amp;#x200B;

Now which message do you think works best for the project and your artistic development? The answer may astound you.

&amp;#x200B;

\- **Many people will say no, deal with it and keep going:**

&amp;#x200B;

Back when I started recruiting people for Cotidiano I spent most of my time writing and replying to emails and Reddit PMs. I kid you not, I remember one day during my internship that I spent four hours just writing emails, listening to potential collaborators and overall managing the project. Then when I came home I would record the tracks and upload the demos so the next day I could use them to entice people to collaborate. I think that I had a 20% reply rate to my messages, and from that 20% just a 5% ended up collaborating. Like many things in life, finding the right collaborators is a numbers game. Don't be discouraged and keep on trying. Nobody will remember your project if you never put it out there.

&amp;#x200B;

\- **Have a clear goal in mind, but be flexible:**

&amp;#x200B;

One of the collaborations I'm most fond of is the track ""Cursos"". While playing solo, this track was always the darkest song in the album. My low pitched voice with a guitar that kept you hanging and the constant tension of the song made for a stressful track that I liked a lot. I always had a fixed idea of having some keys in that track, some pads to make the ambient even darker and to keep a sensation of dread throughout the track.

That original idea disappeared once I head what César played on the track. He wrote a beautiful bossa-nova line that changed the mood from despair into hopeful melancholy. I was amazed. It was nothing like I had envisioned but it worked perfectly. I knew he had written something that was better for the track than what I thought was the correct procedure. I could've easily told him to scrape what he had played and to play as I intended but I knew that was a mistake.

&amp;#x200B;

Being flexible is a huge part, in my opinion, of working in projects. Of course, if someone suggests something that goes against your vision and your values then by all means refuse, however, improvements and ideas that come out of nowhere and that improve the value of your art are amazing. The least you could do is consider what they may bring to the table. If you decide it's not gonna cut it, then be gentle and tell them. It's your project after all, but keep in mind that perhaps there are ideas better than the ones you can come up with and it would be idiotic to ignore them in order to boost your ego.

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion:**

&amp;#x200B;

I've said it a million times and I'll say it again: /r/BedroomBands is perhaps the greatest thing to happen to Reddit during 2018. Seriously. Think about how insane it sounds to someone that you can get to record with high quality musicians from all around the world for free. I believe that this will be a huge part of the future of musical collaborations and development in the future. I'm really glad some talented individuals gave me the chance and the trust to record with me and accept and share my vision. You guys are great.

I truly hope, from the bottom of my heart, that something on this album resonates with you. The most beautiful thing about music is the ability to bring people together, and bringing together a group of total strangers that don't even live on the same continent is a very powerful idea.

**Tips on how to survive college**

Scoring good grades, then a successful college application is one step into a successful college career. However much is needed for its success. It is not just a walk in the park to making it in the graduation list thus much is needed. Right from freshman and beyond, a determined mind to make it through is required. Above all make your college life one full of memories and don’t forget to be yourself in whatever you do. Make new friends, have fun while still learning and get the most out of your college experience.

Check out this tips on how you can survive college and make the best out of it.

**Go to orientation.**

This is the first survival tip for college life. Sounds boring right? College tour again? Yes, it’s very vital. It will help your learn how everything works. You will get to learn on what you need to know to get your career started on the right foot. It’s an opportunity where you will get to learn on how to set up your student portal, register your course online, get to know your academic advisors etc. Therefore, in as much as you may want to skip it, it’s one really important stage of college life.

**Get organized.**

Unlike high school, college comes with a lot of freedom. Thus organizing yourself is vital. Get a calendar and mark those dates or get an app that will help you organize your work,mostly for the assignments. For college, no one is going to see you through your homework and see that you meet the due dates. It’s all your responsibility to ensure that you do your work perfectly and meet the time deadlines. Remember the quality of your assignment matters in scooping the excellent grades. It is for that reason that[ topacademicwriter.com](https://topacademicwriter.com/) will always be a click away in ensuring that you meet the quality requirements and don’t miss the due dates.

**Go to class and make good notes.**

Classes may be boring mostly for the morning 8 am classes right?  The bed may be too warm to get out and attend that class. Don’t let yourself fall for that temptation. Attending each class is very vital. You might get an idea of what to expect on the tests or even a review of assignment due dates which might save you late submissions. In attending classes also, make sure that you make some really good notes. Write in a way that you can comprehend and be sure not leave behind any key points and whatever illustrations from your professor. Take down what you feel is important.

**Get yourself an ideal place to study.**

Get yourself a place where you can have a period of effective studying. Get a place with zero or minimal disruptions where you will have a chance to give 100%  attention to your studies. It might be a study area in your dorm or one corner of the library. Whatever place may be convenient for you, be sure to locate one for your routine studies.

**Be accountable for your actions. Avoid making bad decisions.**

At college, everyone will see you as an adult now. And as they say, adulthood means you can take responsibility for everything that you do. Therefore it’s all upon you now as college life comes with everything  from drugs, parties, random hookups etc. Be sure you involve yourself in a lifestyle you can handle to the very end. Don’t let all this divert you from your main objective when you stepped your foot into college. Be yourself. If you never did it earlier, why do it now?

**Your finances.**

Managing your finances is one of the challenges you are most likely to face. However, keep track of your finances. Make yourself a budget. It is also important to find a way to stretch your money. Do not strain your budget on irrelevant things. Remember you might need to get external academic help. Be sure that for whatever academic company you choose, the fee they charge is reasonable and worth the pay.[ Topacademicwriter.com](https://topacademicwriter.com/) is here for you in case you are stuck on getting the most convenient company.

**Seek for job and internship opportunities.**

On the graduation day, one thing that scares most graduands is what next after graduation. Everyone you interact with in college could help you solve this. May it be your course mate, your professor or your roommate. They could all be of help in securing you that internship or job. Remember to always reach out for[ topacademicwriter.com](https://topacademicwriter.com/) for your resume and cover letters.  If it fails, then you can volunteer in your department. College life basically grants you the chance to prepare, plan and even act on your future.

**Make time for yourself.**

Finally as said earlier, be yourself.  Give your brains a break from all the week’s stress once in a while. Watch that TV show, go jogging, attend those yoga classes, whatever may be your interest, make sure you do it. You don’t have to get stressed over the endless bothering assignments, projects and homework.[ Topacademicwriter.com](https://topacademicwriter.com/) is here to step in and be part of your success. We are here to handle the projects and assignments and leave you enough time to give yourself a break and concentrate more on your assignments.

Hope the tips enlighten you on how you can make the best out of your college life. And since college comes with numerous college papers,[ topacademicwriter.com](https://topacademicwriter.com/) will always be here for you. Don’t be reluctant to make that single click and place you request."

The network, pointing to instances where Trump has criticized Acosta and CNN, also sought ""permanent relief,"" or a declaration from Judge Kelly that President Trump's revocation of Acosta's press pass violated the constitution. If successful, this legal conculsion could have wide ranging implications for other White House reporters. 

CNN, represented by **[Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher](https://www.law.com/law-firm-profile/?id=119&amp;name=Gibson-Dunn)** partner Theodore Boutrous, pointed to instances where Trump publicly criticized Acosta and CNN as “fake news.” Kelly appeared to question whether the decision to revoke Acosta’s credentials was driven by the content of his coverage—raising First Amendment issues—or instead by his conduct at a press conference on Nov. 7, which the White House cited as the reason.

**“Why now,” after previously criticizing Acosta’s coverage, was the White House revoking Acosta’s press pass?** Kelly asked Boutrous.

Boutrous recalled that Trump described Acosta as “rude” for refusing to hand over a microphone and yield to other reporters at last week’s press conference. “‘Rudeness’ is really a codeword for ‘I don’t like you being an aggressive reporter,’” said Boutrous, who was joined in court by a Gibson Dunn team including Theodore Olson, a partner at the firm and former solicitor general under the George W. Bush administration.

Justice Department attorney James Burnham defended the White House’s decision, saying the move was based on Acosta’s conduct and not content. He told Kelly: “**A single journalist’s attempt to monopolize a press conference is not a viewpoint**.” Burnham said CNN has about 50 other employees with so-called “hard passes” to access the White House. -[law.com](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2018/11/14/judge-plans-swift-ruling-in-cnn-suit-against-trump-over-press-access/?slreturn=20181016100702)

Earlier this month while asking Trump about a northbound migrant caravan making its way to the southern US border, Acosta challenged Trump's characterization of the group as an ""invasion."" 

Acosta asked ""**Why did you characterize it as such?**"" to which Trump replied ""because I consider it an invasion. You and I have a difference of opinion."" 

""**Do you think that you demonized immigrants**?"" Acosta shot back. 

""Not at all, no - not at all,"" Trump replied. ""I want them to come into the country, but they have to come in legally. **You know, they have to come in Jim through a process. And I want people to come in, and we need the people**.""

Acosta then questioned Trump on an midterm advertisement showing ""migrants climbing over walls and so-on,"" to which Trump fired back: ""They weren't actors."" 

After more barbs were exchanged between the two, Trump said: ""**Honestly, I think you should let me run the country, you run CNN, and if you did it well, your ratings would be much better."" **

Acosta then refused to sit down, leading to a **standoff** in which a White House aide tried to take his microphone.

Acosta's press pass was pulled shortly thereafter, while controversy erupted over whether or not White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders had released a doctored version of a video showing Acosta brushing a White House aide's arm away.

9xnblh,10,2018-11-16,How do I do this?,Venez_Voir,minimalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/minimalism/comments/9xnblh/how_do_i_do_this/,"Hey folks
     
Minimalism is something I've been interested in for a while and had various purges over the past ~5 years but don't feel like I've ever quite reached that point.
    
The purges have been good, but now I've accumulated stuff that I regularly use or have plans to use and there is too much of it! I often have to move 8 different things just to get to what I need.
     
Some context, I am mid 20s computer science university student, who works a ""get me by"" job and has also done internships and the like. I don't keep any work from either jobs or from university. I house share with 2 friends, and so far I've managed to contain everything in my quite large room.
    
Most of the ""junk"" clothing I have is for my job as it's in a dirty warehouse and it ruins clothes. I have been working there for about 5 years and have slowly gone through clothes from my teenage years. The problem is people have bought me replacement clothes for said job, which has meant my net clothes in and clothes out is probably positive, but I am still using the clothes regularly.
    
I own 2 cars and have A LOT of tools to fix the cars. The tools cannot go, they have saved me money and more importantly taught me skills. Additionally they are useful when a friend is in need of some help. 
    
One car is a fun car, the other is needed. I can probably sell the fun car and free up some space in the house that is used to store parts for it. Even then I don't think that will help much as it's effectively 2 boxes under the bed...
    
I also own a desktop, 2 monitors, 2 laptops, no tv. A bunch of keyboards and mice and cables for computers/tech. Just various bits and bobs that do get used/come in handy.
     
There is also other things such as hiking equipment (winter stuff too, crampons, ice axe), books, a piano (don't play very much anymore, but would like to, just there is piles of crap on the seat...), drawers full of important documents, typical things that most people have. 
     
I have about 20 pairs of footwear - they are next on my streamline list, bought cheap over the years.
    
**What I'm trying to say is - I have a lot of stuff that I *think* I regularly use and don't know how to purge it. Is it a case of making a list of stuff and recognizing that I don't use it and then purging that and repeat? Any other techniques?**

[BALANCE]

Lumeris:

* Lumeris can now reduce Inflation on themselves by printing their dust into the shape of other factions money.
* If there are a lot of Lumeris they may start doing what the people with the Dust tell them to. Moreso than usual anyway. In fact, 5% more.
* Galactic Real Estate Prices are now immune to inflation due to the Lumeris being too big to fail.
* Lumeris get even more Less Inflation from trading companies
* Lumeris can now avoid like half the marketplace taxes. They still pay the other half only so the owner of the marketplace won't declare war on them.

Vodyani:

* The Holy Bureaucracy of the Virtual Saint's Arkbuilding Administration has been expanded to allow different kinds of Arks!
* If there are a lot of Vodyani their ships go faster due to threatening to leech the essence of space traffic cops
* The Holy Bureaucracy of the Virtual Saint's Draft Office now always drafts some of the drained souls of innocent bystanders.
* The Holy Bureaucracy of the Virtual Saint's Essence Logistics Agency now keeps track of not just how much Essence is gained but also how much is used up
* Vodyani aren't so bad at being alive anymore the presence of even one pop of them instantly halves agricultural output across a whole system.
* Making better space-to-ground soul draining devices is easier now
* Bigger space-to-ground soul draining devices will not consume more peoples souls. From the scout abducting a small town population to a mighty carrier scooping up a whole continents population and then putting their souls into storage can.
* The Divine Order of All Must Do Something isn't being taken as serious anymore due to Sophons uploading Scientist Memes to Vodyani Arks.
* Space-to-ground soul draining devices can now also be used to scoop up the crews of destroyed ship for the purpose of stealing their souls.

Horatio:

* Horatio Engineers have been successful in making gun turrets more gorgeous, allowing Horatio ships to have more of them without becoming Ugly like other faction ones.
* In a wild act of Wrong, the perfect genes trait is cheaper for custom factions now. Being Imperfect beings unlike Horatio, the devs at Amplitude cannot grasp the Cost of Perfection!
* Turns out the Price of Perfection isn't as much as previously thought and Horatio just got a really bad deal at the shipyard.
* Horatio has finally granted his subjects his full set of genetimedical expertise, allowing them to make Inferior pops into unreasonably handsome ones at a reasonable price.

Riftborn:

* Riftborn hate Life As We Know It so much, they'd rather stay on a sterile planet than a habitable one, and for once that isn't all talk.
* The Grand Viceroy of New Coroz now seeks to optimize living space on sterile planets so as to limit the terrible fate of having to live on a planet with life as much as possible.
* Singularities have been widened thanks to application of primitive tools on the level of space-time itself, making them less powerful but letting their effect be empire-wide.


Hissho:

* Sacred Ceremonies can't be done 20 times in a row in order to bring the population into 20 times a holy frenzy anymore.
* Hey Hissho Yo Bureaucracy so Inefficent having too many systems makes your homeworld useless
* Hissho colonization cap has been lowered by one
* Hissho AI now gets free honour from Honour Clicker.

Unfallen:

* Thanks to new spaceborne mega-fertilizer, Unfallen vines now spread faster and decay slower, even when incomplete!

United Empire:

* Mezari Population now give some more influence, yet not as much as proper Imperial Patriots!
* They're worse at Science though.
* Sheredyn Patriots will now not just fight even harder but also agree to Emperor Zelevas more!
* Thanks to Emperor Zelevas cunning negotiation strategy, science agreements give more science now!
* The giant talking Zelevas face now motivates Patriots of all species! For under the rule of Emperor Zelevas, we are all working for a brighter future together!
* Imperial Patriots now also spread the will of the Emperor when toiling for the Emperor.
* Choosing the right path and staying the United Empire now makes your glorious industrial powerhouses even more powerful, rather than something about talking with Patriots who do not know of their loyalty to Zelevas yet.
* Sheredyn troops now produce propaganda sketches when not on deployment, for great influence gain!


Accompanying tweaks:

Economy:

* You can't get your population really hyped for the Great Crusade against the Space Frogs of Froskur Prime anymore, you need to actually fight Major factions.
* Trade companies have stopped buying freighters with dust plating, given how the exorbitant dust cost of dust plating made dust-plated freighters really expensive, plus it attracted pirates making them very unprofitable.

Space Battle:

* Conventional Strategy has been discarded and replaced with a new, more conventional form of conventional strategy
* Military science has been formalized much, resulting in you having to actually have people come up with new battle tactics rather than just use what they did in some movie script you found on a backwater planet.
* It turns out basic plasma beams in used by militaries all over the galaxy had been set for space blowtorch use all along! They have been tweaked to fire in Destructation mode now.

Others:

* The science party has been concluded that putting interns in new buildings to watch out for fire and tell someone in case they see one is not a proper cost-saving measure over actual fire prevention systems, making the Dirty Hands Act far less effective.
* Being a dirty pirate is easier now.


[FIXES] 

* If you for some reason try to stripmine the ancient lodestones that will seal the fate of the galaxy either way, the game doesn't crash anymore.
* Heroes have been schooled in extensive courses on how to actually turn on their mic before they try to give motivational speeches to their fleet.
* You can't trick the AI into terraforming planets for you anymore.
* All Juggernaut weapons are now functional, fully loaded and operational(I didn't even change that one!)

It's frustrating to me as I worked so hard my first year of college to obtain a 4.0 GPA along with completely self-studying for Exam P and passing. In addition, I was in a couple clubs and felt my interviews went really well. It has mainly been bringing me down as of late since I don't know where I could possibly improve to give myself better chances to get an internship along with making me feel unsure if I could even get a full-time position after college since I might not have any internship experience whatsoever. Is there anything I can do to set myself apart from other candidates? I'm taking FM in December and told employers that by time of graduation I plan to have 3 exams passed. I just don't know what else I can do at this point, so any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks!"
9xo812,1,2018-11-16,Turbulent College Semester,MecEngJr,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/9xo812/turbulent_college_semester/,"Hello all! I am just looking for some advice/support with my current situation. I am a second year Mechanical Engineering student and have just been on a mental down spiral. I think a lot of this is from my summer internship where I was introduced to the corporate world. I was working in the petroleum industry as a project manager and didn't have the best mentor. I got stuck with a large turn-around project and didn't feel like I had very many people supporting me and my prospects. There were many days in my job where I just wanted to shut the door to my office and cry, but I knew that wasn't the best thing for the company and it would only make the situation worse. Instead I kept trying to persevere. I know to a large company you are just a number, but as a young, budding engineer I'd at least like to feel invested in. When it came to my evaluation at the end of my term I was told I need to ""work on my presentation skills"". This made me feel very insignificant because I gained the respect of my peers and I think that is hard to do as an intern in just a few months. I think having this experience really set me back and made me feel like an inadequate engineer. I keep trying to prove to myself that I can work in the engineering industry and be a brilliant engineer. I was hoping to gain confidence with my internship, but instead it tore me down. I went back to school not having coped with the situation and immediately my already existing anxiety was at a new high.I transferred to the university I am studying mechanical engineering at, so I have completed the majority of my general education credits and have core classes left. I started off the semester with 5 core math and science classes at 13 credits. I thought I could do it because many of my peers took 6 classes and were okay. I guess I was in over my head and was crying pretty much every night. I knew that the correct course of action was to talk to a counselor through my university. After a couple of sessions with her, we decided that the best option was to drop a class I was taking and take it next semester. At first, things seemed to start looking up. I felt better and was excited to learn again. I felt like I finally got back on my feet and could conquer this semester...until I started having health problems. I ended up falling ill with a pretty bad case of laryngitis and was prescribed 50 mg of prednisone by a nurse practitioner at a local clinic. After a few days of being on the medication, I felt better. This dissipated on day 3 where I felt completely wired and couldn't sleep. I discontinued the medication and then ended up going through the withdrawal process. I was extremely depressed during this time and I didn't think I was going to make it through some days. Now two weeks behind in classes, I decided to go back for a Thursday (my busiest days) and try to catch up a little. I went back and my teammates for one of my practice courses did not complete their portion of a lab report. I was upset by this because I had been gone for two weeks and they were still relying on me to complete the work. I stayed up and helped them finish the report, but that had put me behind on packing for my trip home to see my doctor that weekend. This whole thing spun me into a episode where I couldn't sleep for 36 hours and felt overwhelmingly and increasingly anxious. After speaking with my doctor, we decided it might be best for me to take a one week medical leave at home. Things once again started to improve and I tried to return to my campus last Saturday. There I was able to be productive and finish a long overdue report. But once again, I struggled to fall asleep at night and ended having a full-blown panic attack. I ended up, once again, taking this past week off to stay at home.

At this point I'm not really sure what to do. Being sick with laryngitis and consistently being confined to my apartment makes me now anxious in my whole apartment. I cannot sleep in my room because I feel confined there. On top of that, the people next door are loud and my roommate can be sometimes as well. I have been trying to keep-up with my classes on home by watching the recorded video lectures, but am nervous that upon my return everything will just crumble again. I don't want to quit because there are only 4 weeks left in the semester, but I don't know if continuing is the best for my mental health. I am also starting to question whether going to school next semester is even a good idea. I have been trying to work with my doctor to see a psychiatrist but they don't have openings until January. I know seeing the psychiatrist won't be an overnight fix and am nervous that I won't have enough time to get the actual help I need in the short period of time of winter break. I don't know how to go about telling my parents this either. The school I am going to is my dad's alma mater and I would be devastated if I had to leave because I had a reaction to a medication. I also don't know how to talk to my future employer about this issue. I accepted an internship opportunity for a position with one of my dream companies. It would absolutely crush me to have that taken away. People keep telling me this is a small bump in the road, but it is hard to see that right now due to my crippling anxiety and having the general feeling of being a little beat down right now."

Antwoorden van de Minister voor Buitenlandse Handel en Ontwikkelingssamenwerking op vragen van het lid Alkaya &amp;#40;SP&amp;#41; over de Nederlandse en de Europese inzet in het kader van het VN-verdrag over mensenrechten en het bedrijfsleven  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 1  
&amp;nbsp;    
Kunt u een terugkoppeling geven aan de Kamer over uw bijdrage aan en de resultaten van de vierde onderhandelingsronde van de Open Ended Intergovernmental Working Group &amp;#40;OEIGWG&amp;#41; over het VN-verdrag over mensenrechten en het bedrijfsleven, die van 15 tot en met 19 oktober heeft plaatsgevonden in Geneve?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord   
&amp;nbsp;    
Het resultaat van de vierde bijeenkomst van de open-ended intergouvernementele werkgroep &amp;#40;OEIGWG&amp;#41; is dat voorzitter Ecuador op basis van de discussies een nieuw concept zal presenteren. De Europese Dienst voor extern optreden &amp;#40;EDEO&amp;#41; nam namens de EU-lidstaten deel aan de OEIGWG. Nederland droeg actief bij aan de voorbereiding, onder meer door het onderwerp te agenderen binnen de EU raadswerkgroep voor mensenrechten &amp;#40;COHOM&amp;#41;. Ook werd mede op initiatief van Nederland in juni 2018 een expertbijeenkomst georganiseerd om dit onderwerp vanuit verschillende invalshoeken te bespreken tussen de lidstaten. De uitkomsten van de expertbijeenkomst zijn meegenomen in het non-paper van de EU, waaraan Nederland ook bilateraal heeft bijgedragen. De hoofdlijnen van het non-paper vormden de basis voor de EU-interventies tijdens de OEIGWG.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 2  
&amp;nbsp;    
Kunt u daarbij specifiek ingaan op de rol die de Europese Unie &amp;#40;EU&amp;#41; heeft gespeeld tijdens de vierde onderhandelingsronde, met een toelichting omtrent wie er namens de EU deelgenomen heeft aan de onderhandelingen? Klopt het dat de EU-vertegenwoordiging niet aanwezig was op het moment dat de lidstaten de conclusies en aanbevelingen zoals voorgesteld door de voorzitter hebben besproken? Zo ja, bent u bereid de EU aan te spreken op haar verantwoordelijkheid in dit proces, rekening houdende met de opmerkingen uit uw brief van 15 oktober 2018 aan de Tweede Kamer en de aangenomen resolutie in het Europees Parlement over het VN-verdrag?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord   
&amp;nbsp;    
De EDEO nam deel namens de EU lidstaten. De EU heeft betrokkenheid getoond bij het onderwerp door aanwezigheid en inbreng tijdens de besprekingen, ondanks de discussie over het ontbreken van een mandaat voor deze vierde werkgroep. De resolutie uit 2014 waarmee het OEIGWG proces werd gestart is onduidelijk over het mandaat. De EU en andere landen hebben geopperd dat Ecuador een mandaatverlenging zou moeten verkrijgen via een nieuwe resolutie van de Mensenrechtenraad. Het gebrek aan een helder mandaat alsook inhoudelijke twijfels hebben ertoe geleid dat landen als Australië, Canada, de Verenigde Staten, Japan en Noorwegen niet meer meedoen aan de besprekingen.   
&amp;nbsp;    
De EU bracht tijdens de werkgroep in dat het uitgangspunt voor een eventueel verdrag de UN Guiding Principles on business and human rights &amp;#40;UNGPs&amp;#41; moeten zijn; het verdrag moet deze principes ondersteunen en hierop voortbouwen. Zo vindt de EU dat een eventueel verdrag net als de UNGPs op alle bedrijven van toepassing moet zijn, niet alleen op bedrijven met transnationale activiteiten zoals de zero draft tekst van het verdrag voorstelt. Ook gaf de EDEO aan dat de EU al werkt aan de versterking van mensenrechten en bedrijfsleven, zoals via de EU-verordening betreffende conflictmineralen en het Non-Financial Reporting Directive.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Mede dankzij de constructieve inzet van Nederland heeft de EU tijdens de besprekingen deze positie kunnen uitdragen. Helaas werd duidelijk dat de voorzitter Ecuador de input van de EU niet zou meenemen in de conclusies en aanbevelingen, zoals het dat in de voorgaande bijeenkomsten ook niet heeft gedaan. De EU heeft om die reden gekozen niet aanwezig te zijn op het moment dat de conclusies en aanbevelingen werden aangenomen. De EU heeft een verklaring afgegeven dat ze zich niet gebonden voelt aan de conclusies en aanbevelingen.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 3  
&amp;nbsp;    
Is het non-paper waar u naar verwijst in uw brief van 15 oktober inmiddels afgerond?1 Zo ja, kunt u dit non-paper aan de Kamer sturen? Zo nee, hoe heeft de EU kunnen interveniëren op basis van dit non-paper?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 4  
&amp;nbsp;    
Kunt u toelichten wie de oorspronkelijk auteur van het non-paper is?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 5  
&amp;nbsp;    
Welke lidstaten hebben het non-paper ondersteund? Zijn er ook lidstaten die de inzet van het non-paper niet hebben onderschreven?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 3, 4 en 5  
&amp;nbsp;    
De EDEO heeft het non-paper gecoördineerd, de lidstaten hebben hierop commentaar gegeven. De EDEO heeft aangegeven het non-paper als een intern en vertrouwelijk stuk te zien, om die reden wordt het niet bijgevoegd in deze beantwoording. De EU heeft kunnen interveniëren, omdat met consensus in de COHOM is overeengekomen dat de EU dat zou doen op basis van de hoofdlijnen van het non-paper. De EU interventies vindt u in de bijlage.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 6  
&amp;nbsp;    
Kunt u ons informeren over de argumenten die worden aangedragen door tegenstanders van dit verdrag? Kunt u uw antwoord toelichten?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord   
&amp;nbsp;    
Het is niet aan het kabinet om de argumenten van tegenstanders toe te lichten.  
&amp;nbsp;    
   
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 7  
&amp;nbsp;    
Gezien uw opmerking dat de EU en de lidstaten de vrijwillige UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights &amp;#40;UNGP’s&amp;#41; als uitgangspunt dienen voor het bindend VN-verdrag over mensenrechten en het bedrijfsleven, kunt u toelichten op welke wijze de UNGP’s volgens u een afdwingbare status zouden kunnen krijgen in een nieuw VN-verdrag? Zijn er ook landen die niet per se de UNGP’s als uitgangspunt zien, en zo ja, welke?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord   
&amp;nbsp;    
De UNGPs moeten het uitgangspunt zijn voor alle ontwikkelingen op het gebied van mensenrechten en bedrijfsleven, omdat ze met consensus door de VN Mensenrechtenraad zijn aangenomen. Dit geeft de UNGPs een gezaghebbend karakter. De principes geven strategische en operationele richtlijnen en zijn daarom niet een-op-een om te zetten in een afdwingbare status. Als wordt nagedacht hoe bindende maatregelen effectief zouden kunnen zijn, moeten deze strategische en operationele richtlijnen wel het uitgangspunt vormen. Er zijn landen die de UNGPs niet per se als uitgangspunt zien. Ecuador en Zuid-Afrika hebben de UNGPs niet opgenomen in zero draft tekst voor het mogelijke verdrag over mensenrechten en bedrijfsleven.  
&amp;nbsp;    
   
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 8  
&amp;nbsp;    
Welke Europese instelling dan wel bestuurlijke laag is verantwoordelijk voor de inzet van de EU tijdens de OEIGWG-onderhandelingen? Op basis van welk mandaat komt deze inzet tot stand en wordt zij afgestemd met de lidstaten?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord   
&amp;nbsp;    
Mensenrechten betreffen een gezamenlijke bevoegdheid van de EU en haar lidstaten. Tot nu toe spreekt de EDEO namens de lidstaten, omdat er geen formeel EU-mandaat is. De inzet is tot stand gekomen binnen de EU-raadswerkgroep voor mensenrechten &amp;#40;COHOM&amp;#41;.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 9  
&amp;nbsp;    
Kunt u toelichten wat u precies bedoelt met “de politieke insteek van de initiatiefnemers”?1  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord   
&amp;nbsp;    
Met ‘politieke insteek’ wordt bedoeld dat de initiatiefnemers de UNGPs niet hebben opgenomen als internationaal leidend kader. Hierdoor werd de focus van de verantwoordelijkheid verzwaard richting transnationaal opererende bedrijven, terwijl de UNGPs juist goed de verantwoordelijkheden benoemen van staten én alle bedrijven.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 11 [Vraag 10 is niet gesteld]  
&amp;nbsp;    
Wat is uw oordeel over de ‘zero draft’ van het VN-verdrag over mensenrechten en het bedrijfsleven die besproken is tijdens de vierde onderhandelingsronde? Kunt u daarbij toelichten welke juridische struikelblokken u identificeert?   
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord   
&amp;nbsp;    
De zero draft tekst is relatief kort; hij bevat vijftien artikelen in tien pagina’s tekst. Gezien de complexiteit van de materie betekent dit dat er veel abstracte en algemene bewoordingen worden gebruikt, waarvan de reikwijdte en de praktische uitwerkingen nog onduidelijk zijn. Ter illustratie, artikel 5 van de zero draft tekst van Ecuador gaat over rechtsmacht. In artikel 11 lid 9 en 10 wordt verder de erkenning en de tenuitvoerlegging van beslissingen genoemd. Deze bepalingen laten nog veel vragen onbeantwoord: bijvoorbeeld of gedoeld wordt op rechtsmacht op het gebied van straf- civiel, of administratief recht, hoe de bepalingen in de praktijk moeten worden geïmplementeerd en wat de verhouding is met bestaande internationale afspraken op dit gebied. Ter vergelijking, de EU Verordening 44/2011 betreffende rechterlijke bevoegdheid, erkenning en de tenuitvoerlegging van beslissingen gaat alleen over burgerlijke en handelszaken en beslaat 76 artikelen in zeventien pagina’s tekst en 6 bijlagen.   
&amp;nbsp;    
De zero draft tekst bevat verder diverse bepalingen die raken aan bestaande internationale afspraken, bijvoorbeeld op het gebied van handel en investeringen, wederzijdse rechtshulp en internationaal privaatrecht, zonder dat duidelijk wordt gemaakt hoe de voorgestelde verdragstekst zich tot deze bestaande afspraken verhoudt. Andere bepalingen in de zero draft raken aan onderwerpen die primair in nationaal recht geregeld worden, zoals de aansprakelijkheid van bedrijven voor schade veroorzaakt door dochters of contractuele partners en de strafrechtelijke aansprakelijkheid van bedrijven. Dit alles betekent dat een verdrag geschoeid op de leest van de zero draft tekst vergaande implicaties kan hebben voor zowel het internationaal recht als het nationaal recht. Tot slot wordt in zero draft tekst geen enkele verwijzing naar de UNGP’s gemaakt en wordt de benadering gehandhaafd om het verdrag alleen van toepassing te laten zijn op transnationale activiteiten met winstoogmerk. Dit betekent dat niet alle bedrijven eronder zouden vallen, hetgeen niet wenselijk is.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 12  
&amp;nbsp;    
Op welke wijze zouden volgens u via protocollen die toegevoegd kunnen worden aan bestaande VN-verdragen afspraken over mensenrechten en het bedrijfsleven bindend kunnen worden gemaakt?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord   
&amp;nbsp;    
Het is niet mogelijk hier in algemene zin antwoord op te geven, omdat rekening moet worden gehouden met onder meer het specifieke doel van een eventueel voorgesteld protocol, de tekst van het desbetreffende verdrag en de politieke context. Wel wil ik hier opmerken dat overheden onder bestaande VN mensenrechtenverdragen al verplicht zijn hun burgers te beschermen tegen mensenrechtenschendingen door bedrijven.  
&amp;nbsp;    
   
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 13  
&amp;nbsp;    
Kunt u uw antwoorden toesturen voor het algemeen overleg van 31 oktober 2018 over de Raad Buitenlandse Zaken/Handel van 9 november 2018?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord   
&amp;nbsp;    
Dit is helaas niet gelukt.)

9xp11b,11,2018-11-16,"Becoming an Expert in your own Illness, updated and revisited",ShindyCool,schizophrenia,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/9xp11b/becoming_an_expert_in_your_own_illness_updated/,"So I wanted to share a little bit of what helped me along my journey with this illness. This will be a rehash of what I've already written a few months ago with some new ideas.

My therapist and I talked about me becoming an expert in my own disease. This involves knowing your early warning signs of psychosis and thus making small dosage adjustments yourself. On the other hand it means being on the minimum effective dose to minimize side effects like fatigue and concentration problems. Which is a tricky thing, because they can also be caused by the illness itself. Here's what I have learned since I started therapy last May.

So a little background information about me. I'm diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder which is treated with a low to moderate dose of risperidone only(1.5 to 2.75 mg). My positve symptoms consist mostly of paranoia and delusions, hallucinations rarely occured and only under extreme sleep deprivation. I've had long periods of being almost symptom free. I've still had mild paranoia like my neighbor hacking my wifi, but that did not disrupt my everyday life. In between I've had episodes, about once or twice a year for two weeks, where the biggest problem was insomnia and paranoia to the point that I could not leave the house. Sometimes I became depressed when the insomnia was over. I'm considered high functioning.

The first years with this illness I was on a constant dosage of my antipsychotic. Retrospectively this was good because I would have been overwhelmed if I had to make constant changes. Also my insight was pretty limited, which was also due to me sticking with a shitty psychiatrist and psychotherapist for teenagers because I could not find another one in my area. The thing was, I was never told to increase the dose during my smaller episodes(only had one big psychotic break which was the onset of my illness), or to decrease it when being symptom free but tired. In high school I was called the walking sleeping pill sometimes.

Luckily I started going to a good psychiatrist for adults and he referred me to a new therapist. In my country psychiatrists only have fifteen minutes time for you every four months if you're relatively stable so they outsource nearly everything to the therapists. Which includes education on antipsychotic medication. Taking it is the most effective thing you can do to keep you illness under control. But there is also so much else you can do, like reducing unnecessary stress, especially in relationships, regular sleeping patterns and living an overall healthy lifestyle.

So let's talk about the pills. The strategy which my therapist taught me to apply lead to me having more academic success and being able to work for the first time in my life. My father is proud of me and said that this was the longest time period in that I'm doing well ever since the onset of my illness. In fact, I've had no episode of insomnia for about one year now. I've picked up old hobbies again and was able to go on ski vacation twice this year. So what did I do?

If I know I have a stressful event coming up, I stop and think whether I need a small dose increase. Most of the time there isn't much needed, I'm talking about 0.25 to 0.5 mg risperidone in my case. Many times I don't even need to increase my meds at all. I needed to develop the instinct for that. Is this event hindering my ability to sleep beforehand? Am I becoming a little paranoid that something bad might happen to me then, even though there is no proof of it? That would be arguments for upping my dosage a bit.

For example when I have an exam coming up, I'm very nervous because the grade counts and a few nights before I notice that I need longer to fall asleep, I increase my meds a little bit. That way I'm still able to study without freaking out and cancelling the exam last minute. Sometimes I take 250 mg of L-Theanine right before the exam which helps with test taking anxiety. Afterwards I think about whether to reduce the dose again or if I should stay on it longer.

Next example. I've had a concert with my student choir in coorperation with another one this year with an audience of about 1500 people. I increased my dosage two weeks in advance when we practiced the most and then again three days before the concert. In went well even though I had to switch positions with my therapist(yes you read that right) in the dress rehearsal.

On the other hand, if people tell me I look very tired even though I have slept enough, I view it as a sign to talk to a professional about reducing my meds a little bit. But the biggest realization of how important it is to take action fast was when I suddenly had positive symptoms for the first time in months again. I was sick before and noticed my thoughts becoming more and more weird, but because I was sick I slept so much that an increase to prevent insomnia wasn't necessary yet. After a night of normal sleep and not sleeping at daytime I went on my computer that saturday and suddenly had thoughts that someone might be watching what I do online. It came to the point that I had to turn of my computer to ""prevent"" it from happening. When it was medtime, I upped my evening dosage by 0.25 mg and did the same the next morning.

On that sunday I managed to get to choir practice of another choir I sing in, but I had increasing thoughts of the other singers talking about me behind my back. If I had not increased my meds immediately, I would not have gone to practice or worse, would have to leave early like I had to flee. I called my therapist the next day and got an emergency appointment. He said I prevented the worst and did everything right. I'm sure that I have prevented an episode of insomnia that way. This is why I view agreements on prn medication as very important since you can't reach out to someone professional on the weekend or at night that easily.

I am still successfully using the strategy described above and I have not had any psychotic symptoms since the situation I described two paragraphs before, which was in April this year. Also no night of bad sleep. Speaking of sleep, I stopped going to parties late at night or staying aware for other reasons. It's a tradeoff I'm making for less episodes and better mental health. If I don't get an episode after staying up late I still might catch a cold, or might at least need multiple days to not feel tired again. I also made much personal progress this year. I landed an internship which turned into a part-time job, which I'm now working at while still studying. Thanks to the disability office I got extra time for my seminar thesis which I turned in last month. I recommend getting help there if you're in school, I should have done that way earlier.

Now let's talk about some other things you can do, but I will only cover the surface here. Let me know if you're interested in me going into detail on anything.

Read books on psychology, mental illness, schizophrenia, and so on. You're not the first person with these kind of problems and other people have already found a solution. Well, technically not a solution because there is no cure yet, but there is much you can do. You will find information on symptoms, medication, other forms of treatment, outcomes and rehabilitation. I recommend A First Rate Madness, The Ultra Mind Solution and Surviving Schizophrenia. But remember to take the two latter ones with a grain of salt. There's good information in them, but there also is the gluten free and schizophrenics can't do shit BS in them. I will keep my eyes open for better books soon, two good ones I've read do not have a translation in english sadly.

I would recommend taking an Omega-3 supplement and getting enough Vitamin D. I've even read somewhere that antipsychotics might lower your levels of that hormone. Q10 also helped me but I currently can't afford it.

What helped me is having regular events that are a little bit exciting, where you experience a little bit of mostly positve stress. For example choir practice, public speaking jobs like holding tutorials if you're a college student, or just meeting multiple friends. You can use these as an indicator of your current mental health. Are you enjoying it, or do you think they are talking about you behind your back? Are you having fun with them, or are they laughing about you. Can you talk without problems? Are you even going there, or are you staying at home? Asking these kind of questions you can determine if you're on the right track or you might need some help from your therapist or through additional medication.

Another big thing for me is having the right mindset. Everything will turn out alright. It's in your hands. You're not a victim.

If you're in a state where you can't get much done, do one thing a day. But pick the thing you're the most afraid of, and only focus on that for two hours. If you made progress, you reached your goal for today. That's better than trying to get ten things done and doing nothing in the end.

I started doing Yoga recently, which improves my physical and mental well-being. There are even studies on it as an add-on therapy for patients with schizophrenia. If that's not for you, do some other kind of exercise like swimming or strength training, which I can also recommend. It can counter the fatigue you might get from your medication.

Also my therapist and I talked about thinking outside the box. For example I notice that I always have minor psychotic symptoms in the first few warm days in spring. Theoretically I could watch the weather forecast at the end of next winter and increase my meds before the nice weather even starts. It's these individual things that are different in everyone with this illness where you can find creative solutions to decrease your suffering and improve you functioning and well-being.

*****

**Warning:** Only make changes to your medication on your own if you have talked to your doctor about it, he agreed and told you exactly in which increments you are allowed to do it on your own. Always inform your doctor about your reason why a change to your medication was necessary. Don't wean off medication on your own. Things might get more complicated if you're taking other medication than an antipsychotic. If you or your doctor don't feel safe making changes yourself then you shouldn't do it.

Lastly, I want to thank you for reading this far and ask you what are your unique coping strategies? How have they helped you? What are your goals for 2019, which other things do you want to start doing to improve your mental health? Have a nice weekend."

Maybe it's the combination of graduate school and working, both entail work on the road with vulnerable people. It just reminds me of my cousin who had autism and committed suicide and it makes me sad that he couldn't enjoy his own life. But on the other hand, I'm getting everything done and have been purging my entire apartment of everything I don't want. I think about cutting myself (which I haven't for over a year) and sometimes it consumes my thoughts so that I can do it and then continue to be productive. I need to relieve my tension in some way that doesn't take much time. I've been doing it in other ways like sending NSFW pictures of myself which is so unlike me. Also, feeling closer to Jesus and praying which does not happen often (I don't believe in God but during a manic episode I began to feel like Jesus and I've kept the crosses up). I feel like the pressures are weighing in on me and every hour I spend in my car to and from work/my internship I'm slowly losing it. I even went to my AA meeting and cried and admitted that I have bipolar and it's making my life difficult. I'm hoping that next week my short break will help my stability, but otherwise I just keep holding on and doing what I can (not eat too much crap, rest, therapy, mental health meeting which I've been skipping, my AA meetings). Is this a mixed episode? I have no idea and I should be fine on the steady stream of lithium. Thanks for listening."
9xpl3z,5,2018-11-16,Wordpress site for showcasing my homelab to potential internship employers?,jtbis,homelab,https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/9xpl3z/wordpress_site_for_showcasing_my_homelab_to/,"I will be graduating with a bachelor's degree in IT next winter and I don't have much work experience in the IT field.  The tech internships in my city are extremely competitive and I want to be able to show employers that, although my work history doesn't show it, I do have lots of hands-on experience dealing with enterprise level computing.  I am thinking about including a link to it on my resume.  It will just be a Wordpress site with some pictures and text posts about the lab, as well as a digital copy of my resume information.  It will also be hosted on Amazon EC2 since my internet connection is shit (F U ~~Comcast~~ Xfinity).

&amp;#x200B;

The setup is fairly professional for someone on a student's budget.  Its a Dell R410 running Windows Server 2016 with various Hyper-V machines for experimenting with different OSes.  I've got two separate RAID5 arrays totaling 8TB all backed up to Backblaze B2, OpenVPN Server, DHCP server, DDWRT WiFi access point, IP cameras with website access, personal weather station with its own website...

&amp;#x200B;

Would it be better to code the website myself?  I know JavaScript so it could be nice and interactive, but my CSS isn't great, so a wordpress site would definitely look more professional.

&amp;#x200B;

I know many of you work in the IT field, so how would this look to an employer hiring for a summer internship?  Any comments and advice is greatly appreciated.  "

9xpvg7,0,2018-11-16,Student Loans and Low Prospects,ForgottenScrewup,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/9xpvg7/student_loans_and_low_prospects/,"Before any of you say it. Yes. I fucked up. And I fucked up repeatedly.


First off I took out loans from Sallie Mae to pay for college at a four year (UCSC: CS). Currently the total debt is right around $77k. After sophmore year, the weight of the debt hit me hard, I panicked, flailed, and left Santa Cruz to do college at home. I hadn't done great my sophmore year, I figured I could do some stuff at home for less. At home, I was working while going to school, I fucked up and didn't give myself enough time to do some classes not related directly to my major, and, as a result, I'm still working on that. Currently I might be unable to take classes next semester, but my overall goal is to use the California guaranteed transfer program to get into a nearby CalState. During this semester  (And if I can't take classes next, that one too) I'm carving through classes on coursera. Planning on hopping on github in a little bit and finding a project or two to work on.


Problems: 

Sallie Mae loans just entered repayment. I'm going to call them in a little bit to see whether or not I can continue deferment as long as I'm taking classes. If not, I'm stuck paying 850 or so a month. I'm also making payments on a car, about 250 a month, split between me and my father. He also cosigned on the loans (which I took out when I had just turned 18, and then before I turned 19).

I haven't worked an internship in years and I'm massively anxious that however good I may be, I'm not good enough for an internship regardless of what it is.

I'm a lying sack of shit, and my dad thinks that I'm doing great on classes. I honestly don't know how to come clean at this point. He's in on the debt with me, so I don't know how to talk to him about it. Between living that lie and all my friends telling me that I'm doing great, or trying to explain away the shittiness with depression and/or anxiety, I feel like shit most of the time. Every time it feels like I start making progress, something comes up from my screwups and sends me back a while.


Not Problems:

My parents are graciously letting me live at home for now, so I don't have to pay rent. I have a good car that has low monthly payments. I live in a nice area with a few decent colleges nearby. I currently have a shitty serving job, I can make about 300-500 a week at over about 21 hours.

I actually really like programming. I have no problems with any of my coding classes, and I've been reading outside of them for a while. I do feel a little bit aimless when I don't have a class to focus me in on a specific thing though.


Overall, I don't know for sure what the best course of action is. Should I muscle through school making payments, Would I be better off getting an associates and trying to find a job with that? Obviously I should talk with my dad, but I have no idea how to start that conversation."

Commute to school or downtown is very tiring, whenever I want to go anywhere I have to plan with the bus schedule that passes every 30 mins and walk in the cold for 15 mins in winter and then I get there an hour later. After getting home from school Im often too tired from the commute to do anything productive.  
  
My neighborhood is full of toddlers and seniors, and I have like one friend here. I want to move to a more student friendly place where i can meet more friends.  
  
I already have a good friend who wants to move out and were considering joining up with a third friend. These 2 guys are super nice and probably my closest friends.  
  
I don't feel safe in my own house. Like I said, parents have no sense of privacy or personal space, the only time to myself that I get is in the shower. When I am jn my room my parents will come to see me once or twice an hour. Large portions of my day are spent beimg lectured by my parents (average of 1 hour a day) or physically fighting with that parent, when they try to break, confiscate or hurt me. Constantly threaten to kick me out whenever we are arguing to control me. Often sneaking up on me, throwing my stuff outside, humiliating me in front of siblings, or just generally beimg infuriating (i tried to play video games for the first time in weeks, that parent comes down 3 times telling me to let my siblings play even though I had been on it for 30 mins, and then knocks my phone out of my hand when she cant snatch the remote, unplugs the console grabs all the remotes and goes to hide them).  All the floors and beds are squeaky so when I go to sleep at 1 or 2 or 3 am i have to lunge and lean on walls to get to my bed without making noise. 
  
I feel demotivated and depressed living here. I know that moving out won't automatically fix anything, but I cant help but feel that Im wasting my life here. For example, I enjoy cooking but I never can because I dont have access to the car so I would have to walk 40 mins to do groceries, the kitchen barely has any utilities or pans or utensils (knives aren't even sharp because worried about safety), and everytime I try to cook I have to make enough for 6 ppl plus leftovers. I once tried to play online video games with a friend with voice chat. That parent came down 5 times to try and catch me talking to someone like I had done something wrong, then yells at me and says ""i hope your friends hear this"" and tries to embarrass me (i was 17).  
  
I am also underweight for my height, and despite going to the gym multiple times a week it is difficult to see progress because the food in our fridge isn't great. Its hard to complain because they buy it, but its a lot of vegetarian snack food and rice and spaghetti, and breads. We rarely eat meat, so most meals I just eat an omelette (can't make elaborate meals for myself if I dont make for everyone). If I want to get enough protein I have to eat ridiculous amounts of peanut butter, yoghurt, milk and eegs. Most dinners are either gross or not filling and even then I can never eat till im full because I have to leave leftovers. Again, complaining would be ungrateful because they buy and cook for us.  
  
**Reasons for not moving out**:  
  
I have a super close relationship with my two younger brothers, and our parents constantly fighting with each and with us means that the rest of us havent fought in years. My little brothers are some of the best people I know and they are both extremely rational and intelligent and fun to be around. I kinda don't want to leave them, and I don't want to be the brother that just visits on weekends and on hollidays. I know that our relationship will be damaged if we lose contact. My parents are also abusive towards them, and my 10 yo brother gets screamed at and humiliated everytime that parent sits down to do homework with them. It pains me to see them both go through the same 8 or 9 abusive years as I did. I do however get the feeling that my parents are maybe getting a little better.  
  
It will certainly make my life more difficult. Ill probably have to work part time, do more chores, I might end up hating my roommates, ill be poor, and I will lose a lot of the luxuries I have here.  
  
I also kinda feel bad for my parents. Depsite threatening to kick me out 30 times, they are sternly opposed to letting me move out. My mom has threatened to cut contact with me completely and says that I am already not on her will (who does that wtf). After a 3h talk with my parents they are willing to maybe stay on good terms if I leave. But I do feel bad for them. The house is shitty and everyone has procrastinated repairs for 10 years... The second shower hasnt been fixed after 10 years since moving here. The basement still lacks a ceiling, the drainage is still broken. The furniture and doors that have been broken by my parents fighting and throwing things at each other are still broken. I actually stopped inviting friends over when they asked why only half of this cupboard had a glass pane, or why the door was dented and bent and broken. I invited a friend over and he asked about the door. The moment I had to lie to that friend in front of my two younger brothers and they both knew I was lying was such a fucked up moment, but I can honestly say that its a drop in the sea. My youngest brother will likely need therapy, the number of times we had to carry him away from our parents or yell for him to go in his room where we would all play loudly and pretend we didn't hear anything is shameful. That parent threatening to kill themselves a dozen or so times, sometimes us yelling obsceneties and super fucked up things right next to the door my sleeping (he was definitely woken up) little brothers, threatening to kill themselves with a shard of glass that broke off. Their marriage is completely failed and they hate and humiliate each other. Constant abuse like interrupting the other person or ignoring them or making them self conscious... This what my siblings see on a regular basis.  
  
I know a lot of families have it bad, but my brothers day consists of getting home, being yelled at while doing homework, trying to isolate themselves while doing homework, coming to dinner and hearing about the fight and issues of the grownups, and then playing more electronics and going to bed. We dont have any nice family moments or traditions, we'll maybe have 30 nice family days a year, and most of them are kn vacation where my parents but on an act because we are in public.  
  
**Financial situation**: I had a summer tech internship last summer (18$/h) and have saved up 5k in my own bank account. I am currently working at a student startup (unpaid, mostly for experience). I am planning ro do another internship next summer, and I have at least already secured a position at last summer's company with a projected (20$/h pay), which will probably net me upwards of 10k before tax once summer ends. (I worked 50h weeks this summer and will do the same).  
  
Rent near my university is approximately 700-900/month for a three bedroom apartment. We will split rent with my friends. I can potentially work 5 hours a week if it comes to that.  
  
I enjoy cooking, have always done the most chores in my house (after parents) and Im not super tidy, but still not that bad.  
  
Just any advice or thoughts you guys would have because this is the extent of my financial knowledge.  "

I’m at a loss. I do all of the assignments, go to every class, turn in all of them but still so badly on my exams. 

I want to apply for internships next year but it doesn’t seem likely that I’ll have a shot. I’m not what to do anymore."
9xqlui,227,2018-11-16,[MF] It took moving out of the apartment to finally lay my former roommate.,irrumare_asinum,gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/9xqlui/mf_it_took_moving_out_of_the_apartment_to_finally/,"Quick backstory: I went to high school with a girl and we were friends but never super close. We ended up going to the same University and hung out quite a bit our freshman year and then moved in together our sophomore year. But by this time, she already had a boyfriend. She has dark hair, tan skin, about 5'2"" and couldn't weigh more than 110lbs. Athletic; she played tennis in college. Very petite and tight body. I am 6'1"" 190lbs with an athletic build and am very shy in general. 

Being from the same hometown, we would drive home together for holidays to save on gas. One trip back to college, we played a strip game in the car. I was driving her car and she kicked my ass in the game, but knowing she had a bf, I never took any clothes off. A missed hint on my end. On another occasion, she was getting ready to go out for dinner with her bf for their 1 year. She called me back from my buddies apartment (2 minute walk away) for me to help her pick out a dress. She tried on a handful of dresses for me to judge which one looked best on her. She also changed dresses in front of me and me being innocent/shy, missed another hint. I never saw her completely naked because she had a strapless bra on, but she sure looked fine as hell in her underwear. The lasthint I missed/ignored, since I knew she had a bf, is she called me to pick her up when her car broke down. Not her bf. She asked how she could repay me and I told her to not worry about it. 

Looking back at this situation, I missed a lot of hints when I lived with her, but the summer I moved out, I did not miss any more. 

The summer I moved out, her bf moved out of state for an internship. First week of summer she visited him and broke up with him. When she came back, she asked to hang out at my apartment. So, she came over and hung out with my roommates and me and we had a fun night of drinking and what not. All of us ended up staying up to 7am and at that point, the sun was rising and my roommates went to bed, leaving Kay and I on the couch together. 

""Aren't you as tired as I am?"" she asked me with half open eyes. 

""I could sleep or stay up for 3 more hours."" I reply. 

""Well, what so you suggest we do for 3 hours?"" Kay asks with a half cocked smirk on her face. 

Still being shy, but noticing the hint, I awkwardly mumble a ""whatever you want to do.""

She says ""NAP!"" in excitement and rested her head on my lap. Now, I'm wearing basketball shorts and I have this cute little athletic chick resting her head on my dick. Of course, thoughts are running through my mind like crazy and 2 seconds later, I am at half mast. She had to have felt it against her cheek and she rolled her head over and gave me a smile that told me to fuck her brains out. 

I then lift her head up and start making out with her on the couch. We go at it for a few minutes. Running our fingers through each other's hair, I'm rubbing her back and thighs with one hand while controlling her head with the other. She starts grabbing at my cock through my shorts and pulls away from kissing and stares at me and says ""I am not prepared for this."" Being thrown off by this comment, I ask her if she wants to have sex or wait. She says she wants to have sex and that just isn't physically prepared. Confused by this, I get up (dick is poking straight out) and say come to bed with me then. With no warning, she jumps on my back, giggles, and starts biting my ear and telling me how long she has waited for this. My dick is so hard at this point that it could break diamonds. I support her legs and run up to my room. I open the door, jump in, turn around to shut the door and in that time she jumps off me and starts ripping her clothes off. She strips naked and her being really small, I pick her up by her ass and pin her against the wall and start making out with her and kissing her neck. She starts moaning and scratching my back with her nails. After a few minutes of this, she bites my ear again and says ""I want to taste your cock."" I let her down and take my shirt off. She's already on her knees and pulling off my shorts. She whips out my dick and starts licking up when down the shaft. She sucks the head like a lollipop then starts sucking my balls while stroking my spit covered shaft. I bundle up her hair in my hand and guide my dick back in her mouth. She begins sucking me in a slow and sensual way that was super sexy. Eyes locked on mine. Hand around the base. Puckered lips around my dick and a slow head bob while her tongue was ferociously at work. I'm losing my mind at this and can't help but start thrusting my hips. After I start this, she stops half way down my member and I grab her head with hands and begin face fucking her. Jamming my dick down her throat became a sloppy mess. She had tears coming out of her eyes. Slobber all over my body and her face. I couldn't handle the sexiness anymore and blew my load all over her face. She took it like a champ and sucked me dry when I was finished. I gave her a t-shirt to wipe off with. As she's cleaning up, I tell her my night isn't over if she wants to stay up longer. She smiles at me and asks ""what exactly does that mean?"" I then kiss her again and pick her up and lay her on the bed. I lick her body as I'm playing with her pussy and working my way down. This is where she says ""I'm not prepared for this."" And that means, she hasn't shaved in awhile. Don't matter. I work my face down to her crotch and lightly blow over her clit as I work back and forth from biting each thigh. She then grabs my head and smashes it in her pussy. I start working her with my tongue as she's moaning and playing with her tits. After a few minutes, I'm rock hard again and I get up, slide her to the edge of the bed, throw her legs over my shoulder and start fucking her. Her tiny tits and jiggle as much as they can. She's moaning and grabbing at the bed. She grabs a pillow to cover the noise from my roommates and I then flip her legs over and her on her side and start pounding her, pushing her face into the pillow. She's squeezing my arm and after awhile, she flips over and in one motion, she's on top of me and I'm both delighted and impressed. She starts grinding her ass on me while sinking her fingers into my chest. She took control and rode the fuck out of me. When she got tired and started slowing down, we flip position and get into doggy style. I enter her from behind and place my hands on her hips and start thrusting from behind. She drops her head and I grab a fist full of hair and pull it back up. She's arching her back now as I'm pulling her hair and slapping her ass. We no longer care about the noise as she's moaning loudly and the sound of our midsections colliding fills my room. I let go of her hair and grab her ass with both hands and start going as fast as I can. It doesn't take me much longer to reach my second climax of the morning and I spray a couple ropes on her back. I pull out and flop over and she grabs the t shirt and wipes off her back. She rolls over and asks ""where was this at when we lived together?"" I reply ""you had a boyfriend and I'm not looking for a girlfriend but this could be a fun year for us if you want it to be."" She smiles and lays her head down and says ""you can have me whenever you want it.""

That was the start of one of my best summers. "
9xqpnm,1,2018-11-16,Am I in the wrong ?,storyofara,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/9xqpnm/am_i_in_the_wrong/,"Before anything I would like to say I'm not really sure if I'd go as far and say my dads narcissist but definitely he's a asshole and emotionally abusive. I just don't know where else to go for this. 

So last night my younger sister (14) came to my room and asked for a sweater. I asked why and she said because hers are fading off and that some were dirty and what not. I told her to go wash them then so they can be clean for tomorrow morning. She said alright and then that was the end of that. 

The morning rolls around, it's around 60 degrees out (I live in Florida so it actually feels cold lol) I woke up a little later than usual but still had roughly 25 minutes to get ready for school and catch my bus. I finally I'm ready, I have 5 minutes before my bus comes. Perfect right ? Well just before it's time for my mother to take me and my sister off to school, she tells my parents that her sweater is starting to look faded. 

Now let me give a brief background for context. I'm 17 years old, and I'm starting my own clothing line with a friend. We're screen printing designs on some hoodies and shirts we bought. Keep in mind I have a very limited supply of these hoodies, if all goes well with our advertising and business plan we should sell every hoodie. I myself despite it being MY OWN brand can only keep 1. We have to spare some for a few models and promoters as well my partner himself. After these steps we will most likely be left with 20 something hoodies. (There's only 30 or less to begin with) Point is I really can't afford to be giving these hoodies out, keep in mind that's also assuming every hoodie comes out perfect from my printing. 

So my dad asks me if I can give my sister a hoodie and I tell him no I can't but I have other hoodies and sweaters I can give her. (Instead of giving her the hoodie for my business I was just gonna give her one of my own personal hoodies that I wear) apparently me trying to give her a ""old"" hoodie/sweater instead of a ""new"" hoodie is me being greedy. He then tried giving me $10 so that I can go and replace the one he expected me to give him but I still said no. My deadline to put clothes up for sale is in a week, Also there's also the fact that my sister would only most likely fit into a medium and I have very little medium (around 5, they ran smaller than expected and don't seem to be a true medium so I had to return most of them) and I can't risk my sister dirtying or staining the sweater. Regardless of this my sister literally HAD A SWEATER she just didn't wanna wear it because it was fading. 

So he proceeded to yell at me saying that I'm a horrible sales man, I don't know when to take an opportunity when it's best and that I have shitty business skills. This is word for word. He also tells me that I have till the end of the week to sell 1 hoodie or all the clothes will be thrown out.  I don't understand why he's setting deadlines for my own business when he's not the one putting countless hours in actually making the clothes or even paid for anything to begin with. I made money from a paid internship and saved up to start up this venture.The clothes also don't take up any space, they're in a box in the corner of my closet. They're not thrown around the house or anything like that. Because of him, me and my sister ended up missing our bus so my mom had to take us. On the way there I couldn't hold it back anymore and I let out a few tears. It's not even over this situation, this was just the breaking point of everything my dad has done to me in the past. (Will go into detail if asked) my mom asked what's the problem and then said that my dad had every reason to yell at me and that how dare I try and give her a ""old hoodie"" (keep in mind the hoodies and sweaters I was gonna give her are perfectly fine, I literally wear them myself) anyways right before we get dropped off I realized tension was gonna be in the house so I asked if after school I could leave with my girlfriend to her house. My mom said yes. Few minutes later she texts me saying my dad said I can't go to my girlfriends house after school because my rooms a mess. I responded saying why can't I pick up my room then leave after, she said because my father wants to talk to me. At this point I'm fucking heated because I don't understand why my mom has to be a middle man messenger, if my dad wants to talk to me so bad why couldn't he tell me himself ? I'm having a breakdown at this point, again not really over this dilemma but I'm so used to bottling in everything that happens between me and my family that it exploded out. 

Fast forward through the day, I get home and anxiously wait for my dad to ""talk to me"" as I know this pretty much means that he's just gonna yell at me for a while, insult me etc. He finally gets home and goes straight to my room and tells me he doesn't know what's gotten into my head but I'm being very greedy, as he would sacrifice the shirt on his back for any of us if he had to, and that i take it for granted that I don't have to pay bills or rent. He started saying that how dare I do this when he's boughten my school uniforms and food etc. and then went on a huge tangent about a lot of other shit and said if I don't sell 1 item by the end of this week my business is not gonna be here at this house and that there's gonna be also be other consequences. Also how dare I ""retaliate"" by saying no to giving a sweater. Afterwards he proceeded, like always to just go and get high off weed as if it's gonna fix anything and magically build a relationship between us. 

Sorry for the long post, if you guys have any questions or are unclear just ask away. I'm just mainly looking for support and to see if I'm actually in the wrong

Budget locations and route suggestions [E.Europe/Near east],NaitMada,Shoestring,https://www.reddit.com/r/Shoestring/comments/9xqvqg/needs_help_with_travel_planning_budget_locations/,"Hi all! New here, UK based, and would much appreciate some tips/help with a trip I'm planning early 2019. Basically as title says, but here are more details:

I have ***12 days*** (4th Feb-15th Feb), starting from ***Berlin and need to be in Istanbul*** 15th Feb to catch a flight for an internship in China (thats unrelated but basically I have to be in Istanbul on the 15th)

I would like the journey ***from Berlin to Istanbul*** to be super budget, tho not hitchhiking level of cheap xD more like budget airline/train/coach, and I'm happy to take cheap hostel/camp site suggestions.

And just a bit about me and stuff I like to do while traveling:

* Solo traveling on British passport
* Pref variety, max couple days in one place, so I'm looking to go 3-5 places
* Big cities with famous stuff are fine but niche towns where booze&amp;food are good&amp;cheap would be perfect
* Loves places rich with history and culture
* Not a great fan of arts and music (dont hate them just dont really understand them)
* Cool with nature, particularly the green forests and blue waters sorts, so couple days at cheap/wilderness camps with good vistas would be nice. I got a tent but pref sleep in a bed or during transit most of the trip
* Low requirements for accommodations, since mostly gon be out and about and I can fit everything in a backpack, basically as long as I dont get mugged while asleep is fine
* Comfort in transit not a priority, I can sleep thro anything xD
* Speak fluent English, can hold a conversation in German and Chinese (Doubt the last one helps, but you never know where theres a sick chinatown :P)
* Budget: £300 (travel and accommodation)+ £100ish spending money. Can bump up the total to £500 if I feel like I'm getting alot out of it
* 420 friendly

If any of you lovely people have suggestions that fits or even just any cool places that you can think of between Berlin-Istanbul, I'd love to hear them! Thank you!!!!"

Anyone who has been in the position have any insight? I want to at least start therapy before I get back to work- I ended up quitting an amazing internship and moving back home for a month after a roommate situation triggered a lot of anxiety for me, and now I’m terrified that I’ll get another job and end up messing everything up because when I get anxious, I feel like I need to run away and lie in bed forever, and I know I can’t keep doing that. I just feel like all my mental stuff is so debilitating it’s ruining my life.

9xs12t,18,2018-11-16,the perks and downsides of being socially oblivious,FernandoLH95,asexuality,https://www.reddit.com/r/asexuality/comments/9xs12t/the_perks_and_downsides_of_being_socially/,"Hello cake lovers... 23/ace/heteroromantic here. 

I've identified as ace for over two years now, and ever since I've known about asexuality and the community, I've felt more at ease being different from what society deems ""normal"". For instance, I no longer feel the pressure to engage into relationships, or to be on the lookout for a significant other. It was as if a huge weight had come off my back all at once. Everything had been amazing...

&amp;#x200B;

Until the summer of 2017. I was doing an internship abroad, and I met this girl who worked with me. She was roughly my age and we had a lot in common. We started to hanging out both during our work hours and in our spare time. We became really close friends, however I never mentioned her I was ace. I'm still not very upfront about it, and even less so back then.   


So, by the time my internship was over, I promised her I would keep in touch. And I did. Over the course of a year, texting at least on a weekly basis and even occasionally setting up video chats with her. She kept telling me how much she missed me. I always reminded her that she could come visit and stay for a few days. Much to my surprise, she ended up accepting the offer and, come summer 2018, she was crossing the Arrivals Gate at the International airport.   


She was always very... clingy. Ever since the beginning of our friendship. She would lean against me when we watched movies, or hug me whenever we had to share an umbrella. I'm not a fan of physical contact, but I figured that if this was ""her thing"", I could let it slide, just for the sake of spending time together. 

&amp;#x200B;

Unsurprisingly, I was reluctant when she asked me, the night she arrived, after a long series of layovers and delayed flights, if it would be okay to cuddle in bed. I remember her phrasing it something like ""I just don't want to feel alone"". So I did. And don't worry. It was indeed just hugging and maybe me rubbing her back. But from that point on, she started holding my hand and asking for hugs every now and again. I felt compelled to make her feel safe in a foreign country. I mean, if she had come all the way to visit, and she was going to spend just under a week, I could just as well handle her PDAs for the time being. I didn't mind that much because they made her really happy, and I was happy o see her happy.  


We had a wonderful time, but days flew by and we bid each other farewell, promising we would see each other soon. Fast forward five months, I had the opportunity to spend a few days with her before starting my graduate studies. We were both very excited that we could meet again even despite how far apart we lived. 

&amp;#x200B;

But this time, it was different. As I arrived, she told me we needed to talk. She asked me point-blank what was going on between the two of us. She told me she felt confused because she was getting mixed signals: on the one hand, she was receiving plenty of feedback from her displays of affection, but on the other, she wasn't getting any indications that I ""wanted to move into a more serious relationship"". And she couldn't continue living with a Schrödinger boyfriend.   


I came out to her and told her that I was asexual. I also told her that her life goals didn't align with mine (she always expressed me her desire to have kids, which I very much don't see myself doing... maybe ever). So I wasn't interested in compromising our friendship. 

&amp;#x200B;

She didn't took it so well... to say the least. 

&amp;#x200B;

She was so confused about my erratic social cues, that after all this time, demanded from me a clear-cut label for our relationship: either we formalized it into boyfriend-girlfriend status, or we broke apart entirely, ending what —at least for me— had been one of the greatest friendships I had ever built. She argued that she felt betrayed about how I let this continue for far too long without being honest with her. 

&amp;#x200B;

She was completely heartbroken.  


This story is still open ended. Over the course of the last two months, I've been trying to help her come to terms into a more nuanced option, were we might still end up as friends. But she's had a hard time wrapping her head around the concept of being ace. Nothing would make me happier than keeping our friendship (even better if we could tone down the physical contact issue), but she feels hurt and is discouraged every time we talk, because it reminds her how painful it was for the fantasy she envisioned with me, to collapse like a house of cards. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I'm left wondering what I could have done to avoid all of this. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know I should have been honest about how I felt about physical contact ever since day one. But every step along that slippery slope seemed so tiny and so circumstantially justified. Maybe I could have been more earnest about my being ace, but up to what point? Should I, now and on, always present myself to strangers as asexual just to avoid potential confusions and misunderstandings? 

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR** A girl fell in love with me, but being socially nearsighted and slightly oblivious to romantic cues, I thought she was just a very clingy friend, causing her to believe we were in a relationship, only to burst her bubble and practically loose our two-year-long friendship altogether. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any comments, similar stories, and advice would be greatly appreciated. 

&amp;#x200B;

I hope you all have a wonderful day. Thanks in advance for your support. "

I literally didn’t know how I was gonna pay for grad school without loans, so this is a huge relief off my shoulders.

Thank you to everyone here that had the patience to deal with us that were recruiting this season! Y’all are the best!

Btw for those who might wondering and are losing faith. I’m a hell of an introvert, no money (below poverty line- 24k in a house of 5), and alright gpa (3.3 accounting,m). I haven’t done anything extracurricular in about 2 years, nor did I speak for the past year (yes you read that right).
 I was struggling with severe depression for a couple years, failed my accounting class, and had little to no social skills. But I sold my butt off, lost a lot of sleep, polished (with the grittiest sandpaper you can imagine ) my resume, and joined all my coins and courage to join BAP. 

This semester has been hard and trying but so far I’ve made it! Congrats to everyone else who got their internships and good luck to those recruiting next year!"
9xtgz7,9,2018-11-16,"A Community Created Petition for What Should Be Included in the English Release of Please Don't Bully Me, Nagatoro.",Canyon_,nagatoro,https://www.reddit.com/r/nagatoro/comments/9xtgz7/a_community_created_petition_for_what_should_be/,"~~Hello Everyone! Like everyone else, I've been patiently waiting for the English release of Nagatoro. The fanslation teams are fantastic and I've really appreciated all the work they do just so we can enjoy the manga. I've also seen that many users on the subreddit have gone ahead and bought the Japanese release to support Nanashi. But back to the English release of Nagatoro by Vertical, Inc. I believe if we as a community want to see certain material be present in the English release it is best to make Vertical aware of it by emails and a friendly petition that organizes what we want in a single outlet. I've specifically been interested in seeing the Illust Collection from Vol.2 and the Comic Anthology from Vol.3 included in the English release (either within the book or as a separate Saddle-stitched† booklet). I personally think it would be a shame if a portion of the material that was released to the Japanese consumers wasn't available to us in an English release. I'm sure there are also things that other community members would be interested to see in the English release. Which I'm sure will include whether there will be an E-book, hardback, the supplementary that came with the Special editions and more.~~


~~With this post, I'd like to first have help from the admins, as I know this subreddit is their baby and they'd be interested in watching over this and ensuring we don't represent the community in a bad light to Vertical. I'd especially like to hear what other users would like to see included with the English release. With a list of items we'd like to see, we would vote on what would be included in our request and then use those results to make a final, finished petition to present to Vertical. After the petition would be drafted, we  would work to get as many signatures as possible.Then we would email the petition to the four total emails (Three of which are for individual team members on the staff and a general info email) which are publicly posted on their website *on the exact same day*. By sending a wave of emails on the same day we are more likely to get a response when they see an organized, polite request for what we as the fans would like to see.~~


~~I'm sure that many of us would wonder if Vertical would even pay attention to such a petition. However, I believe that we have many reasons to assume Vertical would listen to our request. (1) From my research I've found that Vertical is actually a very small company, my estimate is they have between 4 to 6 employees. According to their [website](http://www.vertical-inc.com/whoweare.html) they have 4 employees that are at least mentioned. According to Wikipedia, they have 6 employees. This number is given without a citation, however, it's possible that the company has two lower positions that aren't mentioned by name on the website or are simply intern positions that are rotated often. (2) If along with our request for additional content we state that we will happily pay for additional cost Vertical will not lose financially from the increase in page count. Say if the book was originally going to cost $9.95 with a 160-page printing†††, we would agree to pay $11.95 for a 192-page printing††. (3) If we send the emails on the same date to all team members on Vertical will be made aware of our enthusiasm for Nagatoro and be made aware of how much we appreciate and support their work and the work of Nanashi's.~~


~~I hope that this post leads to some fruitful discussion on what we'd like to see included in the English release. Hopefully, this will lead to a better version of the release and ensure that Vertical continue to print the newly release volumes as they come out once they realize how passionate our community is.~~


~~Please don't bully me,~~


~~Canyon_.~~


~~†   I'm not aware if the supplementary, the Comic Anthology in Vol.2 and the Illust Collection in Vol.3, were Saddle-stitched or perfect bound. If any user has a copy of the supplementary and they are in fact perfect bound, please message me and I will edit the original post to account for that mistake.~~


~~††   This is simply an example, there's no way of knowing what Vertical is planning to charge for the English release or how much the price would increase per page. The increase of 32 pages is simply two standard 16-page bundles, which is the most cost-effective increase in page counts in the industry due to how the industry currently prints books. Both of the prices are also the exact same cost-per-page, which would be preferable for negotiating an increase in page count.  As for the 160 pages given, this is taken from the page count of Vol.1 on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_Mess_with_Me,_Nagatoro) for the Japanese release.~~


~~†††  If this page count is inaccurate please message me and I will edit the original post to account for that mistake.~~

Date: 7/16/19██

Today’s subject of interest is Funtime Bot 3, AKA Funtime Freddy. By the authorities of the board of Fazbear Entertainment, clearance has been granted to hold interview sessions with all Afton Robotics robots with “active” A.I. The purpose of this project is to understand more about the Funtimes and how they think and operate before being locked and contained on site for storage, study, and salvaging.

For details about Interview and Observation Room description, as well as safety instructions given to the Interviewer and Engineers on site, please refer to File: [FFR1](https://www.reddit.com/r/fivenightsatfreddys/comments/9xhwx7/funtime_freddy_examination_01/), for more details.

Dr. F█████████ and Board Member ██████ have both gone over the information, brought back by an unnamed intern, about Funtime Freddy’s past. The most agreed upon conclusion was that Funtime Freddy’s past must come from out of state, whether or not these memories were programmed in or from a human soul is inconclusive.

Funtime Freddy has been talking to Bon Bon during this time, engineers report nothing but witty banter going back and forth between the two. Although they do note that Bon Bon seemed to still calm him down fairly easily, strange seeing Funtime Freddy can take complete control of the Bonnie Handpuppet at any time.

After 40 minutes, the Bonnie hand puppet was removed and Dr. F█████████ continued the interview.

Interviewer requests:

Dr. F█████████ request that more engineers/guards be stationed outside emergency hatch just in case: [APPROVED; TWO GUARDS SHALL BE PLACED OUTSIDE]

Dr. F█████████ request that Bon Bon be placed inside Funtime Auditorium instead of Storage Room 2-██: [REJECTED]

Engineer requests:

Both Engineers request better restraining equipment. The request came from, quote, “That creepy [EXPLICIT] puppet was eyeing us a lot, the whole time he was in here. I don’t feel safe doc!”: [REJECTED]

[TAPE STARTS]

(*Funtime Freddy is holding his right hand, rubbing it slightly, and muttering to himself.*)

Dr. F█████████: Miss him that much?

(*Funtime Freddy’s head jerks up.*)

Funtime Freddy: Oh! Uh… no, sorry! It’s just… I need him… He makes me… think… clearer…

Dr. F: You find difficulty in making decisions?

F. Freddy: No! It’s just less stressing… to do something… he doesn’t have any fears like I do.

Dr. F: Having fears? 

(*Funtime Freddy starts muttering and rubbing his hand again.*)

Board Member ██████: I think we should end this line of questioning, doctor.

Dr. F: Agreed, Freddy. Would you like to continue your tale?

(*Funtime Freddy head jerks up, his voice a bit higher/happier.*)

F. Freddy: Of course! So, I believe we were at the incident?

Dr. F: Correct, so what was the unfortunate accident?

F. Freddy: Well, everything was going well, until a storm came through! Winds started to pick up, and there was even threat of lighting in the area! The party was moved to the Welcome Center, and everyone was just trying to enjoy themselves inside the old building.

(*Funtime Freddy shifts a bit, and holds up left hand.*)

F. Freddy: Now, that is what I remember from my human memory, and you'd mostly expect me to focus on that! (*Funtime Freddy puts down his left arm and holds up his right arm*) *I, on the other hand!* Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

Dr. F: Ha, ha. Funny, Freddy. Before you continue, from what you are saying, it is safe to conclude that you have memories of both of yourself and of Funtime Freddy?

F. Freddy: I’m sorry! Am I interrupting your story?!

Dr. F: I’m sorry, please lad, continue.

F. Freddy: Thank you! Now, I don’t know if I have mentioned this, but the party was medieval themed. The birthday boy was the king, his best friends were knights, and everyone else was the peasants. Ha, ha, ha, ha! I guess you can say we animatronics were the court jesters! He, he, he, he… Now, the reason I mention this is because they were having a contest on the stage in the Welcome Center. It was like fencing with their balloon swords, first to hit the person three times would lose. I wanted to participate, but I was nervous, so nervous! I didn’t want to look like a fool in front of everyone. But my love right next to me reassured me, told me (*Funtime Freddy’s Voice Mimic/██████ activates again, the voice is of a sweet young American girl, probably ██ years of age.*) “*Don’t worry about your fears, I bet no man born alive can ever beat you!*”

(*Dr. F█████████ has started to write something quickly in his notes. His note taking seems to be nonexistent, bar a few things, after this point forward. Funtime Freddy's voice returns to normal.*)

F. Freddy: With my new found confidence, I got up on the stage. I took my red sword, and I attacked! Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! No one stood a chance against me, everyone was going down left and right. Soon enough, I won, and everyone was chanting my name. The birthday boy even gave me his crown, I’d never felt so special! After this, the party started to calm down, everyone started to sit down and do arts and crafts. Me, proud and sitting tall on the second floor of the welcome center, looked down on everyone! But then, something happened. A kid had fallen down, he destroyed his self-made knight helmet to pieces. Then! His dad came and helped him up from the fall, and my heart sank. The thought of my dad came rushing back to me! And I lost it, I started crying, I was having the time of my life… but my dad would never be able to see it! We would never be together again! My crying must have drawn attention because when I looked up somebody had come to check on me. Or rather… something…

Dr. F: It was Funtime Freddy wasn’t it?

(*Funtime Freddy goes quiet and starts looking at Dr. F█████████ for a while. His eyes jittering for a few seconds.*)

F. Freddy: Ha, ha, he, he! You know… I might get to that part if you stop interrupting me! (*Funtime Freddy stands up and bangs his hand on the table, a humongous dent is made in the steel table.*)

(*Both engineers ready their taser batons, one puts his hand on his steel animal control pole.*)

Board Member █: Remain passive Funtime Freddy! Or I will end this! Now!

(*Funtime Freddy eyes the observation room, still eyeing Board Member ██████ through the two-way mirror. He starts to slowly sit back down.*)

F. Freddy: All right, all right. I’m calm. He, he, he, he… I promise…

(*Both engineers sheath their equipment.*)

Dr. F: Please, continue your story, Freddy.

F. Freddy: Well, to answer your question Doc, yes, it was Freddy. Remember when I said I keep an eye on the other hand?! Well, I remember this too! I remember the counting, I always coordinated where everyone was. Baby was busy blowing up animals and making ice cream, that was until I noticed an opportunity. A kid, sitting on the second floor, there was no parent near him. So! I moved up to him, I came up to him and saw the tears. I had asked him, “*What’s wrong friend, aren’t you having fun?!*” Well, he, he, he, he… I responded with, “*It’s just… my father… he is gone. I can’t get him back!*” Bon Bon had chipped up, he said, “*Well you can try, (gasp) we can show you how!*” I was confused, I asked how. I responded with, “*Let me show you a secret… follow me!*"" I lead my human self to a storage room, once I walked in I closed the door and a metal ████ came out of MY animatronic stomach! I screamed, I laughed, and my eyes went dark! Everything slowly slowed down, and I reopened my eyes… and I was in a dark room… I was in one of these rooms…

Dr. F: You achieved sentience in your robotic form by possession?

F. Freddy: Correct! My mind slowly started to unravel, but Bon Bon was there to calm me down… told me to not worry. Told me we were going to do good things in this form… Sometimes… I wonder if Bon Bon is another soul, or just my mind spilt, and it’s just trying to not get me stressed… But I take on my new role, as the new entertainer of the band, as the new king of robots down here!

Dr. F: So… that is how you came to be…

F. Freddy: Yeah… can you believe it?!

(*Dr. F█████████ closes his notebook and looks up at Freddy.*)

Dr. F: … No.

F. Freddy: Come again?!

Board Member █: Doctor F█████████ don’t say something you can’t take back!

Dr. F: Let me propose what I think laddie… I think you are making up these series of events. You are making up a sad tragedy to try and elicit a sympathetic response from us. Maybe even have us convinced you are a poor kid we need to take care of but in reality… You are playing mind games… May I ask if I’m correct?

(*Funtime Freddy stays quiet, opens his mouth a bit, and starts to cackle wildly.*)

F. Freddy: Ho, ho, ho, ha, ha, ha! Nothing can get past you Doc? Tell me! How did you figure it out?!

Dr. F: I have to say, I’m impressed by your knowledge of stage performances. If you were trying to get an emotional response, Shakespeare is a good place to start. Quite an intellectual choice, if I may say so.

F. Freddy: Well, I had to leave some breadcrumbs! No fun playing a game you know you're going to win without handicapping yourself! Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

Dr. F: So, what is the true story?

F. Freddy: Eh, who knows anymore?! He, he, he… let’s not dance around the subject! We both know what happens when a kid dies in here! (*Funtime Freddy points to his chest, most likely referring to his ███████ ████*) You have my charts Doc, they have my charts! (*Funtime Freddy nods at the Observation Room.*) You guys know how popular I was with the kiddies! Ho, ho, ho, ha, ha, Ha! Oh, there are so many voices in here, I can’t even tell which ones are real or not!

Dr. F: So… (*Dr.F█████████ makes a gulping sound*) you truly are nutso… that isn’t part of your personality programming?

F. Freddy: He, he, he, he… It only takes the universe to take away a person’s happiest day, to drive even the most sanest man to lunacy! He, he, he, he, Ha, HA! Now imagine you being the person who rips away those happiest days! I’m not surprised all of these “*children*” have gone mad down here! Believing they are these cartoon animals, ha, ha, ha, Ha!

Dr. F: So… what are you really. Are you a spirt, an A.I., why would you make up this story?!

F. Freddy: If you are going to have an origin story, you’re better off making it multiple choice, Doc. And besides, I like this one best. Nothing like getting some action after your dad dies, am I right doc?! Ho, ho, ho, ha, ha, ha!

(Dr. F█████████ gets up from his chair, and moves towards the exit)

Dr. F: I think it’s time we end the interview-

F. Freddy: What’s wrong doc, the party is just starting!

Dr. F: What do you mean?

F. Freddy:... I said to keep an eye on the other hand...

(*Loud white noise comes from the speakers, cluttering and crashing is heard, with the sound of a man grunting and screaming.*)

Board Member █: Doctor! Ugh, ahhh! Somebody help, this [**EXPLICT**] puppet is on my face!

(*Funtime Freddy gets up and tackles one of the engineers, the other starts to prod it. At this time, Dr. F█████████ runs out of the room, and the two guards outside enter to control the situation. Standby guards outside Observation Room enter to help Board Member ██████, with Bon Bon. After a few second electroshock floor panels activate, Funtime Freddy doesn’t stop, after a full minute goes by Funtime Freddy incapacitates all guards. He starts to head out of the room, by bashing the door down.*)

F. Freddy: Oh doctor, doctor! Come out to play!!

[TAPE ENDS]

Incident Report: After Funtime Freddy’s breach of security he started to slaughter multiple workers. Bon Bon was later incapacitated but he too took out and terminated two workers on his way to the Observation Room. Funtime Freddy was later recaptured when threats against Bon Bon were made, he was prodded with controlled shocks until all his power systems shut down. He apparently received mild damage to his voice box during this period, this will not be fixed, as a punishment deterrent.

In total ██ casualties were counted, another ██ was injured.

Interviewers Notes: “That was the scariest moment of my life. That… monster is nothing more than a god damn sociopath. His manipulation of our emotions, to his ability to control and influence from afar, and his use of brute deadly force… In some ways, he is worse the Circus Baby! In my examination, I will title him the second most dangerous robot behind her, from one glaring issue… Bon Bon. Bon Bon is the only robot down here we can manually take control over, and it’s the only thing that has some leverage over him… As long as we have that, we can contain him. But if we were to lose Bon Bon in some way… Bloody Hell, it would be a slaughter… My recommendations would be this: Don’t lock that [**EXPLICIT**] with Funtime Foxy in Funtime Auditorium. I don’t want that thing being able to communicate with anyone. You saw what it did to us, imagine what it can do to other fractured minds…” - Dr. F█████████, Head of Research

Interviewer request:

Dr. F█████████ request to remove Funtime Freddy from Funtime Auditorium: [APPROVED, FUNTIME FREDDY SHALL BE MOVED TO ANOTHER LOCATION ASAP]

Addendum 1A:

Date: 8/02/19██

Due to results from the Artificial Intelligence Mentality test, Funtime Freddy has increased concerned over containment safety. During testing procedures, Funtime Freddy reportedly told researchers, “He won’t lie this time.” During sanity testing parts, Funtime Freddy was deemed: “Above Average Sain.” It reportedly told researchers, “I think your test is broken.” It got every question right on that test. During the intelligence examination, it scored 478 points out of 500. Researcher C██████ claims, due to its score and speed, that Funtime Freddy has an IQ of 325, unheard of by any human. Debates have sparked with research heads whether or not this is a result of its advanced A.I. or if is using the souls it has claimed to increase its intellect. Even so, Funtime Freddy reliance on Bon Bon, and his animalistic drive to murder are still present, and are not deemed “*an act*.” At this time, most researchers have eliminated the possibility of one soul possessing Funtime Freddy, at least.

So I am in the Chicago area and attend a small school south of Chicago. It’s about a 1 hour drive up to Chicago or I could commute on train (what I was planning on doing). So I’m obviously not a target school but I have a great gpa, 3.8/4 and 4/4 for accounting courses. I have been told previously on reddit that if I get to a recruiter from a large firm they’d probably love my work ethic and background and I interview super well. 
Details: have full ride scholarship to my school, in my accounting clubs and probably be a president of the international business club next semester, and I work full time during school since I’m breadwinner of the family. 

My question or advice I’m seeking is how do I even get to the interview phase. After I apply what can I do to connect with a recruiter to stick out and get an interview. I had the idea of sneaking into a targets schools job fair/recruiting event and connect with a recruiter that way but would it look shady afterwards when I’m from a small school far from the college? I started finding recruiters on LinkedIn and connected with a few but how do I start a conversation with them? 

Last detail: just got an offer from a paid internship at a small firm near me and that’s for Jan-May 25 hours a week. The pay is only $10 but I took it because I plan on keeping a part time job during this to help make up lost pay but just enough to pay bills. I think this internship would help me get an internship at the big 4 since it’ll help me stand out hopefully! 

I’m sorry for the wall of text but I’m just really shooting for a summer or fall internship next year and want to do everything I can to get there! "

From what I gather our icu and all our critical care departments utilize a lot of travel nurses. I understand internships are costly and time consuming as you’re teaching someone a lot of information. But wouldn’t training more core staff to that level be a part of cost reduction? Increased job satisfaction? 
I applied recently for another internship they opened, confident I would at least get an interview and get my face seen. Instead I’ve found out they opened this position for someone they already had wanted to hire, and really it was all just for show. 

I was very open and honest with my manager when I got hired that icu has always been my goal. I even told her I applied because I want to continue to grow as a nurse. She was LIVID and now ignores me and basically refuses to talk to me. I’m one of her best employees, patients love me, I’m smart, I’m dedicated. 
I am getting NO support to further myself and it’s so frustrating. I’m feeling myself get burnt out and bored. 
Any suggestions on other steps I could take to pursue critical care? 
Going to assume leaving this organization or this hospital will be high on the list of suggestions. "
9xzcbz,363,2018-11-17,My gf (well now exgf) been too close to comfort with male coworker in the past couple weeks.....so I dumped her.. kinda thinking second thoughts... anyone experience this??,KillingItat24,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/9xzcbz/my_gf_well_now_exgf_been_too_close_to_comfort/,"Dated this girl for a two years... things were amazing for both of us in the beginning like how these stories always go... to rap it up quickly... I got my dream job a couple months ago ... going for my masters... and doing an internship... Im a busy dude.. so yes.. the attention has been off of her for a bit... my focus has solely been my career for the past couple months..which means less courting her... less making an effort with dates... and yes less funny phonecalls… She started a new job recently ... and of course... this ""male coworker"" came into the picture.... Didnt think much of it... happy shes fitting in with the new crew... then comes the how ""great he is... he reminds me of you""...started seeing they are texting each other...I  put my foot down.. told her to cut that crap out or im gone.. she convinced me he was just a friendly guy and shell stop...a couple weeks later.he invited us to a ball game... I said ""well, he sending the message, im not after your girl... just a friend""... so we went.. I tried to get to know the dude... bust a few jokes... but the entire time.. they were flirting with each other... and when the game ended... I gave him the death  warning stare.... he chuckled .. I called her out on it afterwards..she look down and said sorry but. ""he just a funny guy"" and I ll stop....

&amp;#x200B;

Final straw...  been focusing on a paper for a couple days... she called me up to check on me and wanting to meet up... she mentioned she been on the phone with this guy all week and how hes funny and great he is... I dumped her right then and there... she sped over to my place for closure... and told her to gtfo... and blocked her...

How would you have reacted???

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: WOW... YOU GUYS ARE FREAKING AWSOME....It means a lot to hear people taking the time to read my thoughts...I will say one thing... It is true.. our relationship was going through a patch for months...I am believer that the man leads the relationship...so  I failed her... I loved this woman... The first year consisted of me taking her out.. dancing, bowling, movies, ice skating, cultural restuarants, plays...travling suprising her, flirting her, tickling her feet when she slept, cracking our own inside jokes, farting each others face when we slept... She felt like the luckiest woman.  I took it as a compliment that she begged to marry me and get settled even within a few months of dating.... I got caught up with school and the new job man the following year... and warned her things were going to be different... that's when things went downhill..had less time to talk to her.. flirting felt forced....sex dried up... looked at me differently... She got b\^$\^tchy and irritable in last months because I knew she was miserable in the relationship and instead of talking things out and go back to my lovey dovey self with her..I  just distanced myself from her. she kept trying to reach out and... That where that ahole came into a play and I guess started to give her the attention she craved from me..thats where the fights grew and . I was emotionally exhausted from the fights.guys.. and once the ahole starting courting her.. I knew cheating would be the next step...When she came looking for closure... she cried.. and begged... kneeled for forgiveness for throwing this guy in my face...and wanted to fix our relationship.... but I gave her chances as I said orginally and im a man that doesn't tolerate crap... and with this guy working with her...I really didn't want to sleep with one eye open..ya know... idk im fearful that I will be like this with everywoman since I will never stop focusing on improving myself

9y02bv,4,2018-11-17,Advice on internship offers,CrayonHighlighter,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/9y02bv/advice_on_internship_offers/,"Hello! I'm sorry if this sub has already seen a hundred of these posts, but I would really appreciate input on internship decisions. I'm using a throwaway, but I'm an avid user of this sub, and I really appreciate all of the advice/feedback I've gotten over the past few months. I don't think I would have been able to make it through recruiting season without the help of a lot of the user's here, so thank you!!

I was fortunate to receive 2 B4 offers, but I'm very conflicted about my choice.

I already accepted an offer with KPMG in a niche and small advisory sector. The comp is pretty generous (around $32/hour), and I was told that they always bring interns in as FT staff. However, I'm concerned because there doesn't seem to be much room to grow within this small department. Additionally, the exit ops for this particular department aren't great.

The got another offer from EY a few days after I accepted KPMG's offer. The offer is also for an advisory internship (around $28/hour) with an additional sign-on bonus. The exit opportunities for this particular advisory sector seem better, as it's similar to an internal audit function. 

I'm lost on what to do, and I'm not sure if KPMG's compensation outweighs EY's opportunities for growth within the firm. I'm also really worried about having to call KPMG to renege my offer (the staff and recruiters have all been super nice to me and have been sending me emails to welcome me to their team).

TLDR; KPMG has better comp, EY has better opportunities both within and outside of the firm. I already accepted KPMG's offer, so I'm even more conflicted about my decision. Any advice is appreciated!

[23:01] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; Hello people

[23:01] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; The clock just stuck 11`

[23:01] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; I guess there are some (hopefully?) people waiting?

[23:01] &lt;#47&gt; When does it start?

[23:02] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; It starts right now, I suppose.

[23:02] &lt;derp2&gt; it just did

[23:02] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; Let me give a small briefing.

[23:02] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; Basic 2-2 questions which are definitely expected.

[23:02] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; 2-3*

[23:03] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; I am a final year student having his last month on campus.

[23:03] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; Am I placed? Yes.

[23:03] &lt;YokoHomo&gt; AMA, more like ARA, amirite?

[23:03] &lt;BeastMaster64&gt; Did fall in cutoffs have any effects on the companies that came or number of people they took?

[23:03] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; Save that question for the last YohoHomo?

[23:04] &lt;bladerunner&gt; @beastmaster +1

[23:04] &lt;ThePrinceThatWasPromised0&gt; hi bhaiya. a 3rd year mechanical guy here without a finance minor. Do i have a shot at non core companies or is IT my only choice?

[23:04] &lt;Canterville_Ghot.™&gt; Congrats! I went through the reddit thread. I currently am a second yearite, what should I look forward to in this AMA?

[23:04] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; @BeastMaster64, the effect of fall in cutoffs is definitely not visible right. (continued)

[23:04] &lt;FitterHappier&gt; what is the one thing you regret not doing while on campus or rather your college life?

[23:04] &lt;derp2&gt; one at a time please

[23:04] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; Our batch, our seniors and one batch junior are people who took admission before the fall 

[23:05] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; The possible effect, if any, should be seen after the graduation of 2017 batch I suppose.

[23:05] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; @ThePrinceThatWasPromised0

[23:05] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; Hello
[23:05] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; A mechanical guy wanting a shot at non core

[23:05] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; See, maintain a fine CGPA for a first thing

[23:05] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; Secondly, apply for internships.

[23:06] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; I reckon you just have a summer and PS2 left.

[23:06] &lt;ThePrinceThatWasPromised&gt; yes

[23:06] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; Fix a domain and apply to startups in that domain.

[23:06] &lt;bladerunner&gt; whats ur branch, bhaiya ?

[23:06] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; @FitterHappier

[23:06] &lt;iloveass2&gt; How do I get an internship if I didn't get one in the intern season

[23:06] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; let's see

[23:06] &lt;bandi_nahi_toh_randi_sahi&gt; Fine CGPA ? How much?

[23:06] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; That is a good question.

[23:07] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; I regret not having a girlfriend for a start. Flings and all never do away a relationship.

[23:07] &lt;Animefreak&gt; Guys one at a time please

[23:07] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; @bladerunner - 2015A7

[23:07] &lt;unconfigured-shakespeer-user&gt; Comparch lab test ke liye kaise padhna hai?

[23:07] &lt;iloveass2&gt; Just give up, man. That's what I'm doing. @unconfig.....

[23:07] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; @iloveass2 - the opportunities are never ending.

[23:07] &lt;derp2&gt; what are the placement sstats in general? around how many people remain unplaced?

[23:08] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; I suggest you find people working in the domain of your interest

[23:08] &lt;buurrrra!&gt; vo kitab apni gand mei dal lo aur vaha jake hag dena @unconfigured-shakespeer-user

[23:08] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; Finding people becomes easier with a fine linkedin page and/or posting on BITSian facebook groups.

[23:08] &lt;unconfigured-shakespeer-user&gt; @burrrra CG lani hai please.

[23:08] &lt;Animefreak&gt; No more discussions on comparch...

[23:08] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; Talk to them, ask them for referrals.

[23:08] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; @bandi_nahi_toh_randi_sah - 7.5 for IT. 8 for non core.

[23:09] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; @unconfigured-shakespeer-user - is it not too late for that? Go through the previous papers is all I can say right now.

[23:09] &lt;BeastMaster64&gt; How easy/difficult is it for circuital branches to get placed in IT?

[23:09] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; And maybe get out of DC till tomorrow morning?

[23:09] &lt;BeastMaster64&gt; and what is a decent cg to maintain?

[23:09] &lt;unconfigured-shakespeer-user&gt; thanks bhaiya

[23:09] &lt;#47&gt; What's your favourite spot on the campus? And ofc, why?

[23:09] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; @derp2 - That's one interesting question

[23:10] &lt;Canterville_Ghot.™&gt; @beastmaster He did answer:-  7.5 for IT . 8 for non core

[23:10] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; I request others to wait.

[23:10] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; After that, #47 you will get the answer. S

[23:10] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; @derp2 - official stats will tell you that everyone gets placed.

[23:10] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; Everyone being 100% here

[23:10] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; Don't fall for that.

[23:10] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; Everyone in CS gets placed, yes.

[23:11] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; Everyone (on paper) in EEE, Mech get placed.

[23:11] &lt;unconfigured-shakespeer-user&gt; adding ques to queue : where are you placed bhaiya?

[23:11] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; But what really hapens is that people start giving up after a while and deregister from placements.

[23:11] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; A real stat will be asking PU how many people deregistered.

[23:11] &lt;bandi_nahi_toh_randi_sahi&gt; +1

[23:11] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; The answer will be less than 60% people get placed in Civil.

[23:12] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; 70% hopefully in mech.

[23:12] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; 80 around in Circuit branches.

[23:12] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; Pure sciences firms don't come at all.

[23:12] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; That answers it for now.

[23:12] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; @ &lt;#47&gt; What's your favourite spot on the campus? And ofc, why?


[23:13] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; So, that's a tough one.

[23:13] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; I mention two three spots here.

[23:13] &lt;derp2&gt; what would you recommend to a civil dualite, who has fucked up his cg (around 6), has no PORs and no extra curicular activities and wants a decent placement?

[23:13] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; One is for hiding when I want to just run away from the world because of a possible down mood or something.

[23:13] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; That will be behind library, near PSD office.

[23:14] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; Hopefully no couple will be there.

[23:14] &lt;Canterville_Ghot.™&gt; haha

[23:14] &lt;CG_needed&gt; lol

[23:14] &lt;#47&gt; XD

[23:14] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; Second is when I want to have ...ahem.. fun. For that I resort to a couple of spots in NAB and Staff quarters. There is a park behind connaught. *wink*

[23:15] &lt;juju_on_that_beat&gt; What is the minimum package for EEE/EnI?

[23:15] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; If I want to take some one for a walk, I go on the RP-AK road all the way to connaught.

[23:15] &lt;FitterHappier&gt; approximately how much time can i afford before i lose my chance of getting placed in IT(like how much does it take to gain the skills required given i am a noob)( currently in 3rd year and have not have lost hope for core placements though CG is low)

[23:15] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; @derp2 - depends on the domain you want it in. I guess you just want some high paying job and have not decided a domain.

[23:15] &lt;LegendsNeverDie&gt; FitterHappier +1

[23:15] &lt;derp2&gt; yes

[23:16] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; Then I will assume that you are still a second yearite, having a good scope for increasing his CGPA.

[23:16] &lt;derp2&gt; third yearite

[23:16] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; That works as well.

[23:16] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; Leave substance abuse. Very seriously.

[23:16] &lt;derp2&gt; not into it at all

[23:16] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; That is if you indulge.

[23:16] &lt;unconfigured-shakespeer-user&gt; where are you placed bhaiya? 

[23:16] &lt;LegendsNeverDie&gt; +an start

[23:17] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; Okay, in that case, I will suggest increasing CGPA but that is not a really practical answer.

[23:17] &lt;Canterville_Ghot.™&gt; what all courses should i choose to reap out maximum benefits?(I'm a second yearite, M+EEE)

[23:17] &lt;LegendsNeverDie&gt; +asciihelp

[23:17] &lt;derp2&gt; i have a summer and ps2 left

[23:17] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; So, let's see, you can fix a domain in IT, learn on YouTube and stuff and apply for interns in startups.

[23:17] &lt;Illuminaticon&gt; What is the scene for EEE/ENI people for getting placed in an IT job? OOP, OS, DSA Required right?

[23:17] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; @FitterHappier - let's see

[23:17] &lt;NoNick&gt; hi

[23:18] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; You are okay with taking job in your branch which is not CS, right?

[23:18] &lt;FitterHappier&gt; eni it is

[23:18] &lt;FitterHappier&gt; yeah

[23:18] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; @unconfigured-shakespeer-user - let's leave that for the end.

[23:19] &lt;Cris070806&gt; what can a person with chemistry + chemical do from placement point of view?

[23:19] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; @FitterHappier - You should start doing competitive coding right away. Go for an IT PS in first sem. Increase CGPA above 7 by any means.

[23:19] &lt;NoNick&gt; ama inactive h

[23:19] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; @Canterville_Ghot.™ - You have a lot of time for increasing your CGPA right now.

[23:20] &lt;Cris070806&gt; dualites cant do finance minor so what shoul i do

[23:20] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; Don't repeat courses if you are a dualite as that will take up your slots.

[23:20] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; You try to take much more courses so that you at least get the option for a double pS or double TS in last year.

[23:20] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; Study hard in these two years and you won't feel the need of repeating courses.

[23:20] &lt;FitterHappier&gt; How would you suggest starting competitive coding given i know only basic C

[23:21] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; @Illuminaticon - these threee courses are almst necessary. 

[23:21] &lt;Canterville_Ghot.™&gt; which courses do you mean by ""more courses""? And Thank you for the answer :)

[23:21] &lt;Cris070806&gt; okay but is coding an option?

[23:21] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; Above that, keep a 7.5+ CGPA and do competitive coding. That's all I can say.

[23:21] &lt;derp2&gt; how to start cometitive coding?

[23:21] &lt;CG_needed&gt; in which sem should i go for PS2?(want to get place in core(ENI) and cg aftr 2-2 is 7-)

[23:22] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; @Cris070806 - Purely placement basis, your Chemistry degree won't come in use. Use chemical knowledge to get into ExxonMobil or similar companies or increase CGPA and go for non core. Sad, but true.

[23:22] &lt;#47&gt; Apart from studies and all the placement stuff, what all things would you strongly suggest one must do in his college life?

[23:22] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; @FitterHappier - Go to interviewbit and start from the very first section. Take help for GFG for things you are not understanding.

[23:23] &lt;BeastMaster64&gt; Do PORs really matter for IT?

[23:23] &lt;#47&gt; **his/her/its

[23:23] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; @Canterville_Ghot.™ - courses more than your transcript of the particular semester requires. According to the transcript, let's say you are advised to do 21 units, do 24.

[23:24] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; @derp2 - If you have more than one year, then start by watching an online course of algorithms and coding while doing the course. I suggest Stanford algorithms ourse.

[23:24] &lt;Canterville_Ghot.™&gt; Okay...will do so. Thanks bhaiyya

[23:24] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; @CG_needed - Increase to 7.5 and stay for 4-1.

[23:25] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; @#47 - important question.

[23:25] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; OTher's wait for a while.

[23:25] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; What things other than acads and placement prep.

[23:25] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; I believe one should get at least into one sport.

[23:25] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; Firstly that helps you with every other thing by keeping your health good.

[23:26] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; Secondly, it keep sthe toxic thoughts away.

[23:26] &lt;FitterHappier&gt; What is your wildest drunk adventure in pilani?

[23:26] &lt;atapi_vatapi&gt; any idea about placement in finance sector?

[23:26] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; You will waste the evening or get into substance or maybe just become a machine otherwise.

[23:26] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; Others, wait. 

[23:27] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; Another thing which I believe one should do is the following

[23:27] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; Be stupid.

[23:27] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; BE STUPID.

[23:27] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; Let people judge you.

[23:27] &lt;DhaiMard&gt; @AntiSocial, can a MECH guy get a IT PS2?

[23:27] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; Do whatever you want and not whatever others expect you to do.

[23:28] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; You might want to shout out something in ANC and think people will, still do it.

[23:28] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; Okay, next.

[23:28] &lt;Th3_Arr0w&gt; What's your favourite memory of campus life?

[23:28] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; @FitterHappier

[23:28] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; Drunk adventure

[23:28] &lt;#47&gt; brilliant ans :)

[23:28] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; It happened this sem

[23:29] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; I went out with 15-16 people of my batch and made many of them drink for the first time.

[23:29] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; Then

[23:29] &lt;6876&gt; I am a guy with minimal PORs , circuit branch , cgpa around 6 , never taken any substances nor drink, want a IT job , an advice?

[23:29] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; I got really drunk and I started receiving just flashes, black outs.

[23:29] &lt;ghot_reveries&gt; not so anisocial it seems

[23:29] &lt;ghot_ka_sidey&gt; @AntiSocial Wassup

[23:29] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; I was at Pizzeria at 10:15 for once. At PU circle at 11:00 after a single blink.

[23:30] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; I lying down in the QT of Ashok the next moment (at 11:45)

[23:30] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; I was under my bed in RP the next moment and the time was 4:30.

[23:30] &lt;hydragyrum&gt; @AntiSocial What, from your experience, is the magic of BITS Pilani?

[23:30] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; Next day I saw my room and cooridoor covered in Puke and my window broken.

[23:30] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; I learned later that I punched it to break it.

[23:31] &lt;ghot_reveries&gt; Lool

[23:31] &lt;CG_needed&gt; shit 

[23:31] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; @atapi_vatapi - look up placement chronicles and talk to the Wall street club.

[23:31] &lt;FitterHappier&gt; woah!  never blacked out that bad XD

[23:31] &lt;gtrfWEF33&gt; should I take ps2 in 1st sem or 2nd sem for finance?

[23:31] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; @DhaiMard - yes. for details check PS chronicles.

[23:32] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; @Th3_Arr0w - Love you man for this. 

[23:32] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; Let's take this after 23:45

[23:32] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; Let's take just personal stuff after that.

[23:32] &lt;bakagaijin&gt; Will you be giving your nick away to a junior?

[23:33] &lt;nutella1&gt; hello

[23:33] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; @6876 - Take your CGPA above 7. Do a first semester IT PS.

[23:33] &lt;ghot_reveries&gt; @AntiSocial how would you approach bitsian girls going back a year, given another chance? 

[23:33] &lt;Kaldwin&gt; hello

[23:33] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; @ghot_ka_sidey - Record my writeup well, okay?

[23:33] &lt;hydragyrum&gt; @AntiSocial Is social service a necesary-ish thing for higher studies (MS/PhD)?

[23:33] &lt;pagal1&gt; i found with weed in oasis, there is any chance of sem back?

[23:34] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; @ hydragyrum - experience decent tha. Let's take the details after 23:45.

[23:34] &lt;The_Destroyer™&gt;  +history

[23:34] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; @FitterHappier - blackout once, it's good.

[23:34] &lt;FitterHappier&gt; asking the right questions @pagal1

[23:34] &lt;Th3_Arr0w&gt; Okay, how bad is it to not have decided what sector I wanna go in, at the end of 3-1?

[23:34] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; @gtrfWEF33 - first sem for finance job.

[23:34] &lt;nutella1&gt; if no por for a cs guy, how much difference happens

[23:34] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; @bakagaijin - If a stupid foreigner asks me, maybe I will.

[23:34] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; @nutella1 - Hello

[23:35] &lt;derp2&gt; is the ps2 station alotted on cg basis?

[23:35] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; @ghot_reveries - good question.

[23:35] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; Others wait

[23:35] &lt;bakagaijin&gt; Technically, I'm a foreginer only in Nippon

[23:35] &lt;nutella1&gt; helli @antisocial

[23:35] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; I will approach the girls same way I did. I wasn't bad. *wink*

[23:36] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; @hydragyrum - with all due respect for Social Service workers, No, it is not.

[23:36] &lt;6876&gt;   Should someone drink or do substance abbuse just  for a experience , or it wont matter if u eventuall decide not to do it.?? ur take?

[23:36] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; @pagal1 - Talk to SU pres and Disco rep. Yearback is almost guaranteed in case of consumption or possession.

[23:36] &lt;hydragyrum&gt; @AntiSocial follow-up, then what all does matter?

[23:37] &lt;Kaldwin&gt; Is it preferabl to do an on-campus thesis or an off campus thesis?

[23:37] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; @nutella1 - Not at all, unless you want an MBA.

[23:37] &lt;ghot_ka_sidey&gt; @AntiSocial :*

[23:37] &lt;beast89jjj222jhhghmefhdgjejivhuhjjkjhs2HJ&gt; Is it necessary to do courses like DSA to get a good PS 2 in amazon, walmart etc

[23:37] &lt;nutella1&gt; so for it companies no farak?

[23:37] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; @derp2 - branch = CG &gt; courses

[23:37] &lt;ghot_reveries&gt; @the question about you and chicks-it seems my question's assumption was wrong, lets rephrase slightly, what should a person who isn't in depts/clubs/drinking do lol

[23:38] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; @6876 - I won't say no. :P

[23:38] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; @hydragyrum - projects, LoRs, CGPA.

[23:38] &lt;DrakeLol&gt; hey

[23:38] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; @Kaldwin - On campus thesis is shit. outright. I will speak the same on VC's face.

[23:39] &lt;DrakeLol&gt; Relationshi advice

[23:39] &lt;FitterHappier&gt; is there a offshoot thingy for getting IT PS2 for EEE ENI?

[23:39] &lt;hydragyrum&gt; @AntiSocial CG how much, if I am, let's just say, ambitious

[23:39] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; @beast89jjj222jhhghmefhdgjejivhuhjjkjhs2HJ - it's either that or a good (better than most CS people) CG

[23:39] &lt;The_Destroyer™&gt; i am very interested in mechanical and would like to go for higher studies right after graduation. any advice u would like to give&gt;

[23:40] &lt;DrakeLol&gt; CG for finance company?

[23:40] &lt;DrakeLol&gt; Offshoot too?

[23:40] &lt;nutella1&gt; @antisocial which branch are you

[23:40] &lt;The_Destroyer™&gt; also, righnt now my cg is 8.1 and am in 2-1

[23:40] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; @ghot_reveries - the same, what I did. PM me later or ask after 23:45.

[23:40] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; @DrakeLol - Drake, lol!

[23:40] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; @FitterHappier - No, but electives help.

[23:41] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; @hydragyrum - 7.5+ for most. 9+ for DE Shaw. Being a woman for GS.

[23:41] &lt;The_Destroyer™&gt; XD

[23:41] &lt;FitterHappier&gt; FOLLOWUP Considering i dont do DSA only OOP, OS and CompArch is there chance?

[23:41] &lt;hydragyrum&gt; xD

[23:41] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; @The_Destroyer™ - Yes

[23:41] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.

[23:41] &lt;TBG&gt; xD

[23:42] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; That is don't let anyone tell you to go for a job in IT or something.

[23:42] &lt;Kaldwin&gt; follow up which place should a low cg guy try to get a thesis in the area of AI?

[23:42] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; You want to do an MS/PhD, you do it.

[23:42] &lt;The_Destroyer™&gt; yeah i am sure not going into it

[23:42] &lt;pagal1&gt; And in case of drinking?

[23:42] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; People, even with 6.5 CG have gone for decent MS in past.

[23:42] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; Work for what you want and you shall have it.

[23:42] &lt;The_Destroyer™&gt; oh

[23:43] &lt;The_Destroyer™&gt; but i have heard 9+ cg is must to get scholarship

[23:43] &lt;atapi_vatapi&gt; how much does not having a por affects the placement?

[23:43] &lt;kool_kiD&gt; you are not very antisocial afterall

[23:43] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; @DrakeLol - TBH not many finance comapnies come on campus. This sem only one person got placed in a finance firm on campus, hence I cannot speak much about that CGPA criterion,.

[23:43] &lt;wolves&gt; how is having a POR in coding club going to help mee ?

[23:43] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; @FitterHappier - Well, yes, you need to get the knowledge by yourself and keep an 8+ CG

[23:43] &lt;hydragyrum&gt; @AntiSocial I meant CG for higher studies. Like Stanford/MIT/etc. And how much do extra curriculars matter? And in what way?

[23:43] &lt;DrakeLol&gt; Oh thanks!

CG for PS-2 in finance?

[23:44] &lt;The_Destroyer™&gt; Also, does having POR in MEA or IKR-FS help in anyway?

[23:44] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; @Kaldwin - the best will be to get an intern somewhere in a startup in Bangalore or possibly abroad and show it as a thesis.

[23:45] &lt;ghot_reveries&gt; @AntiSocial would an ms in cs(ai) help even if i want to settle in india eventually? 3rd year cs with ~7.5 cg. Ths compared to directly sitting for placements 

[23:45] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; @pagal1 - talk to supri in a good manner and don't give anything in written. You won't even get a fine.

[23:45] &lt;DrakeLol&gt; Should I go for summer research intern in foreign uni or thesis for 4th year? 

[23:46] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; @The_Destroyer™ - scholarship, yes. But not many people go for it. Student loans are always there. Or get a relative living in the country to sponsor you and your dad/yourself to pay them later on.

[23:46] &lt;The_Destroyer™&gt; following

[23:46] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; GUYS, LET'S WRAP UP THE PLACEMENT QUESTIONS AND TALK ABOUT LIFE, COLLEGE AND STUFF?

[23:46] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; Answering this last lot of placement related questions.

[23:47] &lt;kool_kiD&gt; sure man

[23:47] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; @wolves - it won't in placements. It will in having a good campus life.

[23:47] &lt;bakagaijin&gt; +1

[23:47] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; @hydragyrum - stanford and all don't talk about PORs. They do talk about a 9+ CG.

[23:48] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; @The_Destroyer™ - consider changing your orientation

[23:48] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; ?

[23:48] &lt;Th3_Arr0w&gt; LoL

[23:48] &lt;The_Destroyer™&gt; @lolmax sadly, dc culture seems declining to me

[23:48] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; @Canterville_Ghot.™ - End it?

[23:48] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; No, don't.

[23:48] &lt;The_Destroyer™&gt; @antisocial XD

[23:48] &lt;hydragyrum&gt; What is the DC culture?

[23:48] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; I am not allowed to speak that in public.

[23:48] &lt;Canterville_Ghot.™&gt; xD

[23:49] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; @DrakeLol - good boy. Let's talk about it.

[23:49] &lt;DrakeLol&gt; Haan please

[23:49] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; Decide your upper and bottom limit

[23:49] &lt;The_Destroyer™&gt; @lolmax also, lan is replaced with wifi in older bhawans too which will make dc much slower

[23:49] &lt;maroon5&gt; was rap devil better than killshot?

[23:50] &lt;pagal1&gt; +Happy Bhaag Jayegi Returns

[23:50] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; Basically, a standard above which you cannot apply because girls just too good for you

[23:50] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; And below which you don't want to go.

[23:50] &lt;nutella1&gt; how will be the overview of an interview be like: they pounding upon your weaknesses or getting you to talk about what you know

[23:50] &lt;Canterville_Ghot.™&gt; Favourite DC nick?

[23:50] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; Then, be friendly. Don't approach directly with the atitude of just sex.

[23:50] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; DOn't be creap.

[23:50] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; creep*

[23:51] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; Respect girl, maybe.

[23:51] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; And yes, find mutual friends.

[23:51] &lt;DrakeLol&gt; How to start a convo at first place?

[23:51] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; do a favour for her and then in return ask for setting you up. :P

[23:51] &lt;ghot_reveries&gt; hope for common group lmao

[23:51] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; Or meet someone in classes, or DC for that matter. I once scored via DC.

[23:52] &lt;maroon5&gt; guy

[23:53] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; Canterville_Ghot.™ - favourite user or nick?

[23:53] &lt;Canterville_Ghot.™&gt; nick

[23:53] &lt;bakagaijin&gt; Both

[23:53] &lt;Th3_Arr0w&gt; Yes, both.

[23:53] &lt;hydragyrum&gt; What was, in your eyes, the magic of BITS Pilani?

[23:53] &lt;nutella1&gt; @antisocial answer my question just above @canterville's

[23:54] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; nick - my own. This nick is a huge joke on myself. I am the total opposite of antisocial. Possibly the most social person you will know and hence people do go crazy because of that.

[23:54] &lt;Penguin++&gt; ARE WE ALLOWED TO CHAT ON DC???

[23:54] &lt;The_Destroyer™&gt; wtf!?

[23:54] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; user - I will keep the downloaders out of this, because all of them work well.

[23:54] &lt;hydragyrum&gt; @Penguin++ No. You get a semback.

[23:54] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; I say my favourite user in terms of share is TheFourLeafedClover

[23:55] &lt;BeastMaster64&gt; +1 @hydragyrum

[23:55] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; Great collection the user has,

[23:55] &lt;Penguin++&gt; THIS IS A SERIOUS QUESTION. I AM A FRESHER.

[23:55] &lt;bakagaijin&gt; Clearly

[23:55] &lt;ghot_reveries&gt; that is pretty apparent @penguin++

[23:55] &lt;The_Destroyer™&gt; @pengiun++ is ur name satwik?

[23:55] &lt;Canterville_Ghot.™&gt; besides your own nick obv....dont be a narcissist :P

[23:55] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; @nutella1 - this is still placement related. Time out.

[23:55] &lt;Penguin++&gt; BATAO YAAR, DC PE CHAT ALLOWED HAI NA KIDS KO???

[23:56] &lt;Penguin++&gt; MY NAME IS NOT SATWIK.

[23:56] &lt;BeastMaster64&gt; everyone here is already on the way back home because of semback @Penguin

[23:56] &lt;The_Destroyer™&gt; for men yes; for kids no

[23:56] &lt;AntiSocial&gt;  !tempban Penguin++ 

[23:56] &lt;ghot_reveries&gt; ALL CAPS MAYBE

[23:56] &lt;Canterville_Ghot.™&gt; @penguin capslock should be off if you want to chat

[23:56] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; Canterville_Ghot.™ - Fatal1ty

[23:57] &lt;Canterville_Ghot.™&gt; noice "")

[23:57] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; His share was actually like a fatality move. Pretty good a nick hence.

[23:57] &lt;lolmax&gt; Fatal1ty Gawd _/\_

[23:57] &lt;bakagaijin&gt; Does Penguin++ get to read the chat while on a temp ban?

[23:57] &lt;hydragyrum&gt; What was, in your eyes, the magic of BITS Pilani? (bump in case Penguin hided(?) it)

[23:57] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; @hydragyrum - hid*= it*

[23:57] &lt;The_Destroyer™&gt; grammar nazi XD

[23:58] &lt;Th3_Arr0w&gt; bakagaijin: He's not banned.

[23:58] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; the magic was the set of people you get.

[23:58] &lt;hydragyrum&gt; oh f i just had a brain fart

[23:58] &lt;hydragyrum&gt; The set of people?

[23:58] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; This lot is DEFINITELY the best lot in the country, because of no reservation and high cutoffs.

[23:58] &lt;hydragyrum&gt; Friends, you mean?

[23:58] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; No, the people, everyone.

[23:59] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; The alumni network is strong because people have a high average aptitude.

[23:59] &lt;The_Destroyer™&gt; u sure abt high cutoffs?

[23:59] &lt;ghot_reveries&gt; are traps gay

[23:59] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; I am a 2015 batch person. The only juniors I interacted well with were from 2016 batch.

[00:00] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; traps or trans?

[00:00] &lt;ghot_reveries&gt; did you score a 2016?

[00:00] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; @ghot_reveries - a chick from the 2016 batch? Yes.

[00:00] &lt;bakagaijin&gt; +1

[00:00] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; +1

[00:00] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; she was probably the best girl I ever had a thing with.

[00:01] &lt;hydragyrum&gt; I think it's the community that's so tightly knit due to everyone having to be in one place. 

[00:01] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; I deeply regret not converting that into a full fledged relationship when I had the chance.

[00:01] &lt;Canterville_Ghot.™&gt; most painless way of dying?

[00:01] &lt;Canterville_Ghot.™&gt; oh sorry for the timing of the question xD

[00:01] &lt;The_Destroyer™&gt; XD

[00:01] &lt;hydragyrum&gt; xD

[00:01] &lt;ghot_reveries&gt; isnt it the otherway around usually here? full fledged reln then score?

[00:01] &lt;nothingleft&gt; bakagaijin

[00:01] &lt;nothingleft&gt; send highlights

[00:01] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; Hence I say stay open to relationships. They aren't that big a burden as you may think.

[00:02] &lt;ghot_reveries&gt; traps^^^

[00:02] &lt;BeastMaster64&gt; @ghot_reveries depends on the person

[00:02] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; @ghot_reveries - flings are way more common than the mainstream audience realise.

[00:02] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; @Canterville_Ghot.™ - nice question.

[00:02] &lt;ghot_reveries&gt; seems too western to be mainstream here

[00:02] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; I won't go into the chemicals here.

[00:03] &lt;Th3_Arr0w&gt; Chemical = Sed.

[00:03] &lt;ghot_reveries&gt; flings^

[00:03] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; Talking from the more conventional methods, I have always like the idea of jumping off a really high building.

[00:03] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; You see, getting the experience of a skydiving before dying.

[00:03] &lt;The_Destroyer™&gt; y not give it a shot then? XD

[00:03] &lt;!what_goes_around_comes_around&gt; when a senior leaves the campus do they pass on their DC share to any junior to upload it

[00:03] &lt;BeastMaster64&gt; Pretty sure most of the people on campus have a different view on sex as compared to the rest of India

[00:04] &lt;Canterville_Ghot.™&gt; hmmm....

[00:04] &lt;6876&gt; is finding seniors/juniors girls hotter than batchies a common thing?

[00:04] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; @The_Destroyer™ - shh.. wait till I am 50 or something.

[00:04] &lt;The_Destroyer™&gt; yeah many do @whatgoes....

[00:04] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; +1

[00:04] &lt;Canterville_Ghot.™&gt; why a building then? maybe a cliff would be better xD?

[00:04] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; @BeastMaster64 - let's see

[00:04] &lt;heliosun&gt; is this an AMA session?

[00:05] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; Most of the people on campus in Pilani have a relatively more conservative view on sex than metro cities.

[00:05] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; Go to Bangalore/Mumbai and people are way more open/broad.

[00:05] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; @6876 - let's talk in absolutes.

[00:06] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; 2015 has hot women. 2016 has few of them. 2017 is good again.

[00:06] &lt;bakagaijin&gt; Ouch

[00:06] &lt;BeastMaster64&gt; rip

[00:06] &lt;!what_goes_around_comes_around&gt; 2018 is bad again

[00:06] &lt;nothingleft&gt; F

[00:06] &lt;BeastMaster64&gt; +1

[00:06] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; 2018 should be good no? Dumber people = hotter people?

[00:06] &lt;The_Destroyer™&gt; the rule of alternating batchies

[00:06] &lt;BeastMaster64&gt; xD

[00:06] &lt;The_Destroyer™&gt; *batches

[00:06] &lt;[_____]&gt; lol

[00:06] &lt;hydragyrum&gt; TRIGGERED

[00:06] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; IDK as they are just too young and I don't want to call myself a paedophile. :P

[00:06] &lt;The_Destroyer™&gt; XD

[00:07] &lt;Canterville_Ghot.™&gt; okay... had a great time in this AMA, hopefully see ya sometime @antisocial, thanks for the answers bhaiyya. Buh~Bye

[00:07] &lt;The_Destroyer™&gt; should keep such AMA sessions more often. it was really fun

[00:07] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; If most of the people are done with the quesitons, we can actually close this @Canterville_Ghot.™.

[00:07] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; What say people?

[00:08] &lt;hydragyrum&gt; Final thing : (Normie-ish) Advice for first-yearites?

[00:08] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; @The_Destroyer™ - let's hope this one becomes a pilot in many to come.

[00:08] &lt;BeastMaster64&gt; Thanks for the AMA @AntiSocial

[00:08] &lt;Th3_Arr0w&gt; Best memory?

[00:08] &lt;The_Destroyer™&gt; fingers crossed

[00:08] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; @hydragyrum - don't be a normie. :P

[00:08] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; @Th3_Arr0w- right

[00:08] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; I totally forgot that.

[00:08] &lt;Canterville_Ghot.™&gt; nice one

[00:08] &lt;nothingleft&gt; Top 5 Achievements on campus

[00:08] &lt;hydragyrum&gt; @AntiSocial +1. Hope this becomes the pilot.

[00:09] &lt;bakagaijin&gt; +1 ^^

[00:09] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; Having my breakup in 2-2 and seeing so many people on campus caring about me being not depressed in the following period.

[00:09] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; Or let's talk about something purely on campus.

[00:10] &lt;!what_goes_around_comes_around&gt; when will shivg reopen?

[00:10] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; The most memorable on campus

[00:11] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; Okay 

[00:11] &lt;derp2&gt; dont know if its the right place, but any advice to a guy who had a break up after 8 years of relationship with the same girl?

[00:11] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; There was this one night when everything happened way better than I imagined.

[00:12] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; It was 2:45 am in the night and there was nothing to eat. I was in front of FD3 with a group and decided on going to rotunda.

[00:12] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; Found a random box of Pizza and assumed it to be empty. Just flippped it. turns out there were 4 slices and it wasn't rotten.

[00:12] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; Next, in Rotunda we decided to cycle down the NAB path.

[00:12] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; But onyl one had a cycle

[00:13] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; We walked around and found a random cycle outside temple. Unlocked and without a master for 15 minutes.

[00:13] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; Took that to the top of NAB path.

[00:13] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; A security guard came by

[00:13] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; We politely asked if we can cycle down and without question, he agreed.

[00:13] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; Everything went better than anyone could hope.

[00:14] &lt;The_Destroyer™&gt; wow

[00:14] &lt;Th3_Arr0w&gt; The guard comes when I just sit there alone, listening to music. How the hell did he agree to that?!

[00:14] &lt;Kaldwin&gt; intense

[00:14] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; @!what_goes_around_comes_around - if you are courageous enough it is open all the time.

[00:14] &lt;hydragyrum&gt; Which sem was this?

[00:14] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; @Th3_Arr0w - ""politely"" was a keyword

[00:14] &lt;!what_goes_around_comes_around&gt; no sembacks back then?

[00:14] &lt;cyberpython22&gt; when did you stop getting stressed about tut tests and endsems(first yearite here)

[00:14] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; @hydragyrum - last sem. 3-2

[00:15] &lt;AntiSocial&gt; @!what_goes_around_comes_around - courageous and smart*

9y07lg,2,2018-11-17,"[M4A](M playing F) Older woman has affair with younger son, step son, stranger or student. Other ideas in post (futa included) (self.AgeplayPenPals)",Shogun_Logan,AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/9y07lg/m4am_playing_f_older_woman_has_affair_with/,"I am an adult looking for another 18+ year old adult for a fantasy role play.

Please have the Discord app as I prefer to chat on it because of all of its user friendly features (mainly editing posts if mistakes happen).

I'm a male but I’m looking to play as the older woman so I’m looking for someone to be the boy. I'd like the female character to be pretty much based off actress Milla Jovovich and I have a specific idea in mind for the boy but because of the new rules I'm not allowed to say his name.   I am also willing to RP as a second and possibly a third character if there are any addition female characters you might like to have added if they are based on someone we can both agree on.

PM me and we can talk about it (if you don’t like the choice we could possibly change him if need be). Female character would be in her mid-30s to early 40s and male character would be around 12-15.

I was thinking of three possible scenarios (all amendable) and I’m open to any other possible suggestions.

1 - Mom/step mom is about to get married and she is in her [wedding dress](https://imageevent.com/hailtotheking/dppthrowaway13941?p=2&amp;n=1&amp;m=-1&amp;c=4&amp;l=0&amp;w=4&amp;s=0&amp;z=2) and wearing some [white platform heels](https://photos.imageevent.com/hailtotheking/dppthrowaway13941/7C36E731-E4FF-4DF4-ABA2-0AFA02AD9AB4.jpeg ) at the church waiting for the ceremony to start. The son/step son could walk in on her and confess his feelings for her and for what ever reason she decides to give into temptation and have sex with him. Maybe she tells him it has to be a one time thing to get out of his system but once she see's his surprisingly large dick she becomes obsessed with how it stretches her out.

An alternate take on this could be that the boy is some what evil and he blackmails the groom into writing a letter saying the wedding is off (perhaps he threatened to start saying he molested him) and when she finds out that her big day has been ruined he comes in to comfort her, with or with out her really wanting to have sex with him.

2 - Option two is that she is a [married woman](https://imageevent.com/hailtotheking/dppthrowaway13941?p=5&amp;b=-1&amp;m=-1&amp;c=4&amp;w=4&amp;s=1&amp;n=1&amp;l=0&amp;z=9) in a rather loveless marriage. They are fairly wealthy and the husband provides her with pretty much everything she needs...except for routine fucking. Alternatively, she could be completely single and be yearning for her next conquest (especially if it’s extremely risky). One day she comes home from [grocery shopping](https://imageevent.com/hailtotheking/dppthrowaway13941?p=47&amp;b=-1&amp;m=-1&amp;c=4&amp;w=4&amp;s=1&amp;n=1&amp;l=0&amp;z=9) and notices a moving truck next door and spots the absolutely beautiful son of the new neighbors and her [minds starts going to dark sexual places](https://imageevent.com/hailtotheking/dppthrowaway13941?p=50&amp;b=-1&amp;m=-1&amp;c=4&amp;w=4&amp;s=1&amp;n=1&amp;l=0&amp;z=9). After a while, some [light teasing](https://imageevent.com/hailtotheking/dppthrowaway13941?p=177&amp;b=-1&amp;m=-1&amp;c=4&amp;w=4&amp;s=1&amp;n=1&amp;l=0&amp;z=2) and [exhibitionism](https://imageevent.com/hailtotheking/dppthrowaway13941?p=188&amp;n=1&amp;m=-1&amp;c=4&amp;l=0&amp;w=4&amp;s=0&amp;z=9) beings to take place and one day the next door boy comes over and overs to clean her pool/mow her lawn. She gets into a [sexy bikini](https://imageevent.com/hailtotheking/dppthrowaway13941?p=172&amp;b=-1&amp;m=-1&amp;c=4&amp;w=4&amp;s=1&amp;n=1&amp;l=0&amp;z=9) and goes out to the pool to tan and gives him something to look at and she starts to notice his big dick in his shorts.

This concept is highly editable and the two of them could be made to be related instead.

3 - Kind of stole this third idea from someone else’s post but basically I'd be a [woman jogging in the park](https://imageevent.com/hailtotheking/dppthrowaway13941?p=7&amp;b=-1&amp;m=-1&amp;c=4&amp;w=4&amp;s=1&amp;n=1&amp;l=0&amp;z=9) and [getting her daily exorcise](https://imageevent.com/hailtotheking/dppthrowaway13941?p=61&amp;b=-1&amp;m=-1&amp;c=4&amp;w=4&amp;s=1&amp;n=1&amp;l=0&amp;z=9).  I would see you on a park bench by yourself or paying on a on of the athletic fields and I can't take my eyes off you.  As I get closer I can see that your shorts can barely contain your huge dick and I approach you in an attempt to get it inside me.

This idea could feature a bunch of different options. We could be complete and total strangers meeting my chance. It could piggyback of the theme of option 2 and we actually live in the same neighborhood and this is how we approach each other. I could be a mom and my son could go to the same school as you and I’ve seen you at parent teacher meeting and other school functions. Or I could be a teacher at your school and I’ve seen you walking through the halls before. Many options to be decided on this one.

So those are my three ideas but I'm willing to take any suggestions if anyone is interested. I’d also be willing to play multiple women and include a sister character or have a secret (or not so secret) girlfriend on the side. Group role play is also acceptable.

[Lingerie](https://imageevent.com/hailtotheking/dppthrowaway13941?p=181&amp;n=1&amp;m=-1&amp;c=4&amp;l=0&amp;w=4&amp;s=0&amp;z=9), latex, feet and shoes (especially platforms) are a plus. Anal, water sports, cum shots (facials and cream pies) that are larger that normal, public/risky sex, clothed sex, handjobs, squirting, sleep/wake up sex, oral sex (especially giving while the other person is busy doing something else’s like talking on the phone or playing video games with a headset on), [smoking](https://imageevent.com/hailtotheking/dppthrowaway13941?p=163&amp;n=1&amp;m=-1&amp;c=4&amp;l=0&amp;w=4&amp;s=0&amp;z=9), stomach distention/inflation, larger objects, fisting, beast, [glasses](https://imageevent.com/hailtotheking/dppthrowaway13941?p=196&amp;n=1&amp;m=-1&amp;c=4&amp;l=0&amp;w=4&amp;s=0&amp;z=9), tattoos and piercings and a lot more are all acceptable kinks in my book.

My only hard limits are snuff, gore, vore, and scat.

Here is a link to some pictures of Milla to give some visual references plus some dick pics for the boy’s genitals to be modeled after.

———————-

All the ideas above can be played as me being a dickgirl but here are some extra ideas for FUTA prompts (but could also be regular genetic female).

Like above, I’d want my character to be based off Milla Jovovich (specially the first few photo options in the link below). The other roles can also be based off actors, models or any one else you’d like to use as a visual basis. https://imageevent.com/hailtotheking/dppthrowaway13941

A) I would be the [boss](https://imageevent.com/hailtotheking/dppthrowaway13941?p=0&amp;b=-1&amp;m=-1&amp;c=4&amp;w=4&amp;s=1&amp;n=1&amp;l=0&amp;z=9) or a [high level executive](https://imageevent.com/hailtotheking/dppthrowaway13941?p=4&amp;b=-1&amp;m=-1&amp;c=4&amp;w=4&amp;s=1&amp;n=1&amp;l=0&amp;z=9) at some kind of company and I'm always [wearing](https://imageevent.com/hailtotheking/dppthrowaway13941?p=62&amp;b=-1&amp;m=-1&amp;c=4&amp;w=4&amp;s=1&amp;n=1&amp;l=0&amp;z=9 some kind of [suit](https://imageevent.com/hailtotheking/dppthrowaway13941?p=207&amp;b=-1&amp;m=-1&amp;c=4&amp;w=4&amp;s=1&amp;n=1&amp;l=0&amp;z=9) for the [most part](https://imageevent.com/hailtotheking/dppthrowaway13941?p=68&amp;b=-1&amp;m=-1&amp;c=4&amp;w=4&amp;s=1&amp;n=1&amp;l=0&amp;z=9). You’ve just started working at the same place (full employee or summer internship). I’m pretty demanding and have a bit of a temper while you’re soft spoken and fairly intimidated by me. After some time there you start hearing rumors about me and how I’m different and you become increasingly intrigued by what you’ve heard. Alternatively, I could be the one that take a great interest in your youthful body and my condition could be a total surprise to you when I make my move on you.

This scenario would have me be in my late 30s, early 40s with my new employee being around 16-24 and their gender could be male or female. If you want to go younger, pitch me an idea of the situation to explain your presence (maybe you’re the kid of an employee and you’re in the building for some reason).

B) I'm a [military instructor](https://imageevent.com/hailtotheking/dppthrowaway13941?p=1&amp;b=-1&amp;m=-1&amp;c=4&amp;w=4&amp;s=1&amp;n=1&amp;l=0&amp;z=9) at a juvenile boot camp for troubled youth and you're a real piece of work and I make it my personal goal in life to break you out of your delinquent lifestyle by any means necessary.  Maybe I single you out during P.T. and make you keep doing obstacle course runs over and over and at some point I stop you in the woods when we are alone.  Or maybe I keep you exercising well into the night and while everyone else is at the mess hall eating dinner I finally let you stop and tell you go take a shower before going to eat.  While you're in the shower I come in an join you.  Another option could be that I sneak into the barracks in the middle of the night and pull you out of bed and drag you outside and have my way with you.  You're character could be gay or bi and be openly flirting and teasing with me or it could be completely against your will.

Yet another way this could go is that I'm in another country on deployment.  You could be a local kid from a near by town or village that hangs around near the base.  I notice you one day trying to make some money by selling bootleg stuff or offering to be an interrupter but I'm more interested in another service that you may or may not be willing to give.

C) I’m a [teacher](http://imageevent.com/hailtotheking/dppthrowaway13941?p=38&amp;b=-1&amp;m=-1&amp;c=4&amp;w=4&amp;s=1&amp;n=1&amp;l=0&amp;z=9), a [counselor](http://imageevent.com/hailtotheking/dppthrowaway13941?p=39&amp;n=1&amp;m=-1&amp;c=4&amp;l=0&amp;w=4&amp;s=0&amp;z=2) or [P.E. teacher/coach](https://imageevent.com/hailtotheking/dppthrowaway13941?p=6&amp;b=-1&amp;m=-1&amp;c=4&amp;w=4&amp;s=1&amp;n=1&amp;l=0&amp;z=9) at a school. I could be a teacher you have a class in every single day or I could be someone that teaches a higher grade than yours and you’ve just seen me around before. This could go either way we me being attracted to you and making the first move or if could be the other way around. Maybe one day you notice something off with my skirt or pants, a lump that shouldn’t be there, and you want to find out more.

If I’m a P.E. teacher/coach maybe one day I’ve told everyone to get changed and I call you into my office and we have a discussion about your recent lack of effort in class. By the time we finish everyone else is gone so you hit the shower to clean up before leaving for the day while I stay in my office for a bit. You finish your shower and changing in the locker room and walk past my office. I had completely forgotten you were here so I took my dick out and started stroking it to porn on my phone. At first you’re freaked out but then you start to get excited. 

Alternatively, it could be me that goes to shower, thinking you had already left after changing. You spot me in there back first lathering my hair and then I turn and you see my large semi hard dick hanging between my legs.

This option could have me be any age between late 20s-early 40s. You could be a female or male student. Age ranges could be wide for this, 13 to early 20s. For young female students we could use girls that look like Eleven from Stranger Things, Hit-Girl from Kick-Ass, Mathilda from The Professional or any number of possibilities.

D) Final scenario is that I’m a [mechanic](https://imageevent.com/hailtotheking/dppthrowaway13941?p=3&amp;b=-1&amp;m=-1&amp;c=4&amp;w=4&amp;s=1&amp;n=1&amp;l=0&amp;z=9) at a little garage in the middle of no where. I’m the only one that works there so I’m by myself at the place. For your character you could be someone that just got their learners permit a couple of months ago and you’re freaking out because something is going wrong with the car. You’ve stopped at my garage in hopes oh getting a quick fix but you’re blindsided by the cost and you can’t afford it...so we work out another form of payment. 

Another option could be that you’re the kid of the driver and that way you can be younger if you’d like or you’re a runaway or just out playing further from home than you normally do."
9y1bdj,8,2018-11-17,I (m23) just found out I will be a father soon but not with my current girlfriend.

We didnt have any form of contact since I broke up with her 6 months ago. It was a rather short relationship since it all started out as an one-night-stand where I felt guilty and didnt and thought might aswell give it a shot. 
Relatively soon after it ended i got back in touch with my crush from back in the days when we were in school (i know her for 9 years). I immidiately felt the same way I did back then and we (finally) got into a relationship. I could not be happier than I am with her.  
So these news hit me like a truck. I am neither in the finacial (student and intern with shitty payment) nor emotional situation for a child. I am stressing out so much atm. I am afraid I will loose my gf because of this. 

Right now I only heard it from my friend whom I trust 100%. I dont know what she (ex) thinks about it or of it is confirmed. 
How do I handle this? Help :( it feels like my whole life and future is turned upside and I dont know how to handle it

Left out some smaller details since I am on mobile, its 1 am where I live and cant think clearly. 


Edit: 
Now that I have slept a bit I've decided to: 
tell my gf today, tell my parents only if a paternity test comes in as positive, won't sign paperworks until confirmed, will try to be a dad for the child even if I am not ready for it

Thanks you guys!"

I haven't worked a full time job till now and all I have on my portfolio are two internships that I worked in time as a bachelor's student. (One relevant, one not so much)

I took the decision to go for an advanced degree right after finishing my UG from my home country. Masters was a great ride and I was elated on  my graduation day. I could never anticipate  what was coming. It's been over six months now and I have had to face countless rejections and my mental state is often in shreds because I tend to feel worthless. 

I have what I would deem a solid portfolio with a diverse pallette of projects that I worked on during my Masters(past two years) and my bachelors. I try hard to pitch those as my selling point because I lack experience and I am not a citizen. I have a portfolio, a GitHub profile linked with all my projects and achievements (intangibles I am very much proud of) and everything else one must have before going out in the job market. I write tech articles on medium. I publish for two medium-scaled journals. 

I am going for entry level data analyst roles as of now but I am having a hard time getting the one break I so very much need right now. I am neck deep in student loans and everything at the moment is going south; nothing seems to be going up.

Any advice at this point from this community would mean a lot to me because I would rather not prefer going to people who can't empathize and judge me for being unable to fetch a job. 

Thanks much. "

Out of the 500 applications I filled on LinkedIn, Indeed, Angellist and Glassdoor, I managed to land 2-3 online coding tests. I completed one of them successfully, however, I still got rejected because I didn't have enough experience. 

I downloaded Eventbrite and meetup and am going to as many events as possible to try to meet new people.

I'm seeking a long term/ short term RP partner for a collaboration on a feminization story. Maybe this is you. My writing partner must be a solid writer, good at character development, dialog and not just looking for stroke material. Writers who enjoy sensuality, eroticism, and romance will get preference. If you're a strong, dominant type who is also kind and loves the build and the romance and eroticism involved with a story like this then you may be the partner for me. :)

I love building backstory with my partner as we iron out all the details. We don't need to figure out the whole story, just your basic story beats so we have some direction. I've worked really hard on this prompt so I ask you to please not message me with lazy, half-hearted responses. I think with the right partner we could have a blast with this!

The type of stories I prefer are focused on a transformation that takes time to complete. I prefer to go from naïve boi to (your ideal version of a woman). The plot would have to come first of course.
So those of you looking for a quick story in which we start having sex, I am not your gurl.

Plot elements I like:

As stated above I like the naïve boi that goes along with authority figures because he believes they know what's best. One thing to note is I prefer men to women when the transformation is complete. The method in which I become attracted or obsessed with men I would prefer to be a natural progression. For example, loving the way being wanted feels then becoming desperate to attain more of it and one time going too far and realizing that the attention is only half the fun... ;)

Or you know a good old stand by the poor intern at Disney world that has to become a Disney Princess and through a slow mental manipulation process becomes the princess of the parks desires...This can be taken many directions and be a fun way to manipulate the character into becoming feminine perfection and having to love it in order to keep my job. At first hating and fighting it but eventually loving the feeling of being the princess to the prince or park attendees...


It would be helpful to the plot if I were to start as a virgin.

Another plot point that I like is trying to hide the changes to mind and body. If the changes occur at work I like trying to hide them at home so my parents or roommates don't notice. Or if they are happening at home trying to hide them at work.

Method: I like ""realistic"" changes like HYPNOSIS, hormones and surgeries . Science fiction can be fun when paired with the hormones I.e. Fast acting ones.

Slow moving magical curses are also super fun. I like day to day or week to week changes that my character has to get used to in everyday life.

Dislikes: I don't like scat play (including diapers)or furry. But I am game for whatever else sound fun to you.

Likes: Above all I want you to enjoy it. IRL I am a bottom and pleasing is what I prefer.

I am an intern at Bobo Corp.

I am not a bad man, I am not a terrible person.

I just....got a little greedy.

About 2 days ago, the 16th, I was approached by a figure in a trench coat.

I was told to call him ""Dave"", and to meet him at that street corner the day after, same time.

We stopped at a Wendies and ""Dave"" gave me his pitch.

He wanted incite into Bobo. 

He wanted me to bug Mr. Daul's office. Learn all I could about the next big project.

I brought the coffee for Mr. Daul so this wasn't hard.

But things got weird with Daul, he got way more secretive.

And based off those recordings its not hard to see why.

Mr. Daul made contact with something that night. Something he couldn't get rid of."

Saw a ton of cars swerving in front of m, but by the time I saw the animal t was too late to get around it. based on the upward thrust of the nose of the car, I was prepared to get out and see absolute carnage. The only cosmetic damage is a cracked bumper cover and some mangled plastic under-body shrouds. The deer took every single piece of plastic cover off of the underside of the car.

&amp;#x200B;

So far from my very preliminary inspection:

* no oil/ leaks from around the oil pan, oil filter looks a little damp (I did change the oil only hours before doing this, it may just be from that).
* Radiator fan still works
* A/C and heater work
* transmission pan appears to be fine, no issue with shifter linkage or leaks from what I could see
* both front suspension corners appear to be fine, and the car drove normally for the rest of the trip with no noises or weird steering
* no brake line leaks, brakes are working normally
* plastic intake before the air filter is shattered

I am taking the car to a shop in the morning for a more thorough inspection. I am on an internship, and don't have the means to jack it up on my own. If anyone has any other places to inspect that I may have missed, please let me know. I don't think the car is totally fucked, but I really don't want to be wrong.

I'm currently a senior in college pursuing a B.S in Health Sciences, but have had a passion for baseball for as long as I can remember. I played up until my sophomore year of college, and since then become very interested in the field of analytics and data science. I am planning to graduate by March and have decided that I want to try and pursue a career in baseball while I have the time to do so. I've found several threads on this sub helpful, and am trying to put together the right pieces in order to get my foot in the door somewhere. This past summer, I started a blog (I'm not sure if I'm allowed/should link it) where I've tried to put out articles as frequently as possible. I felt it was a good way to get my feet wet in the field, and also provide a way to track my progress. Even if the content isn't the most advanced or ground breaking, I think having some sort of working portfolio is better than nothing. Aside from this, I'm developing my SQL, R and Python toolkit via online resources, all of this outside of my normal school schedule.

I've applied to several internships with teams as they've popped up this season, but haven't had much success. I've reached out to some front office personnel personally, and they've suggested I look into the winter meetings. I'm unfamiliar with how the PBEO job fair actually works aside from whats detailed on the website. At this point, online registration has closed and I'd have to register on-site in Las Vegas. My dilemma is whether or not I should bite the $275 fee and give it a shot in general. I know the job fair takes place from Dec 9-12, but I have a physiology final December 10th from 10-1. I'm about a 4 hour drive from Vegas, and would be missing the first two days of the fair. I guess to specify my questions:

\- Do tickets to the job fair at the Winter Meetings ever sell out?

\- Is it really worth $275 to miss the first two days of the job fair, drive out and hope my resume gets picked to interview within the last two days?

\- If not the Winter Meetings/if the Winter Meetings don't go well, what's next?

I really want to roll the dice with this. I love the game, and I think my passion is shown through all the work I do purely out of interest. However, I understand that I need to consider all factors in order to make the most logical decision, and I would be grateful for some input.

He was enthusiastic as well and said we're going deeper in to it next year. So this year we finally came across CSS Grid just to find out he was talking about the bootstrap kind of grid system, not the literal CSS Grid properties. What a bummer. Now on my internship we're also working with the bootstrap CSS Grid system but not (yet?) with the CSS Grid property. Again, a bummer. As the Grid properties are so extremely handy. 

This made me question whether or not there are companies using the CSS Grid property for their websites. Do you use CSS Grid already and if yes why? If no, why not? What are the advantages of a grid system above the CSS Grid property?

Thank you for answering! "

Long time reader, first time poster here. I have long wanted to post my confession here to make myself feel better, but never had the guts to do so. Finally I decided that I needed some closure so that I can stop thinking about my past flings. English is not my first language, so please bear with me if my story below is poorly described. With the exception of names being changed and the conversations translated from my native language, the entire story and context below is true. If it is too long, just skip to the part with \[TLDNR\].

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

To begin with, I was very close friends with Zack. Although I am 6 years older, he was very mature for his age when I first knew him back then. He was 14 and I was 20. All these while, I have not met him for a long time when I got a job in a different suburb of the city we live in, while he continued schooling.

Fast forward a few years until this story happened (somewhere 2013). Zack has recently started working while I met an intern at work called Sue. She mentioned that we have met before during a career fair we both attended several months before she started interning at my workplace. Although I had no recollection of ever meeting her before, she definitely caught my attention now. Sue has a petite frame of almost 5 feet, with straight, long hair. She has a shy but very sweet smile, which somehow makes a great match with her beautiful, oval face. She clearly has good fashion sense and was good at her make-up which accentuated her beauty. She always wore clothes which hugged her very slim figure, and it was obvious her C-cup breasts was very noticeable to men nearby, always causing heads to turn. She was shadowing my work as part of her internship, and 6 months later from the day she showed up at my workplace, she was gone.

I did not give Sue much thought until several weeks later, I bumped into Zack at a newly opened mall in the city. After exchanging pleasantries and having a quick update on each other's lives, he told me that he was waiting for his girlfriend who was at the fitting room trying on outfits. Turns out his girlfriend is none other than Sue. None of us knew about us knowing each other, and we had a good laugh about it. As we went our own ways I recall turning back and noticed how radiant and sexy she looked.

A week or two later, Zack texted asking me to come over to his place for a party. Although most of his friends are too young for me, I didn't want to disappoint him and agreed. I reached the party and true enough, most of the party-goers are either in their late teens or early 20s at best. When I was there, I saw Zack flirting with a very attractive girl (Quinn) while Sue was in another corner, clearly green with envy. I said a quick hello to Zack. He managed to tell me that he needed to ask for a favour in private later, and he immediately turned his attention back to Quinn. I later talked to Sue, and I remembered clearly how her face lit up when she saw me. She later returned back to her sad frown. I asked her what is wrong, which she pointed out at Quinn. I gave a lame response about how he is just entertaining the guests but I know that was futile considering he was only entertaining one girl that evening. I later found out that Zack met Quinn at a bar several weeks ago and they have been in touch everyday since. As most of the guests have left, I stayed back to help Zack and Sue with the cleanup. When Sue was out of earshot, Zack whispered to me with a wicked grin ""About that favour... can you fuck Sue for one night?"". I was caught off guard that I nearly dropped the glasses I was washing. I managed ""Excuse me? Are you crazy?"". Zack explained that he had a thing for Quinn for a while and that he knows Sue has been fantasizing about a man during her internship which he later found out was me. He needed that favour from me to bargain with Sue in exchange for a fling with Quinn. I was silent the whole time trying to process these thoughts in my head. I am not the attractive sort of guy that I would expect a beautiful girl like Sue to fantasize about me. Zack was persistent in asking for my agreement. As much as my manhood was dying for a taste of Sue, I did not feel comfortable as he was one of my best friends for a long time while Sue became from a mere workplace acquaintance to a friend. I left abruptly blaming that I had too much to drink.

Over the next week, Zack was texting me almost on a daily basis to ask me if I was OK with his proposal. I did not want to spoil our friendship as it really meant a lot to me, and I certainly did not want Sue to blame me for the failure of their relationship. One day Zack texted me when I had a bad day at the office, and I responded with ""Let it go. Sue will not be OK with this if she found out about it"". To my amazement, Sue texted me a few hours later with the subtle ""We need to talk"". I met with Sue for drinks after work, and she did not beat around the bush ""I know about it. I am the one who told Zack about this idea"". I was dumbfounded. I then half-heartedly tried to talk Sue out of that idea, until she shot me down with something I did not know. ""We are on the rocks for some time now. Sex is boring and if this is what we both need maybe we should live with it and try to fix our relationship to move on."" After a long silence with me trying to process all these drama the both of them laid on me, I told her ""Alright, I am in"". I could tell there was a twinkle in her sweet smile which she tried to hide. I added ""Let me be the one to tell Zack"". Sue nodded in agreement.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* TLDNR \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

On the Friday of that week, Sue called me as I was about to leave the office and asked ""Are you free tonight? Can I come over?"". I did not expect that phone call as both Zack and Sue were silent ever since the last time I told them I agreed to their plans. I managed ""What about Zack?"". There was a short pause until Sue said ""He is out of town for the weekend with Quinn"". I agreed to her coming over to my place, and I got a pack of condoms on my way back.

I tidied up my apartment and took a quick shower when I heard a ring on my doorbell. I grabbed a towel and quickly put on a pair of shorts. I looked through the peephole and saw Sue. I ushered her in and ask her to take a seat while I continue to dry myself. She was carrying her handbag with a matching red tone with her dress. Her dress in turn hugged her figure tightly and accentuated her breasts even more. She looked shy and uncomfortable, but I thought that I would leave her alone for now. I put on a shirt and went back to check on her. She did not move from her seat. I said ""If you don't want this, then don't. Tell Zack how you feel."" Her reply was forever etched in my mind to this day: ""I fantasized about this for a long time. I just want to know if you do as well."" I only managed a nod and I leaned in for a kiss. Till this day, I can still remember the soft, sweet kiss and the intoxicating smell of her perfume mixed with her body's aroma. The kiss was slow at first with us exploring each other's lips. Then, she jumped into my arms when I hugged her waist. We wrapped our arms around each other as we continued to move around and explore each other's body. I could feel her breasts pressing through the fabric that I was rock-hard instantaneously. She pushed me away gently and started walking towards my room and told me to walk in after 5 minutes and seduce her. I barely waited for the 5 minutes she asked for before I felt silly, and I walked in as I could not wait for what was about to happen next.

Sue was lying under my blanket, and her dress was already dropped on the floor. I undressed myself with the exception of my boxers and joined her under the blankets. As I touched her I can hear her sigh. I discovered that she is wearing only her lingerie, but also she put on a blindfold on herself as well. I moved my hands all over her body until it rested on her stomach and pulled her to me. I kissed her passionately and as her tongue touched mine I could swear that it tasted like sweet berries. I moved my hand to grope her breasts before deciding that I could wait no longer and moved to her back and unhooked her lacy bra. I threw it on the floor and mouthed a very loud ""Oh my god"" as I fondled her very generous breasts. They felt even bigger than the C-cup I thought they were, and they are definitely perky yet firm. Sue moved her hands inside my boxers to stroke my erect cock. I moved my hand to massage her clit over her panties as she moaned continuously. Her panties was getting soaked so I pulled them down and continued to massage her clit. I moved my hand lower to massage her soaking pussy and continued to tease her until she begged me to put my fingers in. As I did, I can hear her squeal in delight as I stroked my fingers inside her. It was such a turn on and she was so good at stroking my cock as well. The sloshing sound that was produced by her tight, wet pussy did not help matters at all as I was afraid I might orgasm soon. She groped around as her blindfold was still on until she pulled down my boxers and held my cock in her grasp. She smiled and said ""I don't even do this for Zack"" when she wrapped her lips around my cock and sucked on it. I could tell she was not exaggerating when she sloppily sucked my cock, but it got better as it went on. To be honest, I did felt a pang of guilt when she muttered my best friend's name, but that quickly evaporated when I looked down on her naked body.

I continued to stroke my fingers up and down inside her pussy while she sucked my cock. I was afraid I might not last long as she was picking up the pace, until I told her to slow down and she said she wanted me to fuck her. I slipped on a condom and I changed my position so I could enter her in a missionary position. As I entered her, she asked me ""Are you wearing a condom?"" I said yes, when she reached around for my cock and pulled out the condom and threw it away. She said ""I'll get the pill tomorrow morning"". I did not bother to utter a protest as I entered her bare. The feeling of the bare skin on my cock when it entered her very wet and tight pussy was so overwhelming I had to go really slow. I pulled her hips down on me so I could penetrate deeper. She was moaning louder and louder while shouting my name at some point which I find it impossible to bear. To delay myself from having an orgasm too early, I slipped my cock out and went down on her. She was so wet she made a huge spot on my bed already. She tugged at my hair and pressed my head down on her as she wrapped her legs around my neck. I continued to lick her wet pussy and fingered her clit at the same time. At some point when I went down on her, she took off her blindfold. She was nearly close until she pushed my head away and said she wanted to ride me. As we swapped positions, she tried to position herself on top of me. As she was extremely tight and I am below average in length (about 4 inches I guess), we didn't make much progress and I fucked her doggy-style instead. I thought going slow will slow things down, but the sight of her cute ass throttling on my cock was just too much for me to handle. I reached forward and cupped both her breasts, and she arched her back upwards so she can reach behind and pull my heard closer as I licked her neck. I released her breasts and she went back down on all fours. We later switched back to the missionary style she seemed to like a lot. I had to constantly distract myself as her tight pussy squeezing on my bare cock drove me insane. She started squealing again and when she wrapped her legs around my back, I picked up the pace. I could feel her fingernails digging into my back but all I could feel was ecstasy at this point. She started contracting her muscles and I had an orgasm almost immediately, unleashing a huge load inside her. I continued to pound her while she fingered her clit. Her legs started shaking and had a full blown orgasm not long after. Her contraction was so intense I thought her pussy was going to push my cock out. As it subsided, we both rolled over, panting while she rested her head on my chest. I could not wipe that grin off my face, and I can still remember her sweet, blissful smile as she rested on my chest. We both fell into a deep sleep not long later.

I woke up in the middle of the night with a numb arm that Sue was sleeping on. She was a light sleeper and I woke her up as I tried to push her away gently. She mumbled an apology and went back to sleep. As my arm was recovering, the memory of fucking Sue last night was still vivid in my mind. I realized that I am fully erect again. I woke her up for some slow, vanilla, missionary sex. About half an hour later, we both rolled over to sleep.

Despite her initial intentions to stay at my place for 2 nights, the awkwardness in the following Saturday morning prompted her to go back home. Despite the insane sex from last night, I did not bother to persuade her to stay as I was a bit uncomfortable with it myself since we both partially came to our senses. She texted me that she got the morning pill later. Zack came back on Sunday night feeling extremely pleased with himself. The smug on his face somehow triggered the second time I hooked up with Sue again, but more on that in part 2 if you guys liked my confession here."

The events are based on real life, while the conversations and details have been suitably modified for better narration and in the interest of anonymity. 


---------------

I used to work at a big finance firm a few years back. Our company hired many junior undergrads as summer interns who were invited to work on certain projects for a few weeks. Based on their performance and abilities, they would be later extended a full time position (or not). One of the things I used to love about this program was the eagerness and enthusiasm of those young undergrads to please their superiors. I have always had a dominant streak in me, be it inside the bedroom or otherwise. Setting up rules for someone to achieve their goals, training them with the discipline they need to develop in themselves, pushing them out of their comfort zone, are some of the things I have found that I enjoy that naturally come to me. Being a mentor for a small team of these summer interns would mean taking the responsibility to guide them through their project, and cultivating these skills in them. Besides, their willingness to learn was the cherry on the cake. 

This one particular year I was supposed to handle a team of 5 interns. 3 young men and 2 young women : David, Tyler, John, Diane and Susan. They were intelligent, smart, and ambitious young students who wanted to make their mark. It was obvious from their interactions with me as well as with each other that these weren't your typical spoilt and entitled college kids, but people who were willing to work hard and put in the effort to achieve what they wanted. 

I must admit, even though I was always professional with them in our meetings and discussions, there was a great deal which I could've never openly admitted to any of my colleagues lest it was interpreted in a way that could damage my reputation. However logical the human brain might be in its rational moments, the primal part of it can't help but feel the emotions that naturally arise. Looking at Susan you would say it was no surprise that I fell for her charms and feminine beauty. A petite brunette, naturally beautiful breasts, a rather supple derriere, she was the object of desire for every male set of eyes on the floor and the object of envy for every female. Smart and sweet. Giggly and friendly. She was a breath of fresh air for anyone she came to interact with. The geeky glasses she used to wear and the way her eyes turned wide when she was confused when I talked about some intricate concept in detail were only some of the little things that added to her delightful presence. 

The interns went back to their hometowns to finish their senior year in college at the end of summers. David, Diane and Susan had made the cut. They received their full time position offers a few weeks after the internship ended, and all three of them had accepted it. That evening Susan texted me saying how excited she was to get the position and thanked me for the mentorship and how it wouldn't have been possible to get there without me. This was the first time that we talked after the internship was over. I replied her back saying all that she achieved was due to her own effort, my role in it was minimal. We texted back and forth for a while that night, before she had to go back to her assignments and we said our goodnights. 

Over the next few months, the frequency of texts from Susan increased. Initially it used to be about logistical issues, questions pertaining to the position of new hires in the company, or something related to moving to the new city etc. Over time, it gradually proceeded to more personal happenings from her life, like how she was having a bad day or if the new assignment was giving her a tough time or how Kelly was being a mean bitch to her. Conversations with her were always interesting. She was a curious young mind who wanted to know and experience as much as she could about the world. At the same time, she was still the naive and innocent young one, who was still in the phase of that delightfully carefree adolescence when you had very few responsibilities which burdens so many adults from being fun. We texted about inconsequential things, yet nothing sexual so far. It was my self imposed policy to never initiate a relationship of that nature with anyone in my workplace. 

The year passed and the fresh hires were ready to join. Our team had planned of throwing a little house party to welcome them to the new job. It was decided that for the sake of convenience of everyone, the party would be held at my place. My home was the nearest to the office, and that way no one would have to travel much. Sure, I didn't mind.

That Friday we (4 of my colleagues, the 3 new hires, and I) headed back to my apartment after office. We had ordered food and some drinks and were generally having a good time sharing some of the stories from our first year experiences working at the firm. We were sitting in the living room all this time. About an hour into the stories Susan had the urge to go to the washroom. When she came back, she looked at me with a confused look in her eyes and at first I couldn't figure out why, nor did I bother to find out more. She took the seat nearest to me and after a few moments, leaned in to whisper something into my ears

""I have so many questions! Why do you have that *inscribed* dog collar in your room, when you have no pets?""

Her emphasis on inscribed made it clear that she had read what the collar said. That was the moment I realized what had just happened. When she went to the guest bathroom, Diane was already using it, and so Susan had went to the one inside my bedroom. Unfortunately, (or fortunately?) I didn't get the time to clean up my room after a regular play session with one of my subs the previous nights, and Susan had accidentally stumbled upon that collar. 

From the tone of her voice, it was clear enough that she was as yet not exposed to this world of kinks. I had to make a crucial decision at that time. I could either brush off the question, or take this as an opportunity to take a curious mind and introduce it to an interesting world of perversions. Her eyes were looking into mine, waiting for an explanation, while I was taking my time to contemplate how best to answer it.

Part 2

-------



I looked around the cafe as I sat at my table awaiting the arrival of my fellow colleague, and depending on how things went ahead, a potential playmate. I sipped a glass of water to collect my thoughts, running over my plan for this afternoon in my mind on how best to intrigue Susan's curiosity. So far her accidentally finding out the collar in my room had made her curious enough to agree seeing me alone. But if I wanted this to end as I had pictured it, I had to play all my cards right and leave nothing to chance. My seat at the far end of the cafe allowed me to have a direct view of the entrance. I let a smile form on my face as the door opened and I saw her enter, looking around before finding me. She waved her hand as she began walking towards me. I stood up to greet her as she came nearer. Here it begins...

*""I have so many questions! Why do you have that inscribed dog collar in your room, when you have no pets?"" she asked me. I took a moment to consider how best to answer her question.*

*""I'll tell you later, text me tonight"" was the only short reply I gave. There were too many people around at the time to delve deeper into the topic.*

*Indeed, not much time after the party ended I received a text from her : ""Now can you tell me what was all that about?""* 

*How much time had it been yet since they left? She could've hardly got into her Uber by this time!*

*""Long story. Meet me tomorrow at Andy's Brews at noon, and I'll tell you all about it"" I sent her back. This was followed by some back and forth with her making up excuses as to how she was busy, and trying to get her answers out of me over text. But I knew that the goal I had in my mind required me to read her reactions, something which wasn't possible over texts. She eventually gave in to her curiosity and agreed to meet for half an hour.*

She took the seat opposite to me and we ordered our coffees. The first few minutes of our conversation had been about irrelevant things. The things that don't matter, which everyone involved knows. Yet for the sake of following social protocols they talk about them nonetheless, even though they already have something specific on their minds. Our coffees arrived in a while. We took a couple of sips, before her questions began. Questions that I knew must've been burning in her mind since last night.

""So..that collar..interesting piece of decoration you have hidden in your bedroom huh?"" she began, trying to start it on a light note.

""Decoration...A curious choice of words."" was all that I offered, enjoying her uneasiness to directly address it. She was getting fidgety with her curiosity.

""Now come on, what was it? You don't own any pets, of that I am sure. And even if you did, who in their right minds would name them.."" she consciously lowered her voice before finishing her sentence ""*slut*?""

I could hardly control myself and allowed a chuckle to escape. I saw her throwing a confused, and a slightly annoyed look at my condescending reaction. I composed myself before answering her question.

""Okay, you are right about me owning pets. I don't. But that collar isn't mean for *animals*.""

""What do you me...what? I don't ...do you mean..Can you please stop talking in riddles? I can't get that image out of my head since the time I saw it! Will you just tell me now?"" she grew frustrated at the fun I was having at her expense.

""Fair enough"" I said, composing myself again. ""Before I answer that, what do you know about BDSM?""

Susan was taken by surprise at the counter question.

""Umm...I don't know much..isn't that some fetish when people beat up their partners during sex? I never understood what could possibly turn them on about it!"" she offered.

I visibly gasped at the view she had in mind of the whole concept.

""And where did you get this idea? 50 shades?"" I enquired.

""Yeah...I guess so.."" she replied sheepishly, sensing from my reaction that her guess was far from accurate.

""Oh dear...you need to forget all that you think you 'learned' about BDSM from that movie"" I was well aware how majority of the people had weird misconceptions about the lifestyle, but every single time I talked to someone new about their notions of BDSM, they managed to surprise me.

""Okay, I can tell you all about it if you are interested. I myself have been practicing this lifestyle since quite some time now, and let me begin by saying that what you just described is a rather tiny fraction of BDSM, called sadism and masochism. And even then, its not at all what you think it is."" I noticed that she had put down her coffee on the table and was intently listening. Good, I had her attention.

""BDSM is much more than that. Infact, for the most part it need not even be sexual. Let's start with the basics. In its most simplified form, there are two partners in a BDSM relationship. One, who is the Dominant type, or Dom, and the other who is a Submissive type, or a Sub. There are many nuances, of course, but for now let's just talk about this. Are you with me so far?""

She nodded.

""Good. Now, the relationship doesn't have to be sexual always. There are many aspects of it. Let's talk about control and power exchange, which have nothing to do with sex. Being a sub in a D/s type dynamic with someone means allowing them to make certain decisions for you. This does not mean that the sub has absolutely no power over her life and has to obey everything that her Dom says. Far from it. Infact, counter-intuitive though it might seem, it is the Sub who has the real power. It is the Sub who *chooses* to obey. The Dom in this dynamic only has as much power over the Sub as the Sub allows him to take. With me so far?""

""What do you mean make decisions? What kind of decisions?"" she asked. Clearly, her mind had begun processing all the new information being thrown at her.

""Great question. Like I said, it depends on what the Sub *allows*. It could be something as innocent as choosing what she wears on a particular day. Or it can be something as depraved as controlling when she gets to have an orgasm."" I took a pause to observe her reaction. It was the first time in all the time we had known each other that we were venturing into discussions of such a dark nature. Much of our interactions had been professional, or rather platonic at best. It was important to tread these waters lightly before pulling her in deeper.

Susan's reaction was interesting. Her eyebrows shot up at the last sentence, but she spoke nothing. Her curiosity urged me through her silence to fill her with more of the knowledge she was so eagerly seeking.

""BDSM isn't just about sex. It can extend far beyond that in your life. A good Dom who can induce a sense of discipline in his Sub can help her achieve goals in her life that she felt were otherwise unreachable. Often, a Sub allows her Dom to take control of her routines, her schedules, her habits. The Dom may restrict certain activities and enforce certain others. What the Dom provides here is his time, his experience, his guidance, rewards, and punishments. What the Sub gets here is someone to be held accountable to, someone who takes responsibility for her, someone who is willing to invest himself in her improvement. The rewards and punishments that I talk about are often discussed in advance, and they come in fun sexual packages depending on compatible kinks. Again, only as much as the Sub is comfortable with.""

I repeatedly kept emphasizing the part about how beneath the surface, the Sub had plenty of control of everything that was happening. One of the frustrating misconceptions that frequently come up in interactions about BDSM is how 'powerless' a Sub is, and that turns a great deal of people away from the lifestyle. I wanted to make sure I got this point across as clearly as possible, ridding Susan's mind clear of any such notions.

""But then,"" she began ""how is it different than a conventional mentor-mentee dynamic?"" 

It was this curiosity in this young woman that made her all the more alluring to me. I subtly checked the wall clock behind her for the time, as if blankly staring in the distance. About an hour had passed since she had arrived for our supposedly half an hour meeting, and not once had she mentioned the time. I knew I was doing something right.

""You are perceptive, and have touched upon a fine nuance."" I replied. ""The Dom/Sub dynamic is not really that different, except the sexual aspects of course. You see, people identifying as the Dom type or the Sub type isn't something that exists only within the framework of BDSM. Quite often people unconsciously follow those roles their entire lives without coming across this lifestyle. The way I see it, BDSM is only a system which allows you to explore something that inherently exists within you in a fun and fulfilling way, while combining it with sexual play to make it all the more exciting. However, these are only the broadest of dynamics. As you explore the finer nuances, you'll get to know more and more about the type of person you are, the type of things you like, and more importantly the characteristics you would want in a partner, with whom you'll feel comfortable in any relationship. Mentally, physically, and sexually. But that is a topic of discussion for another time. You've got plenty of information to process for a single day.""


I sipped the rest of my coffee, watching her face as a hundred different questions and emotions created turbulence in her thoughts. She was blankly staring at her coffee, turning her fingers around the cup, while her mind was deeply engrossed in an entirely different world. After a while, she spoke

""You still haven't told me anything about that collar""

I simply smirked. 

""You've heard enough for today. Maybe next time."" 

Her curiosity was a wild beast, one that could not be tamed. Nor did I want to. It was this curiosity indeed which would make her keep coming back to me, of that I was sure.

I had done what I could to turn the little sparks of her curiosity into flames; now I had to maintain patience and let time fan those flames into a fire.

Part 3


-------



We parted our ways after the coffee. I could tell she wasn't completely satisfied with the meeting; after all she never got the answer for the one thing she came over for. But what she did get was plenty of questions, in her mind. Just like I had planned.

Over the next few days however, things seemed like they went back to normal. Susan didn't follow up with the discussion we had at the cafe, and acted as if we never had that talk. She went back to being her former, professional self. Even the frequency of her platonic, once regular texts decreased. It was a very real possibility that she might have been weirded out by the kink. In that case all I could do was stop having any thoughts about her ending up as my playmate.

Things went on like this for about a couple more weeks. Regular office related conversations, if any, and nothing else. Earlier she used to stop by my desk randomly when she got bored with work. These short interruptions were always a pleasant distraction for me as well. We would talk for a few minutes till we were both charged up again, and then go back to work. 

Then one day, about three weeks after her finding out the collar in my room, Susan stopped by my desk. Apparently she wanted to clear a technical doubt about the project she was working on. I explained to her the thing she was struggling with, and after seeing what looked like satisfaction in her face, I shifted my attention back to my work. But she stood around by my desk, nervously tapping her fingers on her notepad.

""Uhh..."" she began

""About that *guidance* thing from our discussion earlier...""

My fingers stopped typing. I turned my face to look at her. She had caught my full attention. She averted my gaze as I raised my eyebrows in a questioning glance.

""Can we talk a little bit more about that?"" she requested ""Not here, not now. Maybe someplace in private?""

*Curiosity indeed kills the cat*

""Sure"" I offered. ""How about dinner tonight after work?""

Her lips shaped up in an imperceptible and silent smile, as if conveying her gratitude.

""Yes, that works!"" she gleefully accepted. What a remarkable difference between the woman standing next to me now and the woman from 3 weeks ago who hardly had half an hour. The flames of curiosity were indeed flaring out.


----

""Thank you for meeting with me again!"" Susan said as our orders were placed on the table. I briefly acknowledged it with a smile.

""So, what brings you here tonight?"" I asked

""I've been thinking about our discussion from that day. A lot. And I've been reading up a great deal about it on online forums. Honestly, it felt scary and intimidating at first, but the way you described it last time felt much more calming, and much more...safe!"" My decision to take it slow had indeed paid off. 

""I am getting really curious about this whole thing. I want to try it out and experience it for myself. But the more I read about people's experiences online, the more it felt like there were far more bad Doms than good ones out there. But you...you put my mind so much at ease that day that I didn't even realize it! I was completely comfortable during the time I was with you. I only felt scared when I was reading about it alone."" 

""You are most generous to make that assessment of me. BDSM can be scary, yes, and your first time experiences can make or break your decision to choose this as a lifestyle. You are completely justified in feeling that way. Infact, a healthy bit of skepticism is beneficial to keep yourself alert if the person you're submitting to is acting to fulfill his own selfish desires, or is he actively trying to make your experience better.""

""I was wondering..."" she hesitated in completing the sentence. In the back of my mind I could guess what she was wondering, but I let her finish her sentence on her own accord

""I was wondering if...you would do this with me"" she said eventually.

""What makes you choose me?""

""Well...you seem to be a really caring kind of guy, and like I said, you make me feel so comfortable about it. I don't know if I could even talk about such dark fantasies with anyone else. But you already have experience in this it seems and I feel that I could learn a lot from you!"" The will to learn. How pleasing these words were! 

The seeds that I had planted in her mind had been growing under the nourishment of her curiosity. 

We discussed what were her expectations from this arrangement. She asked questions about the kind of rules I would set up for her, about the rewards and punishments I would give to her. I asked questions about how willingly she was going to devote herself, and what level of control over her life was she ready to give up. We talked about our preferred kinks, likes, dislikes and common sexual fantasies. About a couple hours later, dinner was finished and our mental appetites were full as well. I agreed to take her under my wing. 

""We begin your training this weekend, when we will have our first play session."" I looked into her eyes as she got visibly excited like a little girl who had just heard she was going to Disneyland.

""Dress pretty!""

Being a sub in a D/s type dynamic with someone means allowing them to make certain decisions for you. This does not mean that the sub has absolutely no power over her life and has to obey everything that her Dom says. Far from it. Infact, counter-intuitive though it might seem, it is the Sub who has the real power. It is the Sub who *chooses* to obey. The Dom in this dynamic only has as much power over the Sub as the Sub allows him to take. With me so far?""

""What do you mean make decisions? What kind of decisions?"" she asked. Clearly, her mind had begun processing all the new information being thrown at her.

""Great question. Like I said, it depends on what the Sub *allows*. It could be something as innocent as choosing what she wears on a particular day. Or it can be something as depraved as controlling when she gets to have an orgasm."" I took a pause to observe her reaction. It was the first time in all the time we had known each other that we were venturing into discussions of such a dark nature. Much of our interactions had been professional, or rather platonic at best. It was important to tread these waters lightly before pulling her in deeper.

Susan's reaction was interesting. Her eyebrows shot up at the last sentence, but she spoke nothing. Her curiosity urged me through her silence to fill her with more of the knowledge she was so eagerly seeking.

""BDSM isn't just about sex. It can extend far beyond that in your life. A good Dom who can induce a sense of discipline in his Sub can help her achieve goals in her life that she felt were otherwise unreachable. Often, a Sub allows her Dom to take control of her routines, her schedules, her habits. The Dom may restrict certain activities and enforce certain others. What the Dom provides here is his time, his experience, his guidance, rewards, and punishments. What the Sub gets here is someone to be held accountable to, someone who takes responsibility for her, someone who is willing to invest himself in her improvement. The rewards and punishments that I talk about are often discussed in advance, and they come in fun sexual packages depending on compatible kinks. Again, only as much as the Sub is comfortable with.""

I repeatedly kept emphasizing the part about how beneath the surface, the Sub had plenty of control of everything that was happening. One of the frustrating misconceptions that frequently come up in interactions about BDSM is how 'powerless' a Sub is, and that turns a great deal of people away from the lifestyle. I wanted to make sure I got this point across as clearly as possible, ridding Susan's mind clear of any such notions.

""But then,"" she began ""how is it different than a conventional mentor-mentee dynamic?"" 

It was this curiosity in this young woman that made her all the more alluring to me. I subtly checked the wall clock behind her for the time, as if blankly staring in the distance. About an hour had passed since she had arrived for our supposedly half an hour meeting, and not once had she mentioned the time. I knew I was doing something right.

""You are perceptive, and have touched upon a fine nuance."" I replied. ""The Dom/Sub dynamic is not really that different, except the sexual aspects of course. You see, people identifying as the Dom type or the Sub type isn't something that exists only within the framework of BDSM. Quite often people unconsciously follow those roles their entire lives without coming across this lifestyle. The way I see it, BDSM is only a system which allows you to explore something that inherently exists within you in a fun and fulfilling way, while combining it with sexual play to make it all the more exciting. However, these are only the broadest of dynamics. As you explore the finer nuances, you'll get to know more and more about the type of person you are, the type of things you like, and more importantly the characteristics you would want in a partner, with whom you'll feel comfortable in any relationship. Mentally, physically, and sexually. But that is a topic of discussion for another time. You've got plenty of information to process for a single day.""


I sipped the rest of my coffee, watching her face as a hundred different questions and emotions created turbulence in her thoughts. She was blankly staring at her coffee, turning her fingers around the cup, while her mind was deeply engrossed in an entirely different world. After a while, she spoke

""You still haven't told me anything about that collar""

I simply smirked. 

""You've heard enough for today. Maybe next time."" 

Her curiosity was a wild beast, one that could not be tamed. Nor did I want to. It was this curiosity indeed which would make her keep coming back to me, of that I was sure.

I had done what I could to turn the little sparks of her curiosity into flames; now I had to maintain patience and let time fan those flames into a fire.

Part 3


-------



We parted our ways after the coffee. I could tell she wasn't completely satisfied with the meeting; after all she never got the answer for the one thing she came over for. But what she did get was plenty of questions, in her mind. Just like I had planned.

Over the next few days however, things seemed like they went back to normal. Susan didn't follow up with the discussion we had at the cafe, and acted as if we never had that talk. She went back to being her former, professional self. Even the frequency of her platonic, once regular texts decreased. It was a very real possibility that she might have been weirded out by the kink. In that case all I could do was stop having any thoughts about her ending up as my playmate.

Things went on like this for about a couple more weeks. Regular office related conversations, if any, and nothing else. Earlier she used to stop by my desk randomly when she got bored with work. These short interruptions were always a pleasant distraction for me as well. We would talk for a few minutes till we were both charged up again, and then go back to work. 

Then one day, about three weeks after her finding out the collar in my room, Susan stopped by my desk. Apparently she wanted to clear a technical doubt about the project she was working on. I explained to her the thing she was struggling with, and after seeing what looked like satisfaction in her face, I shifted my attention back to my work. But she stood around by my desk, nervously tapping her fingers on her notepad.

""Uhh..."" she began

""About that *guidance* thing from our discussion earlier...""

My fingers stopped typing. I turned my face to look at her. She had caught my full attention. She averted my gaze as I raised my eyebrows in a questioning glance.

""Can we talk a little bit more about that?"" she requested ""Not here, not now. Maybe someplace in private?""

*Curiosity indeed kills the cat*

""Sure"" I offered. ""How about dinner tonight after work?""

Her lips shaped up in an imperceptible and silent smile, as if conveying her gratitude.

""Yes, that works!"" she gleefully accepted. What a remarkable difference between the woman standing next to me now and the woman from 3 weeks ago who hardly had half an hour. The flames of curiosity were indeed flaring out.


----

""Thank you for meeting with me again!"" Susan said as our orders were placed on the table. I briefly acknowledged it with a smile.

""So, what brings you here tonight?"" I asked

""I've been thinking about our discussion from that day. A lot. And I've been reading up a great deal about it on online forums. Honestly, it felt scary and intimidating at first, but the way you described it last time felt much more calming, and much more...safe!"" My decision to take it slow had indeed paid off. 

""I am getting really curious about this whole thing. I want to try it out and experience it for myself. But the more I read about people's experiences online, the more it felt like there were far more bad Doms than good ones out there. But you...you put my mind so much at ease that day that I didn't even realize it! I was completely comfortable during the time I was with you. I only felt scared when I was reading about it alone."" 

""You are most generous to make that assessment of me. BDSM can be scary, yes, and your first time experiences can make or break your decision to choose this as a lifestyle. You are completely justified in feeling that way. Infact, a healthy bit of skepticism is beneficial to keep yourself alert if the person you're submitting to is acting to fulfill his own selfish desires, or is he actively trying to make your experience better.""

""I was wondering..."" she hesitated in completing the sentence. In the back of my mind I could guess what she was wondering, but I let her finish her sentence on her own accord

""I was wondering if...you would do this with me"" she said eventually.

""What makes you choose me?""

""Well...you seem to be a really caring kind of guy, and like I said, you make me feel so comfortable about it. I don't know if I could even talk about such dark fantasies with anyone else. But you already have experience in this it seems and I feel that I could learn a lot from you!"" The will to learn. How pleasing these words were! 

The seeds that I had planted in her mind had been growing under the nourishment of her curiosity. 

We discussed what were her expectations from this arrangement. She asked questions about the kind of rules I would set up for her, about the rewards and punishments I would give to her. I asked questions about how willingly she was going to devote herself, and what level of control over her life was she ready to give up. We talked about our preferred kinks, likes, dislikes and common sexual fantasies. About a couple hours later, dinner was finished and our mental appetites were full as well. I agreed to take her under my wing. 

""We begin your training this weekend, when we will have our first play session."" I looked into her eyes as she got visibly excited like a little girl who had just heard she was going to Disneyland.

""Dress pretty!""

The story is long and I haven't finished writing it all out yet. I'll be posting the rest soon."
9y7q5p,81,2018-11-18,My wife asked for permission to seduce her student while I watched [MF],mydemonlady,gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/9y7q5p/my_wife_asked_for_permission_to_seduce_her/,"Introducing one of her students into our bedroom wasn't something I was very keen on. Although the idea of luring a young and unexperienced man, with whom she'd done business with, into an sexual encounter was quite attractive to me.

&amp;#x200B;

She mentioned the idea a couple of weeks ago, when the annual student internships at her company where coming to an end. I immediately knew she had someone specific on her mind when I saw her eyes full of anticipation and excitement. Mixing business and sex is something I usually refrain from, but this time I agreed.

&amp;#x200B;

He had been eyeing her for the whole three months he worked at her department. He always tried to be close to her and asked her questions which could've easyily answered by another member of the staff. Instead of working, he was heavily flirting with her. A young student not even close up to her level. She knew her superiority and only toyed with him during the internship.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, she had a thing for this boy. He just started studying and was in his early twenties. It was obvious he would follow our dinner invitation, given the spark of hope to get closer to my wife. I opened the door. He wore a blue suit which was perfectly tailored and offered a grasp of his trained and fit body.

&amp;#x200B;

He introduced himself and genuinely thanked me for the dinner invitation.  A smart young man with a vibrant, yet immature and unexperienced way to him. I noticed a flash of insecurity when she hugged him for the very first time, pressing her full chest against his, welcoming him to our home. He had only shook her hand or maybe slightly brushed her body so far. His arousal was easily to be seen after she embraced his body.

&amp;#x200B;

She wore my favourite olive colored dress with a lightness to it. The fabric was soft to the touch and played perfectly around her feminine curves. Little did he know that this small piece of cloth was the only thing she was wearing right now.

&amp;#x200B;

A formal dinner between coworkers would have required a less revealing dress. But our intention was clear. The fabric barely covered her round and firm butt and perky breasts. Its low cut required her to rearrange it every couple minutes to make sure our guest wouldn't notice the lack of underwear just yet. Everytime she fiddled her dress, he couldn't avoid an eager stare at her body.

&amp;#x200B;

We had wine and a perfect medium-rare steak. We continued to sit at the table and talked about life for a while, asking what he wanted to do after the internship at my wifes company and what he's generelly interested in. He was very respectful and complemented my wife for her work qualities repeatedly, when she shot me a meaningful glance. I nodded, which made her grin sheepishly. He continued to tell us about his future plans, when he suddenly froze. The bare foot of my wife pressed against his inner thigh. He locked eyes with her, than me. His mouth slightly opened. I winked at him and barely nodded my head again.

&amp;#x200B;

She leaned towards him and asked casually what things he was eager to experience while he still had the freedom of his student life. She moved her foot against his crotch. He struggled really hard to keep his composure and answered that he'd like to play along and try whatever life will bring. He moaned out loud when her toes massaged his growing member.

&amp;#x200B;

She stood. Locked eyes with him and let the dress carefully drop to the ground. Exposing her beautiful body. He froze again. This successful women in her early thirties standing butt naked in front of him. His boss for the last three months exposed and vulnerable. He couldn't take his eyes off her, he was bound to the chair at her mere sight. I almost grinned at her confusion. She seduced him, without leaving him with a chance.

&amp;#x200B;

She approached him. Her body clean-shaven, her breasts bouncing at every of her delicate steps. Her body stopped inches from his face. He shifted nervously in his seat, staring at her. She firmly grabbed his crotch while leading his hand and putting it between her legs. She immediately let out a deep moan and closed her eyes. He must have pushed a finger inside of her. Obviusly the boy was not as unexperienced as we thought.

&amp;#x200B;

When she opened her eyes again he was standing in front of her, feeling her up. Caressing her boobs, squeezing her ass. Stroking her wet spot between her legs. She firmly squeezed the hand which still rested on his cock and balls. Both moaned in excitement.

&amp;#x200B;

I noticed that I was gasping for air, as I must have forgotten to breath. Her sight was still breathtaking to me. She skillfully moved her hands and opened his pants. Revealing a very decent cock, throbbing and rock hard.

&amp;#x200B;

She gave it a glance in awe and dropped down on her knees. She sucks and blows him confidently. Her mouth kissing another cock in front of me. Burying it deep into her throat. Her head bobbed up and down on him. Both her hands rested on his thighs, pulling him into her dripping mouth. Driven by the eager determination to  seduce she gave him all she had to offer, which was more than he could take.

&amp;#x200B;

Her eyes shot him a constant look of dedication, only interruped when she pushed herself all the way down on his shaft. He moaned and shook. She gagged and groaned back on his thick cock.

&amp;#x200B;

He couldn't stand her anymore and pulled her up to a kiss. The lips which touched his cock before anything eagerly opened once again. They pulled each other close and kissed deeply.

&amp;#x200B;

His shaft and head glistened in her juices. She was stroking him gently while gifting him another kiss. A deep look was exchanged before she led him to the couch. She was the one in charge. Obviously.

&amp;#x200B;

She layed down and opened her legs for him, exposing her wet spot which longed for someone to fill her. She cried out when he pushed in. One hand held her ankle firmly and spread her even wider. The other one rested on her body when he started to thrust into her. A wild tangle of hands and moans.

&amp;#x200B;

He entered her deep. She squirmed and grabbed onto him. He started to fuck her. His muscular legs and back were strained and moved rhythmical. He pounded her while she screamed and trembled from the excitement to use him.

&amp;#x200B;

She pushed him away. He took off his shirt and layed on the couch when she mounted him. Her ass bounced on him in sync with her tits. He grabbed and massaged them. His touch hot and unfamiliar. She rode him hard, pushing onto him faster and harder with every passing second.

&amp;#x200B;

I could see he was close. He shook and moaned heavily and was gasping for air whenever he let her tits free from his mouth. They both vigorously thrusted their bodies into each other until both of them came.

&amp;#x200B;

He growled and strongly grabbed her hips when he came deep into her reddened pussy. She continued to grind him which made his orgasm even stronger. Only seconds later she cried out, and came all over him. Her legs shaking, her pussy aching.

&amp;#x200B;

She got off him, sucked him clean and walked griningly towards me to kiss me. I grabbed her freshly fucked ass and pulled her glistening body close. She smiled and whispered that she wants my cock to stretch her tight body even more than his could and how she is still craving to fuck me rough tonight.

&amp;#x200B;

She put her dress back on, kissed him goodbye. He thanked us nervously for the dinner and everything else. As soon as the door fell shut, I pushed her against the wall and claimed her back for hours that night.

&amp;#x200B;

9y8md5,0,2018-11-18,"[M4A](M playing F) Older woman has affair with younger son, step son, stranger or student. Other ideas in post (futa included)",Shogun_Logan,AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/9y8md5/m4am_playing_f_older_woman_has_affair_with/,"I am an adult looking for another 18+ year old adult for a fantasy role play.

Please have the Discord app as I prefer to chat on it because of all of its user friendly features (mainly editing posts if mistakes happen).

I'm a male but I’m looking to play as the older woman so I’m looking for someone to be the boy. I'd like the female character to be pretty much based off actress Milla Jovovich and I have a specific idea in mind for the boy but because of the new rules I'm not allowed to say his name.   I am also willing to RP as a second and possibly a third character if there are any addition female characters you might like to have added if they are based on someone we can both agree on.

PM me and we can talk about it (if you don’t like the choice we could possibly change him if need be). Female character would be in her mid-30s to early 40s and male character would be around 12-15.

I was thinking of three possible scenarios (all amendable) and I’m open to any other possible suggestions.

1 - Mom/step mom is about to get married and she is in her [wedding dress](https://imageevent.com/hailtotheking/dppthrowaway13941?p=2&amp;n=1&amp;m=-1&amp;c=4&amp;l=0&amp;w=4&amp;s=0&amp;z=2) and wearing some [white platform heels](https://photos.imageevent.com/hailtotheking/dppthrowaway13941/7C36E731-E4FF-4DF4-ABA2-0AFA02AD9AB4.jpeg ) at the church waiting for the ceremony to start. The son/step son could walk in on her and confess his feelings for her and for what ever reason she decides to give into temptation and have sex with him. Maybe she tells him it has to be a one time thing to get out of his system but once she see's his surprisingly large dick she becomes obsessed with how it stretches her out.

An alternate take on this could be that the boy is some what evil and he blackmails the groom into writing a letter saying the wedding is off (perhaps he threatened to start saying he molested him) and when she finds out that her big day has been ruined he comes in to comfort her, with or with out her really wanting to have sex with him.

2 - Option two is that she is a [married woman](https://imageevent.com/hailtotheking/dppthrowaway13941?p=5&amp;b=-1&amp;m=-1&amp;c=4&amp;w=4&amp;s=1&amp;n=1&amp;l=0&amp;z=9) in a rather loveless marriage. They are fairly wealthy and the husband provides her with pretty much everything she needs...except for routine fucking. Alternatively, she could be completely single and be yearning for her next conquest (especially if it’s extremely risky). One day she comes home from [grocery shopping](https://imageevent.com/hailtotheking/dppthrowaway13941?p=47&amp;b=-1&amp;m=-1&amp;c=4&amp;w=4&amp;s=1&amp;n=1&amp;l=0&amp;z=9) and notices a moving truck next door and spots the absolutely beautiful son of the new neighbors and her [minds starts going to dark sexual places](https://imageevent.com/hailtotheking/dppthrowaway13941?p=50&amp;b=-1&amp;m=-1&amp;c=4&amp;w=4&amp;s=1&amp;n=1&amp;l=0&amp;z=9). After a while, some [light teasing](https://imageevent.com/hailtotheking/dppthrowaway13941?p=177&amp;b=-1&amp;m=-1&amp;c=4&amp;w=4&amp;s=1&amp;n=1&amp;l=0&amp;z=2) and [exhibitionism](https://imageevent.com/hailtotheking/dppthrowaway13941?p=188&amp;n=1&amp;m=-1&amp;c=4&amp;l=0&amp;w=4&amp;s=0&amp;z=9) beings to take place and one day the next door boy comes over and overs to clean her pool/mow her lawn. She gets into a [sexy bikini](https://imageevent.com/hailtotheking/dppthrowaway13941?p=172&amp;b=-1&amp;m=-1&amp;c=4&amp;w=4&amp;s=1&amp;n=1&amp;l=0&amp;z=9) and goes out to the pool to tan and gives him something to look at and she starts to notice his big dick in his shorts.

This concept is highly editable and the two of them could be made to be related instead.

3 - Kind of stole this third idea from someone else’s post but basically I'd be a [woman jogging in the park](https://imageevent.com/hailtotheking/dppthrowaway13941?p=7&amp;b=-1&amp;m=-1&amp;c=4&amp;w=4&amp;s=1&amp;n=1&amp;l=0&amp;z=9) and [getting her daily exorcise](https://imageevent.com/hailtotheking/dppthrowaway13941?p=61&amp;b=-1&amp;m=-1&amp;c=4&amp;w=4&amp;s=1&amp;n=1&amp;l=0&amp;z=9).  I would see you on a park bench by yourself or paying on a on of the athletic fields and I can't take my eyes off you.  As I get closer I can see that your shorts can barely contain your huge dick and I approach you in an attempt to get it inside me.

This idea could feature a bunch of different options. We could be complete and total strangers meeting my chance. It could piggyback of the theme of option 2 and we actually live in the same neighborhood and this is how we approach each other. I could be a mom and my son could go to the same school as you and I’ve seen you at parent teacher meeting and other school functions. Or I could be a teacher at your school and I’ve seen you walking through the halls before. Many options to be decided on this one.

So those are my three ideas but I'm willing to take any suggestions if anyone is interested. I’d also be willing to play multiple women and include a sister character or have a secret (or not so secret) girlfriend on the side. Group role play is also acceptable.

[Lingerie](https://imageevent.com/hailtotheking/dppthrowaway13941?p=181&amp;n=1&amp;m=-1&amp;c=4&amp;l=0&amp;w=4&amp;s=0&amp;z=9), latex, feet and shoes (especially platforms) are a plus. Anal, water sports, cum shots (facials and cream pies) that are larger that normal, public/risky sex, clothed sex, handjobs, squirting, sleep/wake up sex, oral sex (especially giving while the other person is busy doing something else’s like talking on the phone or playing video games with a headset on), [smoking](https://imageevent.com/hailtotheking/dppthrowaway13941?p=163&amp;n=1&amp;m=-1&amp;c=4&amp;l=0&amp;w=4&amp;s=0&amp;z=9), stomach distention/inflation, larger objects, fisting, beast, [glasses](https://imageevent.com/hailtotheking/dppthrowaway13941?p=196&amp;n=1&amp;m=-1&amp;c=4&amp;l=0&amp;w=4&amp;s=0&amp;z=9), tattoos and piercings and a lot more are all acceptable kinks in my book.

My only hard limits are snuff, gore, vore, and scat.

Here is a link to some pictures of Milla to give some visual references plus some dick pics for the boy’s genitals to be modeled after.

———————-

All the ideas above can be played as me being a dickgirl but here are some extra ideas for FUTA prompts (but could also be regular genetic female).

Like above, I’d want my character to be based off Milla Jovovich (specially the first few photo options in the link below). The other roles can also be based off actors, models or any one else you’d like to use as a visual basis. https://imageevent.com/hailtotheking/dppthrowaway13941

A) I would be the [boss](https://imageevent.com/hailtotheking/dppthrowaway13941?p=0&amp;b=-1&amp;m=-1&amp;c=4&amp;w=4&amp;s=1&amp;n=1&amp;l=0&amp;z=9) or a [high level executive](https://imageevent.com/hailtotheking/dppthrowaway13941?p=4&amp;b=-1&amp;m=-1&amp;c=4&amp;w=4&amp;s=1&amp;n=1&amp;l=0&amp;z=9) at some kind of company and I'm always [wearing](https://imageevent.com/hailtotheking/dppthrowaway13941?p=62&amp;b=-1&amp;m=-1&amp;c=4&amp;w=4&amp;s=1&amp;n=1&amp;l=0&amp;z=9 some kind of [suit](https://imageevent.com/hailtotheking/dppthrowaway13941?p=207&amp;b=-1&amp;m=-1&amp;c=4&amp;w=4&amp;s=1&amp;n=1&amp;l=0&amp;z=9) for the [most part](https://imageevent.com/hailtotheking/dppthrowaway13941?p=68&amp;b=-1&amp;m=-1&amp;c=4&amp;w=4&amp;s=1&amp;n=1&amp;l=0&amp;z=9). You’ve just started working at the same place (full employee or summer internship). I’m pretty demanding and have a bit of a temper while you’re soft spoken and fairly intimidated by me. After some time there you start hearing rumors about me and how I’m different and you become increasingly intrigued by what you’ve heard. Alternatively, I could be the one that take a great interest in your youthful body and my condition could be a total surprise to you when I make my move on you.

This scenario would have me be in my late 30s, early 40s with my new employee being around 16-24 and their gender could be male or female. If you want to go younger, pitch me an idea of the situation to explain your presence (maybe you’re the kid of an employee and you’re in the building for some reason).

B) I'm a [military instructor](https://imageevent.com/hailtotheking/dppthrowaway13941?p=1&amp;b=-1&amp;m=-1&amp;c=4&amp;w=4&amp;s=1&amp;n=1&amp;l=0&amp;z=9) at a juvenile boot camp for troubled youth and you're a real piece of work and I make it my personal goal in life to break you out of your delinquent lifestyle by any means necessary.  Maybe I single you out during P.T. and make you keep doing obstacle course runs over and over and at some point I stop you in the woods when we are alone.  Or maybe I keep you exercising well into the night and while everyone else is at the mess hall eating dinner I finally let you stop and tell you go take a shower before going to eat.  While you're in the shower I come in an join you.  Another option could be that I sneak into the barracks in the middle of the night and pull you out of bed and drag you outside and have my way with you.  You're character could be gay or bi and be openly flirting and teasing with me or it could be completely against your will.

Yet another way this could go is that I'm in another country on deployment.  You could be a local kid from a near by town or village that hangs around near the base.  I notice you one day trying to make some money by selling bootleg stuff or offering to be an interrupter but I'm more interested in another service that you may or may not be willing to give.

C) I’m a [teacher](http://imageevent.com/hailtotheking/dppthrowaway13941?p=38&amp;b=-1&amp;m=-1&amp;c=4&amp;w=4&amp;s=1&amp;n=1&amp;l=0&amp;z=9), a [counselor](http://imageevent.com/hailtotheking/dppthrowaway13941?p=39&amp;n=1&amp;m=-1&amp;c=4&amp;l=0&amp;w=4&amp;s=0&amp;z=2) or [P.E. teacher/coach](https://imageevent.com/hailtotheking/dppthrowaway13941?p=6&amp;b=-1&amp;m=-1&amp;c=4&amp;w=4&amp;s=1&amp;n=1&amp;l=0&amp;z=9) at a school. I could be a teacher you have a class in every single day or I could be someone that teaches a higher grade than yours and you’ve just seen me around before. This could go either way we me being attracted to you and making the first move or if could be the other way around. Maybe one day you notice something off with my skirt or pants, a lump that shouldn’t be there, and you want to find out more.

If I’m a P.E. teacher/coach maybe one day I’ve told everyone to get changed and I call you into my office and we have a discussion about your recent lack of effort in class. By the time we finish everyone else is gone so you hit the shower to clean up before leaving for the day while I stay in my office for a bit. You finish your shower and changing in the locker room and walk past my office. I had completely forgotten you were here so I took my dick out and started stroking it to porn on my phone. At first you’re freaked out but then you start to get excited. 

Alternatively, it could be me that goes to shower, thinking you had already left after changing. You spot me in there back first lathering my hair and then I turn and you see my large semi hard dick hanging between my legs.

This option could have me be any age between late 20s-early 40s. You could be a female or male student. Age ranges could be wide for this, 13 to early 20s. For young female students we could use girls that look like Eleven from Stranger Things, Hit-Girl from Kick-Ass, Mathilda from The Professional or any number of possibilities.

D) Final scenario is that I’m a [mechanic](https://imageevent.com/hailtotheking/dppthrowaway13941?p=3&amp;b=-1&amp;m=-1&amp;c=4&amp;w=4&amp;s=1&amp;n=1&amp;l=0&amp;z=9) at a little garage in the middle of no where. I’m the only one that works there so I’m by myself at the place. For your character you could be someone that just got their learners permit a couple of months ago and you’re freaking out because something is going wrong with the car. You’ve stopped at my garage in hopes oh getting a quick fix but you’re blindsided by the cost and you can’t afford it...so we work out another form of payment. 

Another option could be that you’re the kid of the driver and that way you can be younger if you’d like or you’re a runaway or just out playing further from home than you normally do."

9y92m9,9,2018-11-18,I found out that the person I'm with has BPD,BPDandLSD,BPD,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/9y92m9/i_found_out_that_the_person_im_with_has_bpd/,"Everything makes sense now. The need to push our relationship, always wanting promises of the future with me. The cutting. The bulimia. The extreme mood changes. Running away at the slight thought that I may leave. The way she hates herself with such vigor. The constant suicidal idolization.

We got together over the summer while I was going an internship in her area. Things went really fast as you'd imagine and before we knew it she was all but moved in. As the summer ended though, she moved up to Alaska for college, 3000 miles from me. Her plan was to kill herself in the first week. I've been on suicide watch for months, and it's completely drained me. I can never be completely honest about how I feel because it flips her switch and she runs, and if she does she won't have any check on her impulsive behaviors (such as going into the woods and just walking until she dies or is attacked). She can't afford treatment, she grew up in a broke family and is in debt herself due to previous medical bills and college. I'm running out of stamina.

Where she lives it is damn cold, with highs around 0 degrees F already and nights already getting painfully long. It's all exacerbating her depression and overall mental state.

She's coming down for Christmas break (arguably the only thing she looks forward to in life now) and I have to pretend that this relationship is what I ultimately want in life. I have to lie to my family that this is a healthy relationship and that I'm happy. I do love her, but I can't stay. These last few months have been the most challenging of my life. When break is all said and done she'll be going back to Alaska, where she'll be in a lot of pain all over again and any good the trip does for her will likely fade.

I don't know what I'm to do. If I leave and she kills herself, I know I'll probably blame myself for having given up. If I stay I'll be drained of every drop of energy I have and the end result will likely be the same. I'm in a no win situation and it hurts. My academics have begun to suffer as a result of trying to always be there for her, as her suicidal thoughts and actions have gotten more severe.

I don't know exactly why I made this post. Maybe to reach out to people who may have experienced being in this position. Maybe because I just have to get it out there. For those that have BPD, I'm sorry that the human body is so shit that it can do things like this to you. For those who love someone with BPD, you are not alone.

This probably isn't the place, so I'll be making a separate post in r/microdosing about a treatment that we will be trying to see if it helps (EDIT: [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/microdosing/comments/9y9i2l/borderline_personality_disorder_and_microdosing/)). There are several self reported studies on the effects of this, and at least it looks promising. It's one of the only things I have hope for without proper treatment. I know it's no guarantee, but I find myself latching onto any hope I can."

N also frequently posts about her “animation internship with Disney” and how awesome it is, We have a lot of mutual contacts, including old mentors, teachers, friends... and they all post supportive comments quite frequently. 

A couple years ago, I did a little digging and reverse image searched her stuff and found that almost all of it was not original. She just blatantly ripped it off the web.  When I discovered this, I made a burner account and messaged her my proof and told her to stop lying to everyone. I stopped short of threatening her but I told her the truth may come out eventually if she keeps this up. 

N proceeded to block the account and post that someone has been stealing HER work and she is looking into legal options. After this, I just dropped it and left it alone. 

Fast-forward to now, N’s online following has grown and her followers really eat up her success, her art, and her (obviously) fake stories that tug on people’s emotions. She still continues to post plagiarized work but she’s gotten better at hiding it but I just found more proof on recent stuff she has shared. 

I am tempted to message the respected people in our circle and “expose” her because it’s not right that they are being manipulated and lied to. I work in the creative industry and it really grinds my gears to see people blatantly do this. 

At the same time, she is clearly obsessed and/or delusional and I’m wondering if I should just leave her be considering there is a mental issue at play. 

Am I the asshole?

Any feedback is appreciated!

9yb56q,87,2018-11-18,The Degradation of Language,pinkpolkagirl,conspiracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/9yb56q/the_degradation_of_language/,"**Introduction**

Our language shapes our reality.

According to Psychology Today, ""Each language carves up the world somewhat differently. So each language provides its speakers with a particular worldview that won’t be quite the same as the one that speakers of other languages have. In other words, we see the world according to the framework our language imposes on us.""

[https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/talking-apes/201509/how-language-shapes-our-world](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/talking-apes/201509/how-language-shapes-our-world)

If language shapes the world in which we live, it is possible to directly manipulate and even degrade a language to control a group of people - to control our thoughts. In other words, language can (and is) used as a weapon for mind control, or according the following article, ""newspeak is a crucial instrument of totalitarian power.""

[https://fee.org/articles/would-be-tyrants-capture-language-to-control-thought/](https://fee.org/articles/would-be-tyrants-capture-language-to-control-thought/)

In this post, I am going to discuss the modern manipulation and degradation of language, as well as the ultimate conspiracy behind the control of language. Most reading here are aware of how language is used to control us to some extent, but are you aware of how language is breaking down before your very eyes? For the sake of brevity and time, this post will focus more on the degradation and simplification of language versus other means of control of language such as propaganda and censorship.

**Limited Perception**

*“The limits of my language means the limits of my world.”  -* *Ludwig Wittgenstein* 

Let us go back to the original point; our language shapes our world. So, ultimately, the more words we know, the broader our perception of the world will be. Today, though, reading and vocabulary have become a mockery of what they once were. 

To clarify, Americans are behind in math, vocabulary, and technology:

[https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2013/10/americans-are-way-behind-in-math-vocabulary-and-technology/280413/](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2013/10/americans-are-way-behind-in-math-vocabulary-and-technology/280413/)

Looking deeper at vocabulary specifically, there is a widening ""word gap"" between rich and poor kids.

According to the following article,"" ""Children in professionals' homes were exposed to an average of more than fifteen hundred more spoken words per hour than children in welfare homes. Over one year, that amounted to a difference of nearly 8 million words, which, by age four, amounted to a total gap of 32 million words. They also found a substantial gap in tone and in the complexity of words being used. As they crunched the numbers, they discovered a direct correlation between the intensity of these early verbal experiences and later achievement.""

[https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2010/03/the-32-million-word-gap/36856/](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2010/03/the-32-million-word-gap/36856/)

Why does this matter? Again, our words shape our reality. Limited vocabulary means limited perception of our world. Here, for example, are some words rich people use that poor people liikley do not:

\--trust-fund

\--inheritance 

\--off-shore

\--hedge fund

\--investor relations

\--private wealth management

\--commodity strategies

\--pooled investment vehicle 

\--kale 

\--au pair

\--lacrosse 

\--yoga

\--unpaid internship

\--Aspen

\--amenities

\--the longer back nine

\--cotillion

\--coxswain

\--tartan

\--escrow

\--equestrian program

\--Aubusson rug

\--chevre

\--board of directors

\--chaise lounge

\--antiquarian

\--facilitator

\--Wellingtons

\--docent 

\--tax-free municipal bonds 

[https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/snow-white-doesnt-live-here-anymore/201406/words-rich-people-use-poor-people-dont](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/snow-white-doesnt-live-here-anymore/201406/words-rich-people-use-poor-people-dont)

The point here is that if we are not exposed to the language of the powerful, how can we understand the powerful? How can we use our voices to fight back?

**That Little Voice Inside Our Heads**

*""The corruption of man is followed by the corruption of language."" - Ralph Waldo Emerson*

One could argue that the point of education, at least from the ""equality"" perspective (not a conspiratorial one), is that no matter what our backgrounds, we should all be given the same ability to learn to read and write, meaning a kid in Detroit should be able to compete fairly with a kid in Denver on a standardized test. We all know that is not exactly happening right now, and you can read more about this court case in Detroit where it was determined that basic literacy is not a constitutional right:

[https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2018/07/no-right-become-literate/564545/](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2018/07/no-right-become-literate/564545/)

The travesty is that one can spend the majority of his or her life in school and never learn to adequately read and write. Today, kids are barely reading, and they are not reading enough ""tough"" books. 

[http://theconversation.com/teenagers-arent-reading-enough-tough-books-heres-why-that-matters-91932](http://theconversation.com/teenagers-arent-reading-enough-tough-books-heres-why-that-matters-91932)

The point is that even if we are not rich, we can keep up with the powerful when we understand their language. Even the poor, if they learn how to read and write at a high level, can develop the vocabulary of the rich. Language unifies us, and that is exactly why ""they"" do not want anyone to access their language. Language is power. Remember, the education of slaves was discouraged, and there was good reason.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education\_during\_the\_Slave\_Period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_during_the_Slave_Period)

So, today, students are not learning enough words, but it goes even deeper. Perhaps symbolically, kids are literally losing their ability to hold pens or pencils:

[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/feb/25/children-struggle-to-hold-pencils-due-to-too-much-tech-doctors-say](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/feb/25/children-struggle-to-hold-pencils-due-to-too-much-tech-doctors-say)

So, what, though? Can't they just type? 

Kids are struggling to write in nearly any form, and according to the following article, even losing that ""voice in their head.""

***""What voice in my head?” she wrote in her response to the Lamott essay. “I don’t have one.”***

[https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/02/education/edlife/writing-education-grammar-students-children.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/02/education/edlife/writing-education-grammar-students-children.html)

And that is where we this all comes down to. Our language is our identity, or at least a substantial part of it. When people lose the ability to use their language at a high level, they are literally losing a part of themselves - **their voice.**

After all, language allows us to have abstract thought, something that distinguishes us from animals:

[https://www.livescience.com/33376-humans-other-animals-distinguishing-mental-abilities.html](https://www.livescience.com/33376-humans-other-animals-distinguishing-mental-abilities.html)

Limits of our language mean limits of our voice in the world. 

**Tl;dr Culture**

*“Without knowing the force of words, it is impossible to know more.” -* *Confucius*

Language today is in the process of simplification and degradation. 

Simple language is not all bad, right? We are all busy, and the last thing most of us have time do is read a lengthy conspiracy article (like this one). So, language has become simplified so that communication is more efficient. What's wrong with that? Well, let us take a look at the modern meme. 

The problem is not that memes are inherently good or bad. However, when they are used as tools to translate complex messages, there becomes a problem. Memes, just like the 140 characters on Twitter (I guess it is 280 now), no matter how well-done, can never properly convey the complexity of any single issue, yet they are relied on by nearly every group today. Look, I am not anti-meme - they are quick and to the point, and they can be powerful. But the problem lies in the over-simplification of complex ideas. 

We live in the ""tl;dr"" culture - where many are just far too lazy to go into the complexity behind an idea. Or, maybe they are simply ignorant to the fact that an idea can be more complex than what is shown at first glance. 

Let's take a complex issue like racism and put it into a meme. Is anybody, then, really going to explore the complexities of racism, especially kids or teenagers? Likely not. 

By the way - do not underestimate the power of the ""meme."" If you are somehow on /r/conspiracy and do not know about ""memetic magic"", you might want to take a look:

[https://medium.com/tryangle-magazine/meme-magic-is-real-you-guys-16a497fc45b3](https://medium.com/tryangle-magazine/meme-magic-is-real-you-guys-16a497fc45b3)

According to the Guardian, ""Memes – from the Greek for “that which is imitated” – were once defined as being self-replicating units of culture. This included anything that could be learned, remembered and spread from one brain to another, such as the concept of god all the way to the popular Budweiser “Wazzup” catchphrase.""

The simplification of language means that the language is easier to mimic. The problem with memes is that you will get hundreds of people sharing and mimicking them, and they may not even understand their true message, or at least, be willing to look beyond the simplified message. Quite simply, simplified language = simplified thought. 

But it is not just about memes. Most people are not looking deeply into issues today. Most need a tl;dr before they read anything more than a few paragraphs.

That is what is dangerous. Going beyond memes, quite simply, is that people are losing the ability to think abstractly or think deeply about complex issues. 

We now live in the tl;dr culture, where even 15 seconds is too long for most people:

[https://www.cnet.com/news/when-15-seconds-is-too-long-welcome-to-the-tldr-world/](https://www.cnet.com/news/when-15-seconds-is-too-long-welcome-to-the-tldr-world/)

Further, simplified views of the world lead to more extremism, too,  or ""black and white"" thinking. With simple language, the ""shades of grey"" cannot be seen unless someone is willing to examine more deeply. But who has time for that anymore?  

**Classist Language**

*“Books are education and education is power. The more education the people acquire the more equal society will become. Universal learning is the foundation of a fairer future for mankind.”  -* *Helen Culnane,* [*Worlds Apart*](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/64407623) 

A modern argument against the complexities of language, such as stringent grammar, is that it is ""racist"" or ""classist."" According to some colleges, 'proper grammar' promotes racism and ""unjust language structure"":

[https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/feb/21/college-writing-center-proper-grammar-perpetuates-/](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/feb/21/college-writing-center-proper-grammar-perpetuates-/)

So, instead of getting people to learn how to use grammar properly, it is easier to simplify it or dumb it down, right? This is true equality, right? Lowering our standards so that all students can learn! : )

First, education should be used to create equality/equity. Dumbing down systems will not create true equality. Rather, it will divide the super powerful and elite (who are going to use prescriptivism language systems whether we do or not) and anyone who is not the elite.  

Yes, language evolves. Yes, it is probably okay to get rid of outdated rules that do not work well in modern linguistics. However, to advocate for the elimination of an entire grammar system because of  supposed ""oppression"" is ironic. Language may be the only tool people have left to truly speak out anymore, and limiting language directly limits a person's power. 

**Language as a Tool for Power**

*""All I need is a sheet of paper and something to write with, and then I can turn the world upside down."" -Friedrich Nietzsche*

To truly fight against oppression, we need to be able to understand the complexities of the language used by our 'oppressors.' We need to be able to understand how they use language as a tool of power, and we need to be able to use these linguistic tools, too.

""A Modest Proposal"" is the perfect example of that. The author used language to write a satirical piece suggesting ""that the impoverished Irish might ease their economic troubles by selling their children as food for rich gentlemen and ladies. This satirical hyperbole mocked heartless attitudes towards the poor, as well as British policy toward the Irish in general. The primary target of Swift's satire was the rationalism of modern economics, and the growth of rationalistic modes of thinking in modern life at the expense of more traditional human values."" This piece directly criticized the power structures of the time:

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A\_Modest\_Proposal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Modest_Proposal)

This well-written essay was so shocking that real change occurred. 

The complexity of language is needed to convey complex thoughts, and those complex structures of language, like grammar, are needed to keep language clear, concise, and easily communicated and understood.

Education is power, and today, education is nearly entirely centered on language, even subjects like mathematics. If we want true power in our world and if we want a true voice, we need to be able to express ourselves in similar ways.

The best way to divide a country is to make sure there are some who will never be able to read or write properly, but how do ""they"" do that?

**Nobody Reads Anymore**

*""Once you learn to read, you will be forever free."" - Frederick Douglass*

It is rare today to meet a student who truly enjoys reading and writing, and there is good reason for this. 

Reading, believe it or not, used to be done for pleasure, but not it is at an all-time low:

[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2018/06/29/leisure-reading-in-the-u-s-is-at-an-all-time-low/?utm\_term=.e9e4047bb059](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2018/06/29/leisure-reading-in-the-u-s-is-at-an-all-time-low/?utm_term=.e9e4047bb059)

In schools, too, reading and writing are now all associated with testing. There are very few chances to read or write for pleasure:

[https://fee.org/articles/do-schools-teach-kids-to-hate-reading/](https://fee.org/articles/do-schools-teach-kids-to-hate-reading/)

Moreover, the emergence of Common Core has also changed how students read and write - the national curriculum has taken creativity out of the writing process:

[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jun/23/national-curriculum-is-damaging-childrens-creative-writing-say-authors](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jun/23/national-curriculum-is-damaging-childrens-creative-writing-say-authors) 

When our society begins to simplify and devalue language, then the learning outcomes in school are not surprising. Why should Johnny learn to write an essay when he does not see its purpose other than for testing? Why should Mary learn to communicate effectively when she never has to get off her phone anyway?

But we cannot just blame teachers and schools for this. Parents are not reading anymore either; kids do not read books because parents do not read books:

[https://www.forbes.com/sites/jordanshapiro/2014/05/13/kids-dont-read-books-because-parents-dont-read-books/](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jordanshapiro/2014/05/13/kids-dont-read-books-because-parents-dont-read-books/)

And, besides, in a sense, reading is even 'stigmatized.' We do not live in a culture that values the love of learning. I remember being made fun of in school because I loved to read books.

If our society does not value the ""love of language"" and learning, then our students will not either. What is valued in our society, today, seems to be anything that requires as little effort as possible. 

**The Conspiracy**

*“It's a beautiful thing, the destruction of words.”  -* *George Orwell,*     [*1984*](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/153313) 

Warfare today is simple. In order to control people, control their language, and then control their thoughts. Force is not even needed.

*""It is an axiom of economic warfare that the surest way of destroying a country is to debase its currency; for example, by flooding it with counterfeit money. It is no less true that the surest way of destroying a nation’s culture and identity is to debase its language. Not surprisingly, therefore, subversive agencies are giving the highest priority to the corruption of the English language. These ‘semantic forgers,’ all in the course of promoting their odious political correctness, are at work in our schools and colleges, in central and local government, in publishing houses and throughout the mass media. In the process they are seeking to make certain words as unacceptable as counterfeit money, to alter the traditional meaning and value of other words, and to introduce new terms serving their own perverse ideology. (George Orwell prophesied as much in his novel Nineteen Eighty-Four, in which the official language was ‘Newspeak.’)""*

[www.heretical.com/miscellx/language.html](https://www.heretical.com/miscellx/language.html)

In this post, I was not able to get into every aspect of the control of language such as censorship or propaganda.

However, the destruction of our minds starts with the degradation of language. Even people who are ""educated"" are spending limited time using language in complex ways. 

People are not spending hours conversing with others anymore - they maybe send a text to somebody and go back to avoiding the world. People are not reading complex pieces anymore - they maybe see a meme and share it and go back to avoiding the world. People are limiting their use of language in nearly every way, yet speaking up on the most complex of topics in politics. There is real danger here.

Our words have such tremendous power that they are even controlled on Reddit. Think about all the subreddits where the mods have one job, and that is to remove any controversial comments that may go against ""the agenda.""

If you really read this whole post, please know your words still do have power. We are now living in a time where we here more about censorship daily, from books being banned in classrooms, to people's lives being destroyed for ""wrong think."" 

If you words did not have power, they would not try to control them.

Also any general thoughts on job outcomes, post graduation advice, or things to do while I'm a student (personal projects/learning). Im transferring in as a second semester sophomore from a small lib arts school. I was thinking of attending a coding bootcamp in lieu of an internship this summer. "

Our language shapes our reality.

According to Psychology Today, ""Each language carves up the world somewhat differently. So each language provides its speakers with a particular worldview that won’t be quite the same as the one that speakers of other languages have. In other words, we see the world according to the framework our language imposes on us.""

[https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/talking-apes/201509/how-language-shapes-our-world](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/talking-apes/201509/how-language-shapes-our-world)

If language shapes the world in which we live, it is possible to directly manipulate and even degrade a language to control a group of people - to control our thoughts. In other words, language can (and is) used as a weapon for mind control, or according the following article, ""newspeak is a crucial instrument of totalitarian power.""

[https://fee.org/articles/would-be-tyrants-capture-language-to-control-thought/](https://fee.org/articles/would-be-tyrants-capture-language-to-control-thought/)

In this post, I am going to discuss the modern manipulation and degradation of language, as well as the ultimate conspiracy behind the control of language. Most reading here are aware of how language is used to control us to some extent, but are you aware of how language is breaking down before your very eyes? For the sake of brevity and time, this post will focus more on the degradation and simplification of language versus other means of control of language such as propaganda and censorship.

**Limited Perception**

*“The limits of my language means the limits of my world.”  -* *Ludwig Wittgenstein* 

Let us go back to the original point; our language shapes our world. So, ultimately, the more words we know, the broader our perception of the world will be. Today, though, reading and vocabulary have become a mockery of what they once were. 

To clarify, Americans are behind in math, vocabulary, and technology:

[https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2013/10/americans-are-way-behind-in-math-vocabulary-and-technology/280413/](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2013/10/americans-are-way-behind-in-math-vocabulary-and-technology/280413/)

Looking deeper at vocabulary specifically, there is a widening ""word gap"" between rich and poor kids.

According to the following article,"" ""Children in professionals' homes were exposed to an average of more than fifteen hundred more spoken words per hour than children in welfare homes. Over one year, that amounted to a difference of nearly 8 million words, which, by age four, amounted to a total gap of 32 million words. They also found a substantial gap in tone and in the complexity of words being used. As they crunched the numbers, they discovered a direct correlation between the intensity of these early verbal experiences and later achievement.""

[https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2010/03/the-32-million-word-gap/36856/](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2010/03/the-32-million-word-gap/36856/)

Why does this matter? Again, our words shape our reality. Limited vocabulary means limited perception of our world. Here, for example, are some words rich people use that poor people liikley do not:

\--trust-fund

\--inheritance 

\--off-shore

\--hedge fund

\--investor relations

\--private wealth management

\--commodity strategies

\--pooled investment vehicle 

\--kale 

\--au pair

\--lacrosse 

\--yoga

\--unpaid internship

\--Aspen

\--amenities

\--the longer back nine

\--cotillion

\--coxswain

\--tartan

\--escrow

\--equestrian program

\--Aubusson rug

\--chevre

\--board of directors

\--chaise lounge

\--antiquarian

\--facilitator

\--Wellingtons

\--docent 

\--tax-free municipal bonds 

[https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/snow-white-doesnt-live-here-anymore/201406/words-rich-people-use-poor-people-dont](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/snow-white-doesnt-live-here-anymore/201406/words-rich-people-use-poor-people-dont)

The point here is that if we are not exposed to the language of the powerful, how can we understand the powerful? How can we use our voices to fight back?

**That Little Voice Inside Our Heads**

*""The corruption of man is followed by the corruption of language."" - Ralph Waldo Emerson*

One could argue that the point of education, at least from the ""equality"" perspective (not a conspiratorial one), is that no matter what our backgrounds, we should all be given the same ability to learn to read and write, meaning a kid in Detroit should be able to compete fairly with a kid in Denver on a standardized test. We all know that is not exactly happening right now, and you can read more about this court case in Detroit where it was determined that basic literacy is not a constitutional right:

[https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2018/07/no-right-become-literate/564545/](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2018/07/no-right-become-literate/564545/)

The travesty is that one can spend the majority of his or her life in school and never learn to adequately read and write. Today, kids are barely reading, and they are not reading enough ""tough"" books. 

[http://theconversation.com/teenagers-arent-reading-enough-tough-books-heres-why-that-matters-91932](http://theconversation.com/teenagers-arent-reading-enough-tough-books-heres-why-that-matters-91932)

The point is that even if we are not rich, we can keep up with the powerful when we understand their language. Even the poor, if they learn how to read and write at a high level, can develop the vocabulary of the rich. Language unifies us, and that is exactly why ""they"" do not want anyone to access their language. Language is power. Remember, the education of slaves was discouraged, and there was good reason.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education\_during\_the\_Slave\_Period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_during_the_Slave_Period)

So, today, students are not learning enough words, but it goes even deeper. Perhaps symbolically, kids are literally losing their ability to hold pens or pencils:

[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/feb/25/children-struggle-to-hold-pencils-due-to-too-much-tech-doctors-say](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/feb/25/children-struggle-to-hold-pencils-due-to-too-much-tech-doctors-say)

So, what, though? Can't they just type? 

Kids are struggling to write in nearly any form, and according to the following article, even losing that ""voice in their head.""

***""What voice in my head?” she wrote in her response to the Lamott essay. “I don’t have one.”***

[https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/02/education/edlife/writing-education-grammar-students-children.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/02/education/edlife/writing-education-grammar-students-children.html)

And that is where we this all comes down to. Our language is our identity, or at least a substantial part of it. When people lose the ability to use their language at a high level, they are literally losing a part of themselves - **their voice.**

After all, language allows us to have abstract thought, something that distinguishes us from animals:

[https://www.livescience.com/33376-humans-other-animals-distinguishing-mental-abilities.html](https://www.livescience.com/33376-humans-other-animals-distinguishing-mental-abilities.html)

Limits of our language mean limits of our voice in the world. 

**Tl;dr Culture**

*“Without knowing the force of words, it is impossible to know more.” -* *Confucius*

Language today is in the process of simplification and degradation. 

Simple language is not all bad, right? We are all busy, and the last thing most of us have time do is read a lengthy conspiracy article (like this one). So, language has become simplified so that communication is more efficient. What's wrong with that? Well, let us take a look at the modern meme. 

The problem is not that memes are inherently good or bad. However, when they are used as tools to translate complex messages, there becomes a problem. Memes, just like the 140 characters on Twitter (I guess it is 280 now), no matter how well-done, can never properly convey the complexity of any single issue, yet they are relied on by nearly every group today. Look, I am not anti-meme - they are quick and to the point, and they can be powerful. But the problem lies in the over-simplification of complex ideas. 

We live in the ""tl;dr"" culture - where many are just far too lazy to go into the complexity behind an idea. Or, maybe they are simply ignorant to the fact that an idea can be more complex than what is shown at first glance. 

Let's take a complex issue like racism and put it into a meme. Is anybody, then, really going to explore the complexities of racism, especially kids or teenagers? Likely not. 

By the way - do not underestimate the power of the ""meme."" If you are somehow on /r/conspiracy and do not know about ""memetic magic"", you might want to take a look:

[https://medium.com/tryangle-magazine/meme-magic-is-real-you-guys-16a497fc45b3](https://medium.com/tryangle-magazine/meme-magic-is-real-you-guys-16a497fc45b3)

According to the Guardian, ""Memes – from the Greek for “that which is imitated” – were once defined as being self-replicating units of culture. This included anything that could be learned, remembered and spread from one brain to another, such as the concept of god all the way to the popular Budweiser “Wazzup” catchphrase.""

The simplification of language means that the language is easier to mimic. The problem with memes is that you will get hundreds of people sharing and mimicking them, and they may not even understand their true message, or at least, be willing to look beyond the simplified message. Quite simply, simplified language = simplified thought. 

But it is not just about memes. Most people are not looking deeply into issues today. Most need a tl;dr before they read anything more than a few paragraphs.

That is what is dangerous. Going beyond memes, quite simply, is that people are losing the ability to think abstractly or think deeply about complex issues. 

We now live in the tl;dr culture, where even 15 seconds is too long for most people:

[https://www.cnet.com/news/when-15-seconds-is-too-long-welcome-to-the-tldr-world/](https://www.cnet.com/news/when-15-seconds-is-too-long-welcome-to-the-tldr-world/)

Further, simplified views of the world lead to more extremism, too,  or ""black and white"" thinking. With simple language, the ""shades of grey"" cannot be seen unless someone is willing to examine more deeply. But who has time for that anymore?  

**Classist Language**

*“Books are education and education is power. The more education the people acquire the more equal society will become. Universal learning is the foundation of a fairer future for mankind.”  -* *Helen Culnane,* [*Worlds Apart*](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/64407623) 

A modern argument against the complexities of language, such as stringent grammar, is that it is ""racist"" or ""classist."" According to some colleges, 'proper grammar' promotes racism and ""unjust language structure"":

[https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/feb/21/college-writing-center-proper-grammar-perpetuates-/](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/feb/21/college-writing-center-proper-grammar-perpetuates-/)

So, instead of getting people to learn how to use grammar properly, it is easier to simplify it or dumb it down, right? This is true equality, right? Lowering our standards so that all students can learn! : )

First, education should be used to create equality/equity. Dumbing down systems will not create true equality. Rather, it will divide the super powerful and elite (who are going to use prescriptivism language systems whether we do or not) and anyone who is not the elite.  

Yes, language evolves. Yes, it is probably okay to get rid of outdated rules that do not work well in modern linguistics. However, to advocate for the elimination of an entire grammar system because of  supposed ""oppression"" is ironic. Language may be the only tool people have left to truly speak out anymore, and limiting language directly limits a person's power. 

**Language as a Tool for Power**

*""All I need is a sheet of paper and something to write with, and then I can turn the world upside down."" -Friedrich Nietzsche*

To truly fight against oppression, we need to be able to understand the complexities of the language used by our 'oppressors.' We need to be able to understand how they use language as a tool of power, and we need to be able to use these linguistic tools, too.

""A Modest Proposal"" is the perfect example of that. The author used language to write a satirical piece suggesting ""that the impoverished Irish might ease their economic troubles by selling their children as food for rich gentlemen and ladies. This satirical hyperbole mocked heartless attitudes towards the poor, as well as British policy toward the Irish in general. The primary target of Swift's satire was the rationalism of modern economics, and the growth of rationalistic modes of thinking in modern life at the expense of more traditional human values."" This piece directly criticized the power structures of the time:

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A\_Modest\_Proposal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Modest_Proposal)

This well-written essay was so shocking that real change occurred. 

The complexity of language is needed to convey complex thoughts, and those complex structures of language, like grammar, are needed to keep language clear, concise, and easily communicated and understood.

Education is power, and today, education is nearly entirely centered on language, even subjects like mathematics. If we want true power in our world and if we want a true voice, we need to be able to express ourselves in similar ways.

The best way to divide a country is to make sure there are some who will never be able to read or write properly, but how do ""they"" do that?

**Nobody Reads Anymore**

*""Once you learn to read, you will be forever free."" - Frederick Douglass*

It is rare today to meet a student who truly enjoys reading and writing, and there is good reason for this. 

Reading, believe it or not, used to be done for pleasure, but not it is at an all-time low:

[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2018/06/29/leisure-reading-in-the-u-s-is-at-an-all-time-low/?utm\_term=.e9e4047bb059](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2018/06/29/leisure-reading-in-the-u-s-is-at-an-all-time-low/?utm_term=.e9e4047bb059)

In schools, too, reading and writing are now all associated with testing. There are very few chances to read or write for pleasure:

[https://fee.org/articles/do-schools-teach-kids-to-hate-reading/](https://fee.org/articles/do-schools-teach-kids-to-hate-reading/)

Moreover, the emergence of Common Core has also changed how students read and write - the national curriculum has taken creativity out of the writing process:

[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jun/23/national-curriculum-is-damaging-childrens-creative-writing-say-authors](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jun/23/national-curriculum-is-damaging-childrens-creative-writing-say-authors) 

When our society begins to simplify and devalue language, then the learning outcomes in school are not surprising. Why should Johnny learn to write an essay when he does not see its purpose other than for testing? Why should Mary learn to communicate effectively when she never has to get off her phone anyway?

But we cannot just blame teachers and schools for this. Parents are not reading anymore either; kids do not read books because parents do not read books:

[https://www.forbes.com/sites/jordanshapiro/2014/05/13/kids-dont-read-books-because-parents-dont-read-books/](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jordanshapiro/2014/05/13/kids-dont-read-books-because-parents-dont-read-books/)

And, besides, in a sense, reading is even 'stigmatized.' We do not live in a culture that values the love of learning. I remember being made fun of in school because I loved to read books.

If our society does not value the ""love of language"" and learning, then our students will not either. What is valued in our society, today, seems to be anything that requires as little effort as possible. 

**The Conspiracy**

*“It's a beautiful thing, the destruction of words.”  -* *George Orwell,*     [*1984*](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/153313) 

Warfare today is simple. In order to control people, control their language, and then control their thoughts. Force is not even needed.

*""It is an axiom of economic warfare that the surest way of destroying a country is to debase its currency; for example, by flooding it with counterfeit money. It is no less true that the surest way of destroying a nation’s culture and identity is to debase its language. Not surprisingly, therefore, subversive agencies are giving the highest priority to the corruption of the English language. These ‘semantic forgers,’ all in the course of promoting their odious political correctness, are at work in our schools and colleges, in central and local government, in publishing houses and throughout the mass media. In the process they are seeking to make certain words as unacceptable as counterfeit money, to alter the traditional meaning and value of other words, and to introduce new terms serving their own perverse ideology. (George Orwell prophesied as much in his novel Nineteen Eighty-Four, in which the official language was ‘Newspeak.’)""*

[www.heretical.com/miscellx/language.html](https://www.heretical.com/miscellx/language.html)

In this post, I was not able to get into every aspect of the control of language such as censorship or propaganda.

However, the destruction of our minds starts with the degradation of language. Even people who are ""educated"" are spending limited time using language in complex ways. 

People are not spending hours conversing with others anymore - they maybe send a text to somebody and go back to avoiding the world. People are not reading complex pieces anymore - they maybe see a meme and share it and go back to avoiding the world. People are limiting their use of language in nearly every way, yet speaking up on the most complex of topics in politics. There is real danger here.

Our words have such tremendous power that they are even controlled on Reddit. Think about all the subreddits where the mods have one job, and that is to remove any controversial comments that may go against ""the agenda.""

If you really read this whole post, please know your words still do have power. We are now living in a time where we here more about censorship daily, from books being banned in classrooms, to people's lives being destroyed for ""wrong think."" 

If you words did not have power, they would not try to control them.

So I used to work in IT and have been studying for the last 3 years. I would like to apply for jobs at some stage but I'm not confident that I can work a full day due fatigue and the boom and bust effect it will have so it raises the question, why would they hire me?

Just wondering if for anyone that knows someone or has experienced a Traumatic Brain Injury, how did you get back into work? Did you have to apply for jobs? Was there anything you had to explain to them at interviews about your TBI? How did they treat you in the workplace?

I had big ideas on what I wanted to do before this stuff happened and even had an internship, how quickly things changed.

So the backstory...

It really doesn't help when you work in a hella toxic environment w/ literally 99% of the staff being snakes. I do my best to keep my head down but there are times when I know the guys are testing me and just being complete assholes that I really want to do some damage but ofc not only would I lose this job (despite the fact that the boss is SO cheap he's considered of letting me go) but because I know that deep down I'm better than that and I'd hate to step down to their level. Most of these guys are high school dropouts and already I feel sorry for them because most of them have filed for bankruptcy so ofc they'll taunt me since to them I'm some ""privileged milk-fed"" but I stay because I think I can help improve certain practices. I have it on my list of projects but ofc it's difficult to find time with school and homework so to them they think it's B.S. and even unsettling that I want to help out. One of them, who's literally some schlort wormtail that creeps on all the attractive women at the shop (including the girl before my position), has ""followed"" me from the train to the shop multiple times and constantly stares at me like I did some shit to him. He has 5 kids, 2 of which are from different persons because this horny runt must've been after birthright citizenship or something. Whatever the case is, I just........oh. Also, whenever I make a mistake and he catches it, he has some pride of rubbing it in my face which irks the hell out of me but after some months now, I just don't care. What I do find annoying is all the other shit things he does to torment me.

And his friend...he's just as much a bully and barely hygienic. He has molluscum contagiosum and yet goes around shaking other people's hands, doesn't know how to return things properly, walks around like he's calling the shots...a real scumbag if I'm being honest... Hell, he probably thinks he's 25 or something because even the shit he wears is ridiculous at his age... Regardless, I refused to shake his hand one time and he ratted me out to the boss saying ""I don't play well others, etc."". Maybe so, especially if ""others"" includes wormtail's and diseased freak's like him.

And boss... oh my. They carry this mentality that they own you and it's gone so far that recently they installed a camera facing my station where they can essentially see what I'm doing or the next guy. I told the guy ahead in advance (assuming I can trust him; so far, it's a yes) but geezus. Of course, as long as you're on their good side you're fine but it's all for their benefit. I have a VERY toxic figure already in my life and having more included is just chaos. Not to mention during the summer, they basically kept me in internment on the weekends because of some bullshit with another idiot at work which was not a good look for my first few weeks but still...already, there's no sense of privacy with these fucking rats and snakes.

For most of you who haven't left just yet, I know that the most obvious solution to this freak show is to quit - and believe me, the thought has crossed my mind MULTIPLE times - but it's complicated. Like I mentioned earlier, I do see potential for improvement in the business despite the obstacles put in place that otherwise persuade me NOT to help a hopeless cause but the other reason is because this is the only job remotely close to what I am studying that beats an ""unpaid"" internship and miraculously ended up being hired. Many other job interviews never went anywhere and to get an on campus job would mean a whole lot of ass-kissing and boot licking and honestly, that's not what I do, even if that's the case for the majority. I may not be the most self-confident person in the entire fucking planet but I'd like to keep my integrity. Also, they rely too much on this one guy who has literally helped the business grow and prosper that my heart bleeds for him because very few realize his sacrifice. Don't get me wrong, he's got his flaws but honestly since DAY 1, I've always referred to him as the REAL Boss and to this day, still do.

So, after this delightful rant, my question:

What would be the best approach to deal with this toxicity (from midget wormtail, to diseased-four eye's, to Mr. Maellard himself)? Something that took me awhile to understand was ""the bigger picture"" and truth is, the last thing I want is for the next person to fill my shoes to have to endure all this nonsense and bigotry."
9ybv7c,1,2018-11-18,"22 years old, Being booted off of parent's health insurance. Uncertain income for 2019.",ExpressDragonfly,HealthInsurance,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthInsurance/comments/9ybv7c/22_years_old_being_booted_off_of_parents_health/,"The situation is that I'm a 22 year old recent college graduate. A lot has happened in my life in the past year: I graduated from college in Florida in May and then took an unpaid internship over the summer in Texas. Currently, I'm living in Indiana living with my significant other (unmarried) and working \~30hr/week as a delivery driver while applying to graduate school for admission in Fall 2019. 

My estimated total income for 2018 includes:

\-$2,274 from working part-time January-May back when I was still in college

\-$5,016 in net scholarship refunds from my college. My scholarships exceeded my educational costs by a decent margin, so this amount is taxable.

\-$2,000 housing stipend for my unpaid internship in Texas. This is also taxable.

\-$6,200 (estimated) from my current job as a delivery driver in Indiana. 

For a total of $15,490.

&amp;#x200B;

Now the only thing that I rely on my mother for is my health insurance. She is a resident of Florida and we are on a FloridaBlue Bronze PPO plan. She recently met with her insurance navigator and her accountant and has since told me that now that I am an Indiana resident I need to enroll in my own health insurance plan before December 15. I was planning on filing as an independent for 2018, however, my mom announced that she will be claiming me a dependent for 2018.  This complicates matters for me, because according to [Healthcare.gov](https://Healthcare.gov): ""If you are a tax dependent when coverage ends: You can enroll in your own Marketplace plan during Open Enrollment. But you won’t be eligible for savings based on your income. You’d have to pay full price. You may qualify for Medicaid."" I'm assuming that this means that since I will be claimed as a dependent for 2018 (but not for 2019), I would not receive any income-based subsidies.

&amp;#x200B;

In theory, I could go on Medicaid, but my income for 2019 is wildly unpredictable.  If I were accepted to graduate school (I find out in April 2019), I would continue working at my current job until the end of July and then head off to graduate school, where I may/may not get a work-study job or qualify for stipends. In this scenario, I would probably qualify for Medicaid, which would put me at making less than $14,000/yr in Indiana, but I am cutting it close.  If I weren't accepted to graduate school, I would be moving with my partner to wherever he gets a job and would continue working, which would put me at exceeding Medicaid eligibility. What happens if I make more income than my Medicaid eligibility allows? Or conversely, if I don't make enough to qualify in the Marketplace?

&amp;#x200B;

I am wondering if anyone here has been in a remotely similar situation. I'm going to try and meet with a Marketplace Navigator soon. "
9yc5ta,1,2018-11-18,Pulling myself out of Hell,throwa2934,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/9yc5ta/pulling_myself_out_of_hell/,"**TL;DR: steadily pulling myself out of depression over these past few months**

It's been over five months since I took a medical leave off the final two weeks of my previous position at my employment. That position was a year-long internship, and, as it came to an end, I found myself suffering from depression and anxiety the same way I struggled during my undergraduate years. Flashbacks and nightmares to the ways I nearly failed my physics and chemistry courses, faced punishment without defense from the [Dean of Students](http://www.hussainather.com/2018/10/the-story-of-how-i-won.html), and fell ill to a plague of inexpressible, insufferable demons in my mind. Despite the few weeks of leave I took, I still found my fears and anxieties taking control of my life to the point where I lost sight in the purpose of my research and career as a whole.

But things are different now.

Since the beginning of October, I've slowly pulled myself out of my previous ways of thinking. I've begun eating healthy, exercising well, taking up hobbies, praying, working fine, and preparing myself for graduate and fellowship programs. Weeks of therapy that slowly turned into months of therapy as I studied my psychological well-being throughout an entire year. Writing down every thought, feeling, desire, and anxiety that crossed my mind into notepads and looking back on them with an intellectual detachment, I found meaning and value in my experience of the world. I could figure out how events and emotions tied into one another and what sort of narrative I could construct from these senseless ideas. This way, my thoughts no longer trapped me. Rather, I could step out of my world of darkness and look back without redemption. Discovering the truth of my past, no matter how difficult it may be, is the only way I can find peace in the present. Realizing the existential crises that have plagued my mind and soul for nearly half a decade now, I have the power to overcome these struggles that have burned inside of me. Unshackled by fear and unmoved by stigma, I slowly improved. Yet, I still don't know exactly what improved, though. My psyche remained elusive. 

I credit my therapist and psychiatrist in helping me tremendously, but I also have to thank my friends who have supported me through my hobbies. It's been my writing, cosplay, music (picking up bass guitar), and sharing my experience with others. I've even written about my [experiences on classical music](http://www.hussainather.com/2018/10/whats-so-great-about-classical-music.html). I've begun reading about philosophy again (after spending about a year after college near-completely ignoring it.) Those things are how we make sense of an existentially absurd, morally ambiguous world. Thought they don't provide solutions for our questions of existence, they give us reminders, as though one were taking a dose of medicine, of what this world offers. Celebrating existence and value in the present moment is how we our bodies and minds re-adjust to the cold, detached truths of existence. 

This doesn't mean the darkness is completely behind me, though. For four months, I struggled with eating, getting out of bed, reading, writing, and all forms of research. I skipped work almost every day and slowly cut off contact with my boss and the other supervisors I worked under. It got to the point where my parents were calling my boss to check in if I was working. Everyone became worried about me and my safety. My recent success is nothing but a careful, tenacious exodus from those dark corners of life. To this day I still struggle at times with finding a purpose or goal in many things I do, including research and writing. 

The voices inside my head taunted me nevertheless. ""You're an absolute failure. You couldn't finish things in undergrad. What makes you think you can become a successful researcher here now?""

There was no deux ex machina or shining moment of realization. Nothing specific that made me better. Just a slow, gradual process of realization was the only thing that made sense to me. In fact, I wouldn't even use the routine things that I do as evidence that I'm doing better. Even though it's great that I'm exercising, eating well, taking interests in hobbies, and performing well at work, those things are trivial in comparison to the existential crises I've been working through. 

""You barely understand bioinformatics. How are you supposed to write about science and philosophy in general?""

Still, it's paradoxical that, despite their triviality, I wouldn't have been able to struggle through these philosophical conflicts without their support. It's almost as though our temporal, day-to-day activities are necessary for growth but, in and of themselves, not representative of the growth. 

""Ha! What a loser you are. You've fallen victim to the darkness of this world. You were meant to suffer.""

The challenge is simple, though. I have to look to my past to understand the causes of this trauma. I need to understand what I've been through and put things in context. My fears, desires, anxieties, and worries have been getting to me. They've taken over me such that my entire soul has been shaking as a result of that.

I share this lonely view with those of you willing to read this. To the people who have the courage and willpower to understand this dark side of the human condition, I thank you. As I cite singer Anthony Kiedis' line from ""Scar Tissue,"" (""I'll make it to the moon if I have to crawl""), I'm reminded of the ways we overcome these seemingly impossible struggles through perseverance. Let's hope the future is brighter for the students and researchers of tomorrow. "

As a civil engineer student this is a very stressful moment and having a chance to talk to these companies could give us a chance of landing an internship. 

Anyways, I’ve talked to about 3 companies now and I start to feel comfortable and start to open up more and feel less stressed until I talk to the 4th company. 

I go up to this company and the first question they ask is “So what do you like about Flatiron?” I was so puzzled and confused. Why was she asking me about flat iron, is it a type of iron you build with? So I ask “Um, Flatiron?”. When I said that she says “yeah, Flatiron, the name of the company.” And I look up at the booth and see it right there, the name of the company, Flatiron. 

I immediately got red and nervous and my voice started to shake. I had no clue what to say, how was I supposed to come back from this?! Lets just say I left that career fair without an offer. "

9yd6ce,3,2018-11-18,My First Experience in a Kitchen,ACuriousFrenchie,KitchenConfidential,https://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/9yd6ce/my_first_experience_in_a_kitchen/,"Hey everyone,

I just discovered this thread and felt like sharing this story of my first experience in a kitchen because... it didn't go great. 

I've always loved baking and since my mother worked in the Hospitality industry, she was able to get me an internship in this quite renowned pastry shop here in France so it was a big deal and I was very excited. But oh boy was I in for a shock. 

Keep in mind, I was 14, so already breaking a few labor laws there (and it'll get worse), and it was my first real job.

First, had to wake up at 5 am, which was fine. I took my bike and it was fun cos my house is all the way up a hill and I could just glide down to work, oblivious I'll have to ride back up my long shift. 

I get ready for work, meet the crew, other than the Pastry chef who wasn't there, and we just start working. I'm tasked to make the room service breakfasts (the pastry shop was attached to a luxurious hotel) and I gotta hurry because they're going to wake up soon. In the end, I'm a bit late but nothing too bad, not too hard.

At 8:30 am, we take a break and eat breakfast. However, I had already eaten breakfast before coming to work so I say I', not hungry... **big mistake** because for the next 9 hours there was not ONE break. Not ONE. And it'll be like that the whole week.

In all fairness, normally, the work was supposed to end at 1 PM but that week, they had a deal with the Congress Palace to provide breakfast for an event there, and that meant we finished worked at 5 PM. So yeah, after a 12 hour shift (labor laws broken?), I was exhausted. Also, I realized my hard shoes were too small too, and I had to cycle back home but in all honesty, nothing too bad because I was still full of energy and excitement.

But that energy and excitement eventually waned away and by the end of the week, shit really went down. First, I'm told to redo the meringue for my lemon pies because I hadn't done it properly, which made me feel like shit because frankly, at that point, I was not only exhausted but I also felt like I wasn't meant to be there and I was taking the place of someone more qualified and that deserved my place more. After all, I had gotten the place thanks to nepotism, and that really made me feel like shit cos I don't think I was doing great.

I redo the meringues and this time it's fine so I'm told the pick up the apple tarts shells, which I do but I drop one of the trays and a few break. Second bad mark. Then I'm told to make the ""Financiers"" (rectangular almond cakes) which I do and then put them in the oven. Meanwhile, one guy asks me to put plastic film on the jams (if I remember well, it was to avoid a film forming above it?) but a few minute later another asks me to come to the open freezer to help him carry stuff (Even though I was younger, I was by far much bigger and taller than them so yeah, I did most of the carrying).

I tell him I'm just putting plastic film and I'll be just there. The thing is the first guy keeps telling me to redo it cos I hadn't done it properly so I get nervous cos I want to go help out the first which makes me fuck things up even more. But eventually I'm done and I run to the other guy to help him out, who's know upset cos he had to do quite a bit without me.

Anyway, I finish with that and then I remember my Financiers so I run to the oven but my colleague had already taken care of it and starts saying, ""Oh no they're burned! ACuriousFrenchie!"" so I freak out but he laughs and tells me they're perfect. I laugh nervously, still unwell, and I'm not proud of this, but I jokingly tell him, ""Oh fuck you haha"". Instant regret it cos his smile immediately disappears, but he doesn't say anything and just leaves.

Meanwhile, the head chef had arrived and was working in his office. I do my usual job, actually helping with a wedding cake which was a lot of fun (I think one of my colleague realized I needed some time off), and the rest of the day was fine.

The following day, however, I get call in maybe 2 hours into my shift by the head pastry chef. By then, I had only said ""hi"" to him and talked a bit once so yeah, great second impression. He started berating me about how intolerable it is that I disrespected my superior like that and that had he done the same to his superior when he was in my position, he would have been absolutely destroyed and on and on and then he tells me that I'm ruining the mood of the kitchen because I look upset and that he had told my team  I just needed time to get used to it but that I needed to get my shit together. And I'm just there sucking it in, not saying anything and absolutely hating myself. Feeling like a proper failure. 

I say I'm sorry and that I will get my shit together, and I appreciate him vouching for me. Then I get back to work, work for ten minutes and just take a break to go to the toilet. That was the first time since I had started working that I had taken any break, even to go to the toilet (I would hold until I got back home) cos I was just too intimidated. But yeah, I just went to the toilet and started crying as quietly as possible.

After a good ten minute of pathetic crying, I felt much better and actually had a decent day. By the end, I went to the head pastry chef and told him I thought I should quit because I wasn't contributing much but mostly, I was taking the place of some guy who needed this much more than me. He accepted and I just left.

And while I told myself I quit because I didn't deserve the opportunity and should leave my place to an apprentice who did, I always felt it was because I was too weak to handle it. It really made me feel worthless but mostly, spoiled as fuck. I also felt bad because I tarnished my mother's reputation since she got me the job; she didn't mind because she thought I was overworked, but I minded. Finally, it felt that the week was unusually hard because of the Event contract, and that I had basically left just before it got easier.

The experience really put me off baking for anything other myself and friends, which is a shame because I really love it. Is it like that everywhere? Reading this sub, it seems like. Was it just my age? I feel like I would have done much better and finished the internship had I been 18 since I had much more work experience by then, and that always upset me because it felt like a ruined opportunity. A great one nonetheless. Mostly, how much of an asshole was I?"
9ydn91,3,2018-11-19,I really need to vent about my roommate,legit_snack,TrueOffMyChest,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/9ydn91/i_really_need_to_vent_about_my_roommate/,"My roomie was once my bff. She is not a good listener at all. When she goes on dates all she does is talk about herself and all the amazing adventures she goes on. She doesn’t ask me or the other person about themselves or how they feel. She always has to be in a relationship - she can’t stand being single. She thinks that any guy who looks at her or talks to her likes her. Every conversation she has with me revolves around talking about a guy hitting on her. She pressures me to lose my virginity in a month. She thinks that in her relationship with her boyfriend, if either she or her bf were to cheat, it would be her. Whenever she sees me wear a cute outfit, she has to get the same outfit. She tries to be the best dressed and cares about attracting guys by dressing “sexy”.   
On her birthday I got her an amazing bday present. Bought a gorgeous blouse and filled the gift bag with candies and chocolates and wrote her a thoughtful and long card. She loved it.  
On my birthday, I just got cheap sunglasses from forever 21 and a cheap t shirt. No handwritten card. No thought.  
The other night she quit her job at Wendy’s bc her manager sucks and she was telling me about it and I felt sad about the way she was being treated. She told me she hates taking crap from others and I was like “don’t we all?” And she was like “yeah I can’t take crap from others and the only people I can give crap to are the people I care about. Like my bf, my parents, or you” I was like “you give me crap?” And she was like “yeah I give you crap like when I can’t get something for our apartment then I tell you to get it”  
Then she got a phone call from one of her co workers at Wendy’s and they were talking about how she quit the job. She didn’t know who’s number is it but I heard that the coworkers wanted to keep in touch with her and for her to text each other. She was like “omg she’s like the sweetest person ever she texted me asking to keep in touch”  
I felt sad hearing  this because I remember I used to wait 5 hours for her to get out of her last class so we could go home together, how i would listen to her talk about her guy problems and her self esteem problems, how I would give her uplifting and encouraging advice, and I genuinely cared about her happiness. But with all the shit I told you about earlier (how our conversations turned out to be her talking all the time, talking about her dates and all the guys she’s into, how she stopped listening to me), it makes me feel like I’m not valued or good enough at all. I want to be a best friend but I guess I never was, or she doesn’t value me for the friend I am.   
Another day I came into the living room and my roommate was telling her 16 year old sister to drink wine and her sis kept on saying no. Then I said to her “don’t pressure her to drink if she doesn’t want to. She’s only 16” and my roomie was like “well she will drink anyways so why not start now?” (She comes from a Muslim family where drinking isn’t allowed) And me and the sister were so mad. Then my roommate got mad at me for “interfering” and I was like “I just came to the living room to say hi to you and then I saw this” And she gave me attitude for that   
Another day  I told her about something great happening to me... I found someone who could get me an internship... then she said “oh maybe I can work there too” even though I worked hard for it   
I have dated a guy who knows my roommate - he revealed to me that everyone at my roommate’s workplace doesn’t like her. She bullshits about everyone, especially girls who are prettier than her, saying that this girl is a “b\*tch’, that guys flirts with everyone, etc. She told the guy not to talk to me (when she brought him home to meet all of the roommates) because I apparently use my looks to get free things from guys, that I’m a party girl, that I date a lot, and a lot of other mean things about me that aren’t true at all. I don’t use my looks for money at all. I have a job and the only financial help I get outside of that would be financial aide and my parents. I don’t party a lot since I’m busy. And I don’t date a lot too. My date knows that I’m a really cool person, and he could sense that my roommate is “crazy jealous” of me. She is spreading rumors about me

All of a sudden, she wants to hangout more with my REAL best friend (RBFF), the one who was truly there for me. My roomie told me today that she wants to hangout with my RBFF. I kind of don’t want her to hangout with my RBBF, but my RBBF told me she doesn’t like her anymore from all these things I mentioned on my post."

I have never felt anything for a girl this young before. Trust me, I am just as disgusted with myself as you guys probably are. I've always dated women my age, with my last long-term relationship ending last spring with a girl who was in my year. Since then, I haven't been actively searching for any relationships due to stress and lack of time).


The girl, who is a second-year undergrad, started interning at the lab I work at around three months ago. Another guy, who sits next to me, was assigned as her mentor. The guy who sits next to me actually really did not want to take on an intern, but our PI insisted she go with him since her research interests aligned best with his. For the first month, he mostly left her at his desk making her do busywork while he did his own research. I do most of my work at my desk so I ended up helping her out a lot with understanding papers, figuring out certain softwares, etc. We also just chatted a lot about random things. She's very outgoing/talkative so she'd always start conversations and ask a lot of questions. She's also very sweet and intelligent so I liked talking with her.


This went on for about 2-3 weeks. Then one day, she asked where I got my food and I told her there was this place by campus that sells really cheap sandwiches and salads. She seemed really interested and asked if we could go together sometime. Me, being a dumbass, saw no harm in that at the moment and agreed. At that point, everything was purely platonic and I had zero interest in her.


Then us going out to lunch somehow turned into a weekly occurence. The more we talked and spent time together, the more I caught myself thinking that she's quite perfect and very pretty. I started looking forward to having lunch with her and I turned on the charm a bit. Then it hit me how disgusting I was being one night and I was literally horrified. I could not even sleep that night. I came to work the next day and immediately told her that I thought it was best if we did not have lunch with each other everyday since it was affecting my work a bit. She seemed really confused and looked quite hurt. I told her it wasn't her and it was just that I needed to focus more of my time on my research. It was true, I was taking much longer lunch breaks. Plus, I usually eat at my desk while looking over some notes.
It's been about another month and my feelings have only gotten worse. I can't avoid them and the more I see her, the worse they get. She's started doing more benchwork so I see her less, but she always tries to talk to me a lot and still asks me questions so it's hard to avoid her.


I'm at a loss right now. I went on dates with two girls in the past month and I wasn't interested in either. I kept wishing it was her instead of them which just makes me even more disgusted at myself.
How do I stop liking this girl without quitting my job? This is actually completely fucking with my brain and distracting me. The worst part is, she likes me back.


TL;DR: Became friends with an undergrad who recently started working at the same place as me. We started having lunch together whenever we could and I stared developing feelings for her that have since gotten worse. How do I end these feelings now?

Nobody could have prepared me for this.

I'm a second year computer science major. I really like writing code and working on my own little projects. I enjoy a lot of the classes I've been taking, even the ones that people *hate*. I do really well in classes because I just enjoy the material and eagerly start new assignments and think about them in my free time.

That's where the good stuff ends.

Tomorrow morning I'll be signing up for classes for next quarter. There are currently 0 open seats in any CS class I can take. There are waitlists that don't open up for another few weeks.

I don't know what to *do*. I can't even enroll in anything. I haven't even gotten a chance to enroll and everything's already full. Sure, there are wait lists... but wait listing is tons of extra stress. What if I don't get in? I'm pretty much just fucked if I don't. What if I don't get into ANY relevant major classes? Then I'm stuck taking irrelevant classes. I'd honestly rather drop out for a quarter than have my parents pay $13,000 for me to take 3 GE classes. It's a fantasy, though, I'd never be able to drop because I'd lose financial aid, and I'd lose priority and I'd be even more fucked the next quarter.

This makes me really deeply reconsider my major. Sure, I love learning CS. But I had an internship a few years ago and I HATED it. I have been thinking a lot lately about how I just want to drop out of college, get a retail or food service job, and just code as a hobby. 

Would I be happier that way? I have a friend who grew up in an area where college wasn't really expected of everyone. He has a job in retail, which doesn't sound amazing, but it's enough for him to live on. That honestly sounds like a nice way to live. I was never in CS for the money anyways... and the only dream I'd *really* be giving up is the dream of some day living alone.

I've considered transferring. My grades are pretty decent, but even if I had a 4.0 it would still be a long shot. And even then - I've been told that any college in California has this same issue.

I'm lost. I don't know what I'm going to do. I really only feel nothing but contempt right now. What did I do wrong? I just wish they had rejected me when I applied to this school. Fix the overcrowding problem. Fix the lack of housing problem. I'd rather be rejected than be put into this system. I hate this school. I hate that I'm the only one who seems to like these classes and yet I have nothing to show for it. I hate the education system. I hate the community I came from where going to a community college was seen as a *failure*... when really I wish I had gone to one and transferred into another school."

This was my first relationship and my ex who I shall call K broke things off. With my situation, my ex had been losing heart for the relationship  for a while as work, family and study commitments started to bear down  on her, to the point where she wasn't even thinking about our relationship or me anymore. After painfully making her aware of how unfair it was of her to still have me around and not even know if she  wants me anymore, we took a brief break. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Background**

I was adamant of wanting to continue the relationship, also because  it was my first so I was much more reluctant to part with it. K wasn't. Her feelings for me had diminished and she thought we were too  different and incompatible - along with some concerns relating to my  personality which I had previously been trying to work on (like my  jealousy at her successes). After much tears on my end and in  bitterness, I broke things off. That hurt her more than she thought and I  painfully reminded her that I'm only giving up because she isn't putting in the effort anymore. I clearly did not want to make that decision of breaking things off but we'd be wasting both our time if I dragged it out. So I still left a chance on the table if she wants it  and truly believes the relationship is a valuable addition to her life.  That same night she decided that we can give it another go, starting  fresh, and we see how it is after a month. After that we can say we really tried.

​

I would be lying if I said that month passed without issue. I was still enjoying it, but the underlying issues of the relationship were  not addressed. I really wanted to show her that I'm not harbouring the unhealthy envy from before - but one of the repeat concerns of the relationship which I sorely regret not communicating because I was so shaken and scared by it - was that she didn't enjoy the sex and was fearful that whenever we were in private I was always expecting or wanting sexual acts to happen. It got to the point where I was so scared to escalate things in the bedroom, even if K were to initiate things for example by pulling me in for a kiss because I would be caught so off guard. But I was also afraid that if I brought these up I would loseK. Also, I did see some improvement in the time she was giving me so I told myself not to stress, she'll get things sorted on her end. Jokes on me because K broke up with me shortly after that month after feeling like  there was no longer a romantic connection. 

&amp;#x200B;

K lamented that she hasn't grown as much as she as with anyone else but we never had a chance toreally  be friends since we  jumped so quickly into dating. For that reason she dearly wished that we could remain friends, though emphasising I had no obligation to. I was somehow  able to control myself but the day after I was pleading for her to come  back when all the rough emotions set in. K was disheartened to see me unwell but all I did was just drive a rift further between us. I realised I  had to cut her off my life. She understood and wished me all the best.

​

**1st - 2nd month**

What follows is me reaching out in various capacities, to various reactions and just confusing and hurting both of us. She would be so happy that I'm seemingly talking to her like normal again only for me to regret it when I told her we shouldn't be talking so I screwed up there for example. Though we did make  it clear to each other that we still mean a lot in each other's lives and K expressed that she was willing to help and support me despite our separation. 

&amp;#x200B;

About a week or so after our split I was seeing a counsellor and talked with her beforehand. I declared I wanted to be friends because I knew getting back together wasn't possible and figured that we both good people who could back each other up despite our history. She was moved and joyous to hear it but also  mentioned that nothing she does is set in stone and that there's no telling what the future holds. I tried not to think on that too much.

​

She dropped me off a birthday letter and present shortly after when were both at work. It was a heartfelt letter saying how grateful she was for the relationship, thanking me for being such a dedicated partner, and that she missed me dearly and hoped we could connect in the near future. After that was a month of no-contact.

​

I worked on myself, continued exercising as I always had, and managed  to get an internship. However I was also researching  how-to-get-your-ex-back guides which certainly held me back. After a  month I caved in under an emotional relapse and reached out to her. I thought she would've received me with open arms but she wasn't as warm  and welcoming as I expected. She was excited to hear about my internship but it overall sounded very neutral over the phone. After that brief interaction I felt  like the initial wave of the BU happened again. I've feverishly looked into personal development even more and am  trying my best to temper the fundamentals of my conciousness and mind. I  feel happy definitely, and can look on myself with pride on how I've  bounced from this. However the invasive thoughts are still there. 

&amp;#x200B;

**2nd - 3rd (current) month**

Sometime later I send her a friend request on facebook after I deleted her during the NC period and she accepts after a few days. Just a few days ago I decided I'd reach out to K once more - saying that it was a while since we spoke and I would like the chance to have a few game, which she was up for but couldn't do it tonight. A few days later when we managed to play she wasn't at all talkative. I told K that it was nice to play with her again and hoped she enjoyed it. K's response was only a ""yeah you too! :)"" and logged off immediately after. 

&amp;#x200B;

Normally I'd just drop it and move on but I still have some residual feelings for K. I would love to at least speak to her for another shot at the relationship now that I've had the time to properly gain insights and perspective into what was wrong. Of course I also recognise that with the current circumstances my chances are pretty low so I'm kind of assuming the worst. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am also sensitive to the fact that maybe me reappearing in her life has caused some confusion emotionally or something. I was thinking of giving it some space - it's been about 2 day since our last interaction so a day or two more I think is ideal just so it doesn't feel like it's happening all at once for her. But really, I think being direct and using what control I have of the situation to at least reach out for a talk and if she still wants the same thing as before is also an appealing course of action. I'm pretty optimistic about what's going on for me in life so what do I have to lose, really. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you've read the whole thing I really appreciate it. Love to know people's thoughts on this and similar experiences, if any.

9yg6pt,3,2018-11-19,I Spent Years studying engineering and now I don't feel comfortable in my job,orangists100,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/9yg6pt/i_spent_years_studying_engineering_and_now_i_dont/,"I went to undergrad at a fairly well known state school and spent almost all of my time studying, neglecting many other things like my social life and my health. I worked very hard and did four different internships before graduating in only 7 semesters. I definitely felt satisfaction about what I was studying but I also acknowledged what I was doing was a means to an end at the time, that being getting a fulfilling job in my field. I really didn't do much else other than schoolwork to be honest. Didn't really engage in that many extracurriculars, didn't date at all, didn't get too involved with friends. I graduated Summa Cum Laude from my institution and I got accepted to every grad school I applied to. 

&amp;#x200B;

Rather than going to the one that was the most well known in my field (Civil Engineering), I went to an Ivy League School as it was something I had dreamed of doing when I was in high school. I ended up doing a rather pricy one year accelerated program rather than staying at a renowned-within-the-field state school that would have given me a funded research position but a longer and more fruitful period of study. While my decision actually wasn't that financially devastating (due to me being able to make money this year rather than live on a stipend for two) I ended up not getting a lot out of my grad school experience (I was also fairly depressed an un-engaged that year). I have gone from being in the top of my class to being fairly mediocre in what I studied compared to my peers who have additional study in structural engineering. I was never sure whether I wanted to focus on transportation/traffic engineering or structural, but I followed my adviser's advice and went with the one that was more versatile, which was structures.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a job now at a big company that required me to move to a different state across the country. I don't know a single soul here. I went into a very specific subset of structural engineering, which is bridge engineering. I did not take a lot of seismic coursework nor did I take anything on bridges, and even the most fundamental structural classes are only intermediate level. I tell this to people who get concerned, but truthfully there is nothing unsafe about this - you have to thoroughly prove each and every thing in your bridge works with equations and models, which is rigorously checked both internally and externally. However, it does make my job very challenging for me. I am not familiar with much of the code or the procedure. I spend hours a day reading manuals only to get no useful information out of them. There was no orientation period, they assigned me to a project day 1, and I am the sole designer of my project. It is expected that I will ask for help if and or when I need it. I ask questions to some of the senior engineers, some of which have casually berated me for not understanding a simple concept, particularly since I came from an ""elite university"". Often times too, the senior engineers offer contradictory advice on how to do things, which makes my interpretation of my job that much more challenging. We don't have too much work to do, I've never felt pressured by time. But in a way, that has made things worse. I have a blank template, a sandbox, and I am expected to know how to get from Point A to Point B in a matter of months with very little help or support.

&amp;#x200B;

The few times I get a simpler albeit mundane task, like updating an excel spreadsheet, answering emails, or going to a meeting, I breathe a sigh of relief as it is one of the few times I don't have to endure hours of mental torment and struggle. Worst yet is most of my colleagues are workaholics, including the new hires I came in with. They are all married. As far as I am aware, none of them drink or go out or really do much outside of the office to be honest (one of my Chinese coworkers had never tried Mediterranean, Middle Eastern, OR Mexican food and we live in California). I know for a fact many of them are in for 10+ hours a day. I just long for 5 PM every day, and I don't take a lunch break because it means I get to leave that much sooner. However, every day, I go home and have nothing to do. I hang out every night with on Discord with a bunch of underachieving more-than-casually-racist people who I don't even like. I don't know anyone here and I never have any energy to do anything because I stay up late every night. I suspect the reason I stay up late is because I am subconsciously procrastinating going to work; even though I can't change the time I go in, I can change the conscious time I have before I have to go in. However, this creates a cruel cycle of hating work that much more due to being fatigued. I am afraid what I am doing is completely unsustainable and I will be utterly burned out or lost within the next one to two months. I just don't know what to do. A car speeding through a red light almost hit me the other day and I thought for a split second about how great it would be to spend a month in the hospital rather than going into the office."
9yh5n0,1,2018-11-19,I’m so thankful for my pdoc’s medical assistant,TheHQOverlord,bipolar,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/9yh5n0/im_so_thankful_for_my_pdocs_medical_assistant/,"During my final year of college I suddenly was crying all the time and could not get off the couch for multiple days. I’m a very anxious student and I always go to every class and beat myself up if I don’t get A’s so I quickly scheduled an appointment with my doctor’s office. 

My pdoc was busy so I saw his medical assistant instead. She put me on an antidepressant and said to come back in a month. Within the first couple weeks I was sooo irritable and would snap at people out of nowhere along with random bursts of crying so I went back and was given another antidepressant. 

This time I thought it worked. I was so happy and energized for the first time in so long. I didn’t even need sleep! I was up 72 hours and my supervisor at my internship pulled me aside and was genuinely worried about my erratic behavior. So i went back to the doctor. 

She then decided it was bipolar disorder and put me on a mode stabilizer. It worked! I began having a better control on how I processed things and my actions. 

While it’s been a couple years and I’m back to feeling the crazy ups and downs due to stopping my meds against psychiatrist and therapist advice and restating after quitting my job and going through months long severe depression, I am so thankful that from the time I went for help to the time I got a proper diagnosis was only a few short months where I’ve seen people on here go years."
9yhpho,4,2018-11-19,Need some juridical advice,Symfuru,belgium,https://www.reddit.com/r/belgium/comments/9yhpho/need_some_juridical_advice/,"Hello,

First times I'm posting a story of my own in Reddit.

I'm 22 year old and I had my first work experience, i worked 1 year for this company, I worked really hard, was really motivated, never miss a day or be late.

I had a 6 month Paid internship (it's half a base salary, it's not that bad to start of), after that they wanted to keep me so they offered a FPIE contract, 6 month internship with 80% to 100% of a base salary and at the end they are obligated to engage me as full time job for at least 6 month.

It's a family company, run by the father and his 2 sons are manager, they have really easy job, they start whenever they want, they go to gym, go to restaurant, etc while I do most of the work.

I didn't really mind, I liked the job and liked to be busy.

My 6 month stage just finished and they told me they have to save some money since they didn't do as well as last year.

So they will not give me at least 6 month of contract, which is obligated, and Brussels Formation also insisted that they respect the contract.

They tried the loophole saying that I didn't had the skills for the job which is obviously false and Brussels denied their request and told them they on the violation of contract

The thing is they took another internship last month, who was little by little taking over my task...

So now I will go to court of work, as suggested by Brussels, but I have no experience on the matter. 

Anybody have some advice or had the same situation?

I'm a bit worried to go on court vs a Company  and to lose all my hard earned savings. "

### The Trump White House reportedly notified Jim Acosta they plan to ban his once again once the 14-day court ordered restraining order expires.

### Acosta was blocked from his White House hard pass after his many interruptions and rude contact at White House pressers including his latest stunt where he took a swipe at a young female intern.

[Vice News](https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/kzvbzx/white-house-ban-cnn-jim-acosta) reported:

**The White House is not backing down over Jim Acosta’s press pass, and plans to ban the reporter again once the current 14-day restraining order expires**, CNN said Sunday.

Acosta, CNN’s chief White House correspondent, had his credentials suspended by the administration last week after a heated press conference.

A judge ordered the White House to temporarily restore the press pass Friday while he weighed the case.

**The White House complied but has since written to Acosta, saying his pass will be suspended again once the judge’s order expires,** CNN’s chief media correspondent Brian Stelter reported in his newsletter Sunday night.

The network said in a statement that the White House was “continuing to violate the First and Fifth Amendments of the Constitution.”

“These actions threaten all journalists and news organizations. Jim Acosta and CNN will continue to report the news about the White House and the President.”

I have been recently reading a lot of Quora posts specifically on the Canadian Immigration system. 

A lot of these posts says that Canadian job pool has it's like 7 tiers, where the last tier are people with WH visa and that they rarely get a desired job because of this policy.

A lot of them as well are stating that Canada is kind of profiting with the immigrants in ways that a lot of educated and skilled people come there in hope of better life, and only what they get is some manual labor job or something similar.

Now I am close to getting an internship and hopefully a job in a company, and generally I will continue my life in that career. I am 25 and want to come to Canada in about 2-3 years either via YP or WH depending on which visa will be easier to obtain, and after I gather some experience. 

What are the chances that this is going to happen in then IT industry, specifically a software development?"

Basically, we live on the east coast and I'll be doing an internship over the summer on the west coast. She miiiight visit once if she's able to and then we will probably have a week or two before school starts together.

After that, she is going to Europe to study abroad for a semester. I miiight be able to visit her once.

I basically want to know what advice you guys have, and what boundaries we should put in place in our time apart. I trust my girlfriend, but this subreddit scares me sometimes. I was just reading about a story where the dude's gf is studying abroad and hangs out with this guy all the time to grab lunch or to go drink etc and is basically dating the kid but claiming they aren't a thing. At the moment my girlfriend wouldn't do that, but I'm worried she'll miss the emotional support I give her and how she is a really nice person that has trouble with telling people no.

TL;DR - ill have an internship in summer followed by her studying abroad, so 6 months LDR. any advice on how to prepare / set boundaries?"

Hello everyone!

First time posting on this subreddit so bear with me.

Here's my backstory: I'm a freshly graduated medicine doctor, about to start working in say... a week or so. Medicine never interested me THAT much. I mean, I had a certain interest in it when i finished high school, didn't know which faculty to attend, so I chose med school. I'm not discontented for going to med school. I learned some valuable life lessons and I would probably do it the same all over again.

Back when I was a kid, I used to draw a lot. For a kid, I did pretty good in my opinion. Videogames also had a high impact in my life. I was in front of my PC all the time, playing Warcraft, Baldurs gate... well, all kinds of games, actually. I often drew my own little stories and comics, creating all sorts of characters and their backstories and imagined making my own game one day,. I even made some pen and paper/board games back in the day! I also learned how to play the guitar, and was in a band briefly. Never learned to play it as I really wanted, but more about that later.

Around my 3rd-4th year of med school, my artsy nature revealed itself again. I started dabbling around in digital art, also started learning some 3d modeling and animation, which really piqued my interest, started learning some game development stuff like game engines... I was all over the place. Every little thing regarding gamedev, from writing the scenario, doing the soundtrack to concept art and game models was interesting and fun to me, and I could see myself doing it for a living. I remember my gf often thought it was a phase, and I'd get over it after the semester passes, but my interest only rose, to the point where I want to do art and/or videogame development for a living.

When I passed my last exam in July, I made a promise to myself to use the summer holidays to really do something useful. I started jogging every morning, started lifting weights (cause on top of it all, I also want to look good xD), drawing every day along some drawing books, did digital sculpting exercises in blender3D every day... and it went pretty good for awhile. Soon, my dissertation stuff came and I was busy with it, but I still jogged at least. Then, I graduated and came home for good. In the meantime I also obtained another instrument, an accordion, and have decided to learn how to play it along with perfecting my guitar skills on top of already drawing and 3Dmodeling every day. Also, I decided to start the Insanity fitness program instead of jogging, to burn some of that extra belly fat.

This is where things started to get a bit messy. I divided my day, and decided to do, each day, a drawing or two, a digital sculpt, play the guitar for at least an hour and learn to play the accordion. I also had my Insanity sessions in the late afternoon, and I wanted to maintain some sort of a social life. Besides that, I also wanted some free time to play videogames, since they bring me joy and relaxation. Unfortunately, I burned out and couldn't find the willpower to do it all in one day. I did one or two things tops (along Insanity, I never missed that). After a long chat with my girlfriend she advised me to pick something and just practice that ONE thing till I become really, really good, and then move on to the other one. I enrolled in a CGMA course for Art foundations (40 weeks) and am now drawing every day and doing Insanity. Although, my accordion and guitar (which I sometimes play, just usual things that I know) are still here, and I gotta say, I miss playing them, and I miss blender3D. I'm thinking of maybe trying to incorporate it again into my schedule.

Until now, I had all the time in the world for everything I wanted to do, and it was awesome. These holidays were among the best times of my life. I had a blast, really. But now, I'm soon going to work every day for 8 hours straight. My girlfriend is still on college and we're long distance at the moment, and will be for the next 2 years (with seeing each other on every other weekend etc. That's the one thing I don't worry about, I just know it will work :) ). I want to USE that time efficiently, and brush my skills cause frankly, I don't intend to be a doctor my whole life. My plan was to do my internship, pick a specialization, finish its 5 years and then work the next 5 years as a specialist (so 10 years basically) which I have to, since it's part of the contract and then, if I can financially support myself from my freelance art business/gamedev work I would like to quit my job and pursue a career in game development. If not, I can live a happy life as a doctor as well. But I need to know that I tried at least.

If you made it till here, firstly, thanks a lot for the read :)

So, what I want is to make some sort of a plan for my life. I would very much like to incorporate 3D modeling and the guitar and accordion alongside drawing if it works, and have some time for myself to play videogames, or maybe also relax with a book or go for a walk or so. I plan on having workout as a part of my daily ritual as well.

Basically, how I see it, we only get one life to live. I want to live it to the fullest, being happy, and doing things I enjoy for a living, creating worlds and stories, filling them up with life and music, and sharing with others to enjoy. I really hope you guys can help me.

Cheers!

9yk2hw,1,2018-11-19,I dont like anyone,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/9yk2hw/i_dont_like_anyone/,"Hello, before you read this its' going to be very long and probably off topic. I'm going to be as honest as I can. I really want someone to understand me. Before you say just break up with her, I believe I actually do love her (i think). The thought of being with her forever does scare me, but it scares me to be with anyone forever. I love living alone, I feel like a child. I don't like any of my friends either. I don't live with all of the basically. I have one other friend that I used to highly respect, but my opinion is changing.

&amp;#x200B;

Me:

I'm very introverted and I have bad social anxiety. Being alone is when I feel the most comfortable. The reason I don't like it is because I feel like I'm being judge by friends, family, etc. I feel weird when they are all hanging out or something, but I would rather be alone. I like going out like every other weekend for about three hours, but people don't like that and don't want to be friends with you anymore. I'm scared one day they will all get married and just judge me that I'm not. The main reason's I wanted a relationship was to have someone care about me so much (but I learned I don't like it) and so I could tell people I do.

I was popular growing up, I got more social anxiety as grew up. Like I don't know why people liked me, I guess I was nice and didn't judge people. I acted kind of wild too. In high school I was pretty popular, but I was still scared to talk in front of the class. I was the only one to freeze up and didn't make sense, people told me. I actually really liked high school. People were nice to me and I was nice to them, but the best part was living at home. I had all my time to me. I could talk to my parents when I wanted to, but they left me alone when I didn't want to.

My immediate family is very diverse too. I'm the youngest by a lot. My oldest sister is 16 years older. My mom was married once before my dad. So I have two half sisters, a brother, and a sister. One sister is a doctor, another works for my mom, another is a social worker, and my brother recently became a sex offender. He has terrible mental problems. He had took special classes at school. My father is a farmer and my other is veterinarian. My mom works all the time and my dad is always outside.

One thing that really messed me up was liking a girl too much in high school. I would have done anything for this girl. I paid for her speeding tickets and even basically gave her a car for nothing. Anyway this girl invited me to a party. I just turned 16. I never drank before or anything. I got my license the day of the party and went to it. I got very drunk and cried the whole time. I was kinda mean to everyone but I did like it, because I felt like I could be myself. Then I started drinking very heavily at 16. And I was a good quiet kid everyone thought. I was an honor student and I respected my teachers. But then I started drinking and driving my dirt bike. I did it for a months. I hosted a party once, I invited the girl I liked. I told her I liked her before the party and she just said I never tried to make a move on her so she didn't know that. Well that night I kept talking to her and touching her, but she told me to get off and then later was making out with another guy. When then I got sad again and ended up pissing everyone off. Well later on she invited me to anther party, but instead of riding with me she just told me to come to it. I ended up buying her alcohol too. That night I drove my dirt bike drunk again and this time got pulled over. Instead of stopping I ran though. But eventually stopped long enough to get tasered by the police. I had to do community service I was kicked out of sports. Everyone asked what happened to me, I used to be so good and now look at me. But that some how faded and I was treated the same. But I changed a lot after that. I was put on probation and had to be home by 8pm. I never liked talking about what happened but people would always ask me. I was alone most of the time and just did push ups and sit ups in my room (like 1000 a day each). Then when ever my probation ended I still stayed home a lot. I didn't drink for a long time.

I didn't have a lot of relationships in high school. I was very horny though. Oh yeah that girl I really liked, I paid her to have sex with me.. I liked her so much. I told myself if I ever got the chance I would to anything to have sex with her. I also thought I would die a virgin and be alone forever. Then everyone found out. Nothing really happened though, it was just really embarrassing that I did that and I lost my virginity that way. I did go on dates somethings and had a few hookups. But whenever a girl would want to date me and I just couldn't do it. My friends would say she's not pretty or something and then I could never date them. But I also didn't like running on someone else's schedule. I had routine that I loved. I would program a lot and dating someone took time away from that. One girl I was about to have sex with her clothes off and everything. I just said look I can't date you and said I can't do this. I liked her but I just didn't want to be tied down. Then girls i didn't care about I would hookup with them. And others would just stop talking to me.

In college I haven't made any friends after 3 years. My first semester I did the best in my classes. I didn't party or anything. I was on the cross country team but quit because I didn't have any friends on the team. I barely talked, they said I was quiet. But i never talked because I didn't really know what to say. It's not that I'm holding anything back, I just don't know what to say. It was hard telling the coach I quit. He let me on the varsity team as a freshman. My second semester I partied every weekend. I was happy though I finally had my own room. I did see some cross country people at a party and talked to them, and they said that's the first time they heard me talk. When I'm drunk I can actually talk to people. After that semester I only partied once a semester. I became super strict again. Anyway, all my friends are all from high school. I barely talk to anyone else. I mean I don't, unless I have to. And i just don't know what to say. Like in my classes I've always felt so lost. Like I feel like a I'm stupid. I don't know how to study and I don't understand what I'm reading. I'm a computer science major and I get C's in all my classes. My parents are even paying for all my schooling.. I've had an internship and they want me to work there. Even there I feel weird. I barely talk and they point it out. All the other interns talk to each other and talk to the employees. I just talked to my boss and my face turns red when talking to anyone else. I felt stressed whenever I was talked to. I mumble bad, I'm quiet, I have a very small vocabulary ( so I can't understand a lot of people), and I can't think whenever someone is talking. I usually just say yes or no.

&amp;#x200B;

My girlfriend:

I've been dating my girlfriend for 1.5 years. She is great. She is beautiful, funny, smart, and everything I was looking for. She's my first real girlfriend. We live 2 hours apart, but see each other every weekend and talk about an hour on the phone every night. Most nights I would say I don't want to talk to her. Usually I just have to listen and say yes. I don't really care about talking about my day, I never have. I tell her this. If I do have anything to say, it usually turns around to her talking for 30 minutes straight again.

We have lived together before. About 2 months after we first started dating she moved in with me while I was on an internship. I told her I didn't want her to move in with me, but she convinced me. It went better than expected, but it was still not ideal. Whenever I live with someone, there is like a small pain in my head that makes me have to control what I do. I don't like people asking me why I'm doing something. Or having to tell them when I'm about to do anything. When I spend the weekend with her. I sleep a lot more and feel more tired.

Also I don't like going to her family events. I don't like going to mind either, but she is very close to her family and we spend a lot of time there. Her brother is nice to me, but also says I never talk. Especially at the family events. Once I got drunk at her mom's house and then I started acting stupid. But him and his girlfriend was there. She said that's the first time she ever heard me talk and asked why I never talked. She said I usually just mumble something or say yes/no. When I was drunk I just joked with her. But the next day it kinda hurt. Because usually when I talk in front of them my face turns yet and try to get the attention off me.

But anyway when my girlfriend wants to go places, I tell her I don't really want to. Like she wants to travel and I do too, but for some reason I don't want to with her. She wants to go to my sister's house out of state, I like going there. But I don't think it when she's there. I feel embarrassed or something with my girlfriend (not of her). I have no idea I just like going alone. It's terrible for my girlfriend I know.

My girlfriend also wants to get married and have kids. But I don't really want kids or marriage. She's religious and I'm not. I want to change for her and I would. But I know I won't like it. But I know she's great and if I broke up with her I would want her back. The grass is always greener on the other side. I love just hanging out with her, watching movies and stuff. But I just can't image having to spend 24/7 with her.

I know I would feel this way with any partner. Like I don't want to see someone everyday after work. Have to sleep with them and share my stuff with them. I think I shouldn't be a relationship. I romanticize it in my head, but I don't like it in person.

&amp;#x200B;

My Friends:

They are all fine people I suppose. There are four that I'm closest to. 1&amp;2 of them are pretty normal, I feel like they are too judging but I am weird. 3 is just a terrible person. The 4th is just becoming too strange for me. 1,2 want all of us to fail, besides theirselves. Like if were are trying to study they come in and try to get us to go out with them or something. They've said in person that they hope we fail our tests and stuff. Or me and friend 4 have money in the stock market. They tell me they hope friend 4 loses it all. I kinda fail the same way, but I don't act on my thoughts. I tell them to study even though it makes me happy for some weird messed up reason when the fail. But I make sure my actions help them in the long run.

Friend 3 is kinda a terrible person. Like he was engaged, cheated on his girlfriend, she forgave him and he continued to do it. He would steal bikes and give them to her. He sends snapchats of him having sex with girls. He's an attractive guy and gets a lot of girls. He lies all the time and then we find out. Sometimes he says he has a problem. But people that don't know him love him. But people that do hate him. He lied about going on a date with a 40 year old, she calls me just to say how much she hates him. He doesn't care at all though. He got a DUI continued to drive without a drivers license. He sent my girlfriend's mom a message on facebook. But in the end nothing happens to him. He got a summer pipeline job made $70k in one summer. He's good at making friends though. I respect him for this. He can travel alone some where and make friends with people. He does seem interested in other people's stories.

Friend 4 is probably my best friend, but lately I don't know. He's a year older. Has a career. Doesn't want to get married or anything, which I respect. I went to high school with him and he knows friend 3. Friend 4 is started to love friend 3 now though. Friend 1 and 2 hate friend 3, but continue to hang out with him. Friend 4 know's the bad stuff he's done, but I think he wants to get girls like him. Friend 4 has done a lot of drugs too. I was recently with him and he's so cocky now. Him and friend 4 were just trying to top each-other's stories. Friend 2 doesn't know friend 4, but thought he was a complete idiot and drugie. In front of people he will just talk about dropping LSD and doesn't listen to anything you say.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR

I don't really like anyone, outside of my family. I'm worried the problem is me. I'm uncomfortable spending lots of time with anyone, everything over 10 hours a week is too much."

My addiction to internet was just the tip of the iceberg, my to-the-go habit to escape whatever made me feel anxious.


Need to do some homework? I’ll just check this blog first.


Problems with my girlfriend? I’ll read some shit on reddit to get over it.

Feeling low and depressed? Yeah, there is probably a subreddit with a bunch of losers like myself who will make me feel better.


eeling stupid because I don’t understand something for college? Probably I can learn some un-useful shit somewhere on the web and I would feel less stupid.


The class is boring? Just pop out my cell phone and evade reality.


When my life suck, reading self help can make me feel that I’m almost there, really close to the success line.


Lacking motivation maybe?


Fuck no! in this year I got an awesome internship, that although it doesn’t pay well is good experience, and I got preselected for an international scholarship that could open dreamed opportunities.


I have friends, I have a girlfriend, I have hobbies, I even started therapy which I think that is moving me to the right path.


But no.


I failed once more again.


…


But I won’t fail anymore. Or at least I won’t evade the shit in the real world that makes me anxious with fucking blogs and useless reading.

I know I have been on here for some time now, it's been a long and hard road. Things at home are getting much worse, and I don't know how much more I can take. My relationship with my emom and ebrother are deteriorating greatly. I cannot keep up with my mother who needs constant attention and validation from me. Same with my older brother. My nfather who nags at me constantly, demands me to behave in certain ways, and expects me to keep the disgusting truth in the family a secret. It's awful.

I have one more year left of school until I have my bachelor's degree. I'm thinking of getting an internship so I can secure that I do find work right after I graduate. I don't want to spend months of looking for work and being financially burdened. But most of these internships are unpaid, and ask for college credit. This is because I'm a criminal justice/social justice major. I do need to earn some money this summer so I can buy myself food and pay for my car insurance.

My boyfriend who I have been dating for almost two years is offering for me to move in with him and cover for my rent up until I graduate college and have secured an actual job under my belt. Should I take the offer? I really do love him, and want to move in with him. But I would feel guilty not paying any rent. He works a full time job and makes about 50k a year. 

I am afraid that I don't have enough money at the moment since I only work part time about twenty hours a week. But at the same time, I don't know how much longer I can live here at home. It's a nightmare. I have time to think about this, yes. But I want to make a decision soon. 

TLDR: I'm not sure if I should move out now because of the financial burden. My boyfriend is offering to help cover rent, while I buy myself food, pay for my car insurance, Etc. until I find a real job after graduation. But I would feel guilty for not being able to contribute for rent. I don't know how much longer I can live at home, my mental health is significantly deteriorating because of it. "
9yk6nu,49,2018-11-19,The only way to win is not to play: observations on leetcode,cache2salt,ExperiencedDevs,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/9yk6nu/the_only_way_to_win_is_not_to_play_observations/,"I've just made it through the interview process for a couple FANG companies, and am negotiating offers. I don't come here to humblebrag but to talk about how my interview experiences have contrasted with the insane focus on leetcode in our sister sub cscareerquestions.

I have a fairly strong math background (in the sense I've taken most of the classes an undergraduate for engineering/cs/math would take) but I am not really that great at remembering off the top of my head when to use dynamic programming or things like depth first vs breadth first search. I certainly am no stranger to algos and I've been in interviews where floyd's cycle finding algorithm pops up or where I'm presented with a problem involving a maze and I know there's a thing called ""wall following"". In short despite very much enjoying math and puzzles I'm in no way a leetcode expert. I tend to struggle in that portion of the interview when I end up having to do something like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathfinding#Dijkstra's_algorithm or variations of the ""word ladder"" problem. In my last interview I literally couldn't remember breadth first vs depth first and ended up using depth first incorrectly before using breadth first.

And yet, I've never failed to get an offer for a Senior engineer based on my technical skills. Amazon (twice). Google. Twitter. etc. Why? Because it turns out that people really do value communication skills, and the ability to work a problem and iterate towards a solution. They want to see you diagram on the whiteboard and ask questions and try different approaches.

I think maybe if you are an amazon intern competing against hundreds of others the leetcode grind might be helpful. But for us on experienceddevs, it doesn't make sense to focus solely on that. If you already have experience you are doing yourself a disservice by going head to head with new grads on puzzle problems when you could be going way over their heads with actual real world architecture and scalability. I can tell people on how a built a small service that unlocked a business objective of moving to the cloud.

So how do you crack the experienced dev interview? Here's my experience:

1. Be comfortable coding. Be fluent in coding. If you can easily hack together things involving lists/vectors/dictionaries and maybe trees you're probably won't fail based on the coding portion.
2. As you code, talk alot about edge conditions: ""We could have an I/O error here. This datastructure could grow without bound. In the real world we'd want to survive process restarts so I'd handle the queue using $X"".
3. Be comfortable with basic high scalability architectural patterns. Read the dynamo paper. Spend some time learning about Cassandra and others. Learn about sharding/rings/partitioning for data storage. In some sense very little needs to exist beyond load balancers, stateless api servers, queue processing, and replicated storage. Understand when you need a RAFT/PAXOS system for leader elections and agreeing on some piece of state.
4. Talk about metrics and observability and operability. If you design a thing how do you know it's working? How do you know it's broken?
5. Be ready to talk to some generic leadership points. Have a couple projects ready to go to answer questions like: ""How did you influence others to do a thing? How did you build a concensus? How about a project where things went really wrong? Describe a technically challenging project and what you did to succeed""
6. (maybe not applicable for all) Stay fluent in some low level details. For instance I can really dive into conversations about UDP/TCP/HTTP/TLS because I do alot of CDN/edge work. People can sense I have technical depth (because I do) and am not just one of those people who specializes in armchair architecture and 10 level deep UML diagrams.

9ykbje,0,2018-11-19,Should I (23M) just give up in getting back with my ex girlfriend (22F)?,MrYondaime,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9ykbje/should_i_23m_just_give_up_in_getting_back_with_my/,"Ok, that's a long story. Me and my ex met while studying on an university on a different country than ours. I came to study in medical school and she was studying nursing. We're from the same nationality but from different parts of the country. Our relationship started with just a friendship, because I was dating someone else at the time, and she was such a fun girl that I feel in love with her (after I broke up the former relationship). We dated for almost a year, but she couldn't finish her studies because her mother got cancer. She had to leave the country and we tried a long distance relationship.

It was really hard though. She had depression and anxiety and we started fighting for really puny stuff. The fact that her mother had cancer and that she had a stepfather who was a piece of s\*\*t worsened the case. She couldn't find a good job and her stepfather started pressuring her. Also when I could meet her it wouldn't be for much time, because my parents (my father is a pastor) would say that it was ""dangerous"". Of course most of her bad mood was thrown in my back and the fights became even more frequent. She constantly tried to break up because she felt insecure and felt that i would dump her eventually so she wanted to ""do it now so it won't hurt as much later"". She almost forced me to break up since she didn't have the strength to do it. Still I understood that she was not in her normal state of mind, and knew the wonderful person she really was. We finally broke up, but then got back together some 2 months after. In total we'd been almost 4 years together, but of the 4 years 3 were in long distance.

In June of this year she sent me a message saying that we should break up. LDR took a real tool on her, and she felt bad every day. And even when I was there with her she would be thinking that I would soon leave. She was always really frank with her feelings and really wasn't afraid of saying something that would hurt me, so she told me that she had begun looking at some guys differently, and would like to break up before she does something stupid and make me a fool. This was the first time she didn't try to make me break up, so I know it was serious. And it ended there.

We still tried to talk a little, but I couldn't handle knowing that she was meeting other guys. One day she said that she left her charger ""somewhere"", and I knew it was in a dude's house. Then I did something shitty and entered her FB account (first time ever) and saw the conversations. I cried for the first time after breaking up. I apologized to her for entering her account and we agreed to not talk again. The thing is that we are such good friends that we end up talking again every time. I went there to see her and sex was really weird (she said that she didn't want to get attached again because I was just staying for two weeks). Since then sometimes she messages me or I message her and we talk for like 2 or 3 weeks before we start doing couple stuff again and we feel like we need to stop talking. I know that she's seeing other guys, and she says to me that she doesn't really like to talk to me because she feels like she's cheating on me even though we're not in a relationship anymore. She also says it feels bad that she talks to me but can't have me. It doesn't bother me that she is seeing other dudes, because I would do the same if I where her. But I still want to go see her when our classes end at the end of the year.

I'm down to my last two years of medical school, and i'll probably have to make my internship somewhere far from where I am now. Because of the fact that in six months I'll be far away, it's really hard to find someone who I'd want to have a serious relationship in my uni (I don't really like meaningless sex). I tried downloading tinder and i met a 18yo girl (with completely different hobbies as me) who I dated for a month and a half. The problem with tinder is that the city I live in is so tiny that girls are ashamed of using it, and the closest town is an hour away. When I mention where I live the conversation immediately dies.

The thing is I still think of getting back with her. Of course much of it has to do with my own insecurity of thinking that I will not be able to date anyone else (I'm not exactly that pleasant to the eyes). But also because she is such an incredible person (that I know still loves me), and that the only thing that is between us is the distance. Also she's much better now that she finished her studies, moved from her mother's house and is working at a hospital. I feel like I endured all the years of ""shittyness"" and now I can't enjoy the good times. I can still try to make my internship in the hospital where she works, but it's not a really good one, so maybe not a great idea. We are currently on a ""1 year without talking"" break (even though she sent me a video of herself drunk, singing how much she loves me just 3 days ago). But I still want to go see her in december, even though I'm really afraid of getting there and seeing her with someone else.

Sorry for the long story, hope you guys put some sense into my head.

### **The White House has fully restored CNN’s resident jackass Jim Acosta’s hard press pass, according to new reports.**

Fox News White House Correspondent John Roberts reported according to sources, the White House will not seek revocation of Jim Acosta’s hard pass.

If Jim Acosta refuses to follow the new rules, however, the White House reserves the right to revoke his hard pass in the future.

Acosta was blocked from his White House hard pass after his many interruptions and rude contact at White House pressers including his latest stunt where he took a swipe at a young female intern.

CNN and Jim Acosta filed a lawsuit against the Trump White House; a judge ruled in Acosta’s favor citing the CNN activist’s due process was violated.

Jim Acosta thanked everyone for their support in a tweet Monday afternoon.

Thanks to everybody for their support. As I said last Friday… let's get back to work.

9yl98q,1,2018-11-19,"Dating for 5 years, 2018 hasn't been good [22f/22m]",Owlattex3,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9yl98q/dating_for_5_years_2018_hasnt_been_good_22f22m/,"Hello Reddit, I'm rambling...

Insight: I'm a social person, I love to be adventurous, I love to take photography and play video games.   
Boyfriend: Hes antisocial, I've invited him to hang out with friends in person and online and hes extremely quiet. He refuses a lot of the time to go due to the people going (He isn't interested in meeting new people it seems.)  Hes comfortable with his best friend and his best friends friend and me and some of our highschool friends. He likes to play video games and has depression. 

My boyfriend and I have been together for 5 years. We dated on and off in high-school and then senior decided that we'll get back together and make a agreement to each other to try out best to make this work out.  We've over come some crazy stuff that I've dealt with and I own him big time for being supportive and trying to support me instead of just break up with me then and there.  2 years ago I was interested in my friend and I came out into the open about it. I explained to my boyfriend that I was interested in my friend and I informed my friend as well, well my friend told me that he wasn't interested in me and I explained that to my boyfriend and my boyfriend was obviously hurt from this. Things worked out though. 

Hes going to college and I'm currently working full time. We do long distance relationship because his school in in another part of the state. When we first started dating, I was super jealous and felt like i could lose him. Now I'm perfectly fine with it and when he comes home, I feel like I have to entertain him. He have to do something. Which always results to sex because we live in a small town and there isn't much to do between me working and living in a small town. 

He has recently started to bring up ""you haven't let me do this to you in a year"" he knows I don't like it and yet still bring sit up and I ignore it the best I can but it has bothered me and makes me not want to have sex with him anymore. I've brought up to him that if there is anything he doesn't like to do to me, that is fine and we can stop doing it but yet he says he enjoys it all. I dont want to not do anything for him for bring up a time in which the last time I've done something for him, but I feel like thats a huge red flag and it bothers the shit out of me. (it relates to sex, didn't think I need to go into detail)

My boyfriend has given me so many chances to ""fix"" myself and I felt like I've totally just haven't even tried. Hes forgiven me so many times, why would he do it again is my thinking. I feel like I need to break up just because I dont feel like I will change. I feel like I'll keep doing what I'm doing because I know I'll get away with it. I also feel like I dont have much to talk to him about anymore because we're different people at this time. I hate my job, he hasn't had to work and has loans to live off of unlike me, whos bought my car in full cash, worked since I was 16 and managed college at the same time.  I'm not hating on him but we were speaking of inters the other day and he said ""Its going to suck if I dont get paid"" Well, its going to suck, but you can't get experience without the inter. He also explained to him that its not that easy, college doesn't help with that, He'd have to find a company that does that sort of stuff. I dont know due to going to a college and only getting an associates degree.  I dont feel like he has the motivation to seek out a job or a internship, I feel like he think its going to fall into his lap or someone will do it for him due to his depression. 

His depression has been a huge thing for me and today he brought up that I've been using his depression and anxiety as an excuse for breaking up. I cannot fix it, yet he isn't trying to seek help because that involves people and medication and he refuses to do both those things. I've even tried to help him with like taking a walk everyday or hiking and it just isn't working. I can't help him if he isn't willing to work on himself, and the same goes for me, I can't fix my self and problems. if I wont work on myself. 

I've got problems as well, it takes two to tango:

So, I've got the issue of complaining. Complaining about work, complaining about not being able to beat a game, complaining this and that and this and that. I understand I have that problem. I only feel like I do it to him though. . . I dont do it any of my other friends because I have something to say to them and I can talk to him about anything and everything and they can relate unlike my boyfriend who has been sheltered and antisocial. I also apparently don't listen,  he gets angry at me when he tells me to do something in his way on a video game and I try to do it my own way. He recently has started to put ""Again, "" alot in his text messages as though hes told me before. There are a few things I'll rebring up due to not understanding or due to needing it to be clearer and starting a conversation. Its just one of my faults that I need to work on but I dont know that I can work on it because I feel like I do it with him due to how our relationship has been, 

I've texted a lot of my friends telling them that we might break up and they've asked me why and I've only had negativity things to say, I blame myself but it does take two to tango.. I dont consider him my best friend anymore because he doesn't understand nor gets it because he hasn't ever go through what I've gone through. I'm not his best friend either but I haven't ever been his best friend. 

I just don't know if I have good reasons to end it? I dont know if i break will make me rethink if the relationship is worth it. I dont know that I can handle his student loans when he finishes college and has to find a any time of job to pay those back for 15+ years... I'm 22 years old and feel like I've made myself trap. "
9ymcdm,8,2018-11-19,I feel like my remote location and lack of experience are making getting a job impossible. What kinds of things should I be looking for?,LetMeCodeForYou,cscareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareers/comments/9ymcdm/i_feel_like_my_remote_location_and_lack_of/,"Hey there. I graduated back in May 2018 and have had an incredibly hard time getting a job. To best explain my situation, I'll get some basic facts out of the way first:

* I have a BS in CS.
* I live in a super remote place - no neighbors or anything, just a trailer in the middle of farmland. The nearest city is Cincinnati OH, about an hour+ away.
* I have no programming experience outside of minor school projects. I've never worked in a team or had an internship or even properly used git. I've never done full stack development, just regular standalone programs. I learned some software engineering-related terms like Agile/Waterfall and general terms like PassByReference, but never implemented anything complex in practice.
* My hobby programming is limited to python scripts, game clones in C, UE4 Blueprints, RasPi IOT projects, and emulation/ROMhacking-related (dis)assembly. I think game development is cool, but mostly as a hobby - I don't think I'd enjoy trying to make a game where I'm not in control of everything, nor am I qualified to work as a game developer.
* I have access to a car, but:
 - It's a 96 Saturn in poor condition (flat tire, check engine lights, stuff like that.)
 - I don't know how to drive (never went to driving school, got my license at 18 and haven't driven much at all since) and have a fear of driving at on highways, merging, etc. I'd really like to be able to work at a place that doesn't require travel and has affordable housing &lt;20 minutes away.
* I have slow internet (4 Mb/s down, 0.33 Mb/s up), which would probably make remote work hard if I have to pull down large decentralized databases to my own device.
* I have no idea what CS work is like. I see offers for software engineers on the internet, but even the entry level stuff want at least a little experience. I'm not sure what else is out there, even just in terms of job titles that I could be googling.
* I have about $600 to my name, but thankfully no debt at all (thank you, loopholes!). I mention this because I want to show that I don't have access to moving, buying a new car, etc. as well as the fact that, while getting a job ASAP is best, I'm not sinking any further (financially) if I have to wait for the right position to come along.

I'm really clueless as to what to do. I don't know much about CS careers, nor do I have any related experience to help me know what to look for. Here are my questions I leave to you:

* **Should I be looking for internships or full-time jobs?**

* **What kind of websites are best for that, and what should I be typing in** (based on my qualifications/experiences/hobbies listed above)**?**

* **What locations/job styles would work best?** As in, should I take out a big loan and move into an apartment near a far-away workplace if I were to get hired for a regular job? Or should I shoot for something that lets me work from home so I can avoid travel issues? Sorry for being more of a general advice question than CS.

* **Are there any topics I should be familiar with (or projects I should try) before going into an interview?** I hear that some places ask actual programming questions and even use whiteboards, but most ""typical interview questions"" I see on Google are way over my head because I haven't really written much object-oriented code and all the specific syntax/definitions I learned in school were forgotten the day after the exam. (Of course, I'm not a *total* idiot - I got good grades and even was briefly hired back in June, but I found out day 1 that the job required too much travel and I didn't even have a car at the time, so I had to quit. To be fair though, I only had a single phone ""interview"" and the company was kinda shady to begin with).

Thanks for reading through this! Sorry if this is less CS-focused and more general financial/life advice. I just have no idea where to go - even if I manage to make get an interview and the position, I don't think I really have access to getting *to* the workplace considering my location, let alone the job being anything more resume-worthy than a generic tech support job. :/

Thanks again for reading through!"
9ymdqb,2,2018-11-19,Should I quit my coop at the end of this year?,LaserAlpaca,simonfraser,https://www.reddit.com/r/simonfraser/comments/9ymdqb/should_i_quit_my_coop_at_the_end_of_this_year/,"I just finished an interview for next summer from one of the big 4 companies and I did very well. They told me I will get the result before Christmas. I applied for next summer because I really hate the 8-month coop I am doing now and it will end next April. SFU coop center doesn’t allow me to quit after one term or they will block me from my experience. So I applied myself and if I got the offer I can quit this bad job and I don’t need to care about their words anymore. And If I add one of the big n companies’ intern on my resume nobody will care about how my first coop was and that resume will be very hot when I graduate.

I really don’t want to work in the company I am working now. there are some reasons why:

1, there are excellent courses which will only show a few times in many years. And they will only be in the spring and fall term. I really don’t want to miss them
2, I want to apply for a master degree and if I am doing coop in both spring and summer, my graduation might be delayed and therefore I will have one year gap and I don’t want it to happen.
3, the most important thing is that I really hate this company. I didn’t know what this job is before and I feel very bad every workday. I  am mad every day because of this job and I cannot feel any respect from this company.

But the thing is, I applied the big company for next summer very early this term. I thought I will get the result this month. So I can tell my company I will leave one-month latter and they can change their plan and do some preparation. But now the company which I applied told me I will get the result at the end of this year. So if I want to quit and go back to school I have to quit immediately if I get the offer and my company wouldn’t have any time to prepare for my leaving. I have the right to quit and that’s legal. But I feel that likes an asshole’s behavior. For some reason, I cannot say what they expect me to do next year but I know if I leave they will have a big trouble next four months. I mean everyone has the right to resign but even for full-time workers normally they tell company one month before they quit so the company can prepare before they leave. I don’t want to be a dick. 
I don’t care about how coop center punishes me since that’s in summer and I even don’t need to register to sfu at that term and if I have an offer I have no reasons to fear them. I just feel very sorry if I quit without any notice to my company ( although I really hate them). But I don’t want to hurt myself either. I will lose too much if I don’t quit and I am pretty sure I will be more upset than now. I also don’t want to destroy my life and career plan(I just wanted to do 8 months coop before so I could apply for the master degree) but that company which interviewed me is tooooooooooo great to reject.

I really don’t know what should I do if that big company gives me the offer. I need suggestions."

Sometimes I'll think about how one day I'll tell my children about what my first or second job was like and it makes me want to work extra hard so that I can be proud of it. I just recently got offered my dream job, so I thought I'd ask how other people got to where they currently are. I'll start.

&amp;#x200B;

My senior year of highschool, I decided that I wanted some spending cash and some job experience before moving off to college. I got a job at a food chain and worked for two summers in a row. I can't say I enjoyed the experience and I pretty much vowed to never work in the food industry again, however I am still glad that I did it.

After my sophomore year of college, I moved out of my dorm and got an apartment with my girlfriend so I desperately needed some income so I could start pulling my weight. Initially I got a job at a retail store (definitely not fun) and I worked there for a whole two weeks before getting another job at a big theme park and quitting. I worked at the theme park for a year and a half (just quit in October) and really liked my time there. However, I knew that I didn't want to get stuck there forever.

After my junior year I started applying for internships. I'm studying computer science and this is essential to kickstart my career. I ended up getting a very well paying one and managed to work both my theme park job and the internship all summer and partly through the current fall semester. I am still working here and plan to up until graduation.

Just today I got an offer as a Software Developer and I couldn't be happier.

I drove a couple blocks and stopped at a light before a man starts yelling at me when he pulled up beside me. I couldn't roll down the window to hear what he was saying as it was passenger side and a manual roll down. 

I quickly became panicked wondering what I was doing wrong. I didn't realize til I was back in my work's lot (a couple mins later) that my lights weren't on and it was sunset. My heart sank as I realized that's what the man was yelling at me for. I felt sick walking home, looking up the laws around vehicle lights and stressing about whether he will call and complain to my office (this happens a lot, it's a small community and a municipal office). By the time I was home, I was fighting tears and was convinced I'd be fired.

I called my boyfriend, trying hard to sound chill, explained the situation, and he said it was fine, just give the secretary a heads up about it tomorrow morning in case there is a complaint.

But I stressed about it for hours, doing literally nothing but intermittantly staring at a wall thinking bad thoughts and crying about it. I normally do not do this, but something similar happened a couple months ago where I had an important phone call a month away. And two months before that 3 days before a presentation, I actually convinced myself I had to die before doing this particular presentation; it was overwhelming and hit hard. I don't know what triggers these as I often have phone calls and presentations where I'm hardly nervous at all.

And one time I was pulled over in my work truck because my hazards were on and I was honest with the cop it was a mistake and laughed it off after!

I don't understand it, is it possible to have irregular episodes of anxiety/paranoia? Is it weird to have a situation trigger suicidal thoughts when just hours ago I was feeling fine and had been for weeks? I usually feel better the next day but when this happens it is really debilitating.

My mother tried to kill herself when I was younger and a part of me nags that I should really deal with this before I end up at a very bad place like she did, even if it is only a few times a year. I just don't know.

9yohpg,1,2018-11-19,I hate asking for help because i feel like I waste too much time.,ZygenX,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/9yohpg/i_hate_asking_for_help_because_i_feel_like_i/,"So, I'm a junior in college, in CMPS, it's closing in on finals soon, so it's crunch time. I'm struggling with a low C in my stats class(Linear programming) and I need a C at least to pass in my major.

Needless to say, i'm stressed and clueless since I have such a garbage grade and we only have 2 exams left(including the final) and I've essentially failed both exams with a 56, only getting a higher C on the 2nd due to a gracious makeup. 

A lot of my mistakes are stupid small things that I somehow completely miss, but some are just lack of understanding.

Anyways, between this and other classes, which I am still worried about but less so due to my grade, i'm stressed, and I also realize I don't understand anything about this class. 

I luckily have a discord with a bunch of fellow majors and I've been trying to ask questions in there, and always kinda have been about other classes, but I feel kind of like, guilty about it, or maybe like a failure, or just really stupid.

I should elaborate. I feel like asking for help isn't bad in of itself, but when I start having to ask questions when they answer my questions because I don't fully understand, THAT'S when I start to feel stupid. I feel like I'm just too slow and don't understand anything half the time, and honestly, I wonder if I'm even worthy of getting this far, much less passing my major.

I think this, piled on with stress about trying to still retain some form of a social life, and a personal life, not to mention having to start thinking about internships and potential as to what I want to do in life with my degree, all things I don't know jack shit about, not to mention everytime I look at internships I feel like the most underqualified dumbass in the world.

Just, there's a bunch on my plate, and honestly it's probably inconsequential and stupid to 99% of people, because some people have actual problems and aren't just horrible at dealing with stress and never can actually solve any problems for themselves because they're awful at problem solving apparently in a major where that is the goal. Not to mention half the time when I fail and get hardstuck on a question or have no idea what to do I just resort to insulting the shit out of myself until I either find help to calm me down or honestly sometimes really just give up, or at the very minimum walk away from the situation. 

I guess just all of this together it's a lot of finals stress and i'm going crazy slowly but surely, and I'm just feeling all of these feelings of confusing and inadequacy at the maximum level as I start to pile on review after review of content in preperation for finals.

But this is so off topic, I just hate asking for help through all this because I feel like people have much better things to do, and I spend too much of their time because i'm too damn slow to understand wtf is being said to me.

And then I just end up whinning and feeling bad about that too, it's just a perpetual cycle of fuckery, and now it's late and a day that I didn't plan to have nearly this much has turned into one of my longest days because I have an inability to do like 2 homework problems in my stupid stats class.

Just please let me pass this class, I'm so tired of all this..."
9yosr8,0,2018-11-19,"The 'Hitlergate' Hearings &amp; Rescuing America From ""The Brink Of Fascism""",rotoreuters,zerohedge,https://www.reddit.com/r/zerohedge/comments/9yosr8/the_hitlergate_hearings_rescuing_america_from_the/,"[_Authored by CJ Hopkins via The Unz Review,_](http://www.unz.com/article/the-hitlergate-hearings/)

**OK, so, that was a close one. For a moment there, I was starting to worry that the Democrats weren’t going to take back the House and rescue us from “[the brink of fascism](https://consentfactory.org/2018/11/05/oceania-is-at-war-with-fascism/).”** Which, if that had happened, in addition to having to attend all those horrible stadium rallies and help the government mass murder the Jews, we would have been denied the next two years of Donald Trump-related congressional hearings and investigations that we can now look forward to … **I’m going to go ahead and call them the Hitlergate Hearings.**

[](https://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/inline-images/shutterstock_1050434543-600x390.jpg?itok=GJULgKeP)

Staging these hearings has always been a crucial part of the Resistance’s strategy. As history has proved, time and time again, when literal fascists take over your democracy, outlaw opposing political parties, and start shipping people off to concentration camps and [revoking journalists’ White House access](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/13/media/cnn-sues-trump/index.html), **the only effective way to defeat them is to form a whole buttload of congressional committees and investigate the living Hitler out of them.** This is especially the case when the literal fascists who have commandeered your democracy are conspiring with a shifty-eyed Slavic dictator whose country you have essentially surrounded with your full-spectrum dominant military forces, and who your media have thoroughly demonized, but who is nevertheless able to brainwash your citizens into electing his fascist puppet president with a few thousand dollars worth of Facebook ads.

**Once you’ve determined that has happened (which it obviously has), the gloves have to come off. No more prancing around in pussyhats, not with Russian Hitler in office! No, at that point, you really have no choice but to wait two years until your opposition party (which Hitler somehow forgot to ban) regains control of the House of Representatives (which Hitler somehow forgot to dissolve), wait another two months until they take office, and then immediately start issuing subpoenas, auditing Hitler’s financial records, and taking affidavits from former hookers.**

I realize that may sound extreme, but remember, we’re talking literal fascists, backed by literal Russian fascists, who are going around emboldening literal fascism, and making [literal fascist hand gestures](https://consentfactory.org/2018/09/13/putin-nazi-paranoia/) on television, and doing all kinds of other fascist stuff!

Now, OK, if you’re anything like me, **_you’re probably wondering, if Trump is really a fascist, not to mention a Russian intelligence asset, [why hasn’t the “Resistance” just assassinated him](https://consentfactory.org/2018/10/22/the-assassination-of-donald-trump/)? Many of them are ex-CIA, after all, or are otherwise members of the Intelligence Community. Why bother with all these congressional hearings? Why not just go in there and kill him?_**

Well, the problem with that apparently is, they have to follow “the rule of law,” which prevents them from just assassinating people, and “regime-changing” governments that are not playing ball, and, you know, [staging military coups](https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/06/20/64-years-later-cia-finally-releases-details-of-iranian-coup-iran-tehran-oil/), [arming and training sadistic death squads](https://www.thenation.com/article/time-for-a-us-apology-to-el-salvador/), and [sanctioning thousands of children to death](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omnskeu-puE). **That kind of stuff is not just wrong, like, morally, or whatever, it is also illegal. So, even though a Russian agent, who is also literally Adolf Hitler, stole the election from Hillary Clinton, and is remaking America into a fascist dictatorship, the only recourse the “Resistance” has is to mount these congressional investigations and publicize them in excruciating detail until November 3, 2020**, [at which point all this “Fascism” hysteria will just disappear into the ether like the “War on Terror” hysteria did](https://consentfactory.org/2018/10/29/the-putin-nazi-terrorist-o-matic/) the moment Trump won the nomination.

But that’s two years from now, which is almost an eternity. **In the meantime, the neoliberal “Resistance” has got some serious investigating to do!** And not just Mueller’s investigation of Trump’s treasonous activities as a Russian agent. No, we’re talking congressional investigations of his tax returns, his Deutsche Bank statements, takeout receipts, dry cleaning tickets, his entire fascistic financial history! And then there’s that emoluments thing! And that Kavanaugh thing! And that security clearance thing! And that bimbo thing! And some other things! And, well, I think it’s pretty safe to assume we are on the road to Subpoena City!

**The corporate media appear to agree. Scanning the post-election coverage, it looked like most “Resistance” journalists got the official press release. **_The Guardian_ started taking live bets on [which investigations the House would launch first](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/nov/07/midterms-democrats-house-trump-mueller-investigation). _The New York Times_, in its ongoing efforts to protect Special Counsel Robert Mueller from the fascistic “muzzling” its editorial staff are certain that Trump is about to subject him to in order to prevent him from presenting evidence of Trump’s formative years in the GRU (and possible links to the Skripal assassins), [published a “roadmap”](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/09/opinion/trump-whitaker-mueller-watergate.html?action=click&amp;module=Opinion&amp;pgtype=Homepage) Mueller can follow to “send incriminating evidence directly to Congress,” bypassing the Nazified Justice Department! According to CNN (a dissident samizdat owned by the Turner Broadcasting division of Warner Media, LLC, which, in turn, is owned by AT&amp;T, a multinational conglomerate holding company), “House Democrats are preparing to unleash the full force of their oversight powers on the Trump administration” in series of “[high-octane Democratic-controlled hearings](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/07/politics/investigations-house-democrats/index.html),” which Jim Acosta will be covering live, if he has to take out every jackbooted Nazi intern on the Hill to do it! I could go on, but you get the picture.

And for anyone who doesn’t, here it is...

_**The next two years will be a demonstration of the power of the global capitalist empire and its predominant propaganda machine the likes of which the world has never witnessed.**_ By November 3, 2020, they will need to have brainwashed enough Americans into voting for whatever global capitalist puppet the Democrats end up nominating to defeat Donald Trump in the general election, which isn’t going to be a cakewalk. To do this, they will need to foment such an atmosphere of mindless hysteria, emotional exhaustion, and paranoia that anyone to the left of Mussolini will stagger to the polls on election day and vote for the Democrat just to make it stop.

In addition to the Hitlergate Hearings, each and every excruciating moment of which will be broadcast live and then milked to death by the corporate media’s experts and pundits, **they will continue to subject us to a torrent of messaging designed to convince us that Donald Trump is simultaneously Hitler and a Russian operative, and that America is literally “on the brink of fascism,” and that anyone who questions this narrative is a Putin-loving Trumpian fascist, and a hate criminal, and probably a “domestic terrorist.”**

None of this messaging will need to make sense. The goal of the “Resistance” is not to present a credible case that Donald Trump is literally a fascist or a Russian operative, or that global capitalism is in any real danger of being torn asunder by literal fascism (whatever your definition of fascism is). **The goal of the “Resistance” is to make it unmistakeably clear who is really running things, and what happens to annoying billionaire ass clowns who get elected president without their permission, and to the ignorant rabble who elect such ass clowns,** or who vote to leave the European Union (which, of course, they will never allow to happen, except perhaps in some nominal sense).

**In other words, the global capitalist ruling classes are about to teach the world a lesson.** It is the same basic lesson they have been teaching the world since the dissolution of the Soviet Union. They taught it in the former Yugoslavia. They taught it in Greece, and Iraq, and Libya. They have taught it throughout the Middle East. They are about to teach it throughout the West. The lesson is, resistance to global capitalism is not just futile, it is suicidal. _**The lesson is, play with identity politics and all that “cultural wars” stuff to your heart’s content, but fuck with global capitalism and we will squash you like a tomato bug.**_

The Hitlergate Hearings, the [fascism hysteria](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/opinion/fascists-leaders-america-trump.html), the [Russian mind control paranoia](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/12/opinion/russia-meddling-disinformation-fake-news-elections.html?smtyp=cur&amp;smid=tw-nytopinion), and the rest of the concerted propaganda campaign we have been subjected to since 2016 (and are about to experience the full force of) **are all just parts of a broader effort**, not just to crush the “populist” insurgency that began in the West with the Brexit referendum, continued with Trump, and then spread throughout Europe, but to crush all hope for any future rebellions against global capitalism and its ideology, regardless of whether they stem from the Left or Right. (If you think they’re just focused on the neo-nationalists, you obviously haven’t been paying attention to the ongoing [demonization of Corbyn](https://theguardian.fivefilters.org/antisemitism/), Mélenchon, Sahra Wagenknecht, and assorted other “populist” leftists.) **In the old days, this was the part where the king would mount the usurper’s head on a spike to remind everybody who was boss**. Nowadays, of course, we do it on television, or the Internet, like when we hung Saddam, or sodomized Gaddafi with a bayonet. They’re not going to do anything like that to Trump, who is, after all, an American usurper, but they _are_ going to make an example of him.

So, get out your popcorn, and your pitchforks, and so on, and get ready to cheer them on as they do. **The future of democracy hangs in the balance!** And, if you’re on the Twitter, make sure you fulfill your daily Calling-Trump-a-Fascist and Feeding-the-Fascism-Hysteria quotas. And Putin, of course. Don’t forget Putin … and whatever other mindless hysteria the capitalist ruling classes need us to parrot. _**Trust me, in about two years, when the post-Putin-Nazi celebrations begin, and people are running around in the streets burning effigies, hooting vuvuzelas, and hunting down anyone wearing the wrong hat, you’re not going to want to be mistaken for having been on the “populist” side of history.**_

**Ukrainians Push for Generational Change in Politics**

***

&gt; Q: “Where is the 2014 Maidan Revolution generation, who were supposed to reinvent Ukrainian politics? The majority of the older-generation politicians have remained in politics, but brave new ones are few and far between.” - Jaanus Piirsalu, Journalist for Diplomaatia

&gt; A: “Some of them have remained in politics, but most have distanced themselves. This is also the reason this young generation is widely criticized. They are accused of being ineffective. The renowned Ukrainian historian Yaroslav Hrytsak called them impotent flash mob lovers who do not want to do systemic work or assume power in order to introduce reform. Personal issues are indeed more important to the majority of this generation” - Dr. Vladimir Fesenko, Ukrainian Political Scientist

It seems that the brief flash of fire, fury, and dignity that was witnessed in Kyiv's Maidan Square in 2014 was just that: brief. Extinguished. Gone. Ten years of slow reform and increasing apathy towards politics and politicians threatened to render worthless the sacrifices of the Heavenly Hundred Martyrs of Maidan. However, there were still many Ukrainians who refused to accept the status quo, and were beginning to mobilize.

&gt; “The only way for Ukraine to live is for the old way of doing things to die.”

These were the words of Hanna Hopko, the first leader of the newly-formed Maidan Party. The party was born at a conference of like-minded pro-European politicians and citizens in Lviv, which had begun on January 2nd and concluded five days later. Besides their similar visions for Ukraine's future and generally aligned political views, the politicians, journalists, and advocates who had gathered in Lviv had two key things in common.

One was that they were young, or at least the vast majority of them were. Few of them were over the age of 40, and there were many among them who had never lived a single day under the red banner of the Soviet Union. This was crucial as it meant that the core of the party's membership and target audience was not a product of the Soviet system, and were not accustomed to the old ideas and old habits that were wounding the country on a daily basis. While the Euromaidan spirit is one most commonly attributed to youth, there were still plenty of older Ukrainians who shared these sensibilites. Thus the party had attracted a nucleus of experienced politicians and reformers who had years of experience battling the diseased system and would prove essential for the party's viability.

The other important thing they had in common was their powerful desire to revive the revolution and to vanquish the greatest cancers of Ukrainian society: corruption and oligarchy. These politically-inclined citizens had gathered in Lviv in determination to wage an ultimate and final campaign against these evil forces which had held Ukraine back for twenty-four years since independence. They would accept nothing less than total victory, and immediately began assembling an aggressive agenda for reform in the hopes that their unity and combined resolve would finally be able to achieve a breakthrough, especially if they could reignite the passion of Maidan among the citizenry. Hopefully, the malaise that has settled over Ukrainian politics can be eliminated.

&gt; ""Decades of unprecedented corruption are like a cancer in Ukraine. They weakened our position in the world and destroyed our army. Billions of U.S. dollars were stolen, and therefore they couldn't be invested in the military or the economy."" - Hana Hopko

&gt; “If the [anti-corruption] court is not created, that will be a huge problem for the nation because without such a court the alternative is a new revolution and that’s a very risky scenario because we are at war with Russia at the same time for our independence."" - Yegor Soboliev

&gt; ""“The Orange Revolution of 2004 taught us well that it’s a bad idea to believe that after the Maidan achieved its goal that everything is done. It’s not. You have to get into a routine. Revolution is routine."" - Sergiy Gusovsky

The nuclues of the party would be its older and more experienced members, who would serve as examples and mentors to their younger cohorts and help nurture the next generation of Ukrainian leaders. If Heaven were merciful, this generation would be the one that would vanquish the old elite and complete what the Revolution of Dignity had started over ten years ago, and what the Orange Revolution of 2004 had failed to accomplish. Leading party members included:

* Hanna Hopko

* Svitlana Zalishchuk

* Sergiy Gusovsky

* Victoria Voytsitska

* Andriy Sadovyi

* Yegor Soboliev

* Victor Liakh

* Olena Sotnyk

Party leader [Hana Hopko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanna_Hopko) had announced her intention to press forward with their agenda immediately and aggressively, and confirmed the party's participation in the next elections. Hana Hopko is a veteran legislator and dedicated anti-corruption advocate, and was nominated as the party's presidential candidate. Meanwhile, [Svitlana Zalishchuk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svitlana_Zalishchuk), a champion of human rights and a policy expert, was confirmed as the first candidate on the party-list and the future Prime Minister should the party succeed in the elections.

Many of the party members were participants in USAID's Ukrainian Parliament Internship or Rada Program which ran for several years back in the 2010s and gave over 1,500 Ukrainians a political education and first-hand experience in governance. The program placed an emphasis on transparency, accountability, and integrity. “We need more of these young professionals to transform the country further” said Svitlana Zalishchuk in regards to the program.

The new party has negotiated a merger with Andriy Sadovyi's Self Reliance party, which currently holds 47 seats in the Verkhovna Rada. Several of the Maidan Party's leading members had been members of Self Reliance at some point and were on friendly terms with Sadovyi, making the merger a natural and logical choice. Consolidating the forces of reform in this matter would be indispensable.

When asked for more details of the party's vision for Ukraine, Hopko re-iterated the anti-corruption and anti-oligarch agenda of the party, while also elaborating on the philosophy that was driving them. Speaking of Ukraine, Hopko said that “emerging democracies should focus on the most important issues first: rule of law, transparency and public participation, and economic freedoms.” Building strong institutions to replace Soviet era equivalents and the initiation of the long-delayed High Anti-Corruption Court were cited as top priorities. ""Our party is analyzing the [Acquis communautaire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquis_communautaire) as a source of constant inspiration, and our pro-European outlook is a major part of our platform and our identity. Transparency and accountability will also be key factors in enabling increased growth and fighting corruption, and open data has already proved its potency in this regard"" said Hopko.

Of course taking such a vocal stand against the most powerful people in Ukraine and their vested interests has put these idealists in danger. Hopko had already been on the recieving end of threats before the Maidan Party was created, and party member Victoria Voytsitska has already witnessed attempts on her own life and the lives of her family members.

9yqal5,21,2018-11-20,Adderall addiction help,adderallhelp6767,Drugs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/9yqal5/adderall_addiction_help/,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.  I've read a few posts on here about people who were addicted to Adderall but most seemed to be college students.  I am currently in law school and am struggling immensely with my addiction and any advice would be great.  

&amp;#x200B;

I started taking adderall when I was in 6th grade.  I used it up until my junior year of undergrad without many issues.  I didnt realize it at the time but I was dependant on it at the time but I kept it in control.  My junior year I started boxing.  I would take roughly 25 to 30 mg a day to motivate myself to workout.  At the end of the year I decided to stop boxing and study for the LSAT's to go to law school.  I went from taking 20 mg a day to 30 or 40 a day.  I studied 5 days a week at least 8 hrs a day for the lsat for the entire summer.  When I took the LSAT I was averaging 80 mg a day.  I stopped taking it for a month my tolerance went down then I was able to coast through my final semester.  I also tried different prescriptions (doctor approved) during this period including focalin and ritalin but they did not give me the same drive and focus adderall did.  

&amp;#x200B;

I did suffer depression from withdrawl during the period after I took the lsat and beginning law school.  I did not realize at the time it was the cause.  Flash forward to law school.  My first semester I was taking 30 mg a day.  I should mention during this time I developed a nasty drinking problem.  I would average 10 drinks a night and would take melatonin magnesium and zzzquil to sleep.  At the end of the semester, my tolerance grew to 100 mg a day.  I took winter break off from adderall and that helped.  

&amp;#x200B;

Second semester my tolerance skyrocketed.  I basically went insane.  If I wasnt studying I was trying to drink myself to sleep to wake up early the next day to sleep.  I was erratic twitchy and no matter how much adderall I took I couldnt concentrate.  I missed deadlines for papers and never attended class.  I then had a brief due in march which was 65% of my writing grade.  Because I missed the deadline for my first paper and basically failed I freaked out and upped my dosage to make sure it was perfect.  I ended up taking roughly 160 mg a day for the 6 days before the paper was due and 280mg the day it was due.  I turned it in late had a mental break down and decided to take a medical leave to sort out my problems.  I saw multiple psychiatrist while on my leave.  They gave good advice for my everyday life regarding my leave of absencce.  I began working out stopped taking adderall and lost 40 lbs.  

&amp;#x200B;

I decided I wanted to return to school so I bought the text books for my classes in november and began reading for the January semester to get the hang of reading and studying again.  I was averaging 30 mg a day at this point.  When I returned to school I began seeing a psychatrist there.  It was of little help.  I soon went back to my old habbits and when finals came around I was tacking 80 mg a day. 

I ended up working for a judge over the summer and my tolerance further increased.  I called my doctor and switched to concerta hoping this would solve the problem. ( I will add my doctor does not know of my tolerance skyrocketing.  In January we planned on having me switch to concerta to try to avoid tolerance issues.)  This was a mistake, I became extremely depressed when I took concerta to the point I could not leave my bed for days on end.  I switched back to adderall.  

&amp;#x200B;

SO currently I have gone back to all of my old bad habits excluding drinking.  I average 80 mg a day.  I can hardly concentrate even when I do take that much. I skip classes all the time and I have come to accept I will not do well on my finals.   However,  I still need to study and expect my tolerance to increase by the time I take my last final.  I also plan on going cold turkey the day after my last final until about 6 to 8 weeks into the spring semester.  

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry if I sound like an endless loop of illogical habbits.  Im not trying to complain or say how terrible I have it. I was just hoping to get some advice from someone else with ADHD who is in a professional field. I know I am addicted to the drug but without it I would not be able to succeed in law school or as a lawyer. (using sophmore year of college as a starting point I could barely read or concentrate when I did not take adderall.  Anything I did read I would forget in 5 seconds.  This cause me to reread the same page over and over barely learning anything.)  

&amp;#x200B;

 Is there anytips you can give for overcoming my addiction and being able to concentrate without the drug or with little amounts of it.  I do not want my tolerance to increase any further but I cant think of any way to avoid it.  I am at the point where I have a paying internship this summer and feel like I should turn it down.  I doubt I will be able to function as a lawyer and question if it is in my future.

Drinking and well, sucking. You never forget your firsts, so I figured that I might as well share it on here with you lovely lot here on Reddit.

—

This happened back in college, as many things do, when I was 19. That was just four years ago, mind you, I’m not an old woman or anything, but 19 feels like such a long time ago to me because of how much I’ve changed since then. You see, I used to be this epitome of innocence. I didn’t drink, I didn’t fuck around (or at all), and I went to this Christian organization that was based at my university. They even offered me an officer position in it actually, and the only thing that was stopping me from accepting it at the time was my concern for the effect that it could have on my grades, but otherwise I totally would have. It’s a Roman Catholic org, but the aesthetic’s sort of Mormon if anything, all our posters and publication materials online would have us in all white - prim, proper, clean, the works. Very conservative, and that was me at the time.

I’ve become a whole lot more liberal since then. Like, a *lot*. Like I’m an atheist now, for one, though I don’t look back on the years I spent in that org as a waste or anything, since they were all pretty good people as a whole. Like I’ve had a few encounters with other girls since then, though those are stories for other posts. Like I have Tinder Plus now, and lingerie and a drawer for lube, condoms, and some toys. 

The only way I haven’t really changed is physically, I guess. I’m around 5”5, which is just about average where I’m from. I’m Asian, though it’s more apparent in the complexion of my skin than in my eyes. I’m pretty flat-chested at 32B, though I’ve since bought some bras to help that out sometimes. I’d like to say I have B-cups, but in reality, I could probably wear an A on occasion if I wanted to. I make up for it with my ass though, or so I’m told. My figure’s very slender, very lean and I used to do a bit of streetdance back in highschool, but not a single pair of jeans that I’ve tried our fits me comfortably because of my ass. Of course, back then, this was something that I sort of tried to hide with looser fitting pants and joggers and all, but when this story took place, I didn’t have that much control over my attire.

See, when I was 19, I took an internship at this national corporate firm. I don’t wanna go too into detail to avoid getting found out, but let’s just say that with the size of the company, the HR department really promoted their idea of what the culture was like, and for them, they wanted to have their employees be youthful and energetic, or at least feel that way. Because of that, everyone sort of looked like they were straight out of a fast casual catalogue, think Uniqlo and Zara and the like. Fitting in as the new intern, I bought a slightly new wardrobe, mostly skater and pencil skirts that didn’t reach the top of my knees (gasp!). 

I was doing really well for my first month, and I got a good balance of actual work amidst some coffee jockeying and acting as the human printer. I was on track to go the whole two months without losing my Catholic innocence, until the *new* new intern showed up.

He was a college student too, but a senior, probably like 21. I didn’t know it at the time, but he was sort of exactly my kind of guy. Tall, on the darker side, not muscular but not really chubby. I’d find out later that he had a more than above average cock, which is another huge plus too. 

He was also off limits. He had a girlfriend at the time, someone I sort of knew from my university as well. She was short, chunky, and frankly out of his league, which sort of made me resent her even though I had no real reason to. I guess I eventually got at her for that. 

Obviously not his real name for obvious reasons, let’s call him Stan. Stan spent his first week avoiding me for the most part, probably because he didn’t know I was an intern too. In my downtime, I’d amuse myself by watching Stan from my own cubicle, messing things up and twiddling his thumbs like I did a lot back in my first week. Absentmindedly, I caught myself daydreaming a bit too. He was reasonably fit and dressed to show it, and even a somewhat prude like I was couldn’t really help herself. 

Our first real contact came in his second week. I don’t know how, but he had learned that I was an intern, so naturally, he came over to my desk to ask me if I wanted to go out for lunch. He picked this pretty trendy burger joint nearby, and I figured why not.

I was completely out of my element there is why not. At the time, I had never gone out on a date with a guy, or even a one on one meal. I was a virgin, and I had never even kissed or held hands with a guy. I was pretty stiff and awkward for the most part which took over me by this incessant giggling I did after every half-sentence I could find the courage to speak, and in this hair flippy twirly thing I’d do so that I’d have something to fiddle around with with my hands. For whatever naive reason though, I guess he found that rather cute.

“I really hate the traffic around the office. It takes me a whole hour to get to work sometimes,” I said. This was the level of conversation that I was comfortable holding, really.

“Ah, really? I wouldn’t know. I’m holed up in an apartment for the summer, just takes me a walk to get to the building.”

“Oh?” I asked. I hadn’t even considered finding a place near the office, my parents would’ve never let that happen. “And you’re living alone?”

“Sort of. I have a roommate, a friend from school, he’s interning around the area too. And my girlfriend, ish, she comes over from time to time.” 

I’d be lying if I said that that didn’t disappoint me a bit, but it did, and I could feel myself flustering a bit. I get a bit sweaty and red in the face when I’m nervous, and I’d bet that he noticed, even just a bit.

“Oh. I didn’t know you had a girlfriend.”

“Yeah, almost two years now.”

He proceeded to tell me a bit about her which is where I found out who she was exactly, but I’ll skip this part. I ragged on her a bit, very lightly, but he took it very lightly. Jokingly, really.

“So I’m probably going to end up working in this area too. I’d love to see your place sometime!” I said, somewhere near the end of the meal. Now, looking back at it after the fact, I can see where my friends judged me for being so direct and overt in my attraction to him, but remember, my interaction with guys on this level was limited to the joke dating site account my friends had made for me. For whatever reason, I honestly thought that that was some totally normal thing to say.

 “Yeah, I’d love to! How about we go to this speakeasy bar that’s by the office after work on Monday, then head back over to my place? We could watch a movie or something.”

Of course, I couldn’t go to that speakeasy bar. I had never drank a drop of alcohol in my life at that point.

“I’d love to go! Next week?”

Idiot.

That night, after getting home from work, I was already being lightly slutshamed by some of my friends before I had even done anything, and I suppose there was a bit of guilt there on my part too. I brushed it off though, because I wasn’t cancelling this…interaction with a guy that I was attracted to over them. I hesitate to call it a date, because well, I don’t think it was.

The workdays leading up to that Monday were full of this heavy tension. Looking back, he really was the start of my change - I was walking a bit different and dressing a bit sexier because of him. Nothing radical at all, really, not even a change in what I was wearing. Just a skirt hitched just a bit higher, or a blouse with one less button. I was still wearing comfort bras and boyshorts underneath. 

Monday came, and by 6pm, my skirt was hitched up high enough and my blouse unbuttoned enough to have made my high school teacher cry. I dipped into the bathroom for a quick fingercombing of my hair and a quick face wash, and suddenly I didn’t look like I was dressed for work - I looked like a girl on a well, date. Even then, I didn’t use makeup though. I’m more of a girl-next-door, natural type. 

“You clean up nice,” he said, meeting me at the building lobby to head out for the bar together. I remember this line in particular because of how cliche it was, and how red and nervous it made me. I managed a really soft, really meek, “You too.”

The bar was this classy place, hidden off away inside this upscale diner. The interior was dark, lit by only a few lightbulbs and quite a lot of candles. The tables were small, just enough for a cocktail glass and a plate of food each.

“I don’t know how to tell you this,” I started, “but I’ve actually never drank before. No idea what to order.”

“Seriously? Like, you’ve never had a cocktail before?”

“Never had anything!”

“Wow! Okay. Well. How about you get this one for your first drink ever then?”

I forgot the name of that cocktail, but I’ll never forget what it did for me. It was strong, it’d be strong for me even now, and I downed two and a half that night. It was fruity, sweet, and if I knew any better, I’d figure that he was trying to get me drunk and willing, but well, I already had the willing part down even without it. The best thing this gave me, really, was plausible deniability. 

The second round of drinks arrived, and I took a bigger sip than one should be taking with any alcohol. “Wow, it burns. Really hot going down the throat!”

He took a sip of his drink and smiled, putting his hand around my waist, pulling me closer to him on the couch. That’s when I knew this was getting real, going somewhere maybe. If I had cleavage to show, I would’ve fixed my blouse to give him a better look.

Biting my lip, I looked at him and asked, “So how’s your girlfriend and you doing?” 

He shrugged a bit and answered, “Terrible.” He had this knowing look on his face that told the whole story.

I pretend-frowned and said, “That’s too bad,” and giggled again. I was a bit tipsy at this point, and my face was red more from Asian flush than any nerves.

The third round of drinks came, and this glass I couldn’t finish. I figured I wouldn’t remember much if I drank some more, and I wanted to be in the driver’s seat a bit. 

“So tell me about your lovelife,” he said, “any exes? Guys you’re dating?” 

I smiled. “Exes? No, no. Not me. I came from an all girls high school.”

“Doesn’t mean you couldn’t have found someone for yourself. You look great.”

“Me? No! I haven’t even ever kissed a guy.”

“Well,” he started, and leaned into me, giving me a peck on the cheek, “that’s half of that done. Not that I believe that you’ve never kissed a guy.”

I was reeling from that one. I didn’t really know what to do, what to say. I stuttered, “T-that’s cool.”

We both laughed at that, him from the awkwardness of it all and me mostly trying to act nonchalant. 

The conversation cooled a bit after that, mostly from me trying to finish my drink unsuccessfully, but eventually I just suggested, “Maybe we should head to your place now? So I can check it out?”

His eyes lit up a bit. He called for the waiter, left a pretty hefty collection of notes on the table, and we left without him picking up his change.

The walk to his apartment, his hands were on my waist again, but a bit lower this time, on the side of my butt. I was drunk at this point, and that only gave me more confidence. It made me feel attractive, like I had the power. I didn’t feel like I was restrained by myself anymore, if that makes any sense.

When we got to his place, his roommate was out of the house. I suspect that he must have texted him while we were on the walk there. The apartment was pretty snazzy for a summer rental. Not that much furniture, but what he did have was really modern, and the urban view that high up was great. We took a seat on his black vinyl, leather-y couch and he set up a movie on TV. This was before Netflix was really a thing where I’m from, so it was being fed from a hard drive he had hooked up to the television.

Us both being drunk, me considerably more so, we just kept talking throughout the movie anyway. Our eyes were fixated on the TV, but our minds were elsewhere. Every now and then he would sneak a peek at me, and I would sneak a peek at him. This was the first time in my life that I was really paying attention to a man’s bulge, but it was there, and it was making its presence felt.

After a half hour or so of drunk rambling, I said the magic words.

“But yeah, you know, now I wonder what cock tastes like.” 

As soon as the last few syllables left my lips, his were on mine. It was frantic, energetic, very urgent, like a ticking timebomb had just reached zero and the room was about to explode. His hands were on the back of my head, and I was so excited but clueless, I kept pressing my lips against his, like I was searching for him with my tongue. The technique wasn’t there, but I was contributing to the level of ecstasy that he had set at least. I put my hands on his stomach under his button down, just wanting to feel more of him. His hands were everywhere. At the back of my head, on top of my shirt, right at the seat of my skirt. 

He was unbuttoning my blouse now, and I was scared of what he’d think. Even with my bra on, it was evident that there wasn’t much. It was a very modest number, more built for comfort than anything, colored beige and with pretty wide straps. 

“Fucking beautiful,” he muttered under his breath as he fiddled with the clasp. It was taking him a bit, so I figured I’d help him out. I undid the clasp with one arm, and covered my tits with the other. He kissed me on the neck, then on the collarbone, then on the top of my breasts, then tried to nuzzle my arm away. “Come on then.”

“Are we going too fast?” I asked. I know it was sort of weird to ask that right there and then, but I didn’t exactly know what was the right thing to do in this kinda situation.

“Yeah, we fucking are,” he said as he pried my arm away with his own, and latching onto my nipple with his mouth. He was rough, biting and licking my boob really vigorously, and I let out this long, high pitched moan. 

I could feel myself getting wet. 

I heard the rustling of his belt being unbuckled and his pants being unbuttoned, and without even looking down, I put my hand on his crotch and over his boxers, I felt up my first cock. I remember it being harder than I had expected. I knew it’d be hard, but I don’t think I knew it’d be that rigid? But looking back, that sorta preconception didn’t make any sense. 

He slipped his underwear down. He was definitely above average, I didn’t have much to compare to at that point, but I sorta just knew. Not veiny or gnarly or anything, very neat and thick, just how I’d end up liking it. He gestured for me to get on the floor on my knees, and being obedient, I assumed the position. I gave him a stroke, and then another, sort of feeling out how this sort of thing was supposed to go. He grunted, and took my hand in his and made it tighter, much tighter than I thought it was supposed to be, and showed me through the up and down motion. 

“Now suck.”

And so I did. 

Sucking, I took to more naturally. I knew that I wasn’t supposed to use any teeth, and that I had to make it as wet as possible. I kissed the head of his cock first just to tease him, then I lowered my lips onto him until I had him in my mouth. I swirled my tongue around the underside of his cock and I felt a bit silly doing so, but the reactions I was getting from him were priceless.  He was gripping the sides of the couch with his arms spread to his sides, and his cock was all mine. 

Without stopping, I slipped my own panties off under my skirt. I shimmied them off of me, then kneeled again with my legs angled and spread wide, and I rubbed my pussy as I sucked him off. Tip for you guys, I was starting from the outside, right about near the hood, and doing it very slowly in this circular motion. My eyes were closed from how good this all felt, my head bobbing and my puss getting rubbed while I was just wearing my skirt from work. 

He saw this and gestured me on the couch. With my mouth full of cock, I shook my head no, but then he insisted, so I followed. I rested my head on the armrest of the couch with the rest of my body on the cushions, and he repositioned himself to be facing me, and then hiked my skirt upward and flipped it onto my stomach. One finger first, and real shallow, and I sort of winced a bit. I told him to slow down and to ease off it. I didn’t want to lose my hymen on my first encounter honestly. He nodded and then lowered himself and placed his tongue on my slit. It was warm, and so wet. He spread my lips and found my clit, and then started making this flicking motion with his tongue. 

I was in ecstasy. I was moaning uncontrollably, and my whole body was contorting on the couch as he sucked lightly on my clit. I was swearing like a sailor here.

“Fuck, fuck. Fuck me with your tongue,” I groaned. Small nod of his head, and I was reaching down to push his head in between my legs. 

After a while he stood up and placed his cock next to my mouth. I didn’t need commanding, and began sucking on it. He placed my hand onto his cock, and I was sucking on him while stroking with my other hand. 

He had one hand groping my boobs violently, and the other fingering me, two fingers in and thrusting into me slick and fast. I could tell how wet I was from just how fast he was fingerfucking me, and I thought I’d cry out from how good it felt.  

I came first. I didn’t squirt or anything crazy like that, but my muscles down there contracted and pulsated and I could feel myself get extra wet and then really sensitive, my legs were crossing and squeezing against each other and I was just in complete bliss. 

I didn’t stop sucking, though. I could tell that cumming made him get close too, and I tried to put two hands onto his base while I sucked his shaft. It was real, real tight now and going fast. His cock was so wet, and it would have been easy to almost lose control from how slippery I had made it.

“I’m cumming. Fuck, I’m cumming,” he was grunting. “Where?”

I took a break from his cock and quickly answered, “Whereever you want.”

He groaned as if he had just lost it and pulled out my mouth, shooting spurts of warm cum onto my face and hair. I really didn’t appreciate the hair bit much, but whatever.

“Not bad for a first time,” I said, before lying down on the couch as he found some towels to help clean me up.

9ysv5d,2,2018-11-20,How to properly support?,bienebee,AbuseInterrupted,https://www.reddit.com/r/AbuseInterrupted/comments/9ysv5d/how_to_properly_support/,"Hello everyone, I apologize if I'm not in the right place to ask this question.

Let me try to give a bit of introduction. I am 25, my sister is 40. I was 10 when she got married. She went to a bigger city to study, met a man and married him and they remained to live there. I started my studies in that city too when I was 19. I never lived with them but I sometimes spent weeks in their house. They have a son who is now 14. 

Her husband is an abuser. I've always known it intuitively but I was too young to voice my protests. He blackmails her, he insults her, has a behavior that is so controlling and there's not a single day she's not being yelled at in that house. He claims the house is HIS only and that she can leave if she doesn't like it but if she does he'll make sure she never gets a job again. He throws some vague criminal connections threats too. We live in Europe, in a country that has all the right laws on paper, but it's extremely patriarchal society and corruption is everywhere. I've learned more about what abuse actually is on this subreddit, civil rights are not taught enough here. 

Fast forward to 2 months ago. I have to accept an unpaid internship for 6 months because I need it for my CV (not to go into specifics). I ask my parents for help because I don't want to spend all my savings. They tell me they were sending a lot of money to them lately, and ask if I could figure out to live with them for a while. I accept grudgingly and go there. 

After a week I get kicked out of that house screaming insults at him and telling him I think the only thing he can do to redeem himself is to die. Not the best thing to do, I admit. It came as a culmination after witnessing him abuse her daily, treat her worse than his dog and having the kid join him most of the time. All hell broke loose in me and I was telling him everything I didn't in the past 15 years.

Unfortunately, just a few days after that his father suddenly dies. My father and brother go to the funeral, I never did. I told my family that I need the money since out of all their 3 children I never asked, and they've given them much more previously. I am the youngest and they got help with their 1st cars, 1st houses etc, emergencies, car accidents, and random stuff, while I just want to have rent money for 6 months. 

Today in a conversation with my dad and my sister it's my fault, her husband is upset, money is tight, their debts got more pressing after paying for the funeral, I am the selfish one for not accepting to live with them and so on. How did I have a right to interfere? What gave me the right to insult him? (He insults mine and my sister's dialect all the time and throws ethnic slurs towards our mother's nation, just to give an example). This whole funeral thing, his illnesses in the past, all of that somehow justifies him. 

I tell her honestly that I will never enter his house for as long as I'm alive, I love her and my nephew, but I will not support him becoming his father. That I am in pain because of her and that he keeps choosing that kind of life every day and I don't understand why. 

What I ask from reddit, is how to not be petty but actually helpful? How to stay close to her if she doesn't want my meddling and still stay my ground. I will be moving abroad in about 5 months and marrying there. I am afraid she'll remain alone even more then. I love her, but the sad thing is that here I absolutely know I love myself more. I'd give her my kidney but not my piece of mind cause I know that HE DOESN'T DESERVE IT.

9yufn1,0,2018-11-20,Jim Acosta Perjures Himself in Federal Court: Says He “Politely” Questioned the President and NEVER Placed Hands on Intern,peterboykin,TheRightPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRightPill/comments/9yufn1/jim_acosta_perjures_himself_in_federal_court_says/,"

**NEVER TRUST THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA…
   
 CNN hack Jim Acosta [submitted a sworn declaration](https://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/cnsnewscom-staff/acosta-told-court-under-penalty-perjury-he-politely-questioned-trump) to the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia last week.**

In his [written declaration](https://cdn.cnsnews.com/attachments/acostadeclaration-111318.pdf) Acosta appears to have perjured himself.

Jim Acosta told the court he politely questioned President Trump. He also said video shows he NEVER placed his hands on the young female intern.

From the 15th paragraph:

“During the November 7 press conference, I had two questions I wanted to ask the President, about the migrant caravan and the Russia investigation. I raised my hand was called on by the President as had happened many times before. As the C-SPAN video of this press conference accurately reflects, the President repeatedly interrupted me, and I firmly but politely persisted in asking my two questions and trying to get responses. The President apparently did not like my questions, however, as he did not respond to them and ultimately directed me to stop talking. In other words, it was a typical presidential press conference. Indeed, the only thing unusual about this press conference was that at one point a White House intern approached me and attempted to physically remove the microphone from my right hand. The C-SPAN video accurately depicts what happened. As it shows, I held onto the microphone, stated ‘Pardon me, ma’am,’ and continued asking the President my questions. As eyewitnesses have noted, and as the video clearly demonstrates, the White House’s contention that I ‘plac[ed] my hands on’ the intern is false. In my time as a White House correspondent, I have not seen or experienced a White House intern trying to physically remove a microphone from a reporter’s hand. I interpreted the intern’s unprecedented actions as an expression of the President’s dissatisfaction with the topics of my questions.”

**Jim Acosta is not just an egotistical blowhard and Trump-basher, he’s also a serial liar.**

### Here again is video of Acosta disrupting the Trump press conference and then swiping at and putting his hand on the young female intern.

Here are some ideas we can go with.

Kik is mjd931 


- I am the boss and you are my best friends daughter and I get you a job and you are very thankful or you are shit at it and don't want to lose your job etc

- Perhaps we are already a thing and you're about to leave next week and we want something sexy one last time, so we decide to just fuck in your office so everyone can see


- I am your boss and I find some sexy toys in your draws and I confront you about it

- I am the bosses son and thats the only reason I am there, you have worked hard to get there and really want that promotion and want me to drop out and find a way to make me

- You are an intern during the summer and really wanna stay on, you come into my office to plead your case but I tell you we are keeping you, you're so thankful you decide to show me how much.

- Perhaps I don't work there, you're my girlfriend who I am visiting and you're so sorry I don't see you very much so you decide to treat me to some office sex in your bosses office

- Me and you are both up for the free trip to Miami and I am winning, you want that trip more than anything so you decide to ask me to bow out the only way you know how

- You're my boss and you've worked me so hard lately, one evening I am in your office and you ask me to take some rest and I fall asleep, I wake up to you touching yourself

- You're new to the office and want to get a promotion, whats the easiest way to that, Work? Fuck no? Fuck you're way to the top

- There is a new position opening up when I leave, but I have been asked to select out of you three, (You'd be playing three characters) and you all want the job so bad, one of you decided to help her case and the other two heard and wanted to even the playing field.


THIS IS MY FAVE AND LAST IDEA

I am the new mailboy who is nerdy and nervous and I am doing my first rounds of the day meeting loads of new people, I head into an office and you play two (Or 1 ) women in that office, I go in and they immediately take a liking to me and keep staring at me as I walk in. There are two desks and a load of holes in the wall for letters, I spend some time there putting each letter in the correct hole, the two of them who are hot and big titted decide to tease me and make me even more nervous and see how big I am in my trousers and decide to fuck me :)


I hope you made it to the end, below I will be putting my kinks, my kik is mjd931, come find me and we can chat about it or maybe decide another idea.

Clothed sex, I love women in over the knee boots and leather clothing,

I love sneaky sex, so maybe one of them sliding their foot up my leg at dinner or having some fun the the coat room.

Public sex too, as with sneaky sex, maybe we end up at an after party and were sitting on the couch and you put a blanket over us and you play with me.

Blue balls and teasing, I would love you to tease me, make me hard as hell and then say no by walking off, make me as hard and want it so much that I want to take it.

Bending women over, I love the idea of eventually bending a woman over, weather it be bending them over a pool table, a desk of having them on all fours for me.

Dirty talk, I want to hear you say my name, I want you to tell me every little dirty thing you're going to do to me........

I am 18+ and all participants and characters must be 18+"

9ywjbo,23,2018-11-20,My Career Skills Program (CSP) Experience,21wqaszx,AirForce,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirForce/comments/9ywjbo/my_career_skills_program_csp_experience/,"I was recently approved to take advantage of the DoD SkillBridge/Career Skills Program (CSP) and I wanted to share my experience with everyone here.  You should have some basic knowledge of this program even if you don’t know someone who plans to separate/retire soon, because eventually you’ll encounter that situation with friends/coworkers/troops who could greatly benefit from this opportunity.  

The CSP is a self-initiated program that, once approved by the Commander, permits an Airman to go on PTDY for up to 180 days prior to separation/retirement while he/she attends civilian job skills training.  Some types of authorized training paths include: internships, OJT, apprenticeships, certification courses, boot camps, etc.  I won’t go in to the specifics of these since the requirements of each and the options available are damn near endless.  You should review the options on the [VA’s benefits site](https://www.benefits.va.gov/) and request specifics during your meeting with the Education Center.  

#Notes/rough timeline of events:
1. Start your research EARLY.  I started my school’s application process in early August and I just finally got my CSP application approved by the CC two weeks ago, followed by my PTDY approval last week.  

2. It isn’t too helpful, but check out the garbage [DoD Skillbridge site](https://dodskillbridge.com). There used to be a community forum with some useful Q&amp;A but the link no longer works.  

3. Review [AFI 36-2649]( https://static.e-publishing.af.mil/production/1/af_a1/publication/afi36-2649/afi36-2649.pdf).  Chapter 11 is being added for this program and starts on page 15.  

4. Figure out the specific program/internship/whatever that you’re interested in.  
  
5. If it’s something that you might want/need to use your GI Bill for, make sure that the company is on the [VA’s list of approved schools](https://inquiry.vba.va.gov/weamspub/buildSearchInstitutionCriteria.do;jsessionid=qtMbSxQFpzyL7GpnQrtnNGv6G9CGQQvb2YqM9Cvw3vB2pv2lXhfJ!-1531379871).  

6. Make sure the scheduling works out.  My particular boot camp is 4 months long and is scheduled to begin right at the start of my 180-day mark, followed immediately by terminal leave.  

7. Schedule an appointment with your local Education Center’s CSP representative to get some more details.  Let them know what you are planning on doing and make sure that there are no issues with the training that you’ve chosen.  

8. Make sure you qualify for the training itself and can meet all of the requirements in time.  Again, depending on the program YMMV.  My particular school had several tiers to the application process (resume, written Q&amp;A, interviews, an exam, and a basic logic test).  This process took around a month before finally getting officially accepted.  

9. **Start talking about the program and plant the seed within your CoC**.  At a minimum you may want your supervisor and 1st Sgt to be on board if you want them to go to bat for you with the CC.  I scheduled a 1-on-1 with my Shirt to lay out my plan/plead my case, and at that time delivered a Letter of Recommendation that was endorsed by my flight’s leadership.  I believe that putting a face to my name was crucial to my success, but this was with a very large &amp; geographically separated unit so you may not need to put in as much effort.  

10. There needs to be a CSP POC memo on file with the Education Center (per 36-2649) before they’ll really even bother with you.  It needs to be signed by the CC.  

11. The Ed Ctr’s CSP rep should be able to walk you through submitting the CSP application via the AFVEC site.  This gets sent directly to your CC, so your leadership should already be aware by this point.  

12. After the CC approves the CSP application (simple process similar to TA approvals), submit your PTDY using 36-3003 Table 4.5 Rule 7.  

13. Once you get your authorization number, send the 988 to the Ed Ctr rep so they can send your whole package up to AFPC for final approval.  This step is mostly routine and shouldn’t take long.  

14. Go do your training and remember that you are STILL on Active Duty.  You are still technically subject to being recalled from training by the CC due to mission requirements (hopefully not), or if you’re caught being stupid.  So make sure your workcenter is prepared for your absence and don’t do anything stupid while you’re gone…"

&amp;#x200B;

I just got married in October and am having to re-file my W4. She is a grad student but has had several jobs over this past year. As we will be married and filing jointly, I have to fill out the two-earners/multiple jobs worksheet but have come across an issue.

&amp;#x200B;

It specifies that you subtract a value associated with your lowest paying job from your allowances. Now, she has worked several temporary jobs and internships this year. Do we take the total amount she earned from the lowest paying internship, do we take that value projected as if she had that job over an entire year, etc? If we project it over the year we will have gone from having one tax allowance filing separately to no allowances filing jointly. I was under the impression that getting married often is beneficial to your witholdings... Could someone clear up what I do?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks,"

I SAW SOMETHING SCARY IN MY MIRROR. I TURNED AROUND AND IT SAID THE TIME WAS 13:666 OH GOD!!! THEN I SAW A LITTLE GIRL SMILING AT ME, BUT SHE WAS, LIKE, A CREEPY LITTLE GIRL, SO WHATEVER. THEN A SKELETON POPPED OUT AND DISEMBOWELED HER, SO I WAS LIKE ""OK, I'M DONE WITH THIS."" SO I WALKED OUTSIDE, AND I FOUND A TIMETRAVELER WHO TOLD ME HE KILLED ARCHDUKE FRANZ FERDINAND AND ABRAHAM LINCOLN, WHICH IS WEIRD BECAUSE WHY WOULD HE DO THAT? SO JUST WALKED ALONG, THINKING THAT EVERYTHING WAS FINE NOW, WHEN THE SKY TURNED RED FOR SOME REASON.

THEN I FOUND A YARD SALE THAT WAS SELLING GAMES. I FOUND A POKEMON ONE THAT WAS JUST A BLANK CARTIRAGE WITH POKEMON WRITTEN ON IT IN MARKER. I SAID ""I'LL TAKE IT."" AND THE YARD SALE GUY WAS LIKE ""DUDE, THAT GAME IS HAUNTED."" AND I WAS LIKE ""BITCH I DON'T CARE."" THEN I PUNCHED HIM IN THE GUT AND LEFT HIM FIVE DOLLARS (WITH THREE DOLLAR TIP, OF COURSE). WHEN I GOT HOME, I STARTED PLAYING THE GAME. THE INTRO WAS HITLER GIVING A SPEECH AND NAZIS GOOSE STEPPING THROUGH A CONCENTRATION CAMP, AND IT WAS ALL HYPER-REALISTIC. WEIRD. AND I HEARD THE LAVENDER TOWN THEME BEING PLAYED ON AN ENDLESS LOOP, AND I THOUGHT ""FUCK."" BUT THEN IT WAS OKAY,

BECAUSE I FOUND A SECRET THAT WASN'T SUPPOSED TO BE IN THE GAME, AND I FELT PROUD. I THEN REMEMBERED THAT BEFORE I LEFT, THE YARD SALE GUY TOLD ME THAT THE KID WHO OWNED THIS GAME PUT SATANIC POWERS IN IT AND COMMITED SUICIDE, BUT THEN I REALIZED THAT I DIDN'T GIVE A SHIT AND KEPT ON PLAYING. THEN HEROBINE CAME ON THE SCREEN FOR SOME REASON AND SAID MY NAME, EVEN THOUGH I DIDN'T TELL THE GAME MY REAL NAME. CREEPY, HUH? SO I KEPT ON PLAYING AS NORMAL. I WAS TRYING TO LIVE CHILDHOOD NOSTALGIA WHEN SOME UNOWN FLASHED ON THE SCREEN, AND WHEN I TRANSLATED IT, IT SAID ""LOOK BEHIND YOU."" SO I DID AND THAT CREEPY GIRL WAS THERE AGAIN, NOT DISEMBOWELED FOR SOME REASON. I PATTED HER ON THE HEAD, THEN WENT BACK TO THE GAME. I DECIDED TO TAKE A BREAK (BUT I COULDN'T TURN THE GAME OFF, WTF?) WHEN I FOUND SOMEONE PM'ED ME THIS THING THAT I COULD HACK THE GAME WITH,

SO I DID WITHOUT QUESTIONING ANYTHING. I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT IT WOULD DO. THEN CHARACTERS STARTED TELLING ME TO TURN BACK, TURN OFF THE GAME, AND TO NOT GO TO LAVENDAR TOWN, BUT I SAID ""FUCK THAT SHIT"" AND WENT THERE ANYWAYS. I WALKED UP TO SOME KID AND TALKED TO HIM. HE SAID ""BEN DROWNED"" I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE FUCK THAT MEANS, BUT WHATEVER. SO I LEFT LAVENDAR TOWN BECAUSE THE MUSIC MADE ME WANT TO COMMIT SUICIDE. SOMEONE SAW ME, THEN I FROZE. HE WALKED UP TO ME AND SAID HE WANTED TO FIGHT. BUT WE DIDN'T FIGHT. THESE WEIRD MUTATED CREATURES DID. MINE ONE, AND HIS SUNK INTO THE GROUND. THEN I STOLE HIS MONEY, AND THEN ROBLOX. THEN THE GAME DELETED ITSELF, AND I COULDN'T GET IT BACK. NOW THAT THAT WAS OVER, I DECIDED TO WATCH TV. BUT BEFORE THAT, I WENT BACK ON THE COMPUTER, AND A FRIEND OF MINE WHO WAS ALSO AN INTERN AT NICKOLODEN LIKE ME HAD SENT ME A WEIRD FILE. IT WAS CALLED ""SUPERSUICIDESPONGEMOUSE.AVI"" USING MY L33T SKILLS AND ""FAGGOT.EXE"", I GOT THE FILE ON MY TV AND WATCHED IT. IT WAS A LOST EPISODE OF SPONGEBOB SQUARPANTS AND IT WAS CALLED ""GOODBYE (INSERT MY NAME) SQUAREPANTS, WHAT THE FUCK!!! SO THEN THERE WAS ALL THIS VIOLENCE AND BLOOD AND SHIT, INCLUDING A SOVIET GULAG. THEN THE CREEPY LITTLE GIRL COMMITED SUICIDE, AND I FOUND OUT THAT A LOT OF CHILDREN COMMITED SUICIDE WHEN THEY WATCHED IT. THEN THE SKELTON POPPED OUT AGAIN AND KILLED ME. THE END.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the fifth level is where everything started to go wrong. Despite all the warnings, some adventurers ended up falling prey to the traps hidden in the halls. But these people only managed to harm themselves. It was a successful delver who caused the latest calamity. One careless boast in the tavern, and in a few days the town became packed with knights, pirates, and other vagabonds seeking profit. There have even been rumors of a demon hiding in the crowds, seeking souls to consume. The monsters in the dungeon aren't the biggest threat anymore... Perhaps it's best to wait a while. The next dungeon level isn't going anywhere, and all the stuff that was left behind in the upper levels is reportedly missing. Why explore a scary trap-filled with dungeon when there's probably more loot to be found shaking down drunk pirates?

The theme of this dungeon level is **puzzles**. Tell the world about the most inventive puzzle you solved (or tried to solve), or maybe offer a puzzle of your own. 

You can request any number of games. First come - first served, aggregated by day. Starting the next day after the offer is posted, if you're the only person who requested a particular game, you get it and aren't eligible for any other games that day. If multiple eligible people request a game the winner is selected randomly. People who put some effort in their comment will have more weight in the selection. This repeats until all games are distributed. For Humble Bundle games, I will be sending gift links after receiving a response to my congratulatory DM. A few offers have multiple copies. Locked games will only be sent out after a significant delay, which is shortened when unlocked games get claimed."

I was fortunate enough to be able to work for a company in London as an intern. I am from the Netherlands, I am 18 years old and I am following a bilingual marketing course.

I was working around Liverpool St and residented my 3 month period in Harrow. I just can't thank you guys enough. Thank you to people I became friends with and invited me over to their parties, thank you to the busdriver from the H13 who I always talked with about life in general, thank you to the weird Mexican girl I met in the club who thought I was 27. Thank you to the guy who offered to pay for my groceries when I forgot my wallet. Thank you to everyone in my team who have guided me through and made me become a more valueable marketeer. Thank you to the girl I met who I really liked who made everything so worth it. Thank you to all the people who loved to help me with directions. Thank you to the host family for making me feel like I had a home.

Thank you to everyone in this city.

I have almost never felt unsafe or uncomfortable in London. I loved every piece of this city and I can't stress enough how much I learned here.

Anyway, I'm home since a few days now and realized how much I am going to miss it there. 

I love every single one of you and I really hope my next experience in this city will be the same. :)

9yxzbc,1,2018-11-20,Should I (23M) just give up in getting back with my LDR ex girlfriend (22F)?,MrYondaime,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/9yxzbc/should_i_23m_just_give_up_in_getting_back_with_my/," 

Ok, that's a long story. Posted this on another tread but it's more related to LDR.

Me  and my ex met while studying on an university  on a different country  than ours. I came to study in medical school and  she was studying  nursing. We're from the same nationality but from  different parts of  the country. Our relationship started with just a  friendship, because I  was dating someone else at the time, and she was  such a fun girl that I  feel in love with her (after I broke up the  former relationship). We  dated for almost a year, but she couldn't  finish her studies because  her mother got cancer. She had to leave the  country and we tried a long  distance relationship.

It  was really  hard though. She had depression and anxiety and we started  fighting for  really puny stuff. The fact that her mother had cancer and  that she  had a stepfather who was a piece of s\*\*t worsened the case. She   couldn't find a good job and her stepfather started pressuring her.   Also when I could meet her it wouldn't be for much time, because my   parents (my father is a pastor) would say that it was ""dangerous"". Of   course most of her bad mood was thrown in my back and the fights became   even more frequent. She constantly tried to break up because she felt   insecure and felt that i would dump her eventually so she wanted to ""do   it now so it won't hurt as much later"". She almost forced me to break  up  since she didn't have the strength to do it. Still I understood that   she was not in her normal state of mind, and knew the wonderful person   she really was. We finally broke up, but then got back together some 2   months after. In total we'd been almost 4 years together, but of the 4   years 3 were in long distance.

In June  of  this year she sent me a message saying that we should break up. LDR   took a real tool on her, and she felt bad every day. And even when I  was  there with her she would be thinking that I would soon leave. She  was  always really frank with her feelings and really wasn't afraid of  saying  something that would hurt me, so she told me that she had begun  looking  at some guys differently, and would like to break up before she  does  something stupid and make me a fool. This was the first time she  didn't  try to make me break up, so I know it was serious. And it ended  there.

We  still tried to talk a little,  but I couldn't handle knowing that she  was meeting other guys. One day  she said that she left her charger  ""somewhere"", and I knew it was in a  dude's house. Then I did something  shitty and entered her FB account  (first time ever) and saw the  conversations. I cried for the first time  after breaking up. I  apologized to her for entering her account and we  agreed to not talk  again. The thing is that we are such good friends  that we end up talking  again every time. I went there to see her and  sex was really weird (she  said that she didn't want to get attached  again because I was just  staying for two weeks). Since then sometimes  she messages me or I  message her and we talk for like 2 or 3 weeks  before we start doing  couple stuff again and we feel like we need to  stop talking. I know that  she's seeing other guys, and she says to me  that she doesn't really  like to talk to me because she feels like she's  cheating on me even  though we're not in a relationship anymore. She  also says it feels bad  that she talks to me but can't have me. It  doesn't bother me that she is  seeing other dudes, because I would do  the same if I where her. But I  still want to go see her when our  classes end at the end of the year.

I'm   down to my last two years of medical school, and i'll probably have to   make my internship somewhere far from where I am now. Because of the   fact that in six months I'll be far away, it's really hard to find   someone who I'd want to have a serious relationship in my uni (I don't   really like meaningless sex). I tried downloading tinder and i met a   18yo girl (with completely different hobbies as me) who I dated for a   month and a half. The problem with tinder is that the city I live in is   so tiny that girls are ashamed of using it, and the closest town is an   hour away. When I mention where I live the conversation immediately   dies.

The thing is I still think of   getting back with her. Of course much of it has to do with my own  insecurity of thinking that I will not be able to date anyone else (I'm   not exactly that pleasant to the eyes). But also because she is such an   incredible person (that I know still loves me), and that the only  thing  that is between us is the distance. Also she's much better now  that she  finished her studies, moved from her mother's house and is  working at a  hospital. I feel like I endured all the years of  ""shittyness"" and now I that we're so close to being together can't enjoy  the good times. I can still try to make my internship in the  hospital  where she works, but it's not a really good one, so maybe not a  great  idea. We are currently on a ""1 year without talking"" break (even  though  she sent me a video of herself drunk, singing how much she loves  me  just 3 days ago). But I still want to go see her in December, even   though I'm really afraid of getting there and seeing her with someone  else.

tl;dr: Me ex hates LDR but we still  love each other and we are maybe 2 years away of being able to finally  live together. Should I suck it up and wait for when I can have another  relationship or continue going after her?"
9yz1ql,4,2018-11-20,[Spoilers C2E42] Having a hard time getting back into Critical Role...,thistledownleaf,criticalrole,https://www.reddit.com/r/criticalrole/comments/9yz1ql/spoilers_c2e42_having_a_hard_time_getting_back/," 

So, it's been... months... since Molly's death... literal months, and I've watched a good chunk of Critical Role since Molly's death. I've seen the rise and fall of Lorenzo. I've gone as far as the M9's decision to go towards Nicodramus and met Jester's mom but... then I just couldn't.

I couldn't keep watching. I couldn't bring myself to care about Caduceus - even though I loved how he charmed those giants and basically threw Matt in for a loop - and I just couldn't watch the episodes without thinking about what Molly would've done if he had been alive, what sort of stupid peacock antics he'd get into, and what hit me the most was what sort deep insight Jester's mom would've had on him.

What's worst is that I thoroughly love the rest of the cast and characters (way more than Vox Machina, for sure) but Molly was the one who resonated with me the most.

**\*Fair warning for people reading past this, there's going to be some heavy talk from this point forward. Nothing super heavy, just depression talk\***

So, I started watching the second campaign for Critical Role while I was in a super dark time in my life. My uncle had a stroke and it fell on me and my mom (who is a single mother) to take care of him... a cantankerous man who left a huge ass mess for my mom to deal with. Meanwhile, I had ended my internship and was supposed to be working on finishing my Masters but the family drama that came from my uncle's stroke tanked me into a deeeeeeeep depression. It was a \*dark\* time for me.

Critical Role was the only thing that brought any real joy in my life during those months. Literally, week after week, it was the only thing I truly looked forward to. Four hours of escapism and I latched onto Molly hard. The one thing that stuck out to me and made my fall for him was how he always tried to leave things better - how he sort of dickishly helped those thieves by handing them the gold pieces and sending them on their way, how he held onto Toya and was concerned about her well being, etc. He was a character that was just full of light in my dark dark world.

And then... the death happened.

I actually couldn't even watch Molly's death. I ended the episode early that night because of family stuff the next day, but it got spoiled for me and I tried to get to it and I just... couldn't. I didn't want to see his final moments. I didn't want to sit through the battle knowing that he dies in it.

I just... continued watching the week after because I wanted to see the fall out of Molly's death and I wanted to find any form of closure for it.

And while there was closure in everyone visiting Molly's grave and all that...

I just can't. To give some context to how much I just can't, I had to take several breaks while writing this because I keep wanting to start crying while thinking about how much Molly's death affected me.

I want to get back into watching Critical Role, I want to see what the Might Nein is up to, and I know that the story is going to be good, but every time I think about it, I just can't get invested the same way I did when Molly was part of the team. It sounds stupid, I know, to put so much stock into a character and their death ruins everything for you... I mean, I hear the people saying ""Well that's just how D&amp;D is, deal with it"" and I \*get\* that... that doesn't take the sting out, especially since it's a story line cut short and Critical Role is an escapism method for some people.

Anyways, the bottom line of this post is that I would love for some awesome spoilers for every episode that came after ""The Ruby and The Sapphire"" Episode - Chapter 11, Episode 8 (Episode 33) for all of the characters. Happy moments. Badass moments. Cool interesting plot moments.

I want a reason to get back into Critical Role because I \*miss\* it. I just can't keep watching unless I have things to look forward to seeing. I sincerely love all of the characters but broken by the loss of Molly, so, please give me some things to tether myself back to this fandom. My especially love Caleb as a character ( second favorite after Molly ) and if you guys can give me some reasons to care about Caduceus, I'd appreciate it as well.

And thanks for dealing with my rambles, I just really don't have a lot of friends who are into Critical Role and if they are, they're so far behind and haven't kept up, so I can't talk to them about it.

xoxo"
9yzazf,136,2018-11-20,My Origin Story,DocRape,Rapekink,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rapekink/comments/9yzazf/my_origin_story/,"I have been a reader of this sub for some months now. I discovered it when I was searching for how rape victims feel. I was initially shocked that such a sub existed. But I could only relate to what is posted here. It is early morning here in India and I have 15 more minutes to my first patient appointment. I will tell you my story. I might not reply immediately if you post replies but will do so when I get some time this week.

I am 29 with two kids, living in an Indian metro. My parents were both doctors and it inspired me to chose the same profession. I knew starting middle school days that I inherited good genes from my mother. She received compliments for the way she looked from friends ans family and I was seen as mini-her. I grew up being very confident of my beauty. I finished medical schooling but had to finish a rotating internship for 1 year before getting the degree. 

I was posted to a rural area where the facilities for stay weren't great. One of the renowned doctor's had a guest house there and he happened to suggest my parents that I can use it. This proposal came after a party my parent's attended. I was happy to go to the guest house and immediately liked the facilities there. After I worked for a week, I was greeted by the owner of the guest house, a doctor in his 50s. He told me he was visiting the area. I had my own room and I went, took a shower and came back to join him for dinner. The first time I felt uncomfortable was when he told me I looked very beautiful and asked if I had a boyfriend. I tried to play it down and thanked him and told him I didn't have a boyfriend. When I thought I had handled the situation, he asked me if I was a virgin. I was shocked; didn't see that coming. I felt disturbed and didn't answer except focused on eating the food. 

Post dinner, he asked me to join to watch TV but I told him I was tired and wanted to retire to bed. He asked me for a good night hug. I hesitated but gave in. He hugged me pretty tight. I was wearing a night gown and he lecherously drooled over my boobs after releasing me. He put a hand on his chest and told me, ""They are pretty big, I could feel them sandwiched."" I was shocked for the second time and for the first time felt a sense of fear. This man was renowned in that area as a top doctor. I went and locked my door. This guest house is pretty old and my room didn't have an attached bath. 

The next day when I returned from work, I didn't find him. I jumped into the shower, got fully undressed and was taking a bath under the shower. That's when suddenly he came from nowhere and hugged me. I was so shocked and tried to escape and run away. He was nude and his cock was erect. He pinned me by tying my hands and told me he sent away the workers and it was just him and I int he house. He asked to cooperate as I didn't have a choice. He told me he always wanted to fuck a virgin and couldn't believe his luck. He entered forcefully from behind and held me on the wash basin counter. He fucked me from behind for 15 minutes. I was crying feeling extremely violated. He slapped my face when I tried to escape. He fucked me until he came.

I didn't enjoy it except at the end I felt some pleasure and pain mixed together. But I was so shocked and I felt so violated. He told me, he would fuck me in the bed room. He dragged me there slapping my face on the way when I was crying and begging him to leave. Once he put me on the bed, I thought he would rape me. But he pulled out a lube and a dildo and played with my body for half an hour. He made me cum so many times and slapped my face for enjoying it. This was the first time I fully gave in that night. I thoroughly enjoyed what he was doing. He penetrated and fucked me missionary style for a long time. He was kissing, sucking, biting my boobs and neck.

He turned me around and spanked me with a table tennis paddle. I screamed in pain. He put lube on my anus and finger fucked my ass for a long time. I came multiple times when he did that coupled with a vibrator on my pussy. He made me suck his cock and came all over my face. He then told me a few things that shook me more than the rape. He had consensual affairs with tens of young doctors. He never raped anyone but I was too hot and young and alone that he couldn't resist. He told me I can't tell anyone because I would be slut shamed and no one would marry me (true in my country).

He gave me a ride home the next morning and greeted my parents, had tea with my dad and went home. I got married after I received my degree. My husband is a doctor too and nobody know this happened to me. My husband is kinky and he wanted me to have an affair with some senior doctors for getting a few bureaucratic favors (we run a small hospital). I was so reluctant but gave in after some persistence from him. I have a fuck buddy who is friend's with  the doctor who raped me. I saw my rapist after almost 5 years in August. He came to me when I was trying to get some food at the party. He told me he knows what I was doing with his friend and offered me some favors in exchange for letting him do not so gentle things to me.

I think it will be a long story but his friend also did lot of things without my consent. But it was never too painful and I enjoy being violated. He had anal sex with me when I was 8 months pregnant with my second one. I was hornier than usual during my pregnancy and my fuck buddy did many nasty things to me during this time. I almost want to be gang raped by these old dogs. I feel nothing can satisfy m except being raped roughly. I crave for it."

I was recently accepted to a super awesome, super rigorous programming academy for women; Ada Developers Academy. I'm stoked to be a part of this program and join the other awesome folks who were accepted as well. It has always been my dream to be a Software Engineer and represent women in STEM. However, as with most things, there are some major financial hurdles I will need to overcome.

Currently, I live in Los Angeles and the program is based in Seattle so I will need to relocate. This includes breaking my apartment lease which will cost roughly \~$4000 alone. In addition, I will need to purchase the latest MacBook model as the program specifies it is necessary for classroom instruction. My Go Fund Me outlines all of my expenses in greater detail so please feel free to take a look! :)

The program is intense and extremely immersive and employment while attending is not allowed (classroom instruction is from 9am-5pm). So I will be unable to work until my internship stars roughly 6 months into the program. I've been saving up whatever I can to prepare myself for this endeavor.

If you are interested in supporting my campaign it would mean the absolute world to me. Sharing the link is also super appreciated and I'm so grateful for your eyes simply taking a look at my post. Thanks so much for reading!

# Title

&gt; [REQ] ($14,000)(#Orlando, FL, USA)(Negotiable)(PayPal)

# Post contents

---

I’m 21 years old as I have racked up $14,000 of credit card debt. Now before you go on saying how irresponsible I am and how I deserve to be in the position I’m in I’d like to talk about how I ended up here. 

My story goes as follows: 

My mother was 15 years old when she had me and she had to raise me alone because my father was murdered when I turned 2. We had no money and no help. All I had was education and I took full advantage of that. I have always taken school very seriously and have a chance to be the first successful person in my family. Around the time I turned 18 I became very passionate about financial knowledge and financial independence because no one in my family had any wealth, assets or good credit which I believe was due to not having a financial education. 

Right before I turned 18 I started reading books, watching videos and performing research on financial independence. I spent lots of time on r/personalfinance and other similar subreddits. Once I turned 18 I started saving money into a 401K, started investing in the stock market using Robinhood and opened a credit card every few months until I obtained 5. Things were great. The stock market was giving great returns, I had a 401K and my credit score was almost at 800 while I was only 18. 

While things were great for me financially, things weren’t so great at home. Things at home got much worse as my step father started becoming more and more abusive. The house was crowded, messy and an outright disaster. At one point the 1400 sq foot 4 bedroom house consisted of me, my mother, my 2 siblings, my stepdad, my stepdads brother, my stepdads cousin and my stepdads 2 dogs. 7 people and 2 dogs in a small 4 bedroom cape code style house was miserable.

My mother had always wanted to buy a house and separate from my step dad. I agree that that was the best decision and one that needed to occur urgently.

I decided to take a key role in helping my mother find a home. I had already obtained my real estate license as a side hustle and I became pretty passionate about real estate. This was a long and painful process for me but we had to get out of that house. 

The first step was to completely wipe my mother’s debt that she accumulated. Much like the rest of my family, my mother was not very financially educated and racked up 8K in credit card debt. I walked her through negotiating the debt down to 4K and used my savings to help her pay a large chunk of it. That was the first financial hit on me. We spoke to a mortgage lender and he required her to finish paying off her car loan balance of $4,000 before he would consider her. Most of my moms money goes to bills and she had no savings so I had to carry the weight and use my credit card. 

The next step was paying the down payment and closing costs which amounted to 12K. I did not use my credit card to pay this. Instead I used the money I earned from my internship which was just enough. That meant my own bills were getting neglected such as the rent at the off campus apartment I share, my insurance and my phone bill. In order to keep up I had to use my credit card to pay my own bills. 

Throughout this entire process of about a year I completely abandoned my dream of financial independence to help my mother in her urgent situation. I felt obligated to do everything I could for her because she raised me at such a young age. And while she isn’t perfect, she tried her absolute hardest.
I went from making exponential progress as an 18 year old to stuck in a hole at 21. I even had to abandon my growing Amazon business because I couldn’t afford to buy more product.

While it does suck that I am in the situation I’m in, being able to have my peace of mind that my mother and sisters are okay while I am away at school is priceless. I don’t expect anyone to outright lend $14,000 but I would like to hear what other people would do in my situation.

She was briefly obsessed with an actor she said could be her soulmate and that she has reached out to him in dreams and swore to know everything about him. Then she became obsessed with a different actor, rinse and repeat. After a sales internship ended for me, I was desperately looking for a job (a lengthy and extremely demoralizing process) cue a stint of temp work and an average of 2 interviews per day, with over 80 applications in two months. Before I finally landed a job in banking that I was really excited for, she decided to tell me that unlike me, she had gotten every job she had ever applied for. Dick move, and I know it was meant to kick me when I was down. She then told me that she was going to take a gap year from university just like I had done, in order to get in-state tuition -this detail is important- .

Anything that I started doing, like changing my brand of shampoo, looking into freelance things like Rover, or incorporating protein shakes into my diet, she did them too. She stares at me when I'm half naked in the apartment or wearing just a t-shirt and insists on coming into my room uninvited -even when I have no clothes on- to sit on my bed and talk at me about whatever nonsense she needs to get off her chest. She cries about stupid shit at least twice a week.. loudly sobbing so that my bf or I will go comfort her. Because she's insane, she was inexplicably furious when my bf and I installed a camera facing our bedroom door (we suspected she liked to come in when we weren't there). She went as far as to ask me if that camera recorded or if it was just 'live feed'. I intentionally work on my days off and spend most afternoons in the gym so I can avoid the trap of running into her and ruining my day. We have an alarm system and I time my arrivals home with her departures from the apartment (the system has an app, and it tracks the names of the users since we have our own unique pins). Bella will frequently ask me where I'm going or what I'm doing and will not leave the apartment if she knows I have a day off. She is obsessed with talking to me and if I'm on the phone with my mom, she'll say ""oh it's just your mom, so we can talk. So anyway, guy I'm stalking said...""

Bella told me she got a journalist/intern position at a major news publisher (our state's equivalent of the Washington Post) and bragged that she beat out applicants with masters after a quick phone interview, letting me know that her salary was almost double what I was making at my job. She told me she was assigned to write an article about some performers AFTER she went to a show and thought one of the performers was cute. Now, if you're thinking she created this pretend assignment and actively used it to stalk some poor guy, you are CORRECT. This guy has a gf and is massively creeped out by my roommate.. and she talks to me about him every. single. day. She has this ""position"" and uses the implicit threat of leaving entertainers out of her article to strong-arm them into being her friends. How do I know she is lying about her job? Despite making ""twice my salary"" she doesn't pay utilities, is always a month behind on her $700 rent, doesn't pay her student loans, and has called me SOBBING during my lunch break to beg me to cover her rent. She explains this away by saying her bank ""lost all her ach rent payments"" despite never having had problems like this in the past. My guess is that she was paying rent with grants from the university, but since she kept a $4k overpayment from them instead of giving it back, she can't go back to school until that debt is cleared. Instead of getting a job like an adult, she goes to shows every day to spend money she doesn't have to stalk this poor dude under the guise of her fake job. Her income comes from walking dogs through Rover and she still insists on keeping up her journalist lie. I have a week of PTO in December, but am installing a lock on my bedroom door, so we'll see.

TL/DR; My roommate needs constant attention, has boundary issues, is pretending to have a job, and is using that pretend job to force her stalking victim to spend time with her."

I applied to a few places until I found one offer that seemed incredible, it was called the ""best internship of the world"". The description stated that they were focusing on finding motivated individuals and adventure lovers specialized in business and/or data, which is my case. I applied immediately and ended up getting the job. It turned out to be the best decision of my life.   


I decided  to [write a blog post](https://www.vemgoo.com/blog-single.php?id=30) about it to share the experience, mainly for all future interns out there wondering if they should apply in startups or in bigger companies. The answer is YES, apply to startups, you will get to learn so much.

9z2ax3,2,2018-11-21,So overwhelmed with life,lostinthis96,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/9z2ax3/so_overwhelmed_with_life/,"Hi, I just want to share my struggles here.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 22 yo university student with good grades all in all, but recently life has been such a rollercoaster I just feel like I need to rest, but I cannot afford to. Half a year ago I was quite happy when I was in relationship with my ex whom I loved, only gf I ever had at that time, but she broke my heart and dumped me, I don't want to get into details here, but for months after that I was depressed, had massive panic attacks, felt like I wanted to die honestly (I spent whole days at home, it was off season at uni). It was the worst time of my life, even though I was prone to depression before, it's weird cause even my childhood with alcoholic father didn't break me like this.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to now - my senior year started, I got hired to a very nice internship at a big company part time, I met a girl that I'm in a relationship (very very recently, we are not really close yet). I feel like I should be happy, but I am not. I still feel depressed often, not as much as I used to, I still miss my ex sometimes, and I feel terrible about this because I like the girl I'm dating right now.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like after those months of depression I could finaly tackle it, and slowly improve if I had a little bit of room. The reality is I have too much stuff going on, and I can't change that. 

\- Part time internship that is a bit stressful to me  
\- Have to start writing my thesis   
\- Have to keep my grades at the uni and do assignments  
\- Have to keep the new relationship going  
\- Still struggle with depression, anxiety and lack of motivation  
\- There are courses at uni this semester that I am very interested in, SQL and R I wanted to learn in my own time, chance to learn it at uni is great. But both of them this semester, there is jut too much, I feel like shit for not living up to my ambitions, but it will probably end in me learning only enough to pass, having to learn it again on my own in the future  
\- Insomnia (?) - not sure if it's insomnia, but I always had troubles sleeping, and now with anxiety and different times I have to wake up (sometiems 6 30, sometimes after 9) it became a real problem, I sometimes sleep 8 hours, sometimes 3, no sleep at all also happend  
\- Sleep issues got me to the point that I smoke weed every other day, I'm becoming dependent on it, it makes everything even worse

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sorry that this post is so chaotic, I'm just so overwhelmed, just woke up late after too much weed last night and skipped important classes, now I'm siting here feeling so guilty, I just wanted to get this all out of me.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Struggled with depression not long ago, am recovering, but current time is the busiest and most important to my career time of my life. I need a vacation, but I can't take one. It just feels like too much."
9z2ayt,0,2018-11-21,Depression is ruining my life,Bronte03,TrueOffMyChest,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/9z2ayt/depression_is_ruining_my_life/,"This is a rant I'm sorry I'm not very interesting.

I'm an 18 year old girl who lost her father a little over a year ago... I have since been diagnosed with sever depression, severe anxiety and PTSD. These mental illnesses have led me to ruin my life ever since.

I have a number of good friends who love me and are there for me and I know this. However, god forbid my brain accept this fact. If I don't talk to someone regularly for as little time as a week I presume they have other people they would rather spend their time with (I always feel like the plan B friend). I now avoid talking or hanging out with people who I think don't like me and end up pushing them away. Even if I'm aching to be with them.

I have always felt disgusting in my own body. I'm a size 8-12 (Australian) (4-8 American) and when I think of myself I imagine grease and fat and oil held in skin. I also have constant eye bags, even when I'm not tired, that I get a lot of comments on. I recently shaved my hair off to raise money for cancer research and now I feel unfeminine and ugly constantly, even though I receive many compliments on my now shaved head. I have a boyfriend who tells me I'm beautiful everyday but I don't believe him cos we've been together for so long he has to say it out of habit at this point. All my friends talk about how guys are constantly hitting on them and it makes me feel like shit cos no guys hit on me.

I have been given so many amazing opportunities that I have had to turn down. I went to a national science forum and hated every second cos my anxiety and depression was running rampant. I had an internship at a university but had to turn it down because of my anxiety. I am now lying alone in a hotel room while my friends are out drinking and having fun celebrating our graduation.

I fucking hate myself and I fucking hate life. "

I am a 22yr old computer science student and soon-to-be intern at a cybersecuriy company. I do have some experience with programming (python, some java) and tech support(memory, hardware maintance, basic network install) .

   At this point in my life I should be already used to Linux distributions - but I´m not. I know the importance of using UNIX specially for those workin in IT and therefore I believe it is about time to get serious. 

 Considering my little experience, but also that I´ll be working with cybersecurity, should I get UBUNTU(as it is better for linux begginers) or should I jump straight to KALI (as it is more apropriate for computer forensics)? 

  Would Ubuntu be too limited for my internship at cybersecurity? Would Kali be too much for a linux begginer?

Also, would a bootable USB work fine or should I install it on an HD to run it properly?

&amp;#x200B;

  Any advice is strongly appreciated. I apologize for any english mistakes as it is not my first language."

My relationship with my mother has gone off the rails lately and she was like my best friend.
My parents got divorced when I was 4 years and then got back together for me 1 year later. They divorced again this spring. I have been more than supportive of my mother and even helped her get a bank loan so she can buy her apartment. But since the break up she has slowly become cold in our relationship. 
I have been planing to move to another country for 2 years and finally did this along with my boyfriend which she absolutely loved ( now she seems to have issues with him too) this autumn.  She was ok with this all along but since I moved she has been avoiding me, making excuses when I wanted to call her. I had to return home as I need to leave my dog with my father as it has allergies to house dust and she needs to stay in the yard as much as possible. I want to take the dog back as soon as we can afford an apartment with a yard. So since I told my mom I will come home for this she started yelling at me and saying that I am wasting money and I should give the dog for adoption. I came home and tried to discuss with her and she started rubbing it in my nose that she came back to my father for me and that she was the only one that struggled financially to put me through school and basically all her life was shit because of me. I am more than grateful for this but I had a horrible childhood with them fighting all the time. I told her this but because I wanted her to understand that it has been hard for me too and she should consider this before blaming me. I left the country because I want to have more opportunities and i have only moved 1 month ago and I am still searching for a job, learning the language in the meantime. I applied for an internship at an European institution and waiting for their answer. It is not like I am not doing anything. I just graduated in 2017 and have been working since this October when I moved. She told me that many people managed to make a career in their country and basically I am nobody in another country and will not make it. I am beyond disappointed of her and devastated. She said that I do not respect her  when all I did was try to make her understand my side of the story too and that I should respect her because she is my mother. I told her that she should also respect me. She threw me out of her office today and told me that I embarrass her. I really don t know what to do anymore and if I should do anything for now... 
Sorry for the long post "
9z45on,8,2018-11-21,My ex [24M] and I [23F] broke it off a year ago after dating for 4 years and I am struggling to cope with the changes it caused in my life.,asdfsadgirl,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9z45on/my_ex_24m_and_i_23f_broke_it_off_a_year_ago_after/,"So my ex and I separated a year ago. Things had become tense in the last year as it became more increasingly apparent that we would not be able to make a life together.

A bit of background - I was at college and he had a full time job elsewhere so we had been doing LDR (2 hours away) for about 3 years and would see each other at least every few weeks; I would either visit him or he would come back to his parents place that was also in my city, and I would make the drive and stay there as well when he had time off since I still lived with my parents. I had made the decision early on in my degree that I would move to his town to be with him when I finished my studies. He had also bought a house about 2 years into our relationship and expected that I would also contribute to paying it off when I moved up (noting that I had no say in its purchase) and I was not averse to this at the time.

Since he moved he had made great, reliable friends and had an amazing family that I enjoyed spending lots of time with. Contrarily, he was quite disinterested in a lot of my friends and would often clam up completely when he would accompany me to parties/events. So, I either went alone when he was working or wouldn't go at all to spend time with him. He got on well with my family but never saw them as much since we'd spend so much time with his parents and siblings when he came to visit. Additionally, for a part of my degree I was required to undertake a number internships that spanned 5-7 weeks at a time, one of which I spent living with him in his city. As a result of all of these factors, by about 2 years in I found myself completely involved with his friends and family, making them my own 'core people' since they were a lot more reliable than a lot of those that I had been 'friends' with back home. Looking back, I had inadvertently cut a lot of ties to my hometown in preparation to move in with my ex, and I didn't think much of it at the time. Basically, his friends were now my friends, his family were my family.

We ended up breaking up a year ago after being in a relationship for 4 years. I was completely unsatisfied by his beyond lazy living habits and some of his disrespectful and stubborn traits and he and was completely unwilling to compromise. I still feel so broken from this reaction from him - I had been willing to give up a promising career in a job that could take me around the world, and instead work locally without and chance of career progression; I had been willing to move away from my family to live with him and help pay off his house. I had compromised on so many of his quirks without having to be asked, and yet claimed he was unable to change a few housekeeping habits that may have saved our relationship.

On top of that kick in the teeth, I found myself completely ejected from my lifestyle and cut off from those who had been my closest friends, because they had been his friends first. While I've tried to stay focussed on my last year of college, I can't help but feel as though his life has continued almost without a hitch, as everything has remained the same except for my absence. It has been extremely hard to see him and all the others I was close to continue their lives as though I never existed, while I have been struggling to finish my studies and also to come to terms with everything that I have lost.

I am excited to have just finished my degree and will be moving far far away for a job early next year.  I'm excited to start a new life then, but in the mean time I am finding myself completely consumed by resentment and bitterness from coming off second best when I feel as though I had invested so much more in maintaining the relationship (I don't think that this stems from still having feelings for him, and I am just bitter about being left alone and haven't found anyone new). The more I realise I'm not coping as well as I should be the worse it makes me feel. From about 6 months post breakup I barely thought about him or our relationship at all, but I think hearing news of his (my old) friends or family getting married or having babies has set it off. Since I've finished my studies and have a lot more free time it seems to be all I can think about and I even dream about him finding someone new.

I really just want to focus on other things and get past this but every time I resolve to get over it I find myself picking it all apart again a few days later. I'm really hoping that moving away and starting a new job and meeting new people will resolve a lot of this, since I haven't been able to do so in my last year of study. Should I expect a 'fresh start' to help with this? Should I really be feeling this way a year on? Do I need to look into counselling? Am I kidding myself and I'm just not over him? I guess I just want to hear some general thoughts to try to make sense of this because I don't know how to get past this.

TL;DR My ex and I broke it off a year ago. from my perspective I compromised and emotionally invested more in the relationship than what he did, but this has completely backfired and now I'm a lot worse off and lonely as hell. How do I stop feeling so resentful?"

He is very close with his sister (21f) and even lived with her and her roommates for a few months for a summer internship this summer.

His sister's roommates/friends all get along with him well because he is a genuinely nice guy and friendly. One girl in particular (let's call her Shannon) is the best friend of his sister and her behavior upsets me sometimes. Shannon has a history of going after guys in relationships (like one of my bf's work friends, who she tried to hook up with)

The very first time I met her at the apartment she was literally only wearing a towel. She's also gorgeous, so that contributes to my insecurity.

She still texts my boyfriend frequently (usually to tell funny stories about his sister) and interacts with him a lot on social media (liking all his posts or posting comments with the heart eyes emoji on his profile pics) he also follows her back on insta and they sometimes snap. 

He doesn't seem to think there's anything fishy and would probably genuinely would consider Shannon to be a friend. He doesn't flirt with her or anything and I don't think it registers with him that she's being flirty.

I don't want to tell him that it makes me feel uncomfortable and insecure because I don't want to look jealous or have him think I'm overreacting. But it really bothers me. What should I do? I don't want to be that crazy gf who tries to control who her bf can and can't communicate with, but this whole situation really upsets me. 

**tl;dr:** my bf and I are in a happy committed relationship, but I feel threatened by his sister's best friend (who was also his roommate for a short time). She flirts with him all the time and it makes me so uncomfortable but he seems oblivious to it. I don't know what to do because I don't want to look jealous or controlling, but it's eating away at me lately...

My relationship with my mother has gone off the rails lately and she was like my best friend.
My parents got divorced when I was 4 years and then got back together for me 1 year later. They divorced again this spring. I have been more than supportive of my mother and even helped her get a bank loan so she can buy her apartment. But since the break up she has slowly become cold in our relationship. 
I have been planing to move to another country for 2 years and finally did this along with my boyfriend which she absolutely loved ( now she seems to have issues with him too) this autumn.  She was ok with this all along but since I moved she has been avoiding me, making excuses when I wanted to call her. I had to return home as I need to leave my dog with my father as it has allergies to house dust and she needs to stay in the yard as much as possible. I want to take the dog back as soon as we can afford an apartment with a yard. So since I told my mom I will come home for this she started yelling at me and saying that I am wasting money and I should give the dog for adoption. I came home and tried to discuss with her and she started rubbing it in my nose that she came back to my father for me and that she was the only one that struggled financially to put me through school and basically all her life was shit because of me. I am more than grateful for this but I had a horrible childhood with them fighting all the time. I told her this but because I wanted her to understand that it has been hard for me too and she should consider this before blaming me. I left the country because I want to have more opportunities and i have only moved 1 month ago and I am still searching for a job, learning the language in the meantime. I applied for an internship at an European institution and waiting for their answer. It is not like I am not doing anything. I just graduated in 2017 and have been working since this October when I moved. She told me that many people managed to make a career in their country and basically I am nobody in another country and will not make it. I am beyond disappointed of her and devastated. She said that I do not respect her  when all I did was try to make her understand my side of the story too and that I should respect her because she is my mother. I told her that she should also respect me. She threw me out of her office today and told me that I embarrass her. I really don t know what to do anymore and if I should do anything for now...

I became disillusioned with academia in college due to the stressful lab environments I was exposed to and decided to pursue a career in environmental consulting and hydrology. 

I became even more confused after doing an internship at a small, local environmental consulting company where I had to wrestle with low pay, a long commute, endless menial field work, and few opportunities to actually utilize my education as a geologist.

I scoured r/geologycareers and a lot of other subreddits and got inspired by the many stories of former geologists making successful transitions into computer science and GIS. Over the course of a few months, I taught myself Python, Javascript, and some introductory machine learning. I started taking a graduate class on GIS development and challenged myself to build my own geostatistical geoprocessing tools and web mapping apps to visualize the results. 

After networking with a former alumnus at my school who transitioned from geology, I managed to start making my new career pursuits into reality. 

I am excited to say that I have recently accepted an offer to work full time as a software engineer at a big utility company! I'll be making nearly 3 times as much money as what was offered to me to work full-time at the environmental consulting firm I interned at. Thanks r/geologycareers! I wouldn't have had the courage to make the leap from geology without reading about all the experiences here. I wish I could +1 to the counter, but I'll won't be working in geology for now."
9z5owz,26,2018-11-21,"My dad [66 M] became depressed and abusive towards me [24 M] and my brother [21 M] after my mom died. He controls all our assets, but he's largely incompetent.",become_a_good_human,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9z5owz/my_dad_66_m_became_depressed_and_abusive_towards/,"Background

When I was growing up, I was mostly raised by my mother. She made sure me and my brother did well in school, learned decent values, and had a comfortable upbringing. She even made sure to save enough for both of us to go to college. Generally, she was a really great mom, but she could also be overprotective.

Two years ago in 2016, I was attending a PhD program, and I started a relationship with a girl. My mom decided she absolutely hated her, but I thought the girl was a decent person. My mom and I got into a big fight over the issue, and she threatened to disown me if I didn't break up with the girl. Since then, my relationship with my mother was tense but it gradually recovered as time went on. However, this trend was not to continue.

Last year, my mother died. She died young and suddenly. I took a leave of absence and returned home. She was on her deathbed when I got back, so I was there when they pulled the plug. I stayed with my dad and brother to make sure things were alright. My dad took the death the hardest and is still dealing with depression today. My brother also took it hard, and he has been seeing a counselor since the death. Me? Well, not much. I'm stoic and not emotional as a person. My mom was the glue of the family, so I stayed long enough to make sure things would be alright with my dad and brother, who would live together. Things seemed alright enough, and after a month and a half, I returned to graduate school to continue my education. 

I persisted through the program, I maintained academic performance, and I managed to pass my candidacy exam. However, I started to realize the program did not align with my career goals, and my boss was focused on proposal writing more than doing actual research. Also, I was made to work in an area outside his expertise. I started making plans to leave once I completed a masters. 

Meanwhile, my dad starts taking care of family paperwork, taxes, finance, budgeting, etc. He has money from life insurance and wants to invest it when he hears about the stock market drop last February. My mother formerly handled our investments, and my dad is not a smart man. He never bothered to learn investing, and he has a tendency to gamble (poker, lottery, often thinks of visiting casinos). With those factors in mind, I didn't trust him to make sound investing decisions, so I decided I would learn how to invest. I read up on articles from investopedia and r/personalfinance, I reviewed stock market data, and I built and ran simulations for different portfolios and strategies. While I was figuring this out, my dad was rushing me simply because he's generally impatient. I find a strategy that would work well for our family's situation. 

This discovery came at a cost. I had been slow with proposal writing and my boss called me in to figure out why. I was frustrated during the talk, and let's say I ended up being a little too honest about how I felt about him and the work we were doing. I withdrew from the program that week. Tactically, this wasn't my smartest choice, but I also don't regret it. I spent the next three months refining my skills, and after, I returned home with the investing strategy and skills to find a job. 

---

The meat of our story

I return home eager to help with investing and ready to search for a job. My dad picks me up from the airport, and before we even get home, he slaps me with a demand for money. He had claimed me as a dependent last year, but his tax return mistakenly ended up in my account. I couldn't pay him back in full because my balance would fall below the minimum balance for the account. I thought this would be a non-issue because my mom and I normally treated money as family money. However, my dad is of an opposite mindset. All of the things we've ever had were purchased with his money, so pretty much all our stuff is his in his mind. It seems selfish and petty since my dad is retired with a pension, rental income, and soon investment income. He describes himself as having more money than he knows what to do with. He still can't afford generosity, but whatever. I negotiate to pay half now and half later, so as to avoid paying bank minimum balance fees. 

After implementing the investing strategy, I started my first job hunt. Near the beginning of my job hunt, dad asked me to help him with our utility bills. Apparently, we were paying Comcast and Verizon ~$400 per month for our unlimited phones, our internet, TV, and landlines. He wanted to reduce these and asked me to help. I did some digging, and I found a way to reduce our expenses to ~$85 per month for basic internet, YoutubeTV, and our cell phone service. Really substantial savings, but not a thanks to be had. I also found out my dad is paranoid about computer safety, so he convinced himself he needed to buy antivirus software. He ended up getting a Lifelock subscription which monitors credit thinking it was computer antivirus software. He didn't even put in his personal information properly (minus his credit card info). I canceled that. 

About a month after returning, dad and I got into a fight. In the forty years computers have been around, he decided to barely learn how to use them. He's having trouble with YoutubeTV and life in general, and he starts yelling. He talks a lot of shit, how hard he has worked, how sad he is. He threatens to kick me out of the house, thinks I'm entitled. Maybe I should be homeless. He tries to make me feel bad about being smart yet not having a job and not finishing grad school. My dad only graduated high school and got through life by virtue of hard work. He doesn't realize a degree's value today. He then says something pretty vile: he blames me, my brother, and himself for mom's death. I'm at fault because I got into that relationship which upset my mom, my brother is at fault because he has a learning disability and mom had to work extra hard to help him, and he's at fault because he worked a really stressful job and brought that stress home to his wife. All this stress from us caused her death.

I think this reasoning is fucked, but even supposing that logic, dad's most responsible. Dad had more than 30 years to try to change his circumstances and find less stressful work. My upsetting relationship was less than a year, and my brother can't help being born with a learning disability. At that point, I realized I can't live with my dad long term, and I start wondering if my dad is an awful person. 

After that episode, I've been improving my job hunting efforts regularly. It has been tough because on paper I am a not so recent graduate. I have research experience, but no internship experience. Dad barks job advice which is largely unhelpful or irrelevant. If I ignore it, he gets upset, so I act like his input is useful. He has supported me with food, housing, and utilities. That's something I appreciate. During this time, I start to dream and think a lot about the type of adult or parent I want to be when I grow up. I want to be patient, kind, generous, wise, dependable, loving, and selfless. Everything my dad has not been to me. My job hunting skills get better with time, and I had my first interview last month. Things are looking like they are on the up and up. 

Yesterday, dad started yelling at me again. He was talking about donating stuff around the house and how he could get a bigger write-off. I told him a used twin mattress is not worth $300, and he got upset. Then, he remembered I still owe him the other half of his tax return, and he has another scolding episode. This episode is a re-run of the last. Yeah, I'm still unemployed. Yeah, I didn't finish graduate school. Yeah, you paid for my university. And oh yeah, we killed mom. Yadda, yadda. I think I've become desensitized. I resolve the fight by paying him the rest of the tax return as I made some money through a side hustle. He went to bed angry without talking to me the rest of the day.

The dilemma

If there were no other factors in this story, I would be leaving as soon as I get a decent job. I don't know the technicalities of abuse, but I'm pretty sure my dad is verbally, emotionally, and financially abusive. Not sure if I can act on that. Although my mom spoke well of him, close friends and family of my mom who actually know my dad don't like him at all. I have no problems with leaving. However, there are other factors. Dad controls almost all the financial assets of our family right now. He is largely not competent in managing them, and he is unwilling to improve or learn to do things correctly. He is generally incompetent to all things technical and detail-oriented, and there's a good chance he will lose a significant sum of money doing something stupid. The money could substantially help me, but I don't want to protect the assets for me. More than me, my brother will have more need for that money in the future.  

So, my questions follow along the lines of what should I do? I think my dad is a toxic person who is likely projecting his guilt onto those around him, us. I can walk away once I have a job, but my brother needs to finish his degree which will be at least another year. He could also really use the financial support of my father. If I don't guard our finances, there's a good chance dad will lose money due to him being a generally bad decision maker, as in uneducated, unread, senile, gullible, and impulsive. I can manage our finance and assets. I learn fast and can carry the responsibility better than my father. However, I don't think my dad trusts me enough to have me manage. Is there a way I could build trust even if I wanted to? The thought of trusting my dad seems so daunting. 

Are there other actions worth considering? Should I just cut the losses?

Other details for context

- Dad spent next to no time raising me or my brother, so we aren't that close.
- Dad sometimes says in his sad stupors that his two loves are sports and my mom. He doesn't mention any of his kids and gets defensive when asked ""what about us?""
- Dad is also ""sees a tall black guy and asks if he is a basketball player"" racist
- Dad is attempting to find a new partner. Completely unprompted, he claims he is not doing it for the sex. His first instinct is to use a paid dating website. 
- His previous wife divorced him and she ended up with &gt;70% of their shared assets. 
- He is vulnerable to TV / radio sound bytes. On multiple occasion, he has come to me with ideas from sketchy investing or financial advertisements. 
- He's all but estranged from his first two children. Probably going to be all four soon. 
- He became an alcoholic a few months after I returned to grad school.
- He is inclined to doing things that don't need to be done. He installed coat hangers in the bathroom and removed a towel rack / other DiWHY.
- He has a largely self-centered financial mindset and worldview. 
- He told me he was considering selling the rental property just because he would one day be too lazy to manage it. He is trying to make his life easy.

- I'm by no means a perfect person.
- I am a hard worker with an engineering degree.
- I can be a bit snarky which doesn't translate well with my dad.
- I have lived away from home for 6 years and without financial support for the last 2.5 prior to leaving graduate school. 
- I view my dad as an anti role model and look to other adults for example.

- My brother is lacking in life skills. 
- He is a good kid, gentle and kind. 
- He has never lived without his parents. 
- He has low money sense and independence for his age.
- He might be normalizing my dad's behavior.

tl;dr
My mom died last year. She was the buffer of the family. My dad and I have been clashing. He blames us for her death, and he is a selfish, nasty person. I don't want to maintain a relationship at this point. I'd like to at least protect my family's money rather than see it lost due to my dad's incompetence. Not sure if I even could. Help? Suggestions? Sympathy? "

A little background, I’m currently a college senior working at a US Senate internship in DC, and the school I go to is in a different state than my hometown, so I only really go back during holidays

Anyways, I decided I wanted to go to the Marshall’s that’s like a two minute drive from where my grandmother lives. She also happens to work at this Marshall’s, and I used to work there myself, so I know some of the workers. The dress code is also really relaxed, and it’s basically just you can’t wear graphic T-shirts or shorts. Employees wear lanyards that have their names on it. I’m very clearly not in dress code; wearing black jeans, a hoodie for the school I go to (go heels), and a backwards hat for a campaign I worked on. I also look pretty young, though normally my facial hair hides it, but I’m freshly shaved, so I look 16.

I go in to grab some coasters for thanksgiving dinner, and see my grandmother working. I go up and talk to her for a few minutes before I have to go. I also see one of my old managers and we talk for a bit. 

Anyways, after this, I feel someone tap my shoulder. I’ll call him “Angry old dude” or AOD

AOD: Excuse me, but I need help finding these pillows. 

*shoves a picture on his phone into my face*

Me: I’m sorry man, but I don’t work here. I would help you but I’m a little busy right now.

AOD: I’m sorry? I just saw you talking to those two workers. I know you’re a lazy liar.

Me: Man, if you want help, just ask someone who actually works here instead of creating a scene with me

AOD then grabs my shoulder (I’ll never get why people think they can touch someone they’re annoyed with) and tells me: You’re gonna help me; then I’m gonna tell your manager how you refused to help me and held up my day.

I don’t really have time for an angry old dude, so I just put the coasters back where I found them (he’s literally following me) and leave the store. I’ve got no clue what happened to AOD after that since I kinda tuned him out.

Boy am I glad I don’t have to work retail anymore.

I recently booked a flight through Chase Ultimate Rewards and received the following confirmation email after booking. This  came from  Chase Travel Powered by Expedia &lt;[chasetravelbyexpedia@link.expediamail.com](mailto:chasetravelbyexpedia@link.expediamail.com)\&gt;.

After 3 weeks of consistently contacting Chase about this, I finally got a phone call at 6:30am this morning (really great way to wake up btw) saying that they found no evidence that this text was ever there, and since I couldn't provide them with the email that had the text written in it, they were going to close the case. As mentioned above, this email now has my full name there, so there is no ""Version"" I can send them that shows this message. All i have is a screenshot and a photo of my laptop screen i took with my phone.  
Time stamp of events:  


10/30 - My girlfriend and I book tickets through Chase rewards portals. I receive confirmation email shortly after.  
11/2 - I review this itinerary and notice the ""EVAN WILL BE KILLED"". Take screenshot and photo.  
11/3 - Email Chase through secure messaging with screenshot of message, asking them to please look into.  
11/3 - Chase responds saying they will send to appropriate dept.  
11/5 - Email Chase again requesting urgency in the matter.  
11/5 - Chase responds saying the dept they forwarded to may take up to 6 days to respond.  
11/6 - Private message Chase Support on Twitter with screenshot to see if they can help.  
11/6 - Twitter account responds saying I need to call Chase Rewards directly.  
11/7 - Missed call from unknown Arizona number. Voicemail from Tier 3 Supervisor saying to call him back.  
11/8 - Spoke to Bryce who was the supervisor who called. Said he would look into and give me an update within 1-3 days.  
11/13 - No updates. I call and ask for a Tier 3 Supervisor as instructed in the voicemail. Spend 1 hour on phone giving information to another supervisor since Bryce is out. I forward the email to them which now has my correct first and last name. She told me this would be sent to Glassbox team for review.  
11/13 - After call, I email Chase secure message center again explaining how I wasn't getting anywhere with this.  
11/13 - Chase responds once again saying they would forward to appropriate department.  
11/19 - No updates. I call again and ask for Tier 3. I get Rebecca this time who is the head Supervisor. She informs me that the glassbox request was ""misrouted"" so nothing had been done since I last spoke to them on 11/13. She apologizes and says she will have an answer to me by 11/21  
11/21 - 6:30am phone call wakes me up. Rebecca sounds like she's reading through a script as she tells me they found no evidence that my email ever had this text. Said I failed to provide the original email which had this name on it, and that the case was being closed. Thanks me for being a chase member  


They've basically accused me of making this whole thing up. I have no idea what to do now. My main issue in the first place was that I needed to know who did this. If it was a disgruntled employee or an intern messing around, then it is what it is. Not great, but at least I know it isn't serious. If they couldn't tell me how that got there, then I'd be extremely hesitant to take the flight. After the phone call this morning, I'm now extremely upset and have no idea what to do next. Not only were they unable to tell me how it happened, but they told me that it didn't.... Has anyone booked a flight since they partnered with Expedia and do you have any insight into how this email could have been edited? Would there be any track record of the edit taking place? Should I take the flight? Any recommendations on what to do next? Help!

I am just looking for some feedback from those with experience. I just graduated with my MSW in May and I have been at my first post-grad job for about 5 weeks now. It's a men's short-term detox and rehab for substance use; the facility is new and has been open for 3 or 4 months now. It is more intensive case management than anything else and I am the only full time LMSW on their counseling staff - the rest are CASACs.

I was totally okay for the first 3 weeks. The workload was totally manageable and I had no issues. But the last 2 weeks, I am just feeling completely overwhelmed. We are supposed to have a max caseload of 8, right now I have 10 and my colleague has 15. Patients have not been getting assigned to us and they complain every day that they haven't seen anyone in days (one of my late assignments has been here 1 week already). We are each expected to see each of our patients 2 times per week and see 4 patients in a day, on top of running two 45 minute groups (with 15 men each) per day and keeping up with those notes as well as our individual paperwork. There are 5 groups per day and those are mandatory for all of the men here - aka we should not be pulling them out to do individual sessions.

One counselor is going to the night shift because he is unhappy and another counselor was recently let go. We are all feeling overworked and are having trouble keeping up with deadlines for assessments and treatment plans. They are very understaffed and the patients know it and comment on how this place ""opened prematurely"" almost daily. I am finding myself here later and later each night to meet these deadlines, however they hate when we go overtime. There is a ""system"" in place to make sure that the night staff can take care of things that we do not get to that day, which consists of putting the patient's name and what is needed in a notebook. They do not complete what we leave them and there is 0 accountability. Our clinical director does not want to hear a single thing we have to say about night staff. She asks us in daily meetings how we are doing and asks us to leave work for the night staff. We tell her it didn't get done and we get cut off with ""I'm not gonna sit here and let you complain about the night staff"" and insists that the problems are ours (it is rumored that she used to work with them and looks the other way because she knows and likes them). Lastly, I am finding myself bombarded with patients every time I go up to their floor where their rooms are, and sometimes I feel the need to hide from them!

So in short, should I stick this out? Are my feelings/is this work typical for someone new in the field? Or is this a sinking ship. My internships were absolutely nothing like this, but I also know that I was not given the same caseloads as a full time employee.

Thanks SO much!!"

I’m a sophomore in college, and I’m still debating on what I want to major in. I have a big passion for policy regarding civil/human rights, women’s rights, mental health, education policy, and community outreach. During high school I did a lot of thinking about majoring in political science. But, because I didn’t know what I wanted to major in, I decided it was best to go to community college on a scholarship until I knew what I wanted to do. 

By recommendation from my counselor I took an intro to political science course and various philosophy classes. So far, I’ve enjoyed those classes but I’m still a little unsure. As said before, I want to work in developing policy, a think tank, or even for a senator or congressman. But, as I’ve been searching through Reddit and online a lot of people don’t recommend political science as a major so I wanted your thoughts? 

My plan is to transfer from CC to a 4-year university and intern a lot to hopefully get a job and then pursue my masters in Public Policy. "

Well they were all lies, and he had been stringing me along while getting with her. He just wanted to figure out who he wanted more. He blamed me, mocked me, tried to make me seem like I was crazy, and mentally tortured me. They felt no remorse. They started dating and after less than two months of dating, they got engaged. He told me afterwards to stop publicly talking about what he did to me. He’s been lying about what he did and when he does get caught by someone who knows what he did, justifies it. I have lost friends and my reputation has been tarnished because of what he’s been saying 

I just got word of their wedding date. They are having the ceremony on the exact day he cheated on me. Specifically. And then a party over a month later. I have tried so hard to move forward healthily and it’s like they’re taunting me. I know they chose that date specifically. 

Please, give me any advice. I have tried getting away from him and her and they just seem to make their way back into my life at random moments. I can’t believe people would be so cruel. I don’t know what I did to deserve this "

Dear Todd,

I told you but you still ain't listenin'. I left my e-mail, my YouTube, and my Twitter in the media. I left two reviews back in ‘15, you must not-a got 'em. There probably was a problem with your QA testing or somethin'. Sometimes the frame rates get real choppy when I’m playin’. But anyways, forget it, what's been up, man? How's your engine? Rockstar released an open world game too, they’re ‘bout to go online. If I review it, guess what I’ll rate it? I’m-a rate it higher. I read about your plans for Starfield too, I'm sorry. I know Telltale got complacent too but I’m sure you shouldn’t worry.

I know you probably hear this everyday but I'm Bethesda’s biggest fan! I even bought the power armour edition for the glow-in-the-dark map. I got a hard drive full of Godd Howard memes and your merch’, man. I liked the shit you did with Far Harbour too, that shit was fat. Anyways, I hope you get this man. Hit me back, just to chat.

Truly yours,

Dear Todd,

You still ain't fixed those Skyrim bugs, I hope you have a chance. I ain't salty, I just think it's fucked up you don't respect your fans. If you wanna sell a game twice with some added rays… You’re the Overseer, Todd, but we’re losing dialogue options like we’re dropping frames. Have some standards, man… That game was five years old!! Sixty dollars to enter Virginia feels like I’m selling my soul! It's pretty shitty, man… You're like this 3 billion dollar company. You want us to break it early?... You break it more than I do! A “BETA TEST?!”… Come on, man, I just don't like bein' lied to.

Remember when Emil spoke at STORY? He said he didn’t care ‘bout criticism if you’re making green. See, he’s just like you in that way… Yao Guai fur coat and no knickers: a glowing sea of marketing but fewer memorable scenes. It’s like this game was put together by interns! Or did you just not take your time? You’re numb to the fall-out, ya greed for caps leading to decline. Early access asset-flip or the limits of your engine, you decide!… Or are you headed towards OBLIVION, your “free pass” revoked this time. Bugthesda’s a dead meme, ya games have more bugs than boatflies! It’s like Stockholme syndrome… more you disrespect us, harder we defend your lies! See, everything you build “just works” and I respect the gall with which you sell it. Though deep down you must be jealous ‘cause we talk about Obsidian 24/7.

But the haters don't know you like I know you Todd, no one does! They don't know what it’s like for triple-A game developers just showing up! You gotta tweet me, man… I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose.

They say it’s more fun with friends…

P.S. WE SHOULD TEAM TOGETHER TOO.

I know you got my Metacritic score, I pushed the zero key on it perfect. So this is my Reddit post I'm sending you, I hope you read it. I’m in the ini file right now, I’m changing the 70 to 90 in the F.O.V. Hey Todd… I just selected max settings… You dare me to survive? You know that song by Denver you used to try to get us to buy? About that guy who longed to be home, but wasn’t, but he was heading, and he should have been back already, and he was longing… That's kinda how this is… You could have brought me home instead of insulting. Now it's too late… I'm over-encumbered and I’m dropping. And all I wanted were some choices in my Fall’… I HOPE YOU KNOW I DELETED ALL MY MEMES AND BOMBED THE SCORES! I loved you Bethesda, you coulda had more money, think about it… You ruined it now! I hope you can't sell this and the reviewers drag you for it! And when the fanbase stops making excuses for you, you face facts and feel ashamed about it! I hope your conscience T-POSES and you can't level up WITHOUT ME! I seen this one texture on a wall today and it made me sick!... The texture was like 512 pixels and it looked like absolute shit! It was old and blurry, completely flat and undetailed… your models are low-poly, your frame rate tanking, and the texture wasn’t correctly TILED!!... Well, gotta go… I have to refresh the Nexus.

I use to hear of Real Estate agents making big money from 2005-2006, but then blowing it all on bullshit so when the economy tanked they were broke because they couldn't afford their inflated rent and two luxury car payments.

&amp;#x200B;

When the economy crashes, salaries and wages drop, and many people that keep their jobs are forced to live paycheck to paycheck because of their bills and debt that don't match the economy they now find themselves in. During this time if you have saved money you can choose to stay at your job if you still have it and find a cheap place to live in your area as real estate prices will have dropped, or move away somewhere cheaper with your savings and pursue your passions without worrying about being a wage slave in a crap economy until the market stabilizes and you can earn more for the time you put in once more rather than accepting a shitty economy which means shitty pay for the same output.  


If you decide to take time off from your previous career choice, you can choose new jobs for experience, because you want to and not because you have to, that pay under minimum wage to get experience and demand a better salary/wage in due time (Bosses hate paying new people decent wages, once they know you're competent they'll hire you for the fair wage.) This is mainly to get paid something while acquiring the new experience. It's essentially a paid internship while some college kid goes into debt for what they believe is the same thing. When the economy gets good again you can hop back into the markets/craft/trade/skills you've been learning (Whichever one becomes the highest paying possible) and start saving again like a pirate hordes gold until the next down swing if you so choose.  


Why work paycheck to paycheck in a shitty economy making 30-45k each year when you can work a year in a good economy and make double that for the same time you put in? This frees up time for ourselves in the economic down turn and lets us pursue new options.  


IMPORTANT: If the government is taking more in taxes from you than you are saving for yourself each year, the system IS NOT working for you! Tons of people don't realize the government is profiting off of them like serfs. Unless you make a good margin in savings each year you might as well work under the table or go on welfare. Living paycheck to paycheck is the true definition of a wage slave. The government takes all your potential savings and you're back on the street the next morning in the rat race just to continue being a rat in the rat race... stuck in what seems to be a never ending cycle. Why support a system that profits off of your labor more than the laborer themselves ? The government doesn't pay your rent, but you have to. After all your expenses, who gets more money, you or the government ?  


So why is leaving the rat race important? Because I have a friend who has been working nearly 15 years at the same place and he just quit his job a month ago. He has about $1200 left in his savings, and he's paid the government about $200,000 in taxes over the 15 years. He risks being HOMELESS because the government robbed Peter to pay Paul. He can't get unemployment as he didn't get fired but rather he quit. Here's a man who would have $200,000 in the bank if the government didn't pocket their 'fair share' each week he got paid. Hell, if they took half in taxes he'd still have $100,000 saved up! Do you think society cares about this man? Hell no. Now he's stuck between a rock and a hard place. Society will no longer give a shit about him. He even joked about suicide, which I am now fearful about.   


Leave the rat race now! Start accumulating savings even if it means moving out of your apartment and moving in with a family member. Fuck what society thinks. Save what you would have on rent or a fancy car and start stacking it all now. By the time you'll need it you'll have it.  


TL:DR - Make money in your profession when the Auction House is selling your gear at top prices. Learn new trade skills at your leisure when the materials for crafting cost almost as much as the sell price anyway. (MMORPG analogy)

9z9gwz,102,2018-11-21,Why Ray Palmer is My Favourite,ireactions,LegendsOfTomorrow,https://www.reddit.com/r/LegendsOfTomorrow/comments/9z9gwz/why_ray_palmer_is_my_favourite/,"I really enjoy LEGENDS because of the cast, and Ray Palmer is my favourite character on the show. I think /u/BrandonJRouth is great. What follows is armchair psychoanalysis regarding Routh based on having watched everything he's ever been in and listened to exactly ONE podcast interview with him. It's theory. Don't take it seriously. I said don't take it seriously. Why are you taking it seriously? Stop taking it seriously!

Ray Palmer's character on LEGENDS is one of the high points for me, but there's clearly been a shift from ARROW with Ray almost a different character. Ray has gone from an aloof and mysterious scientist to a brilliant but hapless oaf. Yet, Ray's character rings true for me because of Brandon Routh's performance. Acting isn't about pretending; it's about finding your truth and presenting it in a fictional context, and Ray's trajectory seems to mirror Brandon Routh's career.

According to his [Nerdist podcast,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PW5jbG1Ydcc) Routh started out as a jobbing actor who worked on soap operas and tended bar and sometimes played bartenders in soap operas before getting laid off soap operas and just being a bartender. Due to auditioning for a show produced by McG, he managed to get an audition for McG's SUPERMAN movie and the audition videos were kept when Warner Bros. went with another director. Routh was cast as Superman, his career going from zero to blockbuster.

The resulting movie was trounced at box office by romcoms and pirate movies. But Routh was told he'd be in a sequel; the movie had done adequately. Then three years passed, his contract expired and Warner Bros. made no move to renew it and planned to move on from him.

In the podcast, Routh describes how he was quietly shattered by this: he had expected the next decade of his life to be acting as the custodian of Christopher Reeve's legacy. He'd thought, at least, that playing Superman would lead to many other offers. But, as he says, ""Jobs didn't really come my way.""

He had to go auditioning again and he confessed on Nerdist that he was embarrassed at going from playing Superman to TV guest star roles. Routh was depressed, it affected his work. Looking at his acting in CHUCK and in some episodes of ARROW, it's like he was afraid to make strong, individual choices to make the words and characters his own. He comes off as Brandon Routh reciting dialogue. He's earnest and sincere, but it's the only note he hits, making his characterization wooden.

He's also extremely low energy; he's not enthusiastic, he isn't impassioned. In real life, Routh describes this as going through a dark period of self-doubt over being replaced as Superman, not getting work or the work that he wanted. On CHUCK, his performance was adequate but stiff. He was also stiff in ARROW, although onscreen, it came off as Ray Palmer being a detached, distant, mysterious scientist, haunted by the murder of his fiancee. At the end of Season 3, Ray went missing and Season 4 revealed that Ray had been trapped in isolation for months.

This led to Ray becoming a regular on LEGENDS OF TOMORROW where Routh's performance suddenly changed, as did Ray. Stepping aboard the Wave Rider, Ray became hyperactively enthused about time travel, adventure and superheroics, diving into situations impulsively and constantly making bad situations worse before learning to make them better.  The once hypercompetent, industrialist hotshot from ARROW had become a scatterbrained, well-meaning juvenile.

Ray's high energy was an irritant to the team; his screwups every week led to this subreddit starting a ""Fuckup Counter"" for him. Strangely, this seemed to work better: Ray being talented but incompetent gave Routh a voice and identity to portray with real specificity instead of just being Felicity's single-season boyfriend. Ray *looked* like a flawless, handsome hero but was actually an overgrown child who made a lot of mistakes and he had to struggle and persevere to triumph and needed a lot of help from his friends.

Ray also had limitless compassion and patience, a high tolerance for the peculiarities of others (note his friendships with Mick and Nate), and absolutely no ego whatsoever. Ray always accepted responsibility for his errors and gladly took his spot on the chore wheel. It's hard to imagine the suit and tuxedo Ray of ARROW doing laundry on LEGENDS. Brandon Routh went from being someone for Stephen Amell to score points off of to a truly endearing presence. But it also made Ray seem like a *completely* different character.

Onscreen, there was no direct explanation for this change, although Routh's performance suggested that Ray's months of isolation had caused him to regress to a more childish state. After all, the ATOM suit had proven to be a damp squib in the tech community; he'd come to rebuild Star City only for it to carry on without him. All this had eroded Ray's previous superiority complex. In many ways, the Ray Palmer of LEGENDS is a shadow of who he was on ARROW, except this diminished Ray has much more humility, passion, joy and love than the icy, remote man he was before.

The result is a character I find tremendously likable: an excitable, charmingly earnest and sweet manchild who screws up. A former mogul who's been cut down to size and accepts his diminished stature with a mix of humiliation and grace. And a vastly improved performance from Brandon Routh who has embraced this flawed and lovable character with gusto. Routh is a lifelong gamer and fantasy fan, and he really sold Ray's joy at seeing dinosaurs and the Wild West and the 60s and space.

I suspect that the real reason Ray Palmer changed, however, is that Brandon Routh changed. In the Nerdist podcast, Routh describes his realization with help from family and friends and his wife that his depression over Superman was affecting his life and career.

He talks about accepting that he had to audition for roles; he wouldn't be offered leading parts based on SUPERMAN RETURNS. He came to grips with how he would never play Superman again and he would have to find some other life-defining character to play. Perhaps he came to see that becoming Superman had meant skipping over guest-roles, supporting roles and roles as part of ensembles -- but these were roles he would have to not only accept but embrace and commit himself to fully in order to rebuild a career.

Routh also talks about how he became obsessed with nutrition, discovering the peculiar beverage that is ""Bulletproof Coffee,"" a grammatically curious name for a combination of grass-fed butter and coconut oil into coffee from mold-free beans as well as a high-protein and fat diet with low carb intake. Routh says his physical health went on the upswing, his energy levels ramped up significantly and the once withdrawn and quiet Routh became a manic chatterbox.

It seems as though the LEGENDS writers proceeded to rewrite Ray with Routh's new hypercaffeinated personality. In real life, Routh is known to never shut up about Bulletproof Coffee leading to the Season 3 joke where Nate only realizes Ray's been kidnapped after a morning has passed without Ray espousing the benefits of this beverage.

Ray Palmer in the third season of ARROW was a deeply depressed person over the death of his fiance just as Brandon Routh was quietly miserable for years over losing his franchise. Depression doesn't always manifest in binge drinking or self-destruction. Sometimes, it's just low energy, low enthusiasm, and a low sense of self-worth. And then there's the gleeful joy of a new begnning; just as Routh accepted his career had taken a backwards step, Ray became a less mature but happier figure on LEGENDS and took a new path forward.

There are certain moments in Routh's performance that seem painfully close to his own reality. There's a strong moment in Season 2's ""Shogun"" where Ray has to coach Nate to use his powers to destroy the co-opted ATOM suit and Ray agonizes that by destroying the suit, he is destroying the only thing that makes him special -- a moment that Routh played with such heartfelt grief and loss, perhaps drawing on how it felt when Warner Bros. let his Superman contract expire.

There's also Season 3 opening with Ray, off the Wave Rider, working as an intern at a dating site and being mocked for having once been a big shot in tech. It isn't remotely realistic; Ray Palmer would have still had his profits and savings. But it's *true* \-- that is how Routh felt auditioning to play Cop #3 characters after he'd played Superman.

And that's why I really like Ray Palmer on LEGENDS. Both Ray and Routh lost the thing that gave their lives meaning. And both men had to rebuild themselves and create new lives. Yes, there are some breaks with strict character continuity, but this character rings true because it's Brandon Routh's truth and it gives me hope in my own struggles and my own life.

Ray Palmer is my favourite character on LEGENDS OF TOMORROW and I adore what Brandon Routh and the writers have done with this part."
9z9n8z,6,2018-11-21,AITA for asking a former co worker on a date (I think she's afraid of me now)?,AmIacreepyman,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/9z9n8z/aita_for_asking_a_former_co_worker_on_a_date_i/,"I think this is going to be a bit of a long post, so sorry for that, I just want to provide as much context as possible.

Throughout my undergrad/highschool I never had the confidence to ask women on dates, however I have had a girlfriend and have been with a few other women, I had just never made the first move (girls would either kiss me at a party or ask me to hang out). Last summer I worked with this woman who was absolutely beautiful (like the most attractive person I have ever seen in real life), I wasn't really interested in her initially because a close friend had past away (in hindsight I was probably depressed). Near the end of last summer I started talking to her and realized she was actually incredibly cool so I asked her on a date (for the first time ever), though I didn't explicitly use the word date and looking back at it now I think she might have thought I just wanted to spend time together platonically. What happened was were just speaking after work and she told me a really cool story about what she did that past weekend and I kinda thought (in my head) ""fuck, she's actually awesome I want to get to know her better"" so I said ""lets go get ice-cream and go for a walk Wednesday"", she said she couldn't Wednesday but asked if we could hangout Friday after work instead. I'm mentioning this all because I thought the fact that she wanted to spend time with me one on one, just hanging out and not doing anything specific, made me think that there was a solid chance that she was attracted to me last summer, furthermore she definitely did a couple things throughout our three months together that to me seemed flirty. We ended up not getting ice-cream on Friday, and I took her canceling on me as her not liking me; I only found out this past summer through a friend that she actually had a legit excuse (family emergency). About a week after her canceling that ""date"" (not really a date I guess, I just wanted to get to know her better before leaving) I flew across the country for my senior year of university. We spoke a little on Facebook, her apologizing for not being able to get ice-cream and telling me we should when I get back in town which again I took as a bit of a good sign (she reached out to me, not the other way).

Fast forward 13 months to a week ago and I run into her on the way to class (I'm going to grad school and she's in her senior year at the same college). I'm hugely embarrassed about how I acted, but I here it is. We both are in a meeting together (brief meet up from our internship, not really important to this story) and then I leave to head to class, she calls out my name and I stop so we can walk together. We make casual small talk about what out plans are and then get into an elevator together (I totally recognize that this is the worst place to corner a woman and ask her on a date and what I did was pretty uncool).

I kinda just phase out for about 1-2 seconds looking at her, I know its a clique to say that I got lost in her eyes, but thats honestly what happened.

She looks at me and says ""what?""

It just kinda slipped out and I said ""We should go on a date"". I wasn't planning on saying that, but I did.

Surprisingly she didn't say yes or no instead she just said ""Why?"".

This was a total curveball for me and at the time I didn't know what to say so I said maybe the worst possible thing, which was ""Well I'm going to be back in \[city name\] for the next little while"". What I was trying to say was that I thought she was attractive in every possible way, and that now that we will both be living in the same city long term (instead of me just being there for my summer breaks) I would like to get to know her better.

Then she said ""Well I guess we could meet for coffee"", but the way she said it made it sound like she was somewhat uncomfortable/ didn't really want to to.

I didn't want to put her in an awkward position so I just said ""No worries, just take it as a compliment""

Then a couple more people got in the elevator and I just kinda stared of into space, looked at the time and said something irrelevant like ""well, sorry you're going to be late for class"" and she responded awkwardly with something like ""its fine"".

As soon as I got out of the elevator I was full of regret, she had told me that she had never been in a relationship the previous summer, and being as pretty as she was I would imagine she would have to turn down guys every week. I started to think (and spoke to a friend about this) that she was probably just feeling awkward about me asking her on a date and that she wanted to get to know me a little better than going on what I imagine would have been her first ""date"", especially considering that I hadn't spoke to her for more than two hours over the past year.

The bright side was I new that I would run into her the next day, so I thought really hard about what I was going to say. I was going to say something along the lines of ""I'm sorry for surprising you like that, you know as well as anyone that I don't have much of a filter sometimes, if you're still interested coffee would be nice.""

But when I tried to talk to her, maybe the worst possible thing happened. Her and I plus three others were talking at a work thing (little thing for all the past interns again, not really important).

I lightly touched her on the arm and said ""can we talk for a second?"" and she said ""No."".

Again this was totally surprising and I didn't know what to think, I still can't understand why she wouldn't give me a minute (in a public place) to just let me briefly clear the air.

So then I said ""I just wanted to say sorry"" and she said ""its ok"" and I said ""I'll see you around"" and left.

A week later I saw her at a conference, I didn't approach her and she didn't approach me (obviously). I don't think I will ever see again (outside of in passing).

TLDR: Asked a girl I knew on a date, she said ""why?"", I decided to reject her offer to meet for coffee, I approached her a week later and I think she's afraid of me now.

Sorry for the essay, I do feel bad about this, I would appreciate if the criticism could stay constructive."

She seemed so ok very the top, selfish and unnecessarily extra. It wasn't until she lost a falipian tube that her character grew on me. Too clarify, it was this moment that her character started gaining depth for me. 

SIDE NOTE: Does anyone else think there is a correlation  in Christina not wanting a child and her lost fallopian tube and her miscarriage. I don't believe there was ever a conversation about that ever again, neither with Owen but I might be mistaken. Nonetheless, it could be a stretch but I'm just wondering if the groundwork for her future relationships was sewed that young. 

Furthermore, the reason for this post is because I think Greys needs a intern or a resident with as much fire and love for the art of medicine as yang. Like seriously, it seems like everyone is so focused on relationships or finding themselves or their new married life. I miss 5he fround-breaking medicine aspect, the multi-episode season-long clinical trials. Stephanie was the last person who really showed a yang like spirit, bb it she left the show to Star in her HBO show. Like when she broke up with her boyfriend after his surgery, and when she defended she defended the child with sizures with Karev. We neeeanew Stephanie/Yang like character. 

I feel like Greys but sometimes it feels like Greys is preparing to end the show with everyone getting their lives. "
9z9uae,2,2018-11-21,ho to overcome resentment?,RRKHaloha,productivity,https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/9z9uae/ho_to_overcome_resentment/,"I will try to make it short, easier to read and engaging as possible. I really your advice or tips. thank you very much if you have read the post and responded.

i am currently in third year in electrical engineering of a uk uni. I am 22 y old. For the whole uni period, i have not socialised, took part of club or societies. To compensate my isolation, i am wasting my time watching random entertaining YouTube videos. I believe i got addicted, binge-watching videos on my bed. I got period of depression and instead stay on my bed the whole day watching youtube videos.

I did not have the motivation to be successful. I did not have the drive to do my best of studying. I believed that as long I passed my exams I will be alright. However I came to a realisation that just passing an exam is not enough, that you have to develop skills and gain experiences in order to be attractive to the employers.

I am very reluctant to socialise, not that i have social anxiety but because I despise social interaction due to bad experience or trauma. however I have realised that without interaction, I could not moved up.  Because of despising interaction, I did not partake societies so I could not gain experiences.

Nowadays, employers look for experience of placements or internships along with qualifications. It becomes  harder to find a career and people rely on networking to find a job. It's even hard to find a placements because lots of students apply.

I feel hopeless and faithless. however i would prefer to give all I have than doing nothing. So i decided to have no enjoyments, eating no junk foods(biscuits, noodles) or fine foods(no cheese, meats or alcohol), no entertainment and spend every second working hard.  however I still feel resentful because I wish to have worked hard, have studied hard. I am struggling of getting rid of resent.

How do i stop feeling resentful?"

9zaae3,1,2018-11-21,AITA for feeling unwanted at work and getting angry over not getting a monitor?,MasterFrost01,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/9zaae3/aita_for_feeling_unwanted_at_work_and_getting/,"So, this event requires quite a bit of background. I work as a software developer (kind of, see later), just graduated from university. Over summer last year, I worked for a small company (about 8 developers and 2 bosses/managers) doing a programming internship for three months, completely unpaid, even paying for my own transport costs. After graduating they offered me a temporary job for three months to do a short amount of work, with the possibility for extension, which I took. Importantly, my brother works there full time, which is how I got into the company. (would not recommended, not because I don't get on with *him*, as I do, but because it's hard not to worry any tension between me and other people (which I'm great at generating) won't somehow affect him)

I have got on really well with everyone there, including the bosses, Mary and Mark. While Mary and Mark act as management and team leaders, they also do marketing, client relations, presentations etc. Basically everything the company needs that isn't programming.

I really like everyone as people. But as coworkers, they're complete nightmares and do not get along at all. Two employee are always making snide remarks at each other under a very weak facade of ""I'm just joking!"" causing a lot of tension. Another employee is constantly late, delays meetings, argues with Mark and talks down to people he is supposed to be teaching. Circular arguments getting increasingly louder with immovable egos are incredibly common. Code is always written ""my way"" with no consistency. The bosses seem perfectly fine with all behaviour, with attempt to reprimand anyone. The way Mary handled my contract broke the law in minor ways at multiple points. Essentially, Mary and Mark seem pretty incompetent at management. It's worth mentioning the entire office is in one room so everyone can hear every conversation. Ultimately, we mutually didn't extend my contract because I did not want to work in that kind of environment. 

When I started I was given a pretty old laptop with a fairly damaged screen, but otherwise it did work fine. Ok, I thought, I'll just mainly use a monitor (everyone at the company has a laptop and one monitor, some people have two monitors). 

I asked Mary if there were any monitors I could use. She directed me to two old monitors, with a vga to vga cable, when my laptop only takes HDMI. I ask people if there are any vga to HDMI adapters, and they essentially say ""there might be some around"". The office is a complete mess with no organisation (of course), so I give up after a few minutes and buy one online. 

The cable arrives, and the monitors don't work. I tell Mary ""I don't think these monitors work with this laptop"" and she agrees the monitors are kind of crappy. I take the cable home and test on my own computer, and they do work, and my work laptop does work with my brother's monitors, meaning the fault is with the old monitors. I tell Mary ""these monitors don't work"". I don't remember the response, but I suppose I assumed I had implied I would like a monitor.

A week later, I mention to everyone during a team meeting, including Mary and Mark, that my monitors don't work. Nothing still happens so I think ""fine, I'm just a temp. Maybe their budget doesn't extend that far"" and left it, except sometimes jokingly mentioning to the others how nice it must be to have two monitors. I also mention in private to my brother how hard it is it work with no monitor, but I thought the issue was closed.

In their defence, I don't think I ever actually directly asked for them to buy me a new monitor, but it didn't really seem appropriate as a new employee and I wasn't really sure whether the employees bought and owned the monitors they used or if the company did (as it turned out, the company did), or what the standard procedure for well, anything was, bearing in mind this was my first professional job and I didn't want to overstep any boundaries. I also didn't have any kind of ""this is how things work here now"" as I had gone from an intern to an employee, and it had been a year.

I work for two months and the job I was supposed to be doing falls through and I get moved onto doing testing instead of programming, which is *not* what I agreed to, although it does say in my contract they can make me do whatever they think is appropriate. I do not like testing and am not good at it. The little bit of programming I'm expected to do is in a language I don't like and is back-end, when the original work was basically the exact opposite of these two things. I'm unable to do it and my brother has to take it from me, making me feel incredibly stupid and embarrassed. I do nothing and learn nothing for two months, making me already incredibly bitter and feel like I'm utterly wasting my time.

During this time there were a few other things that made me feel undervalued and completely unwanted there. Not unwanted personally, but professionally. However, I know I can be a little paranoid, so I ignore it I put down the way I've been treated to incompetence rather than intent. It'll be over soon anyway.

Two months are past and I have two weeks left. A new guy, Bob, starts working there temporarily for a few months just like me, same age as me too, although he's there to help with the management side of things rather than ""programming"". Mark is away on business and has been for a week or so, so Mary invites Bob to sit at Mark's desk and use his monitors until he gets back. I'm a little annoyed I hadn't been asked to sit there while Mark was away but whatever, I hadn't thought of it either.

A few days after Bob starts, Mary walks in carrying a brand new monitor in a box. Somehow, I already know what she's going to say. 

""Bob's new monitor has arrived!""

Apparently there wasn't a budget, there was just complete apathy. I'm absolutely livid. The angriest I have probably been in years. I want to fucking scream at someone, though I'm not sure what or who at. ""But *I* wanted a monitor!"" probably wouldn't achieve much. It's ridiculous over a fucking *monitor*, but I'm shaking with anger. It's embarrassing. Fortunately, I sit in the corner (worst spot in the office, obviously) and have my headphones in so I sit there for a bit until the conversation dies down and everyone is at their desk. I then go outside and calm down until I stop shaking. I sit back down and try to pretend everything is ok, which really, it should be, but my voice is still shaky and I'm so angry  I can't concentrate on my work for the rest of the day.

Now, as Bob is brand new and was already using a monitor, I doubt he asked for a monitor, Mary would have bought him one.

Somehow the conversation gets back onto monitors and I say something like ""As Bob has a new monitor, could I have a monitor please?""

My brother responds with ""oh, did you actually want a monitor?"". 

Although it's not his responsibility to buy equipment for me, it's Mary's, this still pisses me off. I say as calmly as possible while still an irritated voice ""*Of course* I want a monitor. I mentioned *multiple times* that the monitors you gave me don't work"". 

""Oh, I didn't know that"". Which is a blatant lie. I'm not sure how much clearer I could be than ""these monitors don't work"".

My brother gave me one of his monitors that works, but it's all a bit bittersweet. Mary still hasn't bought me a monitor.


Just to clarify, I'm not angry about Bob getting a monitor and me not, not really. I'm angry that Mary decided that Bob would get something she should have known I needed to be efficient. Someone that did not spend three months doing completely free work and someone that did not spend two weeks trying to politely prompt her. How else am I meant to feel but unwanted in that workplace?

I'm angry at the complete apathy I feel is directed towards me, for no apparent reason. I'm angry that I'm treated like an intern not an employee. The monitor was just the final straw. If I wasn't leaving already, I would think about quitting asap.

So I don't think I'm an asshole for being annoyed about the monitor thing, but am I the asshole for being being entitled? Am I the asshole for being as angry as I am over something trivial? Am I the asshole for not trying hard enough to communicate and then getting angry?"

9zb0zg,12,2018-11-22,The Holiday Blues,boatofnoodles,ChildrenofDeadParents,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChildrenofDeadParents/comments/9zb0zg/the_holiday_blues/,"It was three years ago today that I came home for Thanksgiving break to find my vibrant, vivacious mother seeming a bit ""off.""  I thought it odd that she didn't enthusiastically gobble down her Thanksgiving feast, but she mentioned she had been having a stomach ache that week.  She was an elementary school technology teacher, so she was always around germy kids so it was nothing too concerning.  I didn't think much of it, except for lamenting how unfortunate the timing was for someone who loves to eat!  But, as she affirmed, she was just so happy to have both my sister and me in the same place at once since we aren't always able to get the whole family together much, and she could always have turkey while she couldn't always enjoy our whole family's company.

&amp;#x200B;

Two days later, Saturday morning after Thanksgiving,  I came downstairs to embark upon our annual mother-daughter Christmas shopping extravaganza, which was always a blast because my mother was the most giving, thoughtful, and fun person I've ever known and watching the wheels in her head turn as she excitedly thought of how to put together the most incredible, creative presents for others was seriously almost more fun than being on the receiving end of those perfectly planned, lovely gifts.  My mother was yellow.  Like... Simpsons yellow.  My dad and I were able to convince her to go to the emergency room, recognizing that there was obviously something seriously wrong, but not believing my mother, who was only 65 and who led a pretty healthy life overall--never smoked, had one alcoholic beverage in her entire life, didn't drink coffee at all or much soda, ate reasonably healthfully despite loving food, exercised--would be gone exactly 14 days later.

&amp;#x200B;

Fuck pancreatic cancer.

&amp;#x200B;

My dad has been an empty, depressed shell of a man for the last three years as he was with my mother for 40+ years.  At least, he said, he had his health and his girls.

&amp;#x200B;

Welp.  He's been diagnosed with Stage IV lung cancer.  This is almost certainly the last holiday season we will enjoy together.

&amp;#x200B;

I have always been closer to my parents than most of my friends.  My mother was my best friend and confidante, my dad is my number one cheerleader and fan.  After the loss of my mother, I lost my sense of self, my confidence, and my sense of competence and control in my life.  Just as I started to bounce back, trying to do what I know would make her proud by working on my MSW with a 4.0 while serving as an intern and volunteer connecting homeless individuals to community resources and directly providing counseling services to those with severe mental and behavioral health diagnoses, my father's illness has shaken my already-fragile world.

&amp;#x200B;

It is difficult to feel pride in my work while I wonder if my dad will be around to see me graduate next year.  It is hard to enjoy anything when I know he is suffering through unpleasant chemo and immunotherapy side effects for weeks at a time when he goes to receive his treatments every 21 days.  It is impossible to feel joy in the season despite the fact that most of my fondest memories were formed during holiday seasons spent in my childhood home with my amazing, kind, supportive parents.  I'm 30, and I feel like I will never be able to flourish or find joy in life again.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't really know what I am getting out of this post; I guess some catharsis because I don't feel like I can talk to anyone in life about my despair and emptiness.  I feel like I shouldn't even be sad because the burden I bear does not compare to that of the clients I serve, and yet, I am utterly, completely, devastatingly... just sad.  I don't like the holidays so much anymore, and this year, especially this and presumably next month, is proving to be one of the most difficult of my life."

&amp;#x200B;

And everything that I have accomplished and learned this semester is going to inform my internship for next year.  I am seeing how the systems in place are broken firsthand and, since I am in a direct service capacity right now, I see so many opportunities to make the world a better place.  It sounds very pie-in-the-sky, but honestly, learning how to navigate these systems in a micro capacity is revealing some realistic paths on which I can embark to make a positive impact on a more macro level.

Oh!  And on that note, mom--I have some really amazing potential opportunities lined up with DC think tanks, research institutes, and maybe even within governmental entities.  I'm still in the searching phase, but I've been working hard to network and have talked to some pretty impressive people doing important work.  And guess what?  Every single person with whom I have had an informational interview has told me that they'd be thrilled to supervise me based on my academic success, enthusiasm, out-of-the box ideas for changing the sociopolitical landscape, and general philosophy.  So much of that is directly attributable to you.

I am going to change the world, just like you always predicted.  Thank you for teaching me to be a good person.

9zbn90,3,2018-11-22,Need Comp Sci advice from Hunter students and grads,AmbulantePhilomath,HunterCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/HunterCollege/comments/9zbn90/need_comp_sci_advice_from_hunter_students_and/,"Hey [r/HunterCollege/](https://www.reddit.com/r/HunterCollege/),

I was recently admitted to (and accepted) Hunter as a second-degree student for Comp Sci and I would like to know what you guys think of the program. I am a Baruch alumni, graduated in 2014, and since then I've had a failed business, worked in operations for 1.5 years, and worked for a law firm for 4 months before deciding to quit and go back to school.

I am trying to pivot into the tech industry, but I'm interested in various positions from business analyst/data science, web developer/software engineering, and project management. Friends told me I should go to a bootcamp, but Flatiron, Fullstack, and HackReactor are all more expensive then CUNY/Hunter. I also think as an undergrad in Comp Sci it could open more doors for internships in these various positions.

My second goal it to get a Masters in Comp Sci, and become a part-time adjunct. I haven’t had my advisement appointment yet, but I saw that Hunter has a new MA program and was wondering if I could do a dual BA/MA. I’m going to ask the department when I have the chance, but if anyone on reddit knows. Feel free to comment.

Anyway, I'm seeking advice and opinions about Hunter's Comp Sci program:

1. What has been your experience with the program?
2. If you are a grad, how are the job prospects? 
3. Current students/recent alumni. How are the internship opportunities? 
4. One of my goals it to be an undergrad TA, how competitive is it to be a Comp Sci TA at Hunter?
5. Any other advice?

P.S. I have been learning to program for 4 months, mainly Python and SQL. I also plan on doing IT certs like CompTIA A+, and a couple of MicroMasters via edX. 

My original goal was to do a masters and apply for NYU’s bridge program at Tandon ([https://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/degrees-programs/bridge-program-nyu-tandon](https://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/degrees-programs/bridge-program-nyu-tandon)), but it cost more money than an undergrad/masters at CUNY."
9zcatw,1,2018-11-22,Still Not sure if I should marry him... (Long posts so sorry),InDeepIsh,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9zcatw/still_not_sure_if_i_should_marry_him_long_posts/,"Hey everyone!

So a few days ago I posted about being indecisive about going through with my wedding because I have been up to my chin in frustration with my fiancé.

I really wanted to just vent at the time but the responses I got all told me to leave out of my relationship. Again, I wrote my post when I was upset (both angry and sad) over the situation to gain clarity. Let me be clear in saying you cannot gain clarity when dealing with either of those emotions.  Now that I am more level-headed I would like to repose this question to Reddit because although I took the responses to heart and have thought them over, I want to make sure my decision isn’t swayed by answers related to extreme emotions.

Basically my fiancé and I have been going back and forth for months because I have felt stressed about our budget not simply with the wedding but entirely with everything.  My fiancé has no idea how to save and it has lead to him missing payments on items he could easily afford if he just watched his spending habits.

One reason I was so upset is that he had missed a bunch of payments on his student loans and my engagement ring (which he had said was bought outright but was not). These of course hit his credit and rather than telling me he took me house shopping. When I found out I was livid and felt embarrassed to be so excited for a house we clearly couldn’t get. (Mind you I had been saving toward our down payment and him not so much).

The second reason is we have not seen eye to eye on romance ever. Being engaged has emphasized this as I find myself desiring things he cannot give me or chooses not to do. On my side I love to give gifts and spend time together. For this reason I go all out for his birthday, shower him with gifts, take him out of town, involve him in any events I go to etc. - I learned his love language was actually physical touch and although I have not let up on my way of showing love I have tried to appease his love language by cuddling more, going to bed when he does so we can sleep together (actually sleep), PDA, and give massages often.  On my hand he doesn’t seem to get what I want or need.  Anniversaries, birthdays, graduations and anything else significant he constantly drops the ball on. I feel like I’m asking for too much because I don’t appreciate what he does do because I feel like he isn’t really trying (he only does something if he can tell I am upset because I tend to shut down and shut him out as I don’t like to go back and forth when I feel I’m not cared for).  An example is for my birthday he made no plans, I asked for weeks if there was an outfit I needed to buy or what as I was excited about what I could anticipate. The day of he asked if I wanted to go wine tasting and because my birthday is a holiday they were booked - no appointment set. Other times he will take me to a generic restaurant or want to stay home and watch Netflix (which we do all the time). I guess because I plan for events so far in advance and do so much to celebrate his milestones it bothers me that he does not as well. We have talked about this being a concern of mine for years but he doesn’t get it the way I wish he would. I started the Live Dare Challenge to try to rework my though process and appreciate his actions more but I am honestly still upset that he doesn’t think outside of the box or present grand items when he knows these are my desires and interest (I don’t just want them from him, I treat myself often because it’s what I like).

He also has a “strange” sense of ambition. He looks for the easy route to money which usually leads to working harder instead of smarter and a lack of security. In the 6 years we have been together he has been laid off twice and after this last time he finally understands why I’ve been pushing for him to attain at least an associates degree.  I’ve explained over and over that there is a lack of security with him hoping job to job with nothing to fall back on.  I myself and in route to pursuing a masters degree and I don’t like the feeling that my partner and I don’t value education the same or have similar work ethics.  

Security, romance, and finances have made me feel unsure of him a lot lately because they haven’t changed for years.  I love him but with these looming I’m not sure I want to marry him anymore as I realize these may never change - or at least for good.  (Mind you these have always been the case but being engaged has magnified my fears).

On the other hand the last month he has been trying to get himself together.  And this is why I am so torn.

He started a new job to get the bills paid but has also reached out for help to try to gain an internship related to his new field of study.  He has been aceing all of his exams as he turns down “guy time” to study.  Although he may not have bought me items he started running bubble baths for me weekly for when I get off my shift once a week (it’s always the night I have my mandatory double) as a way to romance me.  He started reading self-development books and applying them to how he communicates with me and goes after life (they have lead to him wanting to put money into business ventures which I’m not fond of but he has a budgeted amount of how much he is putting in and so I’ve been supporting him even though I’m uncertain of the venture itself).  He had his job change his direct deposit for everything to go into our joint account so I could assist with the finances, and is looking for the second job to pay off the small debts he has been holding onto for years.  Besides all of that he is a kind person, understands and takes care of me when I deal with my extreme lows with depression, and exaggerated paranoia but with anxiety. He lives my family and they adore him. He enjoys my company, and although he is not so great with finances he is definitely better at cooking and cleaning than me and take on the tasks before myself.  I can see that he is changing but my heart is unsure because I’m not sure if it’s too late or that these changes are big enough. Idk, I feel so mean being unsure meanwhile he’s 100% in.

In a fit of rage and depression I downplayed how much work he is doing to change. It’s only been a month but he is trying. I love him but I’m scared due to the past actions being so shady and because of finding out about the bill skipping related to house hunting. He wants me to give him a chance but I’m scared and I’ve been so frustrated with the financial aspect of our wedding planning, house hunting, saving, etc.

My questions are: In your opinion from the surface of information you’ve gotten do you think pursuing marriage is still a good idea, or am I making a mistake?"

9zfaw5,10,2018-11-22,Why do I auto reject women? How can I move passed this?,Neil1398,asktrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/9zfaw5/why_do_i_auto_reject_women_how_can_i_move_passed/,"So tbh I haven’t had a girlfriend since I was 14 and I’m 20 now. That last girl I didn’t even want to go out with. I just kinda felt pressure to ask her because she liked me and I broke it off after like 2 weeks. I was more interested in another girl who I also started to auto reject by ignoring her at some points. 

Anyway through high school, I didn’t have a single girlfriend. I think I wanted one but I just didn’t feel like dealing with everything that came with it. And I mean this is mostly a me thing. I noticed that when I started to approach women in hs, I’d eventually stop talking to them. I literally still do that to this day. It’s like I feel like my initial approach was a waste of time if I don’t keep talking and building something with her.

Last time I approached a girl was a couple of months ago at my college and I just stopped talking to her. It was mostly a mental thing for me. She was beautiful and I’d take the train home with her but I guess I just felt awkward and so I just stopped. Even though I think I coulda at least ask her out. I feel like that was a waste because she had some interest.

Now to this day if a girl shows high interest in me( I can read it like the back of my hand honestly pre approach like staring or standing close to me) I completely shut off and act cold asf. 

There was this Asian girl in my class that I didn’t notice until a fire drill one day. I was standing by myself waiting to go back inside the building and then she was standing right next to me and I knew what was up. I immediately started to feel the butterflies and winded up not saying anything. To this day I ignore her and act like she doesn’t exist. I do this with other girls too.

Any insight on to why I did this? Be real. I think I’m scared to approach but it’s like I’ll approach other girls who show no interest at all and wind up getting jerked around. Maybe I like that. 

Maybe I don’t know what to do when everything is put in front of me and I’m scared to fuck it up so I just decide not to take action.  Idk maybe I’m gay lol (hope not). I just find it so weird. With this I always keep my composure as well like I look like I’m all good but inside I want that girl that showed me interest but I’m scared to fuck it up so I bury everything skin deep. Then I can’t figure out why I do the things I do so I ask a question on reddit lol.

Most dudes would jump at that opportunity. I don’t for some reason. I don’t feel uncomfortable with myself. I have a life(go to school have an internship do martial arts ) I’m not an bad looking and I know these things to myself. Maybe I know there’s more I have to work on like conversation because I’m a pretty quiet dude and sometimes can’t talk to people.

Is there anything you guys suggest  I do? Maybe I’m scared of fucking it up and want perfection in everything I do and don’t want to be humiliated.

Even walking down the street now if there’s a girl staring ill just avoid her contact and not look or pay attention to her.

Happy Thanksgiving guys!"

9zgsvg,9,2018-11-22,Today I found out that I have adrenal fatigue and the symptoms are hitting me like a train - would be grateful if someone could read through my story and answers my questions,DerJogge,adrenalfatigue,https://www.reddit.com/r/adrenalfatigue/comments/9zgsvg/today_i_found_out_that_i_have_adrenal_fatigue_and/,"So this is my story and I'm really sorry for this long text but I had to write it off my chest in the hope somebody could give me a hint or advice that I missed out. I know it takes a long time to heal...Man where do I start...it's hard to think straight, it's hard to even remember what I was doing a few minutes ago, it's hard to concentrate and to read a text that is longer than a few sentences, it's so hard to do anything, I am so tired...I guess I start by telling something about my background and I hope there is someone willing to read through it all, you have no clue how thankful I am for any kind of advise or kind words. 

I am 24 years old and my life was a complete mess. I started smoking weed at the age of 15 while regularly getting drunk. It all was fine til the point my parents caught me smoking weed and forced me to do piss tests. I didn't accept their way of educating me and abused weed when ever I could and then got anxient and stressed out about the fact that I might get caught. I often got caught which led to more anger and stress because my parents would be mad about myself. This went on for quiet some years, many withdrawals of weed and cigarettes. I managed to do the highest degree of school did a internship as a bank worker while partying every weekend. As the years went by chemical drugs as MDMA and amphetamines joined my side and life was an upside down of depression, failure and disappointment. I stressed out my body and mind for to long and I knew if I was going on like that I would hit rock bottom - so I turned around my life in a way nobody would expected. I stopped literally everything. Frist the amphetamines on the weekend, then the weed and cigarettes, then porn/masturbation, alcohol, video gaming, caffeine. I stopped every bad habit since end of May til the start of July.  And I never did and will return to any kind of substance or fake stimulation. I'm tired of them - I'm tired of being tired all the time. I'm tired of having visual snow and a kind of derealized feeling (which in my eyes comes from the extreme fatigue/stress that I'm carrying around since years). I'm tired of having my tinnitus (which isn't a problem on good days but frustrating on bad days). I'm tired of being unfocused, forgetful and not being able to think straight and work even on the smallest problems with my mind. 

Since I stopped all the bullshit I picked up jogging/working out again. I went from vegetarian to a gluten-free vegan. I'm meditating since I stopped my addictions. I only take a cold-shower everyday. I started working again. I started studying at a university. I started my drivers license. I found the best girlfriend possible. I moved out of my parents house into my own basement. And I guess it's all to much at the moment. My concentration-problems , overall motivation-problem and overall fatigue won't fade away it even gets stronger. I supplemented a lot of things at the start of my healing phase then stopped for a while and since 1-2 weeks I supplement all kinds of vitamins (b complex, c, d), Baldrian for sleeping well, Zinc, omega 3 acids. 

I just found out of adrenal fatigue today and all the symptoms fit me like a glove. My adrenal is tired so it won't produce and kind of neurotransmitters, messes up my cortisol and thus my blood sugar. The light-headed feeling all the time, the dizziness when standing up to fast or coming up from a crouch-position. The extreme tiredness after 2-3 hours of being awake (I'm waking up tired as well), the tiredness around 15-17 o'clock. Dark circles around my eyes. I reacted positive on the pupil test you can do when you think you have adrenal fatigue. I got so many symptoms I'm having trouble listing them all but I'm pretty sure this is where all the trouble is coming from. In my past I abused my Dopamin and Adrenalin system by playing violent video games like pubg for many hours, snorting amphetamines on the weekends, watching porn/masturbation, smoking weed and so on. I guess my adrenal needs a long time to recover since the symptoms of yearly abusing them won't fade over night. My overall mental state really got better over the last few months but I still got the feeling of an underlying thing that I'm missing. I have certain moments of clarity where I feel super good and where everything makes sense, where I can coordinate my thoughts, a state where I reach 100 % satisfaction of just being myself. But these are rare moments and I really don't know what causes this few hours of a ""working"" brain. Beside all the healing going I'm stressing myself mentally too much. I identified that I have unhealthy thinking patterns but when you're tired and mentally weak it's hard to stay focused on not getting into negative thought spirals. It's hard to not stress yourself and being anxient while your whole vision is kinda unreal and when you constantly feel disconnected from reality. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL,DR: I abused my mind and body over several years with certain substances, weed, alcohol, PMO, cigarettes, etc. Now I'm in my healing phase and my life greatly improves but I still suffer from severe symptoms.

&amp;#x200B;

Do you guys have any advices for me? What to look for? What to watch out for when I'm supplementing? How long is this whole process going (I know this answer is not easy)? Has anyone in here had the same history of abusing yourself? Just tell me anything you might think would be helpful.

Some things in addition: My sleep got really better over the last 1-2 weeks. I'm not dreaming that much anymore and I have no troubles falling asleep and sleeping through. I ordered some Ashwagandha and L-Tyrosine (the amino-acid from which Dopamin and thus the other transmitters get build of). I really hope that L-Tyrosine will be beneficial. I just heard of adrenal fatigue by reading customer reviews under the product I ordered. L-Tyrosine gets transformed inside the adrenal and I think this really could help. I already supplemented L-Phenylalanin since it's the amino-acid L-Tyrosine gets build of but I read there can be a problem transforming L-Phenylalanin into L-Tyrosine due to stress. One reason of my symptoms might be the fact that there is no resources in my adrenal that can be build in to Dopamin, adrenalin, etc. maybe someone has a thought or experience on that?

&amp;#x200B;

Shoutout to everyone suffering and to everyone that is helping

Peace to y'all

9zgwv4,0,2018-11-22,My Daughter Won't Come Home From College,perplexedreminders,Parenting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/9zgwv4/my_daughter_wont_come_home_from_college/,"My daughter is 19 and a sophomore in college. She never comes home from college. She didn't come home for thanksgiving, winter break, spring break, or summer. The last time I saw her was when I dropped her off at her dorm for her freshman year. Shortly after moving into her dorm, she told me that she was applying to transfer to another college (her 'dream' school). Then in April of her freshman year, she told me that she got accepted to transfer. I was excited because I thought I would finally see my daughter again as she would need help moving to her new college (she doesn't have a car). Turns out she moved to her new college (which was 150 miles away from her current college) without my help; she apparently got there and moved her stuff with the help of a friend who was also transferring to the same college. She told me that she was staying at the new college over the summer so that she could get a job and some other stuff. It's now the end of November, and I still haven't see my daughter in person. I call her a few times a week, and we talk a bit, but it always seems like she doesn't really want to talk to me. She never calls home. I'm always the one that calls her. We've never been super close, but it seems like she's just making a bunch of excuses just so that she doesn't have to visit home. Whenever I ask her if she's going to visit us, she says she can't because she 'has a job', 'has an internship', or is 'spending time with her friends'. I have a feeling she's never going to visit home again. I'm honestly so upset that she made such a big change in her life (transferring to another college) without any of my help. The college she goes at is 3 hours away from our home, so I can't just go and visit her. It breaks my heart that she won't come home, even just for one day. She even calls her college ""home"". What should I do?"
9zhi2q,7,2018-11-22,"Can I financially justify moving 12 hours back home, paying for a lease I won't use, and facing long-term unemployment to confront several serious mental health issues?",[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/9zhi2q/can_i_financially_justify_moving_12_hours_back/,"I'm going to try and keep this as organized as possible, thank you for your patience.

&amp;#x200B;

**My background:** 

I've had some problems with depression and anxiety since I was young, and come from a rough background: my mother passed away when I was 12, my father suffered from severe alcoholism, and as an only child I raised myself through most of high school. My father died when I was 18, and I sold off our house, camp, etc. and put away about $65,000. I continued to struggle with occasional bouts of anxiety and depression, but was able to function through most of it. I graduated in January with a 3.68 GPA, a two liberal arts degrees, and internship experience. I decided to pay off all of my loans while still in grace using the money from my family's assets and have no other loans, debt, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

**My current situation:**

 I didn't have any life plans other than law school, so three friends and I started looking at moving out of our small, northeastern rust-belt city. We settled on a medium-sized city down south, and after a summer of waiting tables at a local country club I saved up $5,000 and we made the move in October. But I had a few problems happen almost simultaneously: my mental issues flared up; I realized it would be immensely more practical to study the LSAT more, apply earlier in the next cycle, and wait until 2020 to start law school; I realized that I didn't want to wait tables until 2020 (no disrespect, it's a great job!). 

&amp;#x200B;

I have had recurring panic attacks, suicidal thoughts, and depressive days since. I attended a walk-in, state-funded clinic and was thankfully able to get on a medication plan. Still, the rest of my family and myself have been concerned about my mental health; this is the worst I've ever felt, and on my worst days I feel worthless, suicidal, helpless, and desperate. My lease was only six months, and ends in April. When it was peaking the thought of even starting a new job would send me into hysteria and my social anxiety was so bad that I couldn't even talk to my roommates without crying or getting unreasonably angry about nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

I have $1,000 of that personal money left and $15,000 from my family assets.

&amp;#x200B;

**My options/dilemmas:** 

I am considering moving home where I can reactivate my healthcare and live with a close family friend who I normally stayed with between semesters. I would be able to go back to working occasional holiday parties at the country club, and devote more time to working on my mental health and other things (i.e. fitness, exploring work opportunities I am interested in, studying for the LSAT etc.). I think that I would be able to more holistically focus on all of these over 1-3 months than I would living with my friends away from home. I also have friends back home, so I wouldn't be isolated.

&amp;#x200B;

The downsides are obvious: I would be living with family rather than independently, I would be paying roughly $1600 to settle a lease I may not ever use again, and it could be 3 months before I find a job in D.C., NY, or Boston that I could justify working. It also means that, for the first time in years, I would be relying on my family money that I've tried to keep set aside. Realistically I don't have much personal money left and could end up spending up to $5,000 of that family money before I have a base for significantly building up my own finances again. I hate using it because I didn't earn it and it makes me feel financially irresponsible- but on the other hand this might be the last chance for me to honestly begin confronting the things that have sabotaged other parts of my life, and that make make it a justifiable investment?

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't been thinking clearly lately and hope to make a decision soon, so I want to use this opportunity to seek objective opinion before I lapse back into a bad state: what are your thoughts on my plan and the situation surrounding it? I welcome any criticisms or insights! Thank you! 

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR- I have some serious mental health issues, and may need to spend $1600 on a lease, move back home, and be basically unemployed for 3-4 months while I look for new work and confront my problems- is that a cost worth incurring to deal with non-financially related issues? I am 23, have no student loan debt, two bachelors degrees, a good GPA, and $15,000 from assets I sold off when my parents died. My goal is to attend law school in two years.**

9zi15h,1,2018-11-22,I'm (22M) stuck living with my now ex(?) (F22). We also work at the same internship site,throwaway1029385746,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9zi15h/im_22m_stuck_living_with_my_now_ex_f22_we_also/,"My ex and I are part of a medical graduate program that requires us to go on several clinical internships at sites we pick from around the country. About 5 months ago my ex of 2 years and I were really happy together and doing pretty well supporting each other through school so we decided to plan our first 4week clinical together in Miami.

Not long after that we started fighting... a lot. About pretty much everything. We've had close to a dozen ""break ups"" where we made up after we both cooled off. I think a big reason we always ended up making up is because we see each other almost every waking hour during classes, studying together, many mutual friends, hanging out every weekend, etc. and we didn't want things to be uncomfortable. Another  big reason is because we knew we'd be spending literally 24hrs/day together on our first clinical.

So fastforward to yesterday, day 3 of our clinical, and we get into a huge argument about our thanksgiving plans since neither of us have any family nearby. She wanted a really structured, activity filled day, I just wanted to play things by ear and decide as we go. It ended with her getting mad and saying she was just going to do her own thing. She then asked me to give her my car keys (we drove down together so we only have one car between us for a month) since I wasn't going to be using my car and laying around all day (not true, I just wanted to relax a bit more). I refused and she turned hysterical, hitting me, trying to wrestle the keys from me, yelling, etc. Eventually she decided she didn't want me sleeping in the same bed and tried to kick me out (using physical force). I refused since I also paid for the bed and have as much right as she does to it. Eventually she settled down and we went to sleep, with me bruised and scratched up. 

This morning, she again tried to fight me for the keys because she wanted to go to the beach, and I ended having to push her out of the way of the door so I could leave. I decided to just drive off because I couldn't stand to be with her anymore. I went to the beach by myself just to cool off and clear my head. I turned my phone off when I got there and when I turned it back on a few hours later I saw about 40 missed calls and texts telling me to come back and that I was ruining her Thanksgiving forcing her to be stuck at home. At one point she told me she called her parents and told them what I did (idk what that would accomplish) and threatened to call my mother, who just had a heart attack a few days ago, in the middle of Thanksgiving dinner to tell her I was abusing my ex.

Sorry this kinda turned into a rant, but the bottom line is I don't want to associate woth her anymore, I've finally had enough. Now we are stuck together 24/7 for 3 more weeks and I don't know how to handle it. She has no other way of getting around to get to our clinical site, to get food, do laundry, etc. And i'm really scared that she is going to try to make up stories about me abusing her to tell our school, our clinical coordinator, our friends, etc. She has already threatened to do so and i'm aftaid it will just be my word against hers. I trapped and scared that something that happens over the coming weeks will affect my standing at school or professionally. I don't know what to do.

Tl;dr - My ex and I are stuck together 24/7 for 3 more weeks for school and I'm afraid of professional, academic, social, or even legal repercussions if I end things and cut her off

9ziql8,241,2018-11-22,"""TUMBLR IS DYING! Artists Suddenly Purged from Site"" - Clownfish TV Weighs in on the Tumblr Purge. supposedly the purge was just loli art rather than real child porn and every animator did Rule34. Tumblr is also losing money and its own community makes the site horrible.",KaltatheNobleMind,KotakuInAction,https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/9ziql8/tumblr_is_dying_artists_suddenly_purged_from_site/,"##[TUMBLR IS DYING! Artists Suddenly Purged from Site | Clownfish TV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoeDWX8SU7M)

in this Hour and 14-minute video Clownfish TV's  Kneon and GeekySparkles tackle the recent Tumblr Purge.

they read one article that claims Tumblr's child abuse scan didn't work because there were images not in the database. Kneon and GeekySparkles speculate and one super chat user confirms said images were likely hand drawn loli art that would not have been in the database.

this actually segues into a small rant about SJW hypocrisy where they call vocal critics of the She-Ra designs (such as GeekySparkles) perverts who were upset that their underage heroine wasn't ""fappable"" only for a cursory glance on Tumblr showing copious amounts of She-Ra X Catra Rule34 who are canonically minors. (although they just show mainly Safe For Work images).

they also give some insight to the history of Tumblr where it was made by an intern from Frederator Studios (which backed him) and was meant to be a blog platform geared towards creators like Writers and artists.  it eventually (d)evolved into the rule34 fanart free-for-all where artists sold commissions until they moved to patreon.  it attracted a certain kind of audience eventually but its golden years were from 2009 to 2012.

they also mention how almost all commercial and studio artists dabbled in rule34, showcasing Steven Universe Creator Rebecca Sugar who did Ed, Edd n Eddy rule34 back on LiveJournal (considered proto tumblr) and how it got her a shoutout in Cartoon Brew, the premier Animation journal.

apparently, rule34 is very lucrative and comics artist Kneon recalls commissions of Disney characters which he refused since he worked for Disney at the time.

anyway because of their reputation and community Tumblr is effectively killing itself as it's purging to what amounts to a 3rd of its user base and the sole draw to their platform.

they read a Daily Dot article talking about all the NSFW artists being permabanned.  they aren't just taking down the risque blogs but the clean ones as well and are permabanning the users.  

also with no warning, so artists who built 5-year portfolios and followings just lose everything (Kneon and Geeky advise not to keep everything on one host for this fear).

apparently, the purge started when a Twitter user pointed out how Tumblr was teaming with child porn and child sex abuse content and so Tumblr took immediate and drastic action.

apparently, a lot of Tumblr artists are moving to Twitter.

they give more advice on the benefits of hosting your own content and 3rd party hosts will drop you as they experienced on a blog they ran regarding leaked Lego Star Wars Toys,[ something I posted about in regards to another youtuber.](https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/6x5n9m/justiceforjang_popular_lego_toy_reviewer/?st=jot4go5k&amp;sh=27d1e35f#thing_t3_6x5n9m)

they go on a small tangent about at least one troll who attacked their daughter for not liking the She-Ra reboot calling her ""Femspawn"" and throw the usual ist-isms.

Geeky remembers a time where not liking something was okay to do and talk about how good He-Man 2002 was and how the DC Comics He-Man run did a wonderful modernized She-Ra. 

after they shoot the shit they talk about how Yahoo,Tumblr's current owners, kills every company they aquire.

they then tackle a Kotaku article which talks about the rampant harassment Tumblr does.

it mentions how Tumblr blew up because Livejournal users migrated as the site's new owners banned NSFW work and brought the same toxic fandom with them making Tumblr just as bad.

they burn the rest of the time shooting the shit."

Since it’s pretty hard to get a job in infosec or cybersecurity I thought this would be the ideal path for me. But there is something in me that makes me sometimes think I shouldn’t do it even tho I know that I should take it. Would like to hear your thoughts on my situation."

Hey APP! So, by the title of this post, I'm guessing that you figured out that I want to play as a younger guy, we can discuss age in the description, that somehow ends up getting together for a secret sexual relationship with a celebrity.

I have a few ideas for this, and they all really depend on what sort of celebrity you play as (Singer, model, actress). However, they all generally include us spending a lot of time alone for whatever reason and this time allows us to build a good strong relationship without anyone else around.

1. I play as an intern at a recording/photography/movie studio that you are supposed to be working with.

2. I am your new assistant.

3. I am an interviewer who comes over to your house, and the interview begins to get pretty flirty and touchy before we end up fucking, making it a regular thing.

4. I am a new up and coming actor that won the chance to costar in a film with you and we decide to spend some time together and alone to get to know each other.

5. I am a lucky fan that got to spend a weekend with you at a resort.

6. I could be the son of a very important executive you are trying to get to sponsor your next project.

We can think of many more! Please message me with any celebs you are interested in playing! Also, [see my other prompts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/7odzp0/m4f_calling_all_submissives_who_want_to_be_made/) if you'd like more ideas of what we could play.

My kinks are: Raceplay (Especially Asian women), worship (you worship my dick), cuckolding, oral, anal, impregnation, BDSM (light), Bondage (light), clothing, bimbos"
9zm2gp,2,2018-11-23,I'm Having a nervous breakdown about my teeth,OverpricedGoods,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/9zm2gp/im_having_a_nervous_breakdown_about_my_teeth/,"Bit of a warning but long read ahead

So a bit of background info:

Last year I left my parents home and moved to a completely new state because I thought I would be happier living with my girlfriend than being miserable with my parents. Since then we've got an apartment, for the most part we're happy, and I got a new job. I even obtained a license in Six Sigma and looking for a better job. 

Now Im freaking out because my teeth are in extremely poor condition. Here are some highlights:
*My top 2 molars are completely eroded on the inward sides. It feels like a downward hill when I rub it with my finger
*My bottom molar is cupped
*Im pretty sure I see a hole in one of my back teeth

There is no pain in my teeth, but I just know for a fact I fucked myself possibly beyond repair. This was all caused by a myriad of things:
1. I'm already complacent in terms of dental hygiene. I barely brushed my teeth even back then because of depression and laziness. This is because usually dental checkups/cleanups would put be back on the right track. But back then I was on my parent's dental insurance and I personally didn't pay a dime. I haven't had a dental visit in about a year and a half now and it shows. When I got my new job I actually decided to opt out of Dental because i work part time (5 days per 2 weeks). Now i work 8-9 days per 2 weeks but back then i thought we needed to save every penny. It was one year without dental, what could go wrong?

2. As I said I work part time. It's at a hospital and I work from 6 pm to 230 am. So I usually get up at 11 am usually and got bed at 3. At night im sometimes too tired to brush my teeth.

3. I am addicted to soda. 1-2 cans a day. Im pretty sure I swish a little bit too by accident

Im not ashamed to see a dentist, and i signed up for a dental ppo for next year. But im worrying about multiple things:
1. The cost. I only have about 1 month of rent in savings. I've been living paycheck to paycheck. I don't want to have operations done on me if i can't afford it now or in the future. And no, this is not savings all from my new job. These are savings that dwindled from my old job (I had 7k from an old internship now its 800).
2. While im picking up a lot of shifts part time, my hours are getting cut back (new staff). Im applying to new jobs since i got my certification by i feel that will process will be months long before finding a new job.
3. What happens if i just don't do anything about it? Will all my teeth fall out? Will that effect my chances of getting a new job and just cement me into poverty?

On top of the shame of the thought of losing my teeth im worried sick thinking about how much this will cost me even with insurance. I know what mistakes I've made. If i could kick myself in the past i would. But all of this have been driving me with almost suicidal thoughts.

I don't know what my options are at this point.

9zm6fy,0,2018-11-23,AITA for trying to plan a day of baking cookies with my father?,Dr_Elizabeth,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/9zm6fy/aita_for_trying_to_plan_a_day_of_baking_cookies/,"A little bit of background, I am 20 years old and my parents got divorced when I was 11. My dad got remarried almost immediately afterwards and our once close relationship has been rocky for many years due to the fact that his current wife and I can never seem to get along. 

On my dad’s side of the family we have a traditional Christmas cookie recipe that everyone makes every year and my dad and I have been making them together every year pretty much since I was able to reach the counter. My brother, 18 (For the sake of the story we will call him S)  makes them with us most years too and since my dad got remarried my stepsister, 15 (for the sake of the story we will call her A) has joined in with us on this tradition.  Also my stepmom has two sons J who lives in another state with A and T who lives with my dad and stepmom. 

Today was thanksgiving so my brother (S) and I went over to my dad and stepmom’s house. My stepsister (A) is also visiting for the holiday and staying through the weekend (she usually lives in another state with her father). The last time I saw all of them was back in August so I was a bit worried I’d get the usual complaints of not seeing them enough but that didn’t really happen this time. We actually had a really really good time. We had dinner and played games, two of T’s friends came over since they had nowhere to go. It was awesome, probably one of the best thanksgivings we have had yet. We tried to take a family picture for Christmas cards but we couldn’t get food enough light since it was already dark out so my stepmom decided to make a plan for S and I to come over Saturday morning so we could do the picture and she and my dad would make us breakfast. Sounded good to me, we agreed all went on. 

Everything was good except my dad and stepmom kept going into their bedroom to our liquor in their drinks because they told everyone else it would be a dry event (but they are never sober so it really doesn’t surprise me that they were sneaking liquor). Not too out of the ordinary though. Everything was pretty normal and good. 

Then T left to bring his friends home. With the friends out of the house things seemed to quickly change. S and I were about to head out but we stopped and talked to my dad in the kitchen and I asked him if there would be any weekends between now and Christmas that he wasn’t traveling for work so I could come over and we could have a Christmas cookie day. He told me which days he’d be out of town and I was like alright I’ll see which of the other days I can get off work and we can do that. He told me he probably wouldn’t bring any to work this year since he doesn’t actually have an office with his new job but he was joking about how he could mail cookies to his coworkers and I started joking about how I could bring some in to my internship to try and butter them up so they will hire me next year. It was all pretty normal conversation but then it got a little confusing. 

A came up and was jokingly being offended that we were going to make cookies without her and my dad told her he already has the stuff so she can make them this weekend while she’s here and she asked if I was going to come make cookies this weekend then and my stepmom reminded her that I had to work all weekend. A suggested Saturday when I’m here for the pictures but I told her I could help in the morning but only a little bit since I have to work at 2. Then my stepmom was trying to say I’d have to be here much earlier on Saturday to help with cookies and I explained “I wasn’t planning to come early I was just saying I will help if I have time. I still have to work all weekend and would like to have another cookie day sometime closer to Christmas when I don’t have to work.” Somehow this led to my stepmom raising her voice and getting angry about how I only want to see them when I need something and that this is why I never see them and I tried to argue back and defend myself saying no this isn’t because I need something, it’s because I want to make cookies with you guys, I’m trying to make a plan here to see you guys.” And it was very clear it was about to turn into a big fight but then S got angry and stormed out the door so I just stopped and said “I guess S says it’s time to go” and then turned and followed him. A stopped me by the door and said goodbye and then told me to tell S she says goodbye too. She was the only one I said goodbye too. Both S and I messaged her after we left and apologized for storming out and she said she understands. We love hanging out with A and obviously we want to get to see my dad but it feels like my stepmom makes it so hard sometimes. 

Was she right though? Am I the asshole in this situation??? I really just don’t even know anymore. She just makes me question everything about myself sometimes. "
9zmdmc,23,2018-11-23,26 and a total failure at life,AquilaTempestas,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/9zmdmc/26_and_a_total_failure_at_life/,"Well, I'm 26 and female, and I honestly feel like that maybe I'm just one of those people not meant to be one of the lucky ones.

&amp;#x200B;

I finished my business degree in 2015. Spent an entire year trying to get a job in that industry, but found nothing. I tried doing a few internships as well, but they were horrendous experiences and I knew I'd probably jump off a cliff if I was stuck in a job like that.

&amp;#x200B;

I did a short diploma at the end of 2016 to get a job at a prison centre. I failed the exam. Needless to say, confidence levels dropped to an all time low and I thought I'd be stuck in my crappy cafe job forever.

&amp;#x200B;

In 2017, I took a chance and got accepted into an education degree. Problem is it'll take 4.5 years to do and I don't know if anyone is gonna wanna hire a teacher at 30 years of age. My parents and relatives are always saying you're too old for that, but I've heard other people say you're never too old to be a teacher. I don't know what to be believe. I'm halfway through now.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently unemployed because I got fired at my cafe job simply for telling my manager the truth (that treating staff members like idiots is unfair) and I'm trying to find something else, but I'm either too old for cafe work or I don't live close enough (I don't have the funds for a car). Not to mention my entire love life is basically nonexistent (I've been out there, meeting different people, but I've never felt good enough for anyone because I have nothing to offer). Besides. It's not like anyone wants to spend time with someone who has no actual relationship experience at the age of 26 anyway. I live at home because I don't have the funds and of course, I feel terribly embarrassed.

&amp;#x200B;

I just feel so totally inadequate. My cousins are all living happy lives and then there's me. 26 and going nowhere. Every Christmas is always 'you don't have a boyfriend yet' and 'you don't have a job yet' or 'you're getting too old and you've got nothing to be proud of'. I'm desperately living in hope that I can eventually pick up some part time teacher aide work once my practical stuff is done (the first few rounds anyway), but I don't know what else to do.

&amp;#x200B;

It was a windy winter day in the month of January when I first met him…I donot know what was about him that made me connect with him instantly.....…I knew I didn't love him yet….we again met a couple of times and I gradually could feel I'm getting addicted to this person…we met around three times and he then moved to Mumbai for his internship which is a part of MBA curriculum… and I got my internship in Bangalore itself….We were in the same city but not in the same college …He was in IIM B and I was doing my MBA from NMIMS……so we kept talking for around eight months and realised I was madly in love with this person ….I also knew he might not understand the depth of my emotions but I couldn't just stop expressing what I felt for him…It was in the month of May I remember being misdiagnosed with acute lukemia....I had been facing some health issues for the past few months …I kept on talking to him and thought of not letting him know as it would trouble him  ,he was alone in Mumbai….I decided I'd tell him once he returns….. Meanwhile I was going through a lot of medical  procedures and somehow I felt he is always there for me and I was so glad he made me feel what love is, he was the only good thing in my life amidst all the trauma...….My parents even told me to quit MBA because of health issues but I knew if I would give up ….he acted as a force which kept m and I had to complete my MBA at any cost…..Last month I was crying a lot and wrote this message for him:

There's something I had been holding on..I thought I'll tell you after we meet again…..u remember the first time I met you I told you I'm not well and I was supposed to meet a doctor the next day ...I don't know if u remember....I was suffering from tremendous pain then and doctors kept saying lack of vitamins etc....In May when u were interning in Mumbai ,I was actually in a lot of pain........I was misdiagnosed with AML...and u know everything was going wrong I didn't know what was happening .... everything was falling apart...I could see my dad crying infront of me when doctors said that.....u won't believe u gave me a force which helped me to keep moving.....the day u texted me n asked if we'll go out to watch Avengers after you come back I was admitted in hospital......I just told you to come back.....there was a time I was undergoing very painful tests and I used to keep praying that I'll come out of all this and hug you and cry my heart out and not let u go....I was in a section of the hospital where I could see ppl who would die within a few days.....u used to joke  ki we'll have three kids one son n two daughters...that day I remember before my bone marrow biopsy all I was thinking everything will be fine and I'll meet u soon and I'll pull your leg more.....I definitely knew I had gained a friend who would not give  up on me...Anyways it was an infection and I was completely fine before the new session began with some antibiotics....I know I've always behaved like a retard....I cannot exactly explain what I exactly felt in the months that followed ...maybe physically I had recovered but mentally I didn't.....I didn't feel like waking up....sleep was my only escape.....I used to break down in between classes ......I didn't feel like talking to my friends even... and I know that time I used to text u like crazy ...it did annoy you...... it was selfish on my part that I didn't want to let you go....All I know had u not been there I wouldn't have overcome that phase....Those hospital rooms still haunt me sometimes.....I was battling so much.....once u r told u have a disease which is going to kill you.....u're almost dead  that very moment .....Anyways if I complete my mba it'll be because of you....You've been my angel and you know I was actually quitting MBA,my parents even insisted me to quit then seeing me in pain and I thought of taking up a job in a stratup later.......Thank you so much for coming in my life...and I'm really sorry for annoying you so much it must have been mentally toxic for you........I always believe you are the best gift I got from Bangalore and there's no equivalent material gift I can ever give you.... 

PS:It was my birthday and I asked him to commit to me if he loves me….I knew I was in love with him and he used to tell the same  but that day he told he lacks the conviction of doing justice to our relationship as he is busy with his MBA…we never met after that and probably we never will…..I would never force him to be in my life but I wish he called me atleast one last time …just talked to me one last time….maybe I used to text him a lot even after he broke up ....... I told him at times to block me because I could never control my urge to talk to him and he did block me this month, he probably became my world  because of the situations he came in my life….I know I might never get a person like him but I wish I could sit beside him and tell him what he meant to me one last time…..He once told me he had fallen out of love but I don’t really understand how that happens…..You never know when you are meeting a person for the last time…..All I know he was a great guy and I'd be so happy to be with him….He is presently in Lyon for his exchange….And I pray god that he gets everything he wants in life….and I'll always love him….Apeeeee if you ever read this….I want you to know you are very adorable to me and I really wish I could hug you one last time …I always will have so much respect for you….

I was planning on going to Japan this winter to get away from life for a bit but I might just commit to this project more. If I stay home anyways I can do an intersession course to fulfill another GE requirement so i don't have to pay the UC system a few thousand dollars to learn about philosophy. Maybe I'll put a bitcoin address on the project page when I release it, and perhaps some generous weeb will like my my efforts and throw money my way to fund further research (but would actually be going to helping pay for a rail pass so I can visit sapporo and drink sapporo beer).

I make $15 an hour tutoring people c++ while my friends are making $47 an hour at their internships plz help lol. Tech bubble plzz

Well anyways

**Project Announcements**

The image wrapper I wrote for lodepng, well it was great for testing how much faster c++ will be than java, but I really need a .jpeg library. Currently writing 4k images using lodepng takes like 4 seconds and CImg takes 0.01 (java is pretty similar to cimg).

I thought to myself for a while, ""should I do java and c++?"" but realized what a daft and janky idea that is. Sadly this project seems to be committing more towards c++ at this point. I understand this will cause some frustration with different operating systems and what not.

I had issues getting CImg to work for a bit but I got it all figured out. Building projects with CImg takes incredibly long though, but I guess this is a time to fully learn and embrace the beauty of c++. I've been a big fan of Clion thus far but a 4.2mb header file for CImg.h is a bit intensive on Clion and I have to use powersaving mode for clion on my desktop as to not let it hog my entire memory..

The following weeks goals (aside from college apps, discrete math test, linear algebra test, Japanese test...work.. uhhahhddsadkmaso-d) is to start converting all my functions to CImg. 

**Research**

*Say I wont release another white paper that isn't peer reviewed, you wont*

high key I enjoy researching random things. I currently have a few techniques to speed up the block matching algorithm but it's gonna involve some research investigating something I've titular titled ""region based block matching"".

The concept of region based block matching is utilizing the concept of ""strong diamond searches"" to investigate a large region without having to compromise speed. I wrote about it when I was half awake but I was half awake.

The algorithm I have in mind utilizes something called ""regions"" in diamond block matching. This algorithm is more generalized towards anime because it hopes to capture and match ""large jumps"", something that's more found in anime than in real life movement (which I would wager most block matching algorithms are designed for).


The premise goes like this: determine a general displacement for a region using a ""strong diamond search"", and use prims algorithm (this is the third time I've used prims in my life to solve a problem lol) to slowly ""cut away"" around the origin point. We only search around the general displacement, and if we find a block that is too far from the general displacement, we define that new block as a ""new region"". 

The motivation of this is to capture movements in various directions (i.e foreground moves left, while background moves right). Having a set displacement for a region reduces the amount of checks diamond search would need to conduct. 

The only issue I can see with this so far is that matching an image is no longer parallelizable, but it wasn't really anyways.. so


that's all. Happy thanks giving

9zmrht,14,2018-11-23,How do I make it less obvious I'm depressed,commont8r,depression_help,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/9zmrht/how_do_i_make_it_less_obvious_im_depressed/,"I was talking with my girlfriend earlier, and a few things came up that are making me feel really low. We've kinda started a soft break up that I intend to make permanent when we graduate from college this year,so I don't need yall telling me to do that.

1. She's felt like she couldn't break up with me for some time because she feels sorry for me and thinks that I'll hurt or kill myself.
2. Many of my coworkers at my school have communicated with our mutual friends who introduced me to the job saying that they are worried about me and asking if I'm OK. (she said this in a way that made me think they were worried that I would like snap and take it out on them. This may be an incorrect interpretation. But I never have been violent.
3. My boss only kept me on for my senior year because he thought that losing my on campus job would be too big of a blow for me to deal with.

Am I depressed, probably so, and my meds aren't helping much. Also, being autistic (medically diagnosed) doesn't help my social situation. But how do I make it so people don't worry about me offing myself or becoming the next Adam Lanza.

Edit 1:

Ive been through shit, and others thinking I couldn't get over these tiny bumps is hard to hear. My parents divorced when I was 10. Over my first senate of high school I was put in a mental hospital twice and then eventually left there. Then put in a shelter, then in the foster care system. I fought in court to come back home, and then graduated high school in a total of 7 semesters (I lost one due to hospitalization) and graduated with honors. I am in college pursuing an engineering degree. Last summer I had an internship, and I was just inducing into an engineering honor society. I will graduate next semester with a degree in engineering, exactly 4 years after I graduated from high school. A on campus job won't hold me back. I'll feel like crap but I'll get over it. A girlfriend went home be back. It feels like crap, but I know I'll get over it. "

I am currently in 12th grade but stopped going to School about a month ago. The reason for this is that I suddenly lost all energy and got overrun by these feelings of hopelessness. I am not able to function properly in this society. I think I suffer from social anxiety. Since my childhood I was not able to do certain things like making phone calls, asking people questions and looking people in the eyes. This was always a big problem for me, in 11th grade I was not able to do a mandatory internship because I could not bring myself to ask a Company if I could be an intern. I dont really know why, I just have a massive fear when it comes to such things. I also struggle to make appointments etc. because of that underlying fear I can not explain. Since I can remember teachers and family always told me that I should Not be so lazy. It is not that I did not want to do things, I was and still am just too afraid to do certain things. I tried multiple Times to overcome this fear and sometimes succeeded, but when I have to do it a second time I still have this unexplainable fear. I am just always worried that I do the wrong thing which I believe was caused by my Family in my childhood. I have a Single mother and my uncles and grandparents always tried to also raise me when they had the opportunity. One uncle for example always used to (and still does) stare at me when eating, walking or whatever and always finds a thing about me I do wrong. ""Why are you walking like that?"", ""Why Are your arms in this position?"", ""do you want to be a girl because of that long hair?"" etc. In my childhood this was even worse, when I didnt to something the exact way he wanted it to be he would terrorize me until I did it ""right"". I was also obese as a Child and almost my entire family would mock me and treat me like I am not a full human being. In addition to this ""trauma(?)"" come my worries that no matter what I do, I will never be happy. This particular thought got especially worse when I turned 18. I am now an adult, if I dont get a good degree I will Never get a good job. If I want to take 1 year off After school to travel europe I will never get a job. This is what my teachers told me constantly since 5th grade and that pressure just made me go crazy and my grades got worse from year to year. When I was 16, I started smoking Marijuana. It was my anxiety relief. I could finally stop worrying about everything and just felt.... happy. Genuinely happy. Around the age of 17 I started smoking every evening. 3-5 joints to be precise. After last summer break I just lost all motivation for School. I know, I spend my whole Childhood make it that far in school but somehow I was not able to continue going to school anymore. I laid in my bed the whole day and just wanted to sleep and never wake up again. I just cant do this anymore. That was around 1 month ago. I decided that I have issues and got in contact with my headteacher to talk with her about my problems. She was nice and understanding and I promised her that I would go to a therapist, which I planned to do anyways. The problem was however that I was too scared to call a Therapist and make an appointment. Fortunately my best friend, who also has major problems, was nice enough to call the therapist to schedule an appointment. That appointment however was for him but the therapist knew that I would come too. We told the therapist that I also needed professional help but unfortunately he could not make any room on his schedule for me. He said that next week he will suggest me another therapist. When we got there the next week he was suprised that I was there too and told me that he wanted to speak with his colleague in person and wasnt able to do this that quick. I need a therapist, I am sitting here in a cold toolshed in my garden. I burned my skin with cigarettes because I feel guilty and like a piece of shit. My friends came to visit me because my headtecher told them to speak to me. Why? I had an appointment with her at wednesday but I didnt go there because I wasnt able to get out of bed. I texted her that I feel sick and would like to meet another day. No response. An hour ago my friends came to me, pissed as hell because my headteacher sent them and told me that she wanted to call the police because I didnt go to the appointment. They asked me 10 times when the last time was I smoked Marijuana and I truthfully told them that I'm sober since 4 weeks. But they don't believe me. They think I just sit there, smoke marijuana all day and don't give a shit about everything. But the complete opposite is the case. I feel lost, my mother doesn't want to hear about my problems and my friends think Im just a silly pothead whos wasting his life. I neee help. I got too Drunk last week and tried to hang myself. And that was not the first time. I'm sitting here in that shed and burn my skin with cigarettes. I just want to live a normal live. I want to function. I want others to understand. I reall want to go to mental health institution. I need to go there. If I don't get myself some help quick I'm going to do something stupid. Please help me. I hope wha I wrote makes some sense. I left out a lot of details though. "

Be as specific as possible, and include specific games or programs you will be using.**

* Probably just Gaming, Surfing and stuff for my school. I want to buy games like RDR2, Destiny and maybe Witcher 3 again because i really enjoyed it on console, but I don't have any really specific Ideas right know but I wanted to do this for a very long time now. 

&gt;**What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?** 

* My maximum budget is 1000€ as it says in the title although it would be very nice if there was some leftover

&gt;**When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy.** 

* Well as soon as the parts arrive. I don't know how quick this sub responds but I was thinking of getting the parts maybe today because there may be some good dealz out there. (Black Friday xD)

&gt;**What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc\)** 

* Only the parts and the case/tower. But some suggestions on monitor etc. would be nice anyway.

&gt;**Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location?** 

* Im from Germany, Hamburg.

&gt;**If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated.** 

* I still have an Logitech keyboard lying around somewhere and a mouse from Roccat. I think it's name was roccat kone pure color.

&gt;**Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?** 

* I have no knowledge about it yet so not right away but ill be looking into it and maybe I do it in the future I dunno.

&gt;**Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)**

* As I have not much experience in PC building besides helping my friend who just told me what to do and building one from used parts in an Internship where my Boss helped me im just going to build a normal PC with no specific features but an SSD would be nice. 😅 But if I get more into it could I add some features if I want to later on?

&gt;**Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?**

* As I just want the most for my money I'm not going to focus that much on looks.

&gt;**Do you need a copy of Windows included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference?**

* No I'm going to buy Windows later on.

&gt;**Extra info or particulars:**

If theres anything I need to watch out for please tell me! Also fyi a friend is going to help me a bit on building it so I won't mess up anything."

I honestly didn’t even think that marijuana was part of that list, seeing as I just remembered that it is indeed still federally illegal. I have definitely smoked weed a good amount in the last 4 years of my undergraduate career.

9zpj0x,3,2018-11-23,Soon to be out of college - rent or buy?,pfthrowawayaccount12,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/9zpj0x/soon_to_be_out_of_college_rent_or_buy/,"Hi [r/personalfinance](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance)! I recently accepted a job (80k per year) in a relatively LCOL area. I was thinking about renting a house in the area with some friends when I stumbled upon a house for $100k. It would be a 3 bedroom/2bath house that is close to my office. After doing a few mortgage calculators and the NYT rent or buy a calculator, it seems unless I can find a rent under $600 a month this is a better deal for the next 5-10 years.

I know it doesn't make sense to lock myself to an area this early, but the job I accepted is one of those rotational finance programs with defined growth/rotations for the next 5 or so years. I figured it would make more sense to pay down a mortgage/build house equity (even have roommates contribute rent to help the mortgage) then pay into a rent payment every month and lose the money.

For reference, I am incredibly lucky, have about 25k saved from internships that I can use on the downpayment the past three summers and am graduating college debt free.

Would this be a reasonable investment? Am I missing anything/extra considerations?"

Bent u bekend met de uitzending van Zembla van 10 oktober 2018?   
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ja.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 2  
&amp;nbsp;    
Wanneer zijn de voorbereidingen voor het akkoord met de Venezolaanse vice-president Tareck El Aissami gestart op het ministerie?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord  
&amp;nbsp;    
De onderhandelingen over het akkoord vonden plaats in januari jl. op Aruba. De delegatieleider aan Venezolaanse zijde was destijds vicepresident Wilmar Castro Soteldo. Sinds de onderhandelingen in januari zijn er voortdurend inspanningen gepleegd om ervoor te zorgen dat Venezuela definitieve goedkeuring zou geven aan het akkoord teneinde daarmee de grens weer open te krijgen mede gelet op de concrete gevolgen die de grenssluiting met zich meebracht. Ook de delegaties van de Staten uitten grote zorgen over de gevolgen van de grenssluiting tijdens het Interparlementair Koninkrijksoverleg van januari jl.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Op 29 maart sprak ik telefonisch met mijn collega Arreaza waarbij ik heb aangegeven dat als duidelijk was dat Venezuela met het in januari onderhandelde akkoord kon instemmen en dat dat ook heropening van de grens zou betekenen, ik voor een ontmoeting open zou staan. Tijdens mijn bezoek aan de Koninkrijkslanden en Colombia van 3-7 april 2018 deed zich de mogelijkheid voor een tussenstop te maken in Caracas en het akkoord te ondertekenen. Die mogelijkheid had ik ook met de premiers van Aruba, Curaçao en Sint-Maarten besproken &amp;#40;zie ook beantwoording van de Kamervragen gesteld door het Lid Ploumen, d.d. 23 november 2018, ref. 2018Z18170&amp;#41;. Op 4 april werd door een vertegenwoordiger van het Venezolaanse ministerie van Buitenlandse zaken aangegeven dat er gewerkt werd aan een mogelijke ontmoeting waarbij vicepresident Soteldo aanwezig zou zijn. Op dat moment kon het bezoek echter nog niet worden bevestigd. Wel werd gesproken over de mogelijke aanwezigheid van vicepresident El Aissami. Mijn collega de heer Arreaza was op dat moment niet in het land.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Op 6 april werd het bezoek bevestigd en konden de voorbereidingen voor een kort bezoek worden getroffen. Op dat moment was ook duidelijk dat vicepresident El Aissami aanwezig zou zijn. Het akkoord heb ik na overleg met de Caribische landen van het Koninkrijk ondertekend. Aan Venezolaanse zijde tekende de Venezolaanse vicepresident Soteldo. De tekst van het getekende akkoord is geactualiseerd vergeleken met de tekst in januari maar inhoudelijk hetzelfde gebleven.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 3  
&amp;nbsp;    
Wanneer werd het voornemen tot sancties tegen El Aissami vanuit de Europese Unie &amp;#40;EU&amp;#41; bekend bij het ministerie?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord  
&amp;nbsp;    
In het algemeen geldt dat individuele sancties die door de EU worden aangenomen het resultaat zijn van een intensief proces van vele maanden waarbij het resultaat niet van tevoren vaststaat. Op technisch niveau worden vaak vele namen ingebracht. Hierbij worden sanctielijsten van bondgenoten betrokken. De bewijsvoering vraagt om een grote mate van zorgvuldigheid. Dit gold ook voor de uitbreiding van de individuele sanctielijst voor Venezuela.   
&amp;nbsp;    
In mei werd de lijst van mogelijk te sanctioneren personen voor het eerst in de EU-verband besproken. Op 25 juni besloot de Raad definitief over de lijst van personen tegen wie individuele sancties zouden worden getroffen. De individuele maatregelen tegen de personen in het sanctieregime Venezuela betreffen een bevriezing van tegoeden en een inreisverbod. Dergelijke maatregelen staan een ontmoeting met personen die op de sanctielijst voorkomen niet in de weg.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 4  
&amp;nbsp;    
Welke rol heeft het voornemen tot sancties tegen El Aissami gespeeld in de afweging om tot een akkoord te komen met hem?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord  
&amp;nbsp;    
De onderhandelingen zijn gevoerd met vicepresident Soteldo. Het akkoord was in het belang van het Koninkrijk. De samenstelling van de Venezolaanse delegatie, die kort voor de ondertekening bekend werd, heeft daar geen verandering in gebracht.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 5  
&amp;nbsp;    
Op welke momenten is dit afwegingskader op het ministerie besproken in de beslissing om tot een akkoord te komen met El Aissami?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord  
&amp;nbsp;    
Zie het antwoord op vraag 2, 3 en 4.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 6  
&amp;nbsp;    
Wat waren de resultaten of uitkomsten van de afzonderlijks gesprekken op het ministerie om ondanks de voorgenomen sancties toch tot een akkoord te komen met El Aissami?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord  
&amp;nbsp;    
Zie antwoord op vraag 2, 3 en 4.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 7  
&amp;nbsp;    
Is er bij de EU nagevraagd op wie de toekomstige sancties betrekking zouden hebben alvorens het akkoord te tekenen met El Aissami?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord  
&amp;nbsp;    
Zie het antwoord op vraag 2 en 3. Het akkoord werd aan Venezolaanse zijde ondertekend door vicepresident Soteldo.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 8  
&amp;nbsp;    
Is intern advies gevraagd of het akkoord met El Aissami in strijd is met de internationale mensenrechten?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord  
&amp;nbsp;    
Nee. Zie het antwoord op vraag 2 en 3.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 9  
Welke documenten hebben ten grondslag gelegen aan de beslissing om tot een akkoord te komen met El Aissami?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord  
&amp;nbsp;    
Zie het antwoord op vraag 2 en 3.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 10  
&amp;nbsp;    
Bent u het eens met de constatering van de EU dat El Aissami verantwoordelijk is voor martelingen en folteringen? Zo ja, is gerechtvaardigd om een grensakkoord met een buurland te sluiten met een mensenrechtenschender?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord  
&amp;nbsp;    
Nederland heeft ingestemd met het uitbreiden van het sanctieregime tegen o.a. vicepresident El Aissami op basis van de daarvoor aangedragen gronden. Zie ook antwoord op vraag 2, 3 en 4.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 11  
&amp;nbsp;    
Welke impact heeft het akkoord tussen u en El Aissami op de uitkomst van het congres over persoonlijke sancties tegen schenders van mensenrechten op 20 november 2018?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord  
&amp;nbsp;    
Zoals u bekend pleit Nederland in EU verband voor ‘EU global human rights sanctions regime’. In dit verband werd op 20 november een hoogambtelijke bijeenkomst voor EU-lidstaten en enkele gelijkgezinde landen georganiseerd om het concept van een mensenrechtensanctieregime verder te ontwikkelen en de   
&amp;nbsp;    
steun hiervoor binnen de EU verder uit te bouwen. Dit staat geheel los van het akkoord. Zie ook antwoord op vraag 2.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 12  
&amp;nbsp;    
Is er bij de onderhandelingen ook gesproken over het terugsturen van illegale migranten door Aruba en Curaçao? Zijn er door u aan Venezuela voorwaarden verbonden, bijvoorbeeld over hoe deze mensen moeten worden behandeld  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord  
&amp;nbsp;    
Er is tijdens de onderhandelingen niet gesproken over het terugsturen van illegale migranten vanuit Aruba en Curaçao naar Venezuela dan wel over voorwaarden over de behandeling van deze personen. Een van de gevolgen van de grenssluiting was natuurlijk wel dat het terugsturen van illegale migranten bemoeilijkt was en dit na het openen van de grenzen weer kon worden genormaliseerd.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 13  
&amp;nbsp;    
Is tijdens de onderhandelingen rondom 7 april van de zijde van Venezuela geëist dat de benoeming van Carlos Mata Figueroa als consul van Venezuela op Aruba door de minister zou worden goedgekeurd? Zo nee, waarom wordt deze kwestie door El Aissami dan nadrukkelijk genoemd tijdens de persconferentie?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord  
&amp;nbsp;    
Tijdens de onderhandelingen is de benoeming van de heer Carlos Mata Figueroa als nieuwe consul-generaal op Aruba ter sprake gebracht door de Venezolaanse delegatie. Op dat moment heb ik aangegeven dat ik geen koppeling wilde maken tussen de ondertekening van het akkoord en andere zaken. Dit is ook niet gebeurd. Zie ook de beantwoording op de Kamervragen gesteld door de  leden De Roon en De Graaf &amp;#40;d.d. 17 mei 2018, ref. 2018Z08417&amp;#41;.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 14  
&amp;nbsp;    
Kunt u een procesbescheid doen toekomen aan de Kamer waarin alle besluiten en relevante gegevens in volgorde worden gepresenteerd rondom de totstandkoming van het akkoord met El Aissami in combinatie met het besluit tot sancties van de EU tegen El Aissami?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord  
&amp;nbsp;    
In de beantwoording van deze vragen staan alle besluiten en relevante gegevens omtrent het sluiten van het akkoord en het EU-sanctieproces beschreven.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 15  
&amp;nbsp;    
Kunt u deze vragen één voor één beantwoorden?

9zr8kr,0,2018-11-23,Should I move on from my boyfriend who goes on dates with another girl?,nutballemily,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9zr8kr/should_i_move_on_from_my_boyfriend_who_goes_on/,"**TL;DR: Boyfriend has a really close female friend, texts her when he’s with me, goes on lunch dates with her while he doesn’t have time for our relationship because he’s “busy”, hits me with the “we’re just friends” line. I’m in a really unfortunate situation here.**

Hi, my name is Emily (16/F) and I’ve been dating this guy for about a year and a half now (16/M). We’re both each other’s first serious relationship. The beginning of our relationship was great as I’m sure most are during that honey moon phase, cute texts about how much we appreciate each other, seeing eachother frequently, etc. but I feel like somewhere along the way our relationship became one sided. We both go to a local youth group and he’s been friends with this girl since around the time we started dating. She’s three years older than us and graduated last year (we’re both sophomores).

 I’ve never had a problem with him being friends with her until recently, or having female friends at all. But something has changed. I’ve noticed the past few months him seeing me less and less and distancing himself, any conversations about our future, cute/affectionate conversations, plans, etc. are always initiated by me. I’ve tried to have conversations with him about where I feel our relationship is heading and he says he’ll try to do things better but his actions don’t match his words. Back to the situation at hand, I’ve been trying to tell him my concerns for a while now, and last Sunday you could say I “blew up” about it due to built up resentment in the relationship. We’re both really busy people, I’m enrolled in all honors classes and taking some college courses, I’m involved in student leaders at our church, student council, our schools band, and a list of other activities. He spends half his school day at our highschool at a special math and science place, and is involved with sports, so we’re both busy, but I still want to spend time with him as people do when they’re in a relationship. Despite my requests to see eachother more and for him to match the effort I’m putting into the relationship, I still have to make all the plans. Last Sunday when I blew up it was due to hearing the girl mention (she’s the youth intern at our church) that she had fun at lunch with him today. Now, they’ve done this before and he asked my permission and I said “I’m not going to stop you from seeing your friends, that would be manipulative of me” but I think he’s abusing the situation. He hid the fact they went out to lunch last week from me, and now I’m feeling unsure about how many other times he’s lied about it. Not to mention all the times he strays away from me in social situations to go talk to her/tease her (flirt) with her. He also texts her when he’s with me and her name is his phone is “my favorite person in the world” (apparently entered in by her). 

 When I brought up my concerns he hit me with the “but we’re just friends!” Line, which puts me in a hard situation where I don’t want to be controlling, but I feel as though my boyfriend shouldn’t want to go on dates with other, older girls. (Why does a legal adult want to hang out with a 16 year old boy anyway?) I’m getting increasingly frustrated with the situation and don’t know what to do. I end up feeling more sad and resentful about the relationship than happy about it, and I feel like the more mature one trying to figure things out. I love him and I want a future with him but not if the future looks like what our relationship has been heading towards. 


Advice would be greatly appreciated. 

**Edit:** 
Some people are taking this as “I don’t want him to have friends of the opposite sex so I don’t feel threatened” the problem is that he spends more time with this one girl than me, which puts me in a bad situation. He knows I’ve been struggling with the death of my brother, my mom getting into an almost fatal car accident, depression and severe social anxiety but still have been putting more work into our relationship and asking for support than he is even though all he’s told me that’s been weighing on him is school, which is valid, he has a lot of school work and it does stress him out. I’m just trying so hard and feel the same effort isn’t being returned to me. 

**Edit 2: I’m really hurt by the situation, but I also don’t really want to break up with him. I do love him a lot but I also don’t want to let myself be manipulated. I have a really emotionally manipulative family and not many friends, and recently went through a friendship breakup with a large group of friends. Things between that group of people ended strangely and without much closure, which could be a cause for why my feelings on this have been heightened lately. It’s not a black and white situation and there is quite a lot of factors in it. Does anyone have any advice for me for how I could try to approach things if I still have some hope for us? Again, I don’t want to be naive, but do you think it’s salvageable at all? "

9zrhpj,420,2018-11-23,Ex [21 M] is angry that I hooked up with someone 3 months after he dumped me [21 F],HopefulRecover,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9zrhpj/ex_21_m_is_angry_that_i_hooked_up_with_someone_3/,"tl;dr: In a relationship for almost 2 years, got dumped by bf the same day a family member dies, and he says he liked someone while we were still together. 3 months after he dumps me, I hook up with someone he's insecure over, and he loses it saying I should have said something to him and how could I go to the one person we had issues over. Over a year later, I get shit for what I have done despite how he handled the entire situation in the first place. What do I even do?

&amp;#x200B;

I was in a relationship for almost 2 years during college (21 months to be exact), and had made future plans on doing so many things together, and spoke about marriage and children. I got dumped last summer the same day I found out my grandfather passed away (an absolute shock on both ends) because he wanted to focus on himself, and distance was going to be difficult (he decided to go to a different continent for an internship and we wouldn't see each other for 6 months, + I would graduate a year earlier than he was. Another reason for him taking this internship was because he messed up his semester by taking too many classes and getting high every day). I still loved him and was willing to forgive him if he asked to be together again when he came back. A month later, he messages me and tells me that another reason he broke up with me was because he caught feelings for some girl while we were together, that he met once at some street fair. I was completely floored by this because this girl and him were just acquaintances, and they never spoke to each other, and then all of a sudden he decides to dump me because he thinks she could be the one. In the coming few weeks, he would tell me about how much he liked this girl, and how he wanted to take her places, and hoped she liked him back too (and he had a 'feeling' that she did).

Fast forward to 3 months later where I'm in my last year of classes, and I hooked up with a guy that we both knew. This guy was someone he had issues with and was insecure over (as I had liked this guy before. Full disclosure - I lost all feelings for him completely after a few months, and did not have any romantic inclinations once my ex and I got together). Ex found out about it before I had the chance to speak to him about it, and went ballistic, saying that I should have had the courtesy to tell him about it, and how could I have fucked the one guy he had issues with. Of course, looking back (it has been a year since this incident), I do agree that it was a mistake and I wish I never did it, but we were both drunk then and both were single. I wish I did say something to my ex sooner and just given him a heads up, but I did not, and I accept that. Ex removed me from all social media accounts and we don't speak from September to February.

Ex then comes back from his internship, and I hear he hasn't pursued the girl that he dumped me for, and on my birthday, someone brings his name up and I start full-on crying because I realize I still miss him and love him. He hears, and decides to meet me, and start an on-off relationship. Feelings for that girl somewhat diminished but still has a small thing. Then he decides that there's another girl who he has been talking to and is a friend of his (who he hasn't met in almost 10 years) that he thinks might also be someone he could like. Needless to say, he and I would be fighting every other week, because I still loved him and was willing to give him a chance after all that had happened, and I thought he loved me too (but he would still bring up how I hooked up with the other guy and guilted me into that being the state we were in). We decided to end our relationship in the summer.

This past summer, we were driving to go somewhere (and this was my first time driving on a highway for a long period, and I almost successfully made it to my destination). We get into a small fender bender, but thankfully all parties were okay. A month after that accident (which my family doesn't know happened, and I have not driven since, because every time I think I'm ready, I start feeling very panicky), he messages me saying I should have been more careful while driving (even though the cop told both him and me that it was the other person's fault and I had done the right thing by braking on time at the light). Still, I carried a lot of guilt from that accident and to hear someone say that maybe I would have realized how much someone was worth after they died got to me, and he decides to remove me from all social media accounts again and cuts off contact. I started drinking heavily every weekend and wasn't sure how to handle all the guilt that came from the accident (as he is the last person I would want to get hurt in an accident and I lost even more confidence in my driving) and how we had ended. I considered therapy (and still am, to cope over all this).

Fast forward to a few weeks ago when I get a message from him where he asks how I'm doing, and make small talk. He apologizes for the comment he made about the accident and said that it was not my fault, and he shouldn't have handled it the way he did (as this could have been our chance to strengthen our bond but he chose otherwise). He joined therapy for some of his issues too, which I was happy about, because he has someone to speak to and help him. We spoke here and there some more (him messaging almost always except one time where I wished him for a holiday). He would say things like how he missed me and it felt so different for him to be in his last year of school while I wasn't there. I miss him too, but I wasn't sure what I could do because we weren't living in the same area anymore, and he was applying for jobs all over the country. He also just fought with me so much and I just didn't think it made sense to feed into something that could end up hurting both of us again.

2 days ago, he messages me and said some of the most nastiest things I've heard in my life. Said I was a hoe and a slut for screwing some guy that got in the way of our relationship (even after I hooked up with said person after we broke up), and wished I would die. He said I was a terrible person and had no idea how relationships worked, and he was the one guy who was everything for me, and I couldn't find anyone better. I didn't respond to him because I was on vacation but he messaged me again the next day asking why I hadn't responded, and how I wasn't brave enough to say anything or face my issues (not true as I am a pretty outspoken person and did not want to say something or else he would twist my words and continue arguing some more. I am trying to be more mature but he doesn't seem to like that). I have always told him that I regretted what I did, and have apologized numerous times, and am not sure what I can say at this point. I forgave him for how he broke up with me while I was grieving over a death and when he liked the girl(s), which took a long time. This time however, I just said that I said whatever that needed to be said before, and wished him well for his future. He blocked my number so I don't think he got my message, and has blocked me on Facebook as well. His brother removed me from social media too.

Is all of this my fault? I have numerous friends who have told me that he is acting immature over all that he has done to me, but I still feel guilty that I didn't say anything when I hooked up with the guy (and I already know that I should have, and wished I never did it in the first place)."

I wish I did say something to my ex sooner and just given him a heads up, but I did not, and I accept that. Ex removed me from all social media accounts and we don't speak from September to February.

Ex then comes back from his internship, and I hear he hasn't pursued the girl that he dumped me for, and on my birthday, someone brings his name up and I start full-on crying because I realize I still miss him and love him. He hears, and decides to meet me, and start an on-off relationship. Feelings for that girl somewhat diminished but still has a small thing. Then he decides that there's another girl who he has been talking to and is a friend of his (who he hasn't met in almost 10 years) that he thinks might also be someone he could like. Needless to say, he and I would be fighting every other week, because I still loved him and was willing to give him a chance after all that had happened, and I thought he loved me too (but he would still bring up how I hooked up with the other guy and guilted me into that being the state we were in). We decided to end our relationship in the summer.

This past summer, we were driving to go somewhere (and this was my first time driving on a highway for a long period, and I almost successfully made it to my destination). We get into a small fender bender, but thankfully all parties were okay. A month after that accident (which my family doesn't know happened, and I have not driven since, because every time I think I'm ready, I start feeling very panicky), he messages me saying I should have been more careful while driving (even though the cop told both him and me that it was the other person's fault and I had done the right thing by braking on time at the light). Still, I carried a lot of guilt from that accident and to hear someone say that maybe I would have realized how much someone was worth after they died got to me, and he decides to remove me from all social media accounts again and cuts off contact. I started drinking heavily every weekend and wasn't sure how to handle all the guilt that came from the accident (as he is the last person I would want to get hurt in an accident and I lost even more confidence in my driving) and how we had ended. I considered therapy (and still am, to cope over all this).

Fast forward to a few weeks ago when I get a message from him where he asks how I'm doing, and make small talk. He apologizes for the comment he made about the accident and said that it was not my fault, and he shouldn't have handled it the way he did (as this could have been our chance to strengthen our bond but he chose otherwise). He joined therapy for some of his issues too, which I was happy about, because he has someone to speak to and help him. We spoke here and there some more (him messaging almost always except one time where I wished him for a holiday). He would say things like how he missed me and it felt so different for him to be in his last year of school while I wasn't there. I miss him too, but I wasn't sure what I could do because we weren't living in the same area anymore, and he was applying for jobs all over the country. He also just fought with me so much and I just didn't think it made sense to feed into something that could end up hurting both of us again.

2 days ago, he messages me and said some of the most nastiest things I've heard in my life. Said I was a hoe and a slut for screwing some guy that got in the way of our relationship (even after I hooked up with said person after we broke up), and wished I would die. He said I was a terrible person and had no idea how relationships worked, and he was the one guy who was everything for me, and I couldn't find anyone better. I didn't respond to him because I was on vacation but he messaged me again the next day asking why I hadn't responded, and how I wasn't brave enough to say anything or face my issues (not true as I am a pretty outspoken person and did not want to say something or else he would twist my words and continue arguing some more. I am trying to be more mature but he doesn't seem to like that). I have always told him that I regretted what I did, and have apologized numerous times, and am not sure what I can say at this point. I forgave him for how he broke up with me while I was grieving over a death and when he liked the girl(s), which took a long time. This time however, I just said that I said whatever that needed to be said before, and wished him well for his future. He blocked my number so I don't think he got my message, and has blocked me on Facebook as well. His brother removed me from social media too.

Is all of this my fault? I have numerous friends who have told me that he is acting immature over all that he has done to me, but I still feel guilty that I didn't say anything when I hooked up with the guy (and I already know that I should have, and wished I never did it in the first place)."

Accounting is easier in university

But CS grads makes more at their first job

I think it's easier to get a job in accounting if you graduate with mediocre grades and no intern experience than if you graduate in CS with mediocre grades and don't have any side projects

I think there's less age discrimination with accounting as you get older

I think there's less work in actual programming jobs than there is as an accountant where you have a ""busy tax season"" and you're at work all day

but in accounting you can work in a lot more cities... with CS you're pretty much can only work in toronto or ottawa

maybe with accounting you'll have knowledge to take more control of your own finances... but with programming knowledge you can work on personal projects and make good money

If this isn't okay, mods please let me know. Unfortunately I was delayed in building it, but I thought I would finally pull the trigger during Black Friday/Cyber Monday and see if I could get any more responses. You guys weren't kidding that prices would change dramatically!

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**What will you be doing with this PC? Be as specific as possible, and include specific games or programs you will be using.**

* Lots of Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign, as well as 3d modeling in Sketchup and Rhino and rendering in Vray or Lumion. I also do some light gaming, and I'd love to be able to play them on high settings or slightly above average settings. If it's relevant, which I doubt it is from a hardware standpoint, there will also be a lot of document reading and Magic Online.

&gt;**What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?**

* $1750.

&gt;**When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy.**

* At the earliest ASAP, at the latest before the end of 2018.

&gt;**What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc)**

* I'll definitely need the tower and monitor. As for the OS, I believe I can get that from my University but I'll need to look into that more. The tower should have the ability to have one of those locks added to it. The monitor needs to be of a relatively high quality, as I will be editing lots of images on it.

&gt;**Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location?**

* Cincinnati, OH, USA. There's a Microcenter in the area as well as an Amazon pickup store.

&gt;**If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated.**

* I have a mouse (Razer Naga) and Keyboard (Corsair K70 Lux).

&gt;**Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?**

* I don't know anything about overclocking, so I don't have an answer.

&gt;**Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)**

* I'd expect to need a good amount of storage, but the only other particulars I could think of are detailed under the ""what should be included"" section. One other thing is I plan on using my 2in1 as a second monitor, so I need to be able to project to it, but I don't think that should impact the build in any way.

&gt;**Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?**

* I'd prefer something on the subtle end stylistically, but I could see the use for a window. Black/grey or muted colors. Not really a fan of LED lighting. I will be keeping it in the studio during semesters when I have class, and at home when I'm doing internships, so I will need some degree of portability.

&gt;**Do you need a copy of Windows included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference?**

* I believe I will be able to get one from my University.

&gt;**Extra info or particulars:**  
&gt;  
&gt;None that come to mind that I haven't detailed above. Thank you!"
9zthy6,2,2018-11-23,Story of my (24M) life.,SeveralAction,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9zthy6/story_of_my_24m_life/,"Sorry if this is too long to read. I just wanted to get everything off my chest once. Also I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this.

This is the story of my life. I was born to Indian parents, I grew up and have lived in the US most of my life. My dad worked very hard to give me and my brother everything we could ever want and still does. When I was little life was great. At the time I thought I was an introvert and that is why I could never make friends but that was not the reason and I’ll get into that in a bit. The lack of friends didn’t really affect me much at that point in my life because we would always have relatives over and I was very close with my cousins, they were my friends.

As I got older my parents started to become more religious. They started distancing themselves from nonreligious people. Around the same time that this was happening my closest cousins moved away and I haven’t seen them much since then. I tried my best to make friends from school, but every attempt was stopped by my parents because they were afraid that I would fall in with the wrong kind of kids. I wasn’t allowed to go out with friends. The only people I could go out with were kids who had religious parents but I had nothing in common with them so I decided to keep to myself. I turned to gaming to fill my free time. All throughout middle school and high school my life consisted of going to school and then coming home and gaming.

Once I got to high school I started to feel like more of an outcast. I had long hair and a turban, I didn’t want to keep it but I was forced. No matter how much I argued with my parents it all fell on deaf ears. Everyone has been through high school and knows that kids can be cruel. I was wasn’t bullied too badly but I just wanted to fit in. Eventually in my junior year I decided again to reason with my parents. I tried to see their side of the argument but they never cared to listen to my side. Their argument was always “what will people say about us if we are religious but our son isn’t” to which I always tried to explain to them that no matter what people will always find things to talk about but they never listened. After this argument I decided, screw it, they aren’t ever going to listen and I just have to do what I need to. So the next day I went with my friends and got a haircut. Once I got home all hell broke loose. My mom was yelling at me and threatening to send me to a religious boarding school in India. Once my dad got home he saw what I did and things became physical. I was around 16 or 17 and was into heavily into lifting so I could handle my own and no one got hurt. My parents stopped me from going to school for the next three weeks. They didn’t want to see me or to figure out what I had done so their solution was to keep me in the basement and make me read about “my” religion for the next three weeks. During this time my friends rang my doorbell and tried to see if I was ok. Every time my mom would just ignore it. Eventually she took me to school and made up a story of how I was sick and that’s why I couldn’t go to school. The teachers and kids knew exactly what happened but no one wanted to say anything.

This is when my depression started. I felt like I had no control in my life. I didn’t want to go to school anymore. I didn’t want to talk to anyone. I didn’t want to do anything anymore. Eventually my hair grew back and I graduated. During those last two years of high school I went from being an honor student to barely passing.

I then got accepted to a college. I went to college and chose the major that my parents told me to so I could work with my dad. I didn’t argue as I didn’t really care. My depression got so bad that I didn’t really think that graduating would be a possibility because I felt like I would end it all soon. I applied for classes and tried my best to go but most days I would just stay home and lay in bed. I eventually got kicked out in my third semester for failing to maintain a 2.0 GPA. I then took a semester off and worked with my dad because it was too late to register anywhere else. I eventually got into a Community College.

Once I got into community college is when my life changed. I told myself that I can’t just sit at home and expect my life to change and that if I was ever going to get out of this hell that I would have to finish college and get a job to move out. Every day I reminded myself and I started to do better. Eventually in my second year I was doing so well, I was on the Dean’s list and even got an award.

In the starting of my last year of Community College I met a girl in my humanities class. At first I didn’t really think anything about it. She would follow me around after class and we would just talk. She was pretty and honestly I thought she was out of my league. Before meeting her I had given up on trying to find a relationship and I was just working on myself. We ended up spending more and more time together and I started to develop feelings for her. After school we would hang out and go eat or just spend time walking around and talking. My parents started to ask questions and I told them about her. I never kept anything from my parents or lied to them. I’ve always been the type of person to just tell the truth and face the consequences rather than to have happiness based on lies. My parents instantly told me to stop talking to her. I was angry because my little brother had a girlfriend which my parents knew about for the last two years and they never said anything like this to him. I told them that I wasn’t going to stop seeing her and that it didn’t matter what I did in my free time as long as my grades were good. As the weeks went on things got worse. Every time I would come home my parents would berate me for spending time with her. It got so bad that I despised going home. I would much rather spend time at college and with her then to come home. It was good because she also loved to spend time with me and didn’t want to go home.

Fast forward to last semester at Community College and my grades were perfect and I had been accepted into the college I always wanted to go to. By now I and my GF at the time were spending most of our time together. I would pretty much only go home to eat and sleep as my parents were still on my case about leaving her. This is when my GF (I’ll call her S to protect her identity) at the time really trusted me enough to open up to me about her life. I need to give a little backstory for the rest of my decisions to make sense so here I go.

She told me about how her dad left her and that her mother had to raise her and her sister. Her mother moved to the US with her and her sister and she basically had to become a prostitute to support them. Eventually “S” found a job and there she met a guy who she started to develop feelings for. Before this she had never been in a relationship and this was her first. She had sex with this guy and her mom found out. Her mom forced her to get married to this guy. “S” went crying to the guy and told him what had happened. The guy felt sad for her and agreed to marry her so she could get away from her abusive mother. “S” told me that she was living with this guy and they were more like roommates. She told me that she works at a club as a dancer and that if I don’t like it she will find a different job. She told me how much she loves me and that she kept this from me because she was afraid that I would leave her. Being an idiot because I knew nothing about the world because I barely had any friends or real life experience, I decided to believe her. I told her I didn’t like her working at the club but I wasn’t going to tell her to stop working there. She decided she would find another job and told me she would stop working there.

As time went on things between us got better. I finally had graduated from Community College and it was summer. We spent most of our time together as I wanted to spend as little time as I need to at home. I was also saving up money to buy my dream car which would be around 15k. I had saved up around 5K a month after summer started. This is when my parents really started to get angry with me seeing her. My GF at the time was busy and I had been working every day. Every free minute I had outside of work I had to listen to my parents berate me and talk shit about my GF when they didn’t even know her. Eventually one night I snapped, I packed up my clothes and I got a hotel room. The next few months were bad. I don’t really want to share details but I ended up accumulating around 50k in credit card debt and my GF cheated on me and left. I was alone and didn’t know what to do so I went back to my parents. They were angry and never missed an opportunity to remind me of how much I fucked up. In all honesty I didn’t run away from home to be with my GF. I ran away from home because it was a toxic environment.

Now that I’m back home I have no job and am going to college to finish up my degree. I’m 24 years old and still a junior in college when my high school friends are becoming doctors or getting married and having kids. I’m sitting here unemployed with a mountain of debt, about to declare bankruptcy. Every day I feel like I want to end it all but the hope that maybe next year will be better stops me from doing so. I feel like a failure. I feel like I’m back in high school. I don’t want to leave my bed or face the outside world anymore. I’m hoping that in the summer I’ll be able to find an internship in my field so I can get a job soon to move out and finally start to live my life. At the moment I again feel like I have no control over my life. I can’t make my own decisions. My parents tell me who to talk to, where to go and what to do, I can’t say no because they pay for my expenses and school. They keep pushing being religious on me but I keep resisting. I would rather die than be religious after what religion has put me through. Yes, I could find a job and move out right now but I finally have a friend I can talk to and actually cares about me. He has always been there for me whenever I needed and always tried to steer me in the right direction. I trust him and he advised me to stay home and finish college and then get a good job where I can move up rather than getting a dead end job right now and making life harder for myself. I agree with him and so I’m trying my best to get done with college as soon as possible but some days I am drained and don’t want to get out of bed. When this happens I just keep reminding myself that maybe in a few years life will be better.

I feel torn about my feelings for my parents. On one hand I love them and they have given me any my brother anything that money can buy and I am grateful. However I want to live my life how I want to and they wont let me. I want to make them happy but unfortunately I have to pick between their happiness or mine. I don't know what to do. If I move out it will break their hearts again but if I stay I risk my mental health and sanity."
9zud41,2,2018-11-23,"[M4F] Mistletoe kisses, a rainbow party, and more ideas if you also think lipstick is ridiculously hot",this-ismyname999,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/9zud41/m4f_mistletoe_kisses_a_rainbow_party_and_more/,"Hey. I think lipstick is fucking sexy. And it only gets hotter when a girl leaves her mark on some lucky guy. So here are some brief starter ideas off the top of my head. I’m more than open to any tweaks, twists, and turns you'd like to throw or add to them. Just warning that I'm fairly vanilla, and not interested in much that's illegal/nonconsenual. Also please forgive me dipping in and out of 1st, 2nd, and 3rd person mid sentence here, I don’t do it during plays. 




You catch your boyfriend cheating and storm over to his apartment to get your things and get a little revenge. I'm his loyal BFF and roommate who he hurriedly begged to ""protect his shit"" before bailing, unable to face you. So we're alone together for the first time. There's a few ways this can go, but the general idea is that he was very possessive of you. It'd kill him to see your favorite lipstick smeared on another guy, much less his BFF. You could take my phone while you're riding me on the couch and text him ""She's gone. Door unlocked. I got pizza."" and then laugh to yourself and ask me to bend you over towards the doorway.





It's almost Christmas, so I'll go ahead and throw in a Mistletoe Party. This could be a neighborhood/suburbs affair thing, with a younger guy home from college and a bunch of horny, wild MILFs wearing red lipstick and hanging out under the mistletoe. The queen of the suburb would definitely want to re-introduce herself to this young man, and then walk around the party with him wearing her smooches across his cheek and neck. Or an office party, with the boss taking his fill of his employee's wives and somewhat cucking them, parading with different color lipstick kisses on his cheek, almost like collecting trophies from the women married to his subordinates. Fuck, that's kinda hot. Another twist could be the Boss' Naughty Slut Daughter. I could end up under the mistletoe with her before I recognize her. You'd purr at me, lying, ""Oh, I'm a new accounting intern"" as you plant another couple kisses along my jawline and glance across the room to see if Daddy notices yet. I don't want to get fired, so we could go somewhere more private, but then your pretty red lips would get a little more… messy.





Rainbow Party - you might remember this as some urban legend from Oprah. But it's been a fantasy of mine for a while. One version went that three girls invite three guys over. Each girl wears a different color lipstick, and sinks to her knees and starts sucking. After some time, each girl switches to another guy, then again to the final. So by the end, if each girl did their part right, each guy's cock would have three distinct different colored lipstick rings. Then I guess they can pick their favorite and cum in their mouth, or they keep trading until they cum, or it just turns into an orgy after that. But the idea of getting different shades of lipstick on my cock and somehow showing it off has always been a massive turn on and fantasy. This doesn't have to be a multiple girl character thing, it could totally be one girl who changes outfits/lipsticks/looks maybe throughout a night or party or something. 





Deepthroat Contest - Okay, backing up, this one is kind of a multiple character thing. There's not much to this - it could be two best friends, roommates, sisters, coworkers, whoever arguing over who can take more dick in their mouth. I'd be just any passing waiter or lucky dude that happens to be nearby. Maybe I'm someone that they know is ""notorious"" for being hung, since they know they need a long dick to prove themselves. Of course, the only way to prove where the girls' lips have been would be for both to put on a generous amount of some bold color lipstick…





Sci-Fi / Future / Fantasy / Vagueness - This is a bit of a last catch-all. I said I was kind of vanilla, but I do like some of this weird stuff. I had a hot prompt and couple stories go about mind control lipstick. I also wouldn't mind some kind of lipstick that makes the kiss-ee unbearably horny, or possibly one that enhances cum production when kissed onto a lucky man's nutsack. I also had another recent one about a sorority witch coven with spell casting lipstick and stuff that had some fun. 





Anyways, I hope any of this catches someone's eye. Part of this is just organizing my own thoughts and some ideas I could make into better, bigger, more full-fledged prompts. These are all aimed at women players, but I'm always open to messages from anyone just to chat about lipstick fetish/story ideas. PMing here is great, Discord is easier, haven’t used chat/KIK, but I’m willing to try them if it’s a dealbreaker for the right partner.

9zukmi,2,2018-11-23,[F4A] Galactic Bad-Ends,asdfghyt,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/9zukmi/f4a_galactic_badends/,"I'm Katherine Meadows, intergalactic adventurer. I'm about 5'9"" in Earth Units, have olive skin, black hair, and a fit body. I have B cup breasts and a classically beautiful face with bright green eyes. I'm a dancer by passion, galactic business heiress by circumstance. My father was a galactic tycoon and left me a huge fortune, a business empire, and a fleet of ships. Of course, like any 23 year old, running a huge business isn't my idea of a good time, so I decide to take a few years after Father's death to explore the galaxy before settling down for my working life. However, little do I know, but I won't be coming back...


Hi everyone! It's just a rough description but I hope it's enough to get your attention! My idea here is a young, rich girl goes off to have adventures in the galaxy but meets with a bad-end. Obviously, I'm not looking to get killed because that's decidedly un-sexy, but I'm looking for something more like permanent transformation, enslavement, complete mind washing, a life of forced space prostitution, and other extremely kinky and irreversible fates! I'll lay out some ideas, but feel free to come up with your own thing if that's what you want!

1. Enslaved.
This one is the easiest and most obvious. All this scenario involves is me being captured against my will and enslaved by someone or something. If I'm chained to the wall in a cheap brothel or sent into the crystal mines is up to you, but this one has to be interesting. Just saying ""I buy you and then you blow me"" isn't going to fly. I'm imagining maybe going on a little adventure to fight pirates, losing to them, being collared, and then being sold and shipped off across the galaxy to like bug people or something. It's a classic, but it can also be boring.

2. Bimbofied and/or dollified
This is another classic. With all the unsavory characters out there and all the new robotic, genetic, and chemical technologies, anything is possible. Maybe you offer me a job as your strip club's top model and offer me some minor and voluntary ""enhancements"" which aren't really voluntary or minor, turning me into your club's drooling, big titted headliner for life. Or maybe you're a mad scientist looking for a test subject and after I agree to be your intern for a while, you drug me and I wake up on your operating table being encased in latex before you give me more drugs to completely wipe my mind and turn me into a living, breathing, and definitely not thinking sexdoll with rubber skin and a gag reflex completely removed by gene mods.

3. Complete petplay transformation
Like last time, with all the new technologies out there, your pets can be transformed like never before! Why settle for pretending to be a pet when you can have their genes spliced with a bit of dog DNA? Why play bark when you can outfit them with a collar that blocks all human sounds and only allows barks, or even just remove their physical ability to speak completely? Why crawl around awkwardly when you can surgically create perfect puppy legs or even replace those awkward human limbs with robotic puppy legs? Why pretend to feel like a pet when you can just have a chip implanted in your brain to short circuit the whole thing and only let you feel the implanted dog instincts? This one has a lot of possibilities and I like it a lot, especially the more complete and detailed the transformation is. I don't want any gore or seriously gross stuff, but the door is open for complete and total mental and physical transformation.

4. Mind controlled
Again a classic with a galactic twist. Do I get addicted to some exotic drug, do you have a microchip inserted into my brain, do you put a collar on me that controls my every thought? Whatever happens, I want to be mind controlled completely, making me your permanent slave. Creativity wins big here.

5. Debt slavery
More interesting than the first slave prompt, but similar. Here I somehow run up a debt that I can't pay and I have to work for you until I can pay it off. Of course, with you adding extra bills to my tab and my low, low wages, I'm stuck here forever. It's more fun when you put me in sexy outfits that I have to buy or modify my body at my expense.

6. Captured
Maybe I go a bit too far into alien territory and they're just not happy with it. It happens all the time, adventurers going where they don't belong and being dragged into a hidden cave and kept forever. Or maybe I break the law on a far away planet and have to serve my time in their prison system, taking all the punishments (and likely dicks) that come with it? Not necessarily a slave prompt but one that involves me being captured and not free to leave.

So those are the ideas I have at the moment. I like the puppy transformation, dollification, and mind control the best, but crossovers and combinations are more than welcome. Like a totally modified, mind controlled puppy doll would be fine with me! My kinks are latex, slavery, noncon, drugs, medical, bondage, collars, mind control, prostitution, body modification, reluctance, and sleep play. Limits are kids, real animals, toilet stuff, blood and excessive violence, and excessively sized dicks. I'm a slut for detail and complicated plots, a plot that says ""U r my slave, now u suck my cock"" isn't fun for anyone. This whole thing is heavily inspired by the game Trials in Tainted Space, so I can send you links there for inspiration or even specific scenes I'm imagining. Anyway, I'm excited to hear from you all and I hope to have some kinky adventures with you very soon!"

9zuucg,12,2018-11-23,Should I move or continue at my current job?,chazychaz518,BusinessIntelligence,https://www.reddit.com/r/BusinessIntelligence/comments/9zuucg/should_i_move_or_continue_at_my_current_job/,"Hi fellows ETL and dashboard creators. I find myself in a situation that I don't know how to proceed I need help from you guys. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm about to graduate in college, and since last year I've been working with BI (started as an intern) in a financial company.

I've nothing to complain about my team everyone has been supportive everytime that I needed them. I was promoted from an intern in less than a year, and I'll probably (not sure) be promoted to a Jr role next year.

A few months ago my colleague left the company, and I'd taken all of his duties, so, I'm doing the work of two. BTW, his position was way above mine, so, I'm currently doing the job of two people but keeping up with my duties still.

To replace him the company wants to hire a Jr or a senior analyst, both of them would have a better position and paycheck, even though I'd teach them everything that they would do.

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand, I've been receiving multiple job offers, which all offered a better salary, etc.

Until this day I've refused all of them, except last week I've received a job offer to work In a bigger company, make 3x more and going up in two positions that I'm right now.

The job that I'd do there is very similar with what I'm doing right now.  They're re-structuring all of their BI environment, so, I'd be responsible to re-create basically, everything. Which is a huge thing for me! I wasn't part of this process where I'm working now, everything was ready when I got there.

&amp;#x200B;

My big question is, should I move to this new job or should I stay where I am?

&amp;#x200B;

PS1: There's, of course, a lot of others factors, but these were the principals that I could think of.

PS2: One thing that really holds me back to move to another job, is that I don't want to bail on them, the amount of job is already too much for us, if I left they will definitely not be able to handle everything. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you if you've read all through everything."
9zv4cr,1,2018-11-23,Receiving $31k in stocks,wolpendorfensi,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/9zv4cr/receiving_31k_in_stocks/,"Hi,

I have been a lurker for a while but I would like some advice for my own situation.

I'm 21 years old and a senior at a technical university. I'm graduating in June and will hopefully be working shortly thereafter in software engineering. I will be a fortunate human in that my school will have been paid off completely by graduation as well.

My grandfather is currently in the process of transferring over a custodial account from Fidelity to me as a graduation gift. It's been slowly growing since I was 10 and it is currently above $31k. He has always liked to talk about how my stocks are doing, and honestly I tended to leave him to it since I knew it wasn't yet my money he was taking risks with. Whatever happened I wasn't going into debt, so I let it be. I was also pretty young to worry over it.

Now that he's transferring the account over to me, I don't know what to do. I mentioned that I want to move it all to index funds and bonds, but he's convinced that I need to keep the money in stocks I pick out (like Coca Cola or Nike or whatever company I decide on). I also have about $21k in my own checking and savings from summer jobs and internships and just being frugal. I have a Discover It card and pay it off in full every month so that I'm building credit.

I've read the wiki on my age bracket and know I'm doing well without debt. I budget hard and am careful with my money. My biggest question is: what do I do with the stocks I'll be getting? Am I wrong to put it all in index funds and bonds? I don't want to have to deal with monitoring the stock market right now in life. I'd like to just let my money grow at a decent rate, nothing crazy.

Again, apologies if this is a question that comes up all the time, but I would like to make sure I'm not being too risk averse. My grandfather seemed kind of upset I didn't want to ""play"" the stock market with the stocks he's been setting up for years. I'm definitely grateful for what he's done so far.

Thanks."

I had just completed my internship with a company and was offered a full time job with a sister company in another state. I was excited about moving to a new city, but because of my reckless spending I did not have much money in the bank to afford a big move like this. It was depressing to know that after just turning twenty-five, I did not have much to show for my hard work. I was scheduled to begin my new job at the beginning of the next month so time was certainly a factor. I racked my brain trying to think of a solution but just was not coming up with anything. 

I decided to call my mother and talk to her and see if she had any ideas. After about an hour of talking and still not coming up with anything, an idea came from out of the blue, my Aunt Jane lives in the town where I was going to work, I thought maybe it would be a possibility to live with her until I got settled? Mom was not too keen on that idea but we eventually decided it was the only option. My Aunt Jane and my mother get along but they are two completely different people. My Aunt Jane has more of an outgoing personality and enjoys going out and having fun whereas my mother enjoys the quiet time at home with my father. 

Mom made the phone call and called me back to say that everything was settled and that Aunt Jane would not mind at all. It was settled then, I packed my belongings and headed out with about one week to move in and reacquaint myself with my Aunt. Driving up to my Aunt's house I wondered if I had made the wrong decision? I walked up to the door and was happily greeted by my Aunt Jane."

9zwr6v,1,2018-11-24,F4F - White girl wants to be Cuckqueaned,dppsexygirl,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/9zwr6v/f4f_white_girl_wants_to_be_cuckqueaned/,"Title basically covers it, haha.

I'm a college white girl in a relationship with a hot white guy looking for a non-white girl to basically steal my man and dominate me as a worthless piece of fuckmeat together.

Kinks: cumplay, being degraded/humiliated, cuckqueaning, raceplay, dirty talk, dom/sub, power imbalances, body writing, public/risk, dressup/outfits, rough sex

My ideal scenario is that I join the same sorority as you do and become friends, but secret rivals. I love the idea that you're attracted to both me and my boyfriend and you decide to seduce him (cuckquean me) and dominate me, kind of creating a three-way relationship where the two of you are dating and dominating me. I have a fantasy of nonwhite girls seducing all the good white guys because they're so much more feminine and sexy, leaving white girls to try to fend for themselves.

However, I'm open to many more scenarios! Another really hot scenario is that I'm a trophy wife to a really succesful businessman who's aged beautifully. He's aged like a fine wine and with all of his charm, success, and confidence, he's a catch for any girl. You're a younger, hotter, and more exotic girl that catches his attention and cuckqueans me. Is he a professor, and you're in his class? Are you his new intern at work? Are you my friend's daughter? Anything goes!"

1. when Big Jim forgives Jon Cho for the accident that killed his pregnant daughter

2. Jessica the little girl with Tay Sachs whose father wanted to take her to Mexico for alternative cures (both daughter and father acted really well, she was really adorable and the music that played, oh gosh)

3. The sweet old lady Rosemary - she signed a DNR and when she really died her husband couldn’t accept it and tried to revive her 

4. Intern Morgan’s baby’s death 

5. April’s friend who’s also a doctor who came into the hospital to die so he could be an organ donor (he fired her as his doctor)

ETA: honorable mention: the paramedic Stan’s death. I think partly because of his wife Sarah’s reaction. "

Does the Instinct keep tracking my steps if I keep it in my pocket? I had a Fenix 3 that I sold because it was too big, and it could track steps in my pocket, but then I replaced it with a Coros Pace and it doesn't track steps in my pocket, so I'm asking just to be sure before I pick up the Instinct. But I doubt it wouldn't track steps in my pocket if the Fenix 3 could do it."
9zys1r,1,2018-11-24,Roots,poor_icarus,u_poor_icarus,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_poor_icarus/comments/9zys1r/roots/,"So I'm back at Grandma's for the weekend. 

She's ill and I think she's barely conscious. I helped my uncle get her out of the wheelchair and tear her diaper from her waist. Looks like her legs have atrophied as they seem abnormally thin. 

She used to be a lively person, always asking me if I had breakfast and what I was doing in college. Now I don't know if she recognizes me anymore. 

As much as I fear to be close to my family, there is this compulsion that drives me to be closer, because I think there is something I need to understand regarding my roots. I have to remind myself where I came from and what I have been looking -- what has never been there in my childhood and what I've been trying to recreate. 

I'm a lot like my mother, actually. As much as people say I look more like my paternal side of the family, I see a strong resemblance of my self in my mother when looking at photographs of her when she was younger. The heart-shaped face, the pouty lips, the nose. 

I also have a tendency to panic and overreact like her and focus on the worst possible situations. 

There's more, of course. Her love for reading. She's an English teacher, after all. When I was in high school, I always accompanied her to the wet market behind our neighborhood and she always picked up novels from an older Chinese man. The man said she was the best reader. I like to read too. I rarely leave a bookstore empty-handed. 

Anyway, I have to finish my report and submit it before 11 am on Monday, means I have to stroll down the campus once again. I also have to pick up my certificate from Perodua for finishing this internship. I don't plan to linger on and let the memories catch me by the ankle. "

a000b0,5,2018-11-24,How do I ask him if he wants to hang out again?,josie_96,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/a000b0/how_do_i_ask_him_if_he_wants_to_hang_out_again/,"I have become good friends with this guy in class that I really like. This last Tuesday was the first time we really hung out and talked about things other than school and it was absolutely amazing. We talked for 5h and I didn't want it to stop.

We've been texting relatively daily since and I want to know how I can ask him to hang out again like last time without coming off as weird.

Last time, the context was that we'd been talking about the meaning of life on Facebook and he suggested we go for coffee or something the next day to talk more about it.

Next Tuesday, I'll have to go to an evening class after our class, so I can hang out with him but only for 1-2h max.

Other than that, we have an online quiz open Thursday evening to Friday evening that we'll be doing together. I would like to hang out with him after that quiz, if he doesn't have any plans after.

What can I say so it won't sound like I'm asking him out on a date? I really just want to keep getting to know him better.

Would suggesting we do an actual activity be better? I can't think of anything that he'd particularly be interested in doing.

I just feel like our conversation this week was such a huge step forward in building a foundation for our friendship (and hopefully a potential relationship) and, knowing myself, if I don't have a plan in place, I won't do anything to move forward and nothing will happen.

I'm also leaving the country for an internship in January, so I doubt I'll have time to date him at all. I just really like him and want to be closer to him and I suck at making friends. I really don't want to mess this up, so I would really appreciate any help :("
a018u9,1,2018-11-24,"Self aware, struggling “nice guy” looking for advice",throwaway-0yawaworht,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/a018u9/self_aware_struggling_nice_guy_looking_for_advice/,"
Reading people and social cues aren’t my greatest strength. Back in high school, I couldn’t accept rejection, take a hint, or realize what people were trying to say with ignorance. This led to cases of harassment and/or stalking, even with guys.

During college, I had a part time job, and there were a few girls hinting for me to make a move, and another practically begging to be asked out. As much as I wanted to, I couldn’t follow through with it. I was afraid of not knowing where the line was, and I’d cross it. Either of us would be better off without that happening.

Years go by with girls out of focus, and I’m relatively happy. Every once in a while, I’d think “Am I going to get a date or laid any time soon?” Hypocritical, I know since I’m not making any effort and keep to myself most of the time. I’m aware I can get obsessive, with sometimes controlling thoughts, and was avoiding triggering my anxiety. I’ve got no problem carrying a conversation with a girl or even flirting. There’s an older woman that I’m good friends with. I’m comfortable with that, since I know nothing is going to happen, since she’s married with a kid.

At my present full time job, but in another department, there was this girl, similar in age to me, that I was friendly with and on/off interested in. I let it be since a) the above, b) it’s work, c) she had a breakup with my coworker and d) I wasn’t getting any signals. She decides to leave the company, long distance, for what was supposed to be a short term internship. We hit it off as friends before she left, and I would like to have dated her had she come back (her friend brought up the idea in a group and I didn’t think anything of it being laughed off). We would occasionally text (with me being the main initiator, but at times knowingly suppressing my inner creep), and it seemed to go well, aside from me being an occasional dick.

Shortly before I believed she was to move back, I got overwhelmed and was about to snap to my old self. I couldn’t take it anymore, and figured my best move would be to cut ties. In a state of paranoia, I told her I was done and probably misread things between us (I at that point felt like a creep that a pretty girl was being polite to, and at the same time wanted to see how she saw things). She assumed I had feelings, said she didn’t, and I thanked her for listening.

I was relieved at that moment knowing that it was the best outcome. I got really depressed afterwards, not at the rejection, but the fact that my thoughts and mindset returned to the worst of myself, and threatened to ruin two people in the process. A mutual friend exchanged a reciprocated “Hi” for me months later, but I haven’t heard or seen her since. At times, I think of reaching out to catch up, and at others to ridicule her - so just don’t.

I know I’m what’s holding me back from making any progress with anybody else. Not only am I afraid to make a move, I’m unsure if I would follow through with a girl initiating anything. I’m still struggling with that and the fact that I’ve probably missed out on some good relationships or even sex. I realize I have a lot to work on, and am seeing a therapist, but was wondering if anybody else had some insight or advice. Thanks."
a02vji,8,2018-11-24,Am I overreacting or did my company really just suck at handling a sexual harassment case?,itsamethrowawa,TheGirlSurvivalGuide,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGirlSurvivalGuide/comments/a02vji/am_i_overreacting_or_did_my_company_really_just/,"Throwaway

This turned out to be really long, but there’s a TL;DR at the bottom

I’ve gone back and forth on whether or not I should post this for the last few months because I’ve been trying to convince myself that my company did enough dealing with this event, but I just can’t seem to get over it.

I’m currently going to school in a fairly liberal area of the deep south and I intern for a top general contracting firm (part time during the school year and full time during the summer). I’ve almost been there for an entire year now, and I’ve had nothing but positive and rewarding experiences. I love the people overall and the company culture as a whole. A few months ago, however, a really freaky thing happened, and I just don’t think my company handled it well at all.

I work in a trailer on site with one other female (like there are only two chicks on the entire site including all subcontractors and laborers). She’s a recent grad, and has only worked there for just over a year. She’s my direct contact and will go by D. She approached me one day and said, “Listen, I try to keep you out of the loop with any little dramas since you’re back in school now, but I really think you should know what’s going on because it actually involves you too.” She then tells me that a group of laborers had been telling a member of our team (J) all these sexual threats and had given us sexual nicknames that they say in another language when we walk the site. Some of the threats were stupid, but one of them really stuck out to me. They continuously said they were going to find the two of us after work and gang rape us. Hmmmm. Interesting. I tried to remain calm, but that really freaked me the fuck out for obvious reasons. I also felt a little betrayed because I had become friends with one of them throughout the summer. Anyways, I asked her if they were going to be removed from the site and she said no because there was more going on.

The guy they were telling these threats to (J) didn’t tell us. He accidentally joked about it to D and my good friend, F (who only works in the office), while they were at a bar drinking together. He said it laughingly and F thought it was funny too because she assumed he wouldn’t be laughing at it if he hadn’t taken care of it. A week or so after they went to the bar together, F and D got brunch together and F told her about what J had said laughingly and D obviously was fucking pissed because she had no idea and didn’t think it was funny. She then reported it to our site boss (G) who is a very important person to the company overall. He was livid and swore he’d take care of it. He got J’s boss involved and the next time I was at work, his boss was yelling at him in his office for over an hour. J of course just denied the entire thing and tried to say that F was lying and making up the entire thing and that no one on site had ever said anything. 

Here’s where I think they handled it poorly.

Because F refuses to just admit he handled it poorly and refuses to tell us who said these threats, we can’t remove anyone from the site nor punish him. The president of the branch and the head HR rep for the entire country ends up flying to our city and interviews D, F and J individually to see who was telling the truth. Eventually, the two of them decide that J is probably lying (duh), and they begin to suspect that the reason he is ratting the trade partner out is because he was probably chatting with them and joking around about the threats they were making/agreeing with them and stuff (if that makes sense). They still end up doing nothing through since they say there’s not enough proof. Instead, they decided that D and I are not allowed to walk on site alone, and have to have another person with us at all times… 

My boss, D, is now updating me and saying she’s trying just to let it go and that she’s probably overreacting and that nothing is going to happen and that his reputation is already ruined throughout the company anyways, but most importantly, that’s she’s worried she’s going to be labeled as “difficult to work with” if she keeps fighting this (construction is by far the most gossipy industry). I encouraged her to keep going though because it’s early on in his career, he’d worked at this company for even less time than I had, and that if he’s not punished now, he’s going to keep doing this to the future women he works with, and eventually something bad could happen. 

As a result, she told our boss that she did not feel comfortable working with him, and requested that he’s taken off the site. So he’s now working at a different project in our city… but that’s it… he still has his job and a clean record...

Am I crazy for thinking he should’ve been heavily punished for this? Literally everyone knew he was lying and that he was most likely in on these threats! Why would we want to keep someone like that working for our company? I just don’t understand. It’s really made me question whether or not I want to work here anymore even though it’s a top firm in the US. Is feeling safe that much to ask for? I’m also worried that the few steps that were taken wouldn’t have even been taken if it was just D involved. I think people were more angry because I’m so much younger and not even full time. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: laborers were telling a coworker they were going to gang rape my only other female coworker and I. He did nothing and barely got punished for it. Am I overreacting thinking they should’ve fired him for not coming forward about the threats and/or shutting them down?"

Hope americans had a good harvest festival! Let's see what's exciting this week…

I finally read the excellent [Bobble](https://forums.spacebattles.com/posts/52615450) which also got an update this week! Cracky-premise (Taylor is an obsessed Funko Pop! collector who can consume them to gain the powers of the cape represented by one) leads to much less cracky fic than one would expect.

[Diary of a Professional Knockoff](https://forums.spacebattles.com/posts/52522426) got a cute little in character informational post about PRT departments.

The astoundingly excellent [Don't Do brains](https://forums.spacebattles.com/posts/52594399) got a new interlude!!

[HOTSWAP](https://forums.spacebattles.com/posts/52527847) got an unbelievable 11 chapters (short ones however) and 10 omake. Definitely check out the omake!

And relatedly, I also finally read [Pick A Card](https://forums.spacebattles.com/posts/52619632). It is in some ways the spiritual successor to THE TECHNO QUEEN (*crack-thoom*), in that it's hammy and legitimately funny, but is played way more straight and this allows for some real drama.  Also great example of a power twisting someone's mind.

Amongst my favs, [In Golden Armour](https://forums.spacebattles.com/posts/52560325) got an up-to-standard adorable chapter, and two omake, one a cross with HOTSWAP.

Speaking of favs, [Mixed Feelings](https://forums.spacebattles.com/posts/52557214) got a little sidestory.

a04wgx,3,2018-11-24,Is it bad to have a common theme (UC Essays)?,mattau13,CollegeEssayReview,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeEssayReview/comments/a04wgx/is_it_bad_to_have_a_common_theme_uc_essays/,"Hey guys, I've written 4 essays that I think are pretty good, but what I've noticed is that they have one common theme (computer science). Not necessarily that they are focused on CS but that it plays a role in each essay. I was wondering if this would be problematic.

My essays are:

Subject That Inspires You? 
I talk about participating in a hackathon as my way of furthering my interests and my exposure to teamwork and collaboration/collective success

Community Service?
I talk about teaching Java to middle school students (one of my main extracurricular activities)

Educational Experience?
I talk about working as an intern at a tech startup and what I've learned about entrepreneurship while mentioning that I wrote code for the company.

Greatest Skill?
Independent Learning - Learned how to build computers by myself among other things."
a0505k,1,2018-11-24,[25m] not sure how to move on from friend [30f],StolenFace777,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a0505k/25m_not_sure_how_to_move_on_from_friend_30f/,"So we basically have all our classes together and I got her phone number we went on a date to the movies and once she made dinner for me at her place about a month ago.. We haven't gotten physical or anything and we haven't really hung out since then. We would text everyday and I would call her a couple times or have lunch together. Once I told her over text that I liked her and then she said that she thinks I'm a great guy but only sees me as a friend but we would celebrate together after the semester is over.

Lately I've been dealing with anxiety/depression really bad to the point where I would feel like crying randomly at school or have panic attacks. Honestly she stresses me out a lot . She said she was there if I needed someone to talk to but I feel like I am oversharing my problems with her. I can tell she is losing her attraction towards me. Also from the beginning of the relationship I feel like she is better than me , she has a really good job outside of school (I don't) and makes good money(I haven't felt like that as much lately though). We also had a discussion about what I expected to make after I graduated and she was like "" thats it?, I made about that much after dental hygiene school"". I just gave a random number I am just trying to get through school rn. She has a place and a car I just live in the dorms. I feel like I started to get clingy and asked her 4 times on 4 different days to hangout before Thanksgiving break she said she was busy but could hang out after the semester is over. She always would respond to all my texts/ calls. She said on the phone once that she needed space. She seems understanding and wants to help me.

However i sent her a long text during break the night of Thanksgiving and she read it yesterday morning. This is what I said "" Dont worry there are other women who will make me feel loved and cared for so you should feel happy for me, if you dont see me that way , its ok dont be sorry . I am not alone. I also have a family I am grateful for.

I'm good looking, smart confident. The fact that you try to laugh at me when I talk about other women just shows your stuck up and I don't need you.

Im also really busy with coding projects I need to finish. Freelance work takes a lot of self discipline since I am my own boss in that aspect and I'm passionate about what I do. Also looking for internships have goals.

Also having an anxiety attack a real friend would tell me to take deep breathes and relax and say everything will b OK... not be critical like u were at lunch that one time.. Dont ask me a bunch of questions like did u do this/take this today or how bad it is to have anxiety I know its bad! Also let me finish my sandwich if ur gonna eat with me for fucks sake..

I only associate myself with kind and respectful people of my feelings and time im busy too, I dont normally like to make last second plans w ppl us seem to do me when u want to do something. Ive been doing that lately too but I would prefer notice ahead of time that parts nbd tho.. Thanks for reading this message have a nice day!""

I think I really messed up with that text and I really regret it. She apologized that I felt this way about all those things but felt like I didn't like her and said she wanted to be left alone now. I told her I did like her and maybe I overreacted and just didn't want to be taken advantage of/felt insecure. She suggested I should seek more therapy and I said I will let her know when I start to feel better. Now she said she dosn't want me to contact her and that she is taking a break from our friendship. I have her in all my classes and I normally sit with her in this one class idk if I should now. I feel like I push all the girls I like away :(

TLDR: was good friends with this girl I liked might have messed it up in a text message/not giving enough space"
a05smq,4,2018-11-25,ROCD sucks and stops me from casual/romantic dating,throwaway-0yawaworht,ROCD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ROCD/comments/a05smq/rocd_sucks_and_stops_me_from_casualromantic_dating/,"Reading people and social cues aren’t my greatest strength. Back in high school, I couldn’t accept rejection, take a hint, or realize what people were trying to say with ignorance. This led to cases of harassment and/or stalking, even with guys.

During college, I had a part time job, and there were a few girls hinting for me to make a move, and another practically begging to be asked out. As much as I wanted to, I couldn’t follow through with it. I was afraid of not knowing where the line was, and I’d cross it. Either of us would be better off without that happening.

Years go by with girls out of focus, and I’m relatively happy. Every once in a while, I’d think “Am I going to get a date or laid any time soon?” Hypocritical, I know since I’m not making any effort and keep to myself most of the time. I’m aware I can get obsessive, with sometimes controlling thoughts, and was avoiding triggering my anxiety. I’ve got no problem carrying a conversation with a girl or even flirting. There’s an older woman that I’m good friends with. I’m comfortable with that, since I know nothing is going to happen, since she’s married with a kid.

At my present full time job, but in another department, there was this girl, similar in age to me, that I was friendly with and on/off interested in. I let it be since a) the above, b) it’s work, c) she had a breakup with my coworker and d) I wasn’t getting any signals. She decides to leave the company, long distance, for what was supposed to be a short term internship. We hit it off as friends before she left, and I would like to have dated her had she come back (her friend brought up the idea in a group and I didn’t think anything of it being laughed off). We would occasionally text (with me being the main initiator, but at times knowingly suppressing my inner creep), and it seemed to go well, aside from me being an occasional dick.

Shortly before I believed she was to move back, I got overwhelmed and was about to snap to my old self. I couldn’t take it anymore, and figured my best move would be to cut ties. In a state of paranoia, I told her I was done and probably misread things between us (I at that point felt like a creep that a pretty girl was being polite to, and at the same time wanted to see how she saw things). She assumed I had feelings, said she didn’t, and I thanked her for listening.

I was relieved at that moment knowing that it was the best outcome. I got really depressed afterwards, not at the rejection, but the fact that my thoughts and mindset returned to the worst of myself, and threatened to ruin two people in the process. A mutual friend exchanged a reciprocated “Hi” for me months later, but I haven’t heard or seen her since. At times, I think of reaching out to catch up, and at others to ridicule her - so just don’t.

I know I’m what’s holding me back from making any progress with anybody else. Not only am I afraid to make a move, I’m unsure if I would follow through with a girl initiating anything. I’m still struggling with that and the fact that I’ve probably missed out on some good relationships or even sex. I realize I have a lot to work on (and not just regarding this) and am seeing someone for CBT, but that’s more to get my life back on track.

tl;dr: Have trouble with social cues, obsessive/controlling thoughts stop me from even trying to date; if I make any progress I eventually either ruin it for both of us or cut ties before it gets out of hand. ROCD sucks."
a06vhn,2,2018-11-25,Negotiating an Unpaid Internship into a Paid Internship,StatusSnow,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/a06vhn/negotiating_an_unpaid_internship_into_a_paid/,"Hi redditors of personal finance. I'm hoping to get some advice on how to best go about a situation that has developed at my internship.

&amp;#x200B;

I started at this internship about a month and a half ago, working in the film finance space. Originally, I was set to work 12/hrs a week as an unpaid intern. I did not mind this, as I had little to no experience and was eager to gain some. Though, it should be said that I have a high GPA in a tough degree at a prestigious school -- it was not exactly hard for me to get this position, nor would it be hard for me to find another. 

&amp;#x200B;

 I have been really enjoying and excelling in this internship. I'm not saying this to brag on myself, but it is objectively true.  I've heard nothing but positive feedback, finish tasks ahead of time, have been asked to lead \*\*all\*\* of the intern projects (projects that will take \~2 mos each to complete), and recently pitched an idea for a long-term research project that my boss was really excited about. I've become somewhat of a go-to person in the company to throw work at when people get overloaded, as I've consistently done a good job and completed tasks ahead of time. One specific example of this is that I have spent a lot of time doing script creative feedback reports -- this is meant to be the job of a senior level position in our company, but he has personally asked me to take some of these on myself as I am doing a good job at them and the company has been inundated with scripts recently. It should be said that I enjoy the people I work with, and they have been great mentors to me both personally and professionally. 

&amp;#x200B;

The only problem is that now that my bosses have seen what I can handle, I've had so much work thrown at me in the last couple of weeks that I have to work 25+ hours a week and through the weekends to keep up. This is getting hard to justify for an unpaid position, and means I'm working nearly double the hours of the two other interns on the team. 

&amp;#x200B;

Last week, my boss emailed me into an email with 5 other people telling them that I was to be the point of contact for a project that is going to take several months, and that I was to lead and delegate tasks with the other interns. He did this all without asking me, which obviously made me really frustrated. I sent him a private email back saying that I would reach out to the other person leading the project and get started delegating tasks, but that I hoped we could sit down at on a certain date and discuss expectations for next semester, specifically the possibility of this becoming a paid internship for the next semester (I was asked to stay on for the next semester around 3 weeks ago). I brought to his attention that I was working 25 hours a week, as I'm not sure he was entirely aware of this, and that this internship has gone above and beyond what I originally expected it to be. He seemed receptive and he said he was glad to sit down and talk about this. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm planning on sitting down with him next week, and I was looking for advice as to how to go about this discussion. I honestly do not know if I will continue on unpaid, but would absolutely be cutting down on workload if I did. However, I am completely fine with my current workload just not at an unpaid position. Do you guys have any advice for how I can about negotiating this so I can turn my unpaid internship into a paid position? Thanks!"
a075bm,6,2018-11-25,I am this close to losing my fucking shit.,problemsthrowaway22,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/a075bm/i_am_this_close_to_losing_my_fucking_shit/,"I took on too much this semester. I graduate in December (only three weeks left) and feel like I'm struggling to finish. I don't care if I fail.

I'm working 60 hours a week and taking six credits worth of classes. I love my internship, my job pays well, and my classes aren't too hard. But it is too fucking much. 

Too. Fucking. Much. 

I have three weeks left of this hell and I don't know what's going to give out next. I hardly eat anymore, my personal hygiene is out the window, I don't see my friends or my boyfriend anymore, I sleep too little or too much, and I don't give a damn about due dates anymore. I feel like if I had a good cry that I could overcome this but I am too stressed to cry. 

I have spread myself too thin and am terrified to see if anything else gives out before this time is up because anything else the breaks under the pressure is going to be vitally important to me. 

On the bright side:
- I have full support from my boyfriend and family
- I have a job interview next week for after graduation 
- I am fucking done I'm three weeks. THREE WEEKS. 

I don't know why I'm here. Maybe to vent, maybe for words of encouragement. I'm really struggling and I'm tired of telling people close to me because I don't want them to worry or have to listen to this shit again. I just need a day to myself, but I work seven days a week... I never have time to recover. Maybe if you have any tips to calm down or you're in the same boat as me and we can complain together. I don't know, I just need help fighting through this last stretch. 

Thanks guys &lt;3"
a07lxr,0,2018-11-25,Rank Juuni Taisen Characters,Lievrehare,anime,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/a07lxr/rank_juuni_taisen_characters/,"From least liked to favorite:

\-Rat: I honestly never stand for him from the start, at first it was just alright to have him around, but then came the end and I was really disappointed. I find his character to be really unrelatable even though he is supposed to be that ""normie"" character that we are supposed to all relate to. His power was OP, he is a coward in the battles, and he made the events of the anime useless.

\-Horse: Again, I found his character kinda bland, but he had some depths going on before he died. I liked how his power was not that OP too.

\-Ox: He was the character that I wanted to die at first, for reasons I will explain later. Still, as I watched the others episodes, I realized he was just playing the battle royale and his alliance with Tiger was cute. Noble character, I respect but I don't like.

\-Dog: Even though his design was more wolf than dog, I appreciated his character though. He was a more entertaining version of Ox.

\-Sheep: He could be tied with Dog, but I slightly appreciated him more for being kind of cute. A small old man running around in a battle royale. Too bad that his death was anti-climatic (like most).

\-Boar: Now we are getting to the characters that I like. Or in her case, I love to hate her, so being in the middle of the rank seems fair. Her whole selfish, harem-minded, arrogant persona was really fun.

\-Rabbit: He had a great design, a fun personnality, and a growing OP power, next to Rat. Even if he kills most of the characters, I cannot blame him when I see how lost he seems in his own mind. His lack of backstory is perhaps good because the anime was already burdened by too much backstory focus. Perhaps that instead of Rat's boring story, his would have been better to discover.

\-Monkey: She was too good for this sinful Earth. Even though, she was kind but not that naïve. It was sad to see her go, but in a battle royal the best often go first in this kind of tournament.

\-Snake/Dragon: They are twins with the same personnality, so I put them in the same place. They were entertaining and had some depths going on. I could rank Snake above Dragon just because his design is hotter.

\-Tiger: I would have never thought that I would like a drunkard fanservice character, but I liked her for how simple and honest she was. The true winner of the battle royale who also died with anti-climax.

And my favorite character is….

Chicken! She is the character I relate the most too, perhaps the only one I relate to, which is what makes her my favorite. As I said, Ox became the character I hated the most after killing her. Indeed, I love cute but psycho characters. The way she played with Dog was great. Then her power was not OP. I also think that she had suicidal tendencies while walking in the battle royale, explaining why she did not brought bombs. Everything about her makes sense; her name, her design and personnality which make her seem vulnerable. Her relationship with animals after being traumatized by humans.

Then, she was the only character to have a character development I think. She could not make difference between friends and foes, so meeting Monkey really made her change. It's too bad that Ox killed her before she could discover that with how cute and funny she is, she could get a lot of friends. I would have loved her to become the real protagonist of the anime, it would have been more fun to see her intern dilemma between paranoia and kindness.

Also, her death was fast, but not anti-climatic. It makes sense. She was a manipulative character, was mostly brains. So when she ""sacrificed"" her life for Monkey, she was not going to last long against a fighting character like Ox."

a09xdx,71,2018-11-25,I [25F] think my ex boss [40sF] is taunting me and I need guidance on how to act.,onemarijuanas,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/a09xdx/i_25f_think_my_ex_boss_40sf_is_taunting_me_and_i/,"Hi everyone!

I’m going to try to explain our past clearly because a lot happened.

I started working for my ex boss at 18 as an intern. I basically worked my ass off, often times 7 days a week, for free. During this time she was really fair with me, gave me many opportunities and was kind. As time went on, I became a professional and started working for her as a paid pro (we are in a sport industry). I was always grateful to her. After I went pro, another girl started working for her. We got on great for awhile, and then eventually things got weird at tense. Looking back, I can see now that my boss was pinning us against each other. I won’t go into details, but know this happened and caused a ton of tension over time.

Again, without going into details, eventually my working relationship with my boss got very toxic. During this time my boss was cheating on her husband, encouraging me and my coworker to help her cheat (forcing us to stay out late and help her get numbers...etc). My coworker was also cheating so they had a little thing going where they would talk about what they were up to giggling like high schoolers.

ANYWAYS, my coworker ends up quitting, I kept working because we had invested in a business venture together (well, my dad and her). My dad and I were very naive (I am about 20/21 at this point) and now looking back I realize how much she screwed us over. 

My boss would manipulate me, take advantage of my giving nature. One night we were traveling for a work event and she wanted to go out, not giving me any other option otherwise I would suffer “consequences” (mind games. She likes to give the silent treatment, favoritism, etc). she forced me to stay out until 2 am, and had to watch this 40 yr old woman with a husband and daughter at home eat up the attention from multiple men.

We had to be up at 5am the next day and of course I had to do all the heavy lifting that day as she was too tired.

I had enough.

I had ended up flipping out one day and rage quit. Honestly best feeling ever. All of my anxieties lifted off my shoulder. I had never felt anxiety like I did working for that woman. She wanted me to come back and work for her and I didn’t. Moved on. 

After I rage quit, she turned one of my best friends against me and I honestly haven’t felt heartache like that before. I was so close to this person and I still miss her very much. 

Now...over two years later. I have moved across the country and started my own business. I’m no longer the same, naive, insecure young 20 yr old like I was. Except when I see this woman’s name, I get anxious. And every 3-6 months or so, she somehow comes back up.



6 months ago she invited me to “like” her business’s Facebook page that I had unliked because I didn’t want to follow it anymore. She noticed I didn’t follow it and did that on purpose, I feel.

I deleted her on Facebook.

She recently got an Instagram page and at the time my insta page was public. She went through and watched my stories one day, then I made my Instagram private.

Now, her business’s Instagram page just followed my business’s Instagram page. Then she went through and liked a bunch of my pictures.


I really, REALLY just want her to leave me alone. I feel weird not following her back, because I’m trying really hard to let go and not hold a grudge but I really struggle with forgiving this woman who made me suffer intense mental anguish over the 3 years I worked for her. I felt like I wasn’t a person around her. I also cannot forgive her for what she did to her husband and sweet child. I struggle with letting her husband know somehow every couple of months. I also cannot forgive her for ruining one of my favorite friendships. 

And I know it’s something so silly. It’s just ducking social media. But I don’t understand why every 6 months or she pops up somehow. 

Why won’t she leave me alone.
How should I address this, or should I even?
What can I change within myself to make myself feel stronger when her name pops up like this? 
I feel weak. And I don’t want to feel this way just because of her.


TL:DR my manipulative ex boss’s name pops up every once in awhile and I just want her to leave me alone.

If you expect the worst you will never be disappointed. So when the expedition leader warned the adventurers not to offend the ""respectable tourists"", he knew, deep in his heart, that in the best case maybe the town will not be on fire by the end of the week. Well, it wasn't. But most of the expedition is dead now, realising that perhaps pirates do know how to fight in tight quarters. The rabble of thieves and pirates tossed their stolen loot and fled once they heard about a patrol arriving from the capital to bring the town to order. But now that the excitement died down, someone still needs to go down there and excavate. So you! Yes, you! Humbleton requires your services. You'll surely get rich, and probably won't die!

The theme of this dungeon level is **magic**. Tell the world about a clever magic system or about an inventive way to control magic in a game. 

You can request any number of games. First come - first served, aggregated by day. Starting the next day after the offer is posted, if you're the only person who requested a particular game, you get it and aren't eligible for any other games that day. If multiple eligible people request a game the winner is selected randomly. People who put some effort in their comment will have more weight in the selection. This repeats until all games are distributed. For Humble Bundle games, I will be sending gift links after receiving a response to my congratulatory DM. A few offers have multiple copies.

I am a dualite, Bio + CS. If anyone has any questions, go ahead. The AMA is on.

\[22:01\] &lt;jammer219&gt; placement scenario for electronics (EEE/ENI) Dualites ?

\[22:01\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; well, its better than those for mech and civil

\[22:01\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; after cs peeps, eee, eni ones get placed the most

\[22:01\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; mostly in IT companies

\[22:02\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; paypal for example actually interviewed EEE people first

\[22:03\] &lt;derp2&gt; any suggestions for a civil dualite with 6 cg?

\[22:03\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; i'll be frank, placements are going to be tough

\[22:03\] &lt;chotasizzz&gt; what about placements in financial sector?

\[22:03\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; core companies put some emphasis on cg

\[22:04\] &lt;derp2&gt; around what fraction of comapnies have a cg parameter?

\[22:04\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; you can try IT companies, if you are good at competitive, a lot of companies overlook everthing else

\[22:04\] &lt;naruto&gt; is the scenario in mech core encouaging?

\[22:04\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; many

\[22:04\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; +naruto, no

\[22:04\] &lt;tattitatte&gt; how are placements for eee/eni in it companies in 2nd sem?

\[22:05\] &lt;KYGO&gt; how is placement scenario for chemical

\[22:05\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; +naruto, 2 companies came this sem, i think

\[22:05\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; +KYGO, same

\[22:05\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; 2-3 companies mostly

\[22:05\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; people with good CGs usually take those

\[22:06\] &lt;juju\_on\_that\_beat&gt; PS2 sem preference?

\[22:06\] &lt;unknownbitch&gt; how many companies(IT) come in second sem which are open for civil(dualite)?

\[22:06\] &lt;jammer219&gt; how difficult is it to grab a decent IT job (14-15 LPA) for EEE/ENI Dualites having a cg of around 7.6 

\[22:06\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; are you asking me which sem to take for PS

\[22:06\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; +jammer, not that tough

\[22:06\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; invest time is competitive

\[22:06\] &lt;juju\_on\_that\_beat&gt; As in pros and cons of diff sem for ps2

\[22:06\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; thats all they care about

\[22:07\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; well, this time, majority people took a PS in sem 1

\[22:07\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; companies pay more for placements in sem 1

\[22:07\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; usually

\[22:07\] &lt;the\_greatest&gt; what about PPO in finance PS2 1sem, current situation? 

\[22:08\] &lt;KYGO&gt; what is the average package given by IT firm?

\[22:08\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; +the\_greatest, can't say

\[22:08\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; +KYGO, average can be misleading

\[22:08\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; since a few people drive up the avg

\[22:08\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; but a median is 10-12LPA

\[22:09\] &lt;nazi&gt; +chat

\[22:09\] &lt;KYGO&gt; did any finance company turn up this time for placement and what is the scenario for consulting firms?

\[22:09\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; not many finance afaik

\[22:09\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; 3-4 companies for consulting

\[22:10\] &lt;KYGO&gt; which one?

\[22:10\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; bcg, mckinsey, indus insights

\[22:10\] &lt;Jon\_\_Snow&gt; how many open to all branch IT companies companies come in first and second sem? 

\[22:10\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; many, almost no one is prepared for development work

\[22:10\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; companies know that

\[22:10\] &lt;the\_greatest&gt; what are main focus(requirement) of consulting companies?

\[22:11\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; problem solving skills

\[22:11\] &lt;King@slayer98&gt; Did you do any internship in the summer after your third year?

\[22:11\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; and they put good emphasis on PORs

\[22:11\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; give you a hypothetical scenario and you have to solve it

\[22:11\] &lt;jkl;'a&gt; how is the placement scenario (IT) in the second semester? 

\[22:11\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; +King@slayer98, after third year, no

\[22:12\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; i'm a dualte, so I interned at de shaw after my 4th year

\[22:12\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; +jkl;'a, its always good for IT

\[22:12\] &lt;KYGO&gt; how would you suggest to start the preparation for IT firms considering C is the only programming language I know and I am a third yearite.

\[22:12\] &lt;jkl;'a&gt; like can you draw comparisons with the first sem

\[22:13\] &lt;Hunt&gt; if we wish to do a SOP in 3-1 are any special skills required...like do we need to develop any particular skills related to the field? 

\[22:13\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; +KYGO, focus on c++

\[22:13\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; start competitive

\[22:13\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; you have enought time 

\[22:13\] &lt;King@slayer98&gt; If its ok, can you tell where are you placed and in which profile?

\[22:13\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; i got a PPO at de shaw, software developer at FO

\[22:14\] &lt;saanp&gt; how should i start coding if i am a 3 yerite of eni and done a little coding stuff?

\[22:14\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; +jkl;'a, first companies usually pay more

\[22:14\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; but pay is pretty good in second sem too, if you get placed in eaerly day companies

\[22:14\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; +Hunt, no. LOL

\[22:15\] &lt;KYGO&gt; can we do thesis and ps both considering i am a single degree student

\[22:15\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; barely anyone actually accomplishes anything of importance in their SOPs

\[22:15\] &lt;iNOcent&gt; what level of competitive programming do i need? what is your current rating level on CodeChef / CodeForces?

\[22:15\] &lt;rocko&gt; eni with 6.4cg, not interested in core. Can do coding if need to. Took one finance course this sem.(3-1) any scope of placement? xD kuch umeed place hone ki?

\[22:15\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; +KYGO, i dont think so

\[22:15\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; +iNOcent, i acually used hackerrank

\[22:15\] &lt;saanp&gt; my cg is 7.7 and i am in 3-1....so should go for ps-2 in sem1 or sem2...i have done a little competitive coding

\[22:16\] &lt;hellothere&gt; whats better for a dualite? (in terms of time needed to learn and packagse) - Data science (ML and stuff) or competetive coding? 

\[22:16\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; always competetive

\[22:16\] &lt;code&gt; what grades do people generally get in SOP in CS department , considering they havent done anything new?

\[22:16\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; everyone knows ML and no one knows it

\[22:17\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; +saanp, see if you reach a good level of competitive before placements

\[22:17\] &lt;bahar\_se\_bhola&gt; is the placement scenario in IT for non circuit,non cs branches good?

\[22:17\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; if yes, sit for placements in first sem, else go for PS

\[22:17\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; you have enough time though

\[22:17\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; +code, not sure. I did one. got an A. People generally get a B

\[22:18\] &lt;Jon\_\_Snow&gt; any chance for ppo in ps2 in IT firm for a chemical guy with 7.3 cg

\[22:18\] &lt;saanp&gt; doing coding along with maintainig a decent cg in eni is [tuff.so](https://tuff.so) is it enough i will start coding in summers 

\[22:18\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; +saanp

\[22:18\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; thats what i did

\[22:18\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; i started just during summers

\[22:18\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; got an internship

\[22:18\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; then PPO

\[22:18\] &lt;BeastMaster64&gt; Things I should definitely try out on campus atleast once?

\[22:19\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; also, if possible, always try ofr an internship

\[22:19\] &lt;staaahp&gt; do you mind sharing your CG at the time of getting the internship?

\[22:19\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; 8.5 ish

\[22:19\] &lt;the\_greatest&gt; are there companies from fintech area visiting the campus?

\[22:19\] &lt;saanp&gt; so have you got off campus intern?

\[22:19\] &lt;Gen\_lite\_be&gt; Is a sem worth competitive enough to get into a good IT firm. I am from a circuit branch? 

\[22:19\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; the\_greatest, many, de shaw, gs

\[22:19\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; etc

\[22:19\] &lt;KYGO&gt; How to go about for an internship if you are not able to land one on campus

\[22:19\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; +Gen\_lite\_be, yes, i think

\[22:20\] &lt;code&gt; what are the cons of not getting an internship after 3rd year , considering i am single degree cs?

\[22:20\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; KYGO, check the websites of those companies

\[22:20\] &lt;payo!!&gt; I am a maths+cs dualite, 3rd yr. shall I go for an internship in next summer or sit at home and do competitive and prepare for internships?

\[22:20\] &lt;Jon\_\_Snow&gt; any chance for ppo in ps2 in IT firm for a chemical guy with 7.3 cg?

\[22:20\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; +code, placements are rather random. companies pay a higher stipend

\[22:20\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; PPO's are easier

\[22:21\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; +payo!!, prepare for internships

\[22:21\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; or do both

\[22:21\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; you have you next sem

\[22:22\] &lt;code&gt; what do you exactly mean when you say placements are random?

\[22:22\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; +BeastMaster64, go for trips with your friends

\[22:22\] &lt;Hunt&gt; can we take days off in ps1? like 1 or 2 days?

\[22:22\] &lt;payo!!&gt; but it's quite difficult to spare time on campus bcoz of CDCs of both branches

\[22:22\] &lt;code&gt; i guess more companies come for placements than internships and also the students are also less , since many go for PS2

\[22:22\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; \*to

\[22:22\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; payo!!, then maybe prepare ofr internships

\[22:23\] &lt;payo!!&gt; ok, and do cg really matter for internships?

\[22:23\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; +code, yes. but from personal experience, i saw really smart people who werent selected

\[22:23\] &lt;KYGO&gt; sabse phod chiz kya ki on campus aapne?

\[22:24\] &lt;bahar\_se\_bhola&gt;  is the placement scenario in IT for non circuit,non cs branches good?

\[22:24\] &lt;payo!!&gt; I mean is 8.5+ good?

\[22:24\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; +KYGO, asked out a random girl from DU during Oasis

\[22:24\] &lt;KYGO&gt; rejected?

\[22:24\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; payo!!, 8.5+ is really good

\[22:24\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; clears all the cutoffs

\[22:24\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; +KYGO, no

\[22:25\] &lt;KYGO&gt; phodaa, what about on campus girls?

\[22:25\] &lt;payo!!&gt; but some say that some companies shortlist only 9 pointers and also its unsaid but they select only high cg people

\[22:25\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; she was the first one i ever approached

\[22:25\] &lt;Hunt&gt; can we take days off in ps1? like 1 or 2 days?

\[22:26\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; +Hunt, joking right, i didnt go for weeks at time

\[22:26\] &lt;PersonalGandu&gt; hey peeps

\[22:26\] &lt;Hunt&gt; oh lol alright

\[22:26\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; but mostly depends on your station, most are useless

\[22:26\] &lt;Hunt&gt; that's what i've heard too

\[22:26\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; payo!!, on the contrary

\[22:26\] &lt;hydragyrum&gt; What's the magic of BITS Pilani for you?

\[22:26\] &lt;PersonalGandu&gt; why do we need to study these subjects?

\[22:27\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; +hydragyrum, my friends

\[22:27\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; and the connections you form

\[22:27\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; i was rather introverted when i first came in

\[22:27\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; definitely more open to new experiences

\[22:27\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; and made real friends

\[22:27\] &lt;Animefreak&gt; @scarlet\_speedster, what's your best drunk story?

\[22:27\] &lt;PersonalGandu&gt; exactly kitne paise mil rahe hai apko?

\[22:27\] &lt;hydragyrum&gt; Same but I don't know about real friends

\[22:28\] &lt;PersonalGandu&gt; CSE hi hogi

\[22:28\] &lt;hydragyrum&gt; Did you just go around and talk to people? How did you get over that initial social anxiety, if you had any?

\[22:29\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; KYGO, don't have a ton of expreience, im not exactly a ladies man

\[22:29\] &lt;Hunt&gt; i am also bhosdiwala

\[22:29\] &lt;Gen\_lite\_be&gt; Do people go for off campus thesis after sitting for placements for some days? 

\[22:29\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; but in my case, i just asked her if she was with someone and would she hang out

\[22:30\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; Gen\_lite\_be, dont follow

\[22:30\] &lt;payo!!&gt; If I choose to go for double PS, will I be eligible to sit for placements?

\[22:30\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; darkbreaker, my friends and the girl i found during oasis

\[22:30\] &lt;PersonalGandu&gt; how to earn with low cgpa?

\[22:30\] &lt;PersonalGandu&gt; and non-cse 

\[22:30\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; payo!!, yes, you have a small windows of 1-2 weeks to sit for placements

\[22:31\] &lt;Animefreak&gt; @scarlet :(

\[22:31\] &lt;Hunt&gt; @PersonalGandu, try musically

\[22:31\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; PersonalGandu, will be tough

\[22:31\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; but again, if you are really good with coding, many IT companies will be more than willing ot take you

\[22:32\] &lt;Lelouch&gt; ama

\[22:32\] &lt;PersonalGandu&gt; how will you quantify ""being good at coding""?

\[22:32\] &lt;Hunt&gt; +1

\[22:32\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; graphs, dp, bfs, dfs etc

\[22:32\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; should be able to do it

\[22:33\] &lt;Lelouch&gt; wait bfs as in boyfriends?

\[22:33\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; interviewers give you questions, and you should be able to come up with a solution

\[22:33\] &lt;Hunt&gt; @Lelouch, such jokes, much wow

\[22:33\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; Lelouch, LOL. breadth first search

\[22:33\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; solve enough questions and slowly it starts to click

\[22:34\] &lt;PersonalGandu&gt; cOOl

\[22:34\] &lt;darkbreaker&gt; how much is your ppo at de shaw?

\[22:34\] &lt;PersonalGandu&gt; anything else?

\[22:34\] &lt;hydragyrum&gt; @scarlet\_speedster Did you just go around and talk to people? How did you get over that initial social anxiety, if you had any? (first-year) (bump)

\[22:34\] &lt;DelhiMetro&gt; what is the scenario for non circuit branches IT?

\[22:34\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; +darkbreaker, 40

\[22:35\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; hydragyrum, i came out of my shell, slowly

\[22:35\] &lt;Animefreak&gt; @scarlet\_speedster, what's your best drunk story? (bump)

\[22:35\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; take small brave steps

\[22:35\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; and each succesful encoutner will make teh next one easier

\[22:35\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; slowly, it will be natural

\[22:35\] &lt;Lelouch&gt; i would like to know how to act as first year after getting placed, and troll second years just for fun? @scarlet\_speedster

\[22:35\] &lt;theageofultron&gt; What is your view on PS-2? Is it worth taking a risk in getting a PS opened in a company of your choice even though that would mean that you would give up your chance of a ppo?(considering I am doing a finance minor and will go for a first sem PS)

\[22:35\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; Lelouch, LOL

\[22:35\] &lt;DelhiMetro&gt; what is the scenario for non circuit branches IT?

\[22:35\] &lt;Animefreak&gt; @Lelouch, bakchodi...

\[22:36\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; we actaully did that

\[22:36\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; me and my friends

\[22:36\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; with Lelouch and his friend

\[22:36\] &lt;darkbreaker&gt; Do IT companies in PS-II 1st sem give ppo in good numbers?

\[22:36\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; his friend was more entertaining

\[22:36\] &lt;Lelouch&gt; @Animefreak there you have it

\[22:36\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; Lelouch was more reasonable

\[22:37\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; darkbreaker, yes

\[22:37\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; Animefreak, i drink rarely

\[22:37\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; but i was a little tipsy during oasis.

\[22:37\] &lt;DelhiMetro&gt; any advice for a chemical guy aiming for IT?

\[22:37\] &lt;Animefreak&gt; I see...

\[22:37\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; asked two groups of two girls out, both gorups were busy

\[22:38\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; so ignored us

\[22:38\] &lt;KYGO&gt; so thats how you went for the girl

\[22:38\] &lt;KYGO&gt; LOL

\[22:38\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; no

\[22:38\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; actyally

\[22:38\] &lt;Hunt&gt; @DelhiMerto .bitsat fir se de de

\[22:38\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; the buzz went away shortly

\[22:38\] &lt;Hunt&gt; sorry i am dyslexic

\[22:38\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; and i realized those group interactions werent all that bad

\[22:39\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; so, i then made the next move while sober

\[22:39\] &lt;TheBlizzard&gt; im a 6 pointer cs guy in second year?? somewhat not interested in coding. any tips??

\[22:39\] &lt;darkbreaker&gt; What motivates you to do better?

\[22:39\] &lt;Animefreak&gt; Nice

\[22:39\] &lt;theageofultron&gt; What is your view on PS-2? Is it worth taking a risk in getting a PS opened in a company of your choice even though that would mean that you would give up your chance of a ppo?(considering I am doing a finance minor and will go for a first sem PS)

\[22:40\] &lt;Animefreak&gt; Bhiaya what's something you were afraid to tell someone because it's too dark and you're afraid it might spoil your relation with the other person (i.e. darkest secrets)?

\[22:40\] &lt;TheBlizzard&gt; ah. i was looking for a minor

\[22:40\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; find the one field you like and work toward it

\[22:41\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; darkbreaker, nothing. i am very bad at motivation

\[22:41\] &lt;Hunt&gt; is it.... is it what i think it is? @scarlet\_speedster

\[22:41\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; things just sort of worked out

\[22:41\] &lt;TheRecordStore&gt; Nobody is anonymous, Big Brother is always watching.

\[22:41\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; true

\[22:41\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; but many of my friends know my nick on dc

\[22:42\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; Hunt, what do you have in mind

\[22:42\] &lt;hydragyrum&gt; Any advice for a first-year (CS) who's looking to do MS/PhD after BITS? (too ambitious, I know, but it never hurts to ask)

\[22:42\] &lt;AMATERASU&gt; does doing a DSA and some other courses being a non-CS dualite in BITS affect while sitting for placements in IT company?

\[22:42\] &lt;Animefreak&gt; True for gen bitsians as well...

\[22:42\] &lt;MetalHead&gt; what exactly is weed in hindi??

\[22:42\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; hydragyrum, not ambitious at all

\[22:42\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; maintain a good 

\[22:42\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; cg

\[22:42\] &lt;theageofultron&gt; ama

\[22:42\] &lt;TheRecordStore&gt; weed is ganja, hash is charas, hemp is bhaang.

\[22:42\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; work a job for few years after graduation

\[22:42\] &lt;MetalHead&gt;  what is charas ?

\[22:43\] &lt;TheRecordStore&gt; Padh na.

\[22:43\] &lt;The\_Destroyer™&gt; hash

\[22:43\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; 8.5+ at least, if you are aiming for good colleges

\[22:43\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; maintain good connections with a few profs

\[22:43\] &lt;1o1\_0kay&gt; geeks for geeks vs interview bit

\[22:43\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; work on SOPs

\[22:43\] &lt;TheRecordStore&gt; Did you ever feel like giving up?

\[22:43\] &lt;TheRecordStore&gt; How did you pull through

\[22:43\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt;  geeks for geeks vs interview bit -&gt; interview bit

\[22:43\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; TheRecordStore, at times

\[22:43\] &lt;MetalHead&gt; what is marijuana?

\[22:43\] &lt;SEALteam&gt; For phd, I dont think working for a few years is a good idea @hydragyrum

\[22:44\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; but get over it after some time

\[22:44\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; then start to work

\[22:44\] &lt;The\_Destroyer™&gt; @MetalHead the thing which u have consumed rn

\[22:44\] &lt;AMATERASU&gt; does doing DSA and some other such courses being a non-CS dualite in BITS affect while sitting for placements in IT company?

\[22:44\] &lt;TheRecordStore&gt; Yes afaik

\[22:44\] &lt;theageofultron&gt; What is your view on PS-2? Is it worth taking a risk in getting a PS opened in a company of your choice even though that would mean that I would be giving up on chance of a PPO?(currently pursuing a minor in finance)

\[22:44\] &lt;hydragyrum&gt; Will my assigned mentor be one of those giving me a LoR? Haven't met him yet.

\[22:44\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; +MetalHead, Cannabis, also known as marijuana among other names, is a psychoactive drug from the Cannabis plant used for medical or recreational purposes.

\[22:44\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; straight from wikipedia

\[22:44\] &lt;The\_Destroyer™&gt; XD

\[22:44\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; theageofultron, dunno

\[22:45\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; hydragyrum, which mentor

\[22:45\] &lt;TheRecordStore&gt; CS courses give you something to talk about in IT interviews.

\[22:45\] &lt;Hunt&gt; is it possible koi bina knowledge ke chutiya kaat ke place ho jaye (cse)

\[22:45\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; a little

\[22:45\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; Hunt, a lot of people do

\[22:45\] &lt;hydragyrum&gt; Like the mentors you get assigned in first-year. CS profs.

\[22:45\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; but thats just luck

\[22:45\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; wouldnt want ot bet on that

\[22:45\] &lt;darkbreaker&gt; What are the things you did differently at de shaw that scored you a ppo?

\[22:45\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; connected with my mentor

\[22:45\] &lt; The Riddler &gt; Can we take up another OPEL next sem by not giving compre for current one?

\[22:45\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; definitely

\[22:46\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; hydragyrum, no

\[22:46\] &lt;The\_Destroyer™&gt; @scarlet\_speedster do u think that the use of DC++ is decreasing? 

\[22:46\] &lt;AMATERASU&gt; so what course apart from DSA will you suggest that have some weightage during IT placements for a non-CS dualite?

\[22:46\] &lt;hydragyrum&gt; Do PoRs (club/deps) help?

\[22:46\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; The\_Destroyer™, i think dc will be fine

\[22:46\] &lt;hydragyrum&gt; What are the mentors for, really?

\[22:46\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; there is always use for movies, porn etc

\[22:46\] &lt;Hunt&gt; chutiya kaat ke place hone ki tips4

\[22:47\] &lt;1o1\_0kay&gt; what exactly should I do in interviewbit? as in one senior told me to do data structures section in gfg,but I find it too vast so what will be analogous for interview bit

\[22:47\] &lt;lolmax&gt; @Hunt xD

\[22:47\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; hydragyrum, you can maybe go to them with personal probs

\[22:47\] &lt;Paradox™&gt; chutiya kaat ke place hone ki tips4

\[22:47\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; but depends

\[22:47\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; i never knew mine

\[22:47\] &lt; The Riddler &gt; Can we take up another OPEL next sem by not giving compre for current one and getting NC in this, do we have to repeat the same OPEL by any chance?

\[22:47\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; becuase they are mostly uyseless

\[22:47\] &lt;AMATERASU&gt;  so what course apart from DSA will you suggest that have some weightage during IT placements for a non-CS dualite?

\[22:47\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; The Riddler, not sure

\[22:47\] &lt;The\_Destroyer™&gt; @the riddler yes

\[22:47\] &lt;The\_Destroyer™&gt; u have to repeat the course

\[22:47\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; AMATERASU, not sure but i hear DAA, OOP, OS 

\[22:47\] &lt;1o1\_0kay&gt; what exactly should I do in interviewbit? as in one senior told me to do data structures section in gfg,but I find it too vast so what will be analogous for interview bit

\[22:48\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; 1o1\_0kay, i actually never used interviewbit

\[22:48\] &lt; The Riddler &gt; @The\_Destroyer do we have to repeat the same OPEL or can we take up some other OPEL Instead of this one?

\[22:48\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; worked on hackerrank

\[22:48\] &lt;AMATERASU&gt; do the companies verify (almost) every point in your CV?

\[22:48\] &lt;hydragyrum&gt; Do PoRs (club/deps) help (as a point in my application)?

\[22:48\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; for consulting, yes

\[22:48\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; core, probably yes

\[22:48\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; IT, no

\[22:48\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; i had none

\[22:49\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; was in NSS for a sem

\[22:49\] &lt;SEALteam&gt; 11

\[22:49\] &lt;1o1\_0kay&gt; any tips for interview?

\[22:49\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; yes

\[22:49\] &lt;AMATERASU&gt; was that yes for my question?

\[22:49\] &lt;hydragyrum&gt; Not for higher studies either. I've heard that it counts as a plus point in extracurriculars.

\[22:49\] &lt;The\_Destroyer™&gt; u have to repeat same opel

\[22:49\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; will be cliched, but be confident and work with the interviewer

\[22:49\] &lt;hydragyrum&gt; either?\*

\[22:50\] &lt;DelhiMetro&gt; how many companies were open for all this sem?

\[22:50\] &lt;theageofultron&gt; What will be the perfect CV according to you which sure is gonna get some attention? Considering that person knows coding but haven't done projects to show for in the CV

\[22:50\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; theageofultron, depends on where you are applying

\[22:50\] &lt; The Riddler &gt; @The\_Destroyer people say it's not the case, you can take up some other opel. It's only hard and fast for CDCs.

\[22:51\] &lt;DelhiMetro&gt;  how many companies were open for all this sem?

\[22:51\] &lt;PersonalGandu&gt; What's your cg?

\[22:51\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; DelhiMetro, not sure

\[22:51\] &lt;Hunt&gt; 6

\[22:51\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; PersonalGandu, right now -&gt; 8.36

\[22:51\] &lt;theageofultron&gt; What if I am open to everything while applying except core? That is why I asked for a perfectly balanced CV considering the fact that the person knows coding (interviewbit and hackerrank)

\[22:51\] &lt;AMATERASU&gt; what are the chances of a guy not getting placed in an IT company despite being a decent competetive coder due to excess competition?

\[22:51\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; low

\[22:52\] &lt;vader\_kp&gt; what was cg cutoff for de shaw and uber

\[22:52\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; dunno

\[22:52\] &lt;AMATERASU&gt; low. was that the answer to my question?

\[22:52\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; people say you need a crazy good cg but i dont think that true

\[22:52\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; if you do well in interview

\[22:52\] &lt;vader\_kp&gt; crazy good as in above 8?

\[22:52\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; AMATERASU, mostly zero

\[22:53\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; vader\_kp, people say above 9

\[22:53\] &lt;vader\_kp&gt; oh damn

\[22:53\] &lt;PersonalGandu&gt; is it too late to start coding(placement pov) now from 3-2(dualite)  ??

\[22:53\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; i had a relatively low cg when compared to toher poeple

\[22:53\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; but i vibed well with the interviewers

\[22:53\] &lt;TheRecordStore&gt; What's the median CTC for EEE six pointers in IT (2nd sem)

\[22:54\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; PersonalGandu, no, dont think so

\[22:54\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; TheRecordStore, not sure

\[22:54\] &lt;TheRecordStore&gt; An approx?

\[22:54\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; any other non placeemnt related questiosn?

\[22:54\] &lt;TheRecordStore&gt; I asked one

\[22:54\] &lt;TheRecordStore&gt; you ignored.

\[22:54\] &lt;TheRecordStore&gt; :/

\[22:54\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; aplogies

\[22:54\] &lt;jkl;'a&gt; with a lot of students being offererd internships this semester and considering this started very recently in our campus,is there a chance that good companies decrease their intake for placements and start focusing on internships. i heard this happened in bits goa

\[22:54\] &lt;theageofultron&gt; How important are soft skills? 

\[22:54\] &lt; The Riddler &gt; @scarlet\_speedster Do you do 'stuff'?

\[22:54\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; yes, its possible

\[22:55\] &lt;PersonalGandu&gt; What's the point of living? \[NON-PLACEMENT\]

\[22:55\] &lt;AMATERASU&gt; what cg is decent enough?

\[22:55\] &lt;Animefreak&gt; What's your favourite spot on campus?

\[22:55\] &lt;TheRecordStore&gt; What do you do when you feel like nothing is worth it.

\[22:55\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; from the perspective of a company, you get to test people and then offer then a PPO

\[22:55\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; PersonalGandu, no point

\[22:55\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; just be happy

\[22:55\] &lt;scarlet\_speedster&gt; and then die

a0d5pn,2,2018-11-25,"[M4F] Who’s under the mistletoe?, a rainbow party, and other naughty ideas including my lipstick fetish",this-ismyname999,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/a0d5pn/m4f_whos_under_the_mistletoe_a_rainbow_party_and/,"Hey. I think lipstick is fucking sexy. And it only gets hotter when a girl leaves her mark on some lucky guy. So here are some brief starter ideas off the top of my head. I’m more than open to any tweaks, twists, and turns you'd like to throw or add to them. Just warning that I'm fairly vanilla, and not interested in much that's illegal/nonconsenual. Also please forgive me dipping in and out of 1st, 2nd, and 3rd person mid sentence here, I don’t do it during plays. 




You catch your boyfriend cheating and storm over to his apartment to get your things and get a little revenge. I'm his loyal BFF and roommate who he hurriedly begged to ""protect his shit"" before bailing, unable to face you. So we're alone together for the first time. There's a few ways this can go, but the general idea is that he was very possessive of you. It'd kill him to see your favorite lipstick smeared on another guy, much less his BFF. You could take my phone while you're riding me on the couch and text him ""She's gone. Door unlocked. I got pizza."" and then laugh to yourself and ask me to bend you over towards the doorway.





It's almost Christmas, so I'll go ahead and throw in a Mistletoe Party. This could be a neighborhood/suburbs affair thing, with a younger guy home from college and a bunch of horny, wild MILFs wearing red lipstick and hanging out under the mistletoe. The queen of the suburb would definitely want to re-introduce herself to this young man, and then walk around the party with him wearing her smooches across his cheek and neck. Or an office party, with the boss taking his fill of his employee's wives and somewhat cucking them, parading with different color lipstick kisses on his cheek, almost like collecting trophies from the women married to his subordinates. Fuck, that's kinda hot. Another twist could be the Boss' Naughty Slut Daughter. I could end up under the mistletoe with her before I recognize her. You'd purr at me, lying, ""Oh, I'm a new accounting intern"" as you plant another couple kisses along my jawline and glance across the room to see if Daddy notices yet. I don't want to get fired, so we could go somewhere more private, but then your pretty red lips would get a little more… messy.





Rainbow Party - you might remember this as some urban legend from Oprah. But it's been a fantasy of mine for a while. One version went that three girls invite three guys over. Each girl wears a different color lipstick, and sinks to her knees and starts sucking. After some time, each girl switches to another guy, then again to the final. So by the end, if each girl did their part right, each guy's cock would have three distinct different colored lipstick rings. Then I guess they can pick their favorite and cum in their mouth, or they keep trading until they cum, or it just turns into an orgy after that. But the idea of getting different shades of lipstick on my cock and somehow showing it off has always been a massive turn on and fantasy. This doesn't have to be a multiple girl character thing, it could totally be one girl who changes outfits/lipsticks/looks maybe throughout a night or party or something. 





Deepthroat Contest - Okay, backing up, this one is kind of a multiple character thing. There's not much to this - it could be two best friends, roommates, sisters, coworkers, whoever arguing over who can take more dick in their mouth. I'd be just any passing waiter or lucky dude that happens to be nearby. Maybe I'm someone that they know is ""notorious"" for being hung, since they know they need a long dick to prove themselves. Of course, the only way to prove where the girls' lips have been would be for both to put on a generous amount of some bold color lipstick…





Sci-Fi / Future / Fantasy / Vagueness - This is a bit of a last catch-all. I said I was kind of vanilla, but I do like some of this weird stuff. I had a hot prompt and couple stories go about mind control lipstick. I also wouldn't mind some kind of lipstick that makes the kiss-ee unbearably horny, or possibly one that enhances cum production when kissed onto a lucky man's nutsack. I also had another recent one about a sorority witch coven with spell casting lipstick and stuff that had some fun. 





Anyways, I hope any of this catches someone's eye. Part of this is just organizing my own thoughts and some ideas I could make into better, bigger, more full-fledged prompts. These are all aimed at women players, but I'm always open to messages from anyone just to chat about lipstick fetish/story ideas. PMing here is great, Discord is easier, haven’t used chat/KIK, but I’m willing to try them if it’s a dealbreaker for the right partner.

We were together for a short time(few months). She was my first for everything. It ended badly, I guess she never really liked me in the first place and i was a casual rebound or a play thing for her to get over her last bf who she obviously still had feelings for.

I blocked her on everything. Taking up new hobbies. Putting more effort into work and school. Still going to gym, talking to new girls on tinder. I try to fill every waking moment I have with something to distract myself. 

But I’m so anxious and so depressed about it, I  still fucking cry sometimes, a grown man crying about this makes it more fucking pathetic..existing has just been torture.

The only thing that I’m optimistic for is this amazing internship I will be starting in January in a state far away in a really popular city. Hopefully by the end of the internship I will have moved on. "
a0dsye,204,2018-11-25,High blood pressure in the hospital and the role of PRN antihypertensives,sunealoneal,medicine,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/a0dsye/high_blood_pressure_in_the_hospital_and_the_role/,"I'm only 5 months (already 5 months?!) into my intern year, but I've noticed that ""high blood pressure"" is the ubiquitous problem that's probably at every hospital in the country. I'm trying to get a QI project together about this issue.

Typical scenario:

Let's say I have a AE COPD patient with poorly controlled BP. At noon I get a page that his BP is 186/98 and that there are no PRNs ordered. This is not an isolated reading, his pressures have been in the 160s and 170s the whole time. He had an AKI on admission so his home losartan was never restarted. He's on his home 50 hydralazine TID. 

On physical exam he's pretty comfortable, no pain or discomfort really. Nothing concerning on a subsequent UA. We can pretend I wasn't terrible at fundoscopic exams and that I didn't find anything concerning on his retina or disk.

I start amlodipine 10 and make myself a reminder to check the next morning. I let the nurse know I'm not ordering any PRNs. The next morning it's still elevated, 160s/90s. So I increase his hydralazine to 100 TID. It settles down to 140s-150s rest of his admission. After that I was able to start lisinopril 20 once his AKI resolved.

- In this scenario, would you have done anything differently? (IV labetalol 10 PRN for SBP &gt; 180?)

It seems that a big reason we end up ordering these PRNs are to ""save us pages from nurses"", especially for our co-interns on night float. So the obvious next step seems to be educating the nurses making those pages. But before I can spearhead any educational initiatives I'd need to make sure that I know what I'm talking about in the first place!

Specific questions for physicians here: 

- When are short acting IV BP meds truly indicated?
- How do you handle ""high BP"" pages?

For nurses on here:

- Do you have any feedback or insight in general about high blood pressure in the hospital?

For all: 
Would love to read your thoughts on this! "

(If by some chance you see this: Hi ageplayf1)

Have a few prompts in mind, they all reveal around humiliation and degradation. This may include, forcing you to behave like a dog, insults to your appearance, racial slurs, marking you body with words like ""slut, cumdump, etc"", making you crawl around nude in public (on a leash of course), walking around with a vibrator, and more.

For prompts I'm open to any ideas you may have or one of the following:

Professor: You come to my office for help, but all that happens is that I degrade you and your race, hopefully to the point of tears. I then other you an opportunity, do as I say and you might be able to pass the class after all. In reality you'll end up covered in cum (maybe spit and piss as well) and put up on display in the quad.

Boss: Your an intern that somehow got hired at my company. This one I have a few ideas on how it plays out. I could call you to my office and threaten to fire you, unless you do as i say. Or your at the office while no one else is and i force myself on you. Both end with you being the office fucktoy/(Toilet)

I’m 19 and currently in my sophomore year of college. Last summer I landed a commercial real estate internship at a boutique brokerage firm. Most of my summer was spent learning the basics of the industry. I’ve continued to work for this company remotely during school.

This past week I met with my boss and was updated on a development project our company is currently working on. There are four buildings currently being designed, they haven’t broken ground yet but will soon. The buildings consist of a hotel, restaurant, apartment building, and retail. 

My responsibilities for the project are to track costs. We’re starting with the smallest building (thank god) and will eventually work our way to the others. By this point you guys have probably determined I’m very inexperienced for such a crucial part of a real estate project. However, I’ve never been one to turn down a challenge and the possible networking and experience gained from this is invaluable.

My first task is to determine what software we should use in order to track our costs. My boss mentioned Microsoft Projects and Property Metrics as possible solutions. Are either of these feasible? What recommendations do you guys have? Between the two I personally thing Property Metrics would be ideal as they have multiple tutorials that would help me and our team.

I would gladly take any other advise you guys have, and if anyone would be interested in “mentoring” me on future questions I would greatly appreciate it. This is a hell of a project, luckily I don’t have any equity in it and can focus on learning. 

I hope this all makes sense and if you’ve made it this far I appreciate the time.

We were in different points of life, I was still in school.  She was only working, a lot of her money went to help her mom who has been unemployed her whole life. And I felt responsible for her and this was hard for me. So we had a lot of spats through out time.  But I helped her a lot we worked at the same place so I’d take her to work and we’d split the gas.  She stayed over a lot.  When things were good they were very good.  I lack most confidence and my mom wasn’t good at being supportive and when I had break downs she always yelled at me. So my gf was always supportive and there for me.  I was in band and she’d come to all my home games to support me and would sit with my family. She was pretty close with my family and was even in the room when my nephew was born.  But soon after that we hit some issues because it was my senior year in college I worked, did an internship, went to class and watched my nephew often.  I didn’t realize her mental health had severely declined.  And when I did it was too late, she broke up with me and started dating someone else.  There was a big blow out because I had allowed her to use my old car after I purchased a new one and she still had it and was driving around with this new girl in it.  I said it’s mine you made this choice, it was one thing when we were planning a life together  that changes once you decide to pursue something different and I took it back.  Well taking back the car threw my ex’s new relationship into a curve ball.  Because it changed her finances and this new girl only cared about what she could do for her.  My ex despite her misgivings is not mean spirited but has been manipulated her entire life my her parents and is weak minded. This girl convinced her that her parents didn’t care about her, her brothers didn’t need her help and that I needed her that she didn’t need me and I’d keep bringing her down.  All so my ex would spend all of her money on her instead and my ex did. Leaving her with nothing and she was full dependent on this chick because she was her ride to work. One day I saw her in passing and asked how to was just to find out she was a wreck. She’d actually taken out a loan for a car off Craigslist  the car was a scam and blew up days after she bought it. She was broke paying back a loan for a car she couldn’t drive and in a relationship  where she knew she was being played, knew it was toxic but thought she could fix the girls issues.  Honestly couldn’t care less it was karma because we dated for 3 years but had been best friends 5 years before that and she’d left me as a friend twice in those 5 years and then third time as her girlfriend. 
  
Well at some point there was a huge blow out.  Me and my ex’s brother where very very close and he still talked to me. He explained the new girlfriend got drunk and high while at HER ex boyfriends house and called my ex to come and pick her and her car up and that’s how she found out she was using her for money while still sleeping with the ex. They’d only been together two months but my ex ran after this and started trying to pick up the pieces of her life she’d managed to destroy including talking to me.  We had a lot of history so we did talk she said she wasn’t asking for forgiveness that she’d done this too many times to ask for it. But she started an extra job her bother let her use his extra car.  She enrolled back in school, bought a decent car has spent the last year working on herself and her relationships and of course we started becoming friends again and we caught ourselves wanting to slowly try again

This sounds like an absolute are you nuts why would you think about it.  But because I contributed to the first times. I was abused when we first met and my mother was toxic. My stepdad had been raping me for years and my mother wouldn’t leave even when I told her  it went on for 4 years till she finally left.  Even when we left I felt I was blamed for everything.  My mom made me responsible for taking care of my little sister.  Doing all the cooking and cleaning, putting bills in my name and telling me I wouldn’t be anything. And I was no good to anyone.  She was my friend when I needed one and I really treated her poorly.  I judged her told her she wouldn’t do anything with herself when I was made.  I’d get angry anytime I felt like she was doing better than me and would purposely hurt her feelings constantly until I realized I needed help I was acting like my mom.  I went and got therapy and was put on anti depressants and started getting better.  But how I treated her previous to that was why she left the friendship the first two times. And my mom knows we’d like to try again but says she’s bad for me...meanwhile even though I’ve really depressed lately without having my best friend and she doesn’t notice she’s just happy I still live at home to pay the bills with her. 

I need advice on what I should do, I’ve been really happy with my ex lately since she worked on herself. She took me to the beach for graduation, she helps me pay for things when I’m broke from helping my mom and our communication has greatly improved. She sat down with my sister and apologized for things that happened because me and my sister are close. She’s taken me out to family gatherings and house parties with friends, simple things that my mother never allowed me to do.  I’m just looking for general advice. "
a0he9r,2,2018-11-26,I just smashed &amp; broke my phone due to stress/anxiety and feel awful &amp; lost,braelen327,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/a0he9r/i_just_smashed_broke_my_phone_due_to/,"Before I go into the full situation, yes, I'm fully aware that the fault is mine &amp; I made a poor decision &amp; brought it upon myself.  But I am looking for support/advice with a problem of mine that peaked tonight  Moving on.

&amp;#x200B;

I have trouble dealing with stress and anxiety well. I can't easily take a deep breath and have a clear head after that.  My thoughts/fears stick around no matter how much I breathe/tell myself I'm doing great.  Rather than breathing, I have to do impulsive/explosive/aggressive acts to calm myself (which doesn't work in the first place).  This consists of knocking things off my desk, splashing water everywhere, slamming/throwing things, flooring it in a car, and sometimes hurting myself (mostly biting myself, but I've cut once).  It happens when I think about things coming up that I'm stressing about or if something isn't going my way/is out of my control (i.e. time going too fast, thinking about how I procrastinated on a homework assignment, some other thought about something in my life that I don't have right).  I guess tonight was the one time it went too far.  I was getting ready for bed (already heated from avoiding studying for a test all night and due to the fact that I have to get up early for this internship training thing and still let my procrastination problem get in the way despite how important it was that I got in bed early).  All of it hit me at once, including the fact that it was 1 AM and I was gonna get little sleep, and I threw my phone against the wall.  The screen's color was messed up, and eventually, it just shut off, and I'm unable to turn it back on.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm now just dumbfounded, numb, and upset that I destroyed my nice phone that I got not too long ago.  I feel stupid that despite acknowledging that my recklessness isn't ok, as well as discussing it with my mom &amp; therapist and getting good tools, that it still happens.  I wish that my word was stronger than my fears and the negativity in my head.  I'm also upset because this is a huge inconvenience that have little time to tend to.  I could be asleep right now, knowing that I have to be at my internship early tomorrow and knowing that I have a busy school week ahead, but no, I gave in to my fears and anxieties, and I let myself get into a bad place and it really worked out just great (sarcasm).  I also feel guilty because my family &amp; I are not in a financial place to easily replace a phone, yet I wasn't careful with my belongings, and now I don't have a nice new phone.  And what might be the worst part is that I can't really talk to anyone about this because it's a side of me no one knows about (except my therapist, and I plan on telling him about this on Tuesday), and I probably wouldn't receive any helpful responses to a situation involving me breaking something (again, not trying to play the victim, I fully accept the fault and that I made a bad decision).

&amp;#x200B;

I just wish I knew how to push out impulses and anxieties that come with negative thoughts, and I wish I could take control of how much effort I'm putting in to helping myself and working hard.  I also feel helpless now, because I'm up late and am going to be tired for a thing that is important to me, have a hard schoolweek ahead of me, and am down a phone that was working well for me \[if there's a bright side to any of this, I have a backup phone {it just has way less space}, and I could've broken something way worse before learning my lesson\].  Any advice on how to beat your stress/anxiety, and I guess on fixing phones, would be much appreciated :)"

Feel frustrated and don't know what to do.",therandombrownboi,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a0hvin/i_20m_need_help_dealing_with_family_abroad_in/,"So I don't really know where to start off with but the **TL:DR;** is that I live in Canada (study here) and my family is back home (Asia) and stuff at home is just really bad, and that is super stressing me out here, especially because I can't do much about it (because super busy with school work, internships and just life here). 

&amp;#x200B;

My mom has pretty much no friends, she always stays at home, cleans the place, cooks food etc. and helps my younger sister (around 14) study and stuff. All her relationships with family have gotten progressively worser and it has taken a serious toll on her mental health because all she does in her free time is think about what happened with family member X and how she feels really sad about it (like someone betrayed her blah etc.) She spends all her time focused on the 3 of us (me, dad and sis) and I think all the work and stress is really getting to her though she really tries not to show it.

&amp;#x200B;

My sister is also going through a phase so conversation with her is incredibly difficult, she talks and interacts with me fine for the most part, other than a mood swing here and there. But she is incredibly difficult for my parents to handles because she likes to throw tantrums for everything and wont listen to anyone. Her grades are also really low and that stresses out my parents and her a lot since she gets some complaints from school about it from time to time. My dad also told me that my sister has a bunch of instagram accounts/ is going on tumblr and doing some stuff but I'm unsure what she is upto etc. could be innocent but it worries me.

&amp;#x200B;

My dad is mostly silent but I'm sure he is very affected with what is going on with my sister and my mom so he is probably going under a lot of stress as well, especially because he works 8-9 hrs a day and comes back home to deal with this.  


Recently I asked them if they all wanted to come to Canada for the Summer instead of me flying back as planned, and they considered it but thought it was a little too expensive to do that right now and said they'll think about it later, which is fine. But my sister is being very adamant about it and causing a ruckus at home which definitely doesn't help anything -- especially since my mom is stressed about my uncle possibly getting cheated on by his wife and my other aunt fighting with her husband (they all come to her to talk about this etc, and this really adds a lot on her mentally).

&amp;#x200B;

So, I try not to think about all this too much but it's hard not to when I talk to them frequently and it makes me feel really defeated and hopeless. I'm starting to have panic and anxiety attacks again (which had stopped for a while). I just need some opinions on what to do and how to proceed, I'm just very confused.

&amp;#x200B;

Also please don't suggest ignoring and stopping contact with family, I love them all a lot and they mean a lot to me, sometimes it might not seem like it but they all care about me deeply so this is not something I can just forget about!

We ended up fighting over plane tickets (she was supposed to come visit me in 2 weeks) on Friday and on Sunday she told me she needed a break from the relationship to focus on those other things. Apperently it was just too much and it put a lot of pressure on it. Part of it is my fault because I pressured her a bit (which I shouldn’t have done) and I feel like I was too intense. She said she still loves me and doesn’t want to lose me, but now we’re not having contact anymore and after just a day it’s already killing me. There’s this void left in my life and I just wonder how long I should wait before I contact her again and if I should at all. She told me just doesn’t want to call anymore like we used to anymore but that she’s there for me if I feel like texting her."

So, I’ve posted on here before and I am a declared actuarial science major, but I am a prospective student. However, I’ve been back and forth between computer science and actuarial science. I’m in a comp sci class at school, and although I’m not like the best I do enjoy solving problems logically through java. Software developers are all the buzz these days and i has some questions about the program at Drake.

What’s the program like? Do you, as computer science majors, feel like you’re receiving a meaningful education that prepares you for the job market? Are there a lot of internships available, and are there any big name companies that recruit on campus? How are the class sizes? Would you be able to double major with say math, or actuarial science (I get this might be harder)? How do you feel you compare with other programs (or does it even matter what school you go to for CS)? I’m from Illinois and UIUC has a great CS program however it’s like impossible to transfer to the LAS CS, much less the college of engineering.

It had been so long since I heard from her that I actually sent her a pic of her granddaughter and a small update on FB messenger. I can see that she “saw” it, but is ignoring me. 

My question is why the fuck does that hurt so much? I’ve waited years to be this far away and I was thrilled to have much less contact, but I anticipated a fight about it. I expected her to message way too much and be overwhelming about staying in touch with her and insist on planning her first visit. But nothing?? And apparently now that I’m gone she’s decided to get her life together, she got a great job with a union doing work she loves and is passionate about and just got accepted into an internship with them. 

It makes me feel like *I’m* the toxic one. 26 years and she couldn’t pull it together to be there for me, she would rather smoke meth for 20+ years than have custody of her child, but I’m gone for 9 months and she is doing great and has basically cut *me* off?

My SO of 11 years believes that I am being treated unfairly by my mom compared to my younger brothers. I'm trying to be the bigger person and not be concerned with it. I'll try to keep the explanation as brief as possible, because there is a lot to say in order to understand the situation.

I am the oldest of three. My brothers are 25 and 20, which I'll refer to as B (25) and C (20). 

At 17 I was forced by my mom (after a recent divorce) to get a part-time job so I could pay for gas (SO lived an hour away) and car payments. As much as I hated that job and working in food service, I worked there for 8 years, worked as a manager for 3 of those years. The paychecks were small, but I saved up a good chunk of money and learned how to manage it. Although my family is middle-class, I lived like I was broke because I never wanted to have to ask my mom for money, and I always wanted to save whenever I could. This led me to go to a local community college, where financial aid covered all of the expenses. I earned a high enough GPA to transfer with a scholarship, where I completed my Bachelor's and ended up with 0 debt because I lived at home. I quit my part-time job a few months prior to landing a job in my career field. My mom is a realtor, so she helped me find a house closer to work (1 hour away from my hometown). I made the down-payment myself. Everything in my home was either given to me as a gift or I bought it myself. I have a newer car which I paid (or am paying) for entirely.

My brother, B, was not forced to get a job while in high school. He went to a big university after high school, which my mom helped him take out a loan for. After going to this big university for a year, he transferred TWO separate times to other expensive universities, changing majors. He only had part-time summer jobs while in college, so my mom paid for his living expenses while he was in college. His car payment was also paid for. In the end, my mom ended up paying his entire school loan off (which I can't even begin to imagine how much that was). He totaled his car recently. Insurance + my mom paid for a newer car. My uncle got him an internship which led to his first real and full-time job. His girlfriend is the same exact way. She hasn't worked a day in her life yet, and is completing her Master's soon.

My other brother, C, doesn't really have any responsibilities at the moment. Hasn't had a steady job and dropped out of college at the moment because he failed and doesn't know what he wants to do with his life. He's on his third car after totaling two. Has a debit card linked to my mom's account for money transfer. You get the picture.

This is where my SO is drawing the line. My mom just bought my brother, B, a foreclosed home for 70k, and is renovating the ENTIRE home. My SO and I were under the impression that since my brother didn't have any money saved, they would be doing a basic renovation, salvaging as much as possible. We were wrong. The entire house is being done, new kitchen with BRAND NEW appliances and cabinets, a completely gutted bathroom to put in a new toilet, tub, fancy tile in the shower, and new vanity. The electrical is being replaced by my dad. New drywall/paint, exterior paint. All of this is being done with a sense of urgency so they can move in by Christmas because my brother's (B) gf wants to. Of course, my brother (B) is not paying a dime for it. My mom says the loan will go in my brother's name after the house appraises.

This bothers me a little. Going back to when I bought my home, my mom and dad helped renovate just our bathroom before we moved in and I was really appreciate of that, since we didn't have to hire anyone. It is our only bathroom. I paid for every piece of material needed, and being that I was on a budget, I opted to go for a less-expensive tile in the shower and just painted the vanity cabinet. Floor is the same, and we just painted the grout. We bought the house in November and also wanted to move in by Christmas. It took 2-3 months to complete it, so we didn't get to move in until February. It was like pulling teeth to get it finished, so obviously not every square inch of that bathroom is perfect.

My SO has been saying that I've been treated unfairly for years. Although she is like me and has a good amount of money saved, she hasn't had a job for a few years and refuses to do anything because she thinks everyone else gets things handed to them, why not her? I'm trying to be the bigger person and explain that I am proud to have paid for everything that I own, but I can't help but be just a little jealous that my brother is getting a newly renovated house just handed to him. I don't know what I've done differently. I treat my parents with the utmost respect and don't really ask for anything, while my brothers are a\*\*holes, literallly. All I asked for my birthday this year was to finish up a few projects around the house, but that never happened. Yet they can do a whole house for him, just because.

My SO hasn't stopped talking about it for days because she isn't too fond of my brother's gf, and it makes her skin crawl to see her getting things handed to her as well. She thinks there is some sort of favoritism going on. She looks at our house now and points things out, saying it looks bad and whatnot. This whole situation just feels wrong to me, but I'm trying to not be angry about it because I'm better than that. She's surprised I'm not angry, but how should I feel about this? I've let all of this slide for years without bringing it up to my mom. Should I let it go, should I bring it up? My SO thinks I'm being too nice by not saying anything and is getting irritated with me.

TL;DR:  
My whole life my brothers have had everything handed to them. My SO of 11 years thinks I am being treated unfairly by my family (mainly my mom) because I don't get that kind of treatment. She is angry about it, and while I feel it is wrong, I am not that phased because I am proud to have worked hard for what I own and my accomplishments. One of my brothers and his gf is getting a newly renovated house handed to him. My SO is livid/jealous, and hasn't stopped talking about it. I'm a little jealous, but she thinks I should say something and is getting irritated with me because I haven't brought it up to my mom, although I've let this kind of thing slide for years. What should I do? How should I feel?

a0mkgy,18,2018-11-26,"future pilot, need guidance and harsh truth",pickletickle4,flying,https://www.reddit.com/r/flying/comments/a0mkgy/future_pilot_need_guidance_and_harsh_truth/,"Hello pilots of reddit, 

I am a 22 year old college student planning on pursuing a career in aviation within the next year. I am set to graduate from a prestigious university in May with degrees in Economics and German and I am going to enroll in a full-time ATP program in NC starting in July that will last 9 months with a guaranteed CFI job upon the completion of the program. My grades are okay (3.2 GPA). Given my choices of study, I feel a bit intimidated to begin flight school and I would like to see what kind of guidance and useful information I can get from reddit. I have already spoken at length with two family friends who are pilots. One is a new CFI and the other is a very experienced charter pilot who have given me great guidance thus far. We have spoken at length on flight school options, changes in the aviation industry, and their day to day work. They are both extremely passionate about their careers and I hope to follow suit.

For context, I only decided to pursue a career in aviation about a year ago. I have always wanted to get my PPL as I have been fascinated with flight since I can remember, but I figured I would pursue a career in business/finance as that is what my dad and brother do currently. I had a good banking internship for a summer and performed pretty well in sales, but I have no passion for the potential careers I could pursue in banking/insurance. I'm good with Matlab, Stata, and Excel but I feel like the skills that I have been building in college are now entirely irrelevant and I have more or less wasted 4 years learning German and the vague complexities of economic theory. I have a good mathematical mind, 20/10 vision, good motor skills and spatial senses, a relaxed demeanor under pressure, and a love for heights and small aircraft. I feel like I am a decent enough candidate to pursue aviation as a career but I have never been in control of an aircraft despite dozens of experiences in small aircraft and helicopters. My family acquaintance (the CFI) told me that I have the mind and demeanor to become a pilot and no one has said something like that before. This has helped inspire me to pursue a career as a pilot. I also worked at a fishing lodge in southern Alaska this past summer where I met dozens of pilots who provided me with advice, contacts, rides in Skycatchers,  and the foreboding ""stay single"" suggestion. 

The next part is sensitive and I am not trying to boast in anyway, just want to provide all relevant information to you readers: I am blessed enough to have a large inheritance of $102,000 which I understand is more than enough to put myself through flight school but my family is concerned that I am choosing to spend most of my money pursuing a career that I have only been committed to for a year. I come from a wealthy family that has put me through private school my entire life in the expectation that I would use my intellect to become a successful investment banker, doctor, lawyer etc. and my parents are pretty disappointed in my choice of career. I try to explain to them that being a pilot is a respectable job that pays well enough, but they are still shocked that I am turning down more stable careers to become a ""sky trucker"". Nevertheless, I am excited to devote myself to becoming a pilot in the coming years. I have usually been able to reach my goals in life in terms of academics, but I am also absolutely terrified that I will fall short of my goal and waste tens of thousands of dollars in the process. Maybe I'll have trouble with cross-wind landings or struggle with FAA compliance, who's to say? I am a hard worker and a very competitive person, but I react poorly to rejection and failure. I am a part of the participation-trophy generation and I worry that I will become a head-case if I feel like I am not up to snuff.

1. In your experience, what are the most common reasons that candidates fall short in their goals to work as a pilot? What kinds of people fail most often in this industry? 

2. What can I do before flight school to increase my chances of acing ground school?

3. Am I stupid for wanting to commit to a full time ATP program without ever having flown before?

4. Has anyone else out there committed to a full time ATP program without prior flying experience?

5. Will I be treated as an ignorant outsider given my relative lack of knowledge in regards to aircraft? (I don't know much about modern military aircraft and technological developments in aviation. Although I can identify a variety of training aircraft and sea planes from my time with Alaskan pilots)

\*\*Bonus questions: Did students in your flight school socialize? How many are recent college graduates? 

&amp;#x200B;

Comments are appreciated. Again, I apologize if I came off as pretentious in this post given my privileged background. I am just a young, relatively clueless guy who wants a cockpit for an office and a career in the skies. I want to gather as much information as possible before I make one of the biggest decisions of my life. It's better to walk in the right direction then to run in the wrong direction. Thanks for reading. "
a0mkkm,64,2018-11-26,For all you people still in Undergrad,alucardthefirst,prephysicianassistant,https://www.reddit.com/r/prephysicianassistant/comments/a0mkkm/for_all_you_people_still_in_undergrad/,"If you're still in Undergrad and have the oppurtunity to fix your GPA, DO IT. DON'T SLACK ON IT. No matter how much experience (unless it is high quality), volunteer, or internships you have it won't matter if your GPA is subpar. Consider applying to PA school with a 3.0 or less cGPA or sGPA? Better have high quality PCE and a killer essay because otherwise it's not going to happen very easily. I've known co-workers who have applied to PA school with low quality PCE/HCE, some volunteer hours, some shadowing hours, or work once a week (while I'm working full time and have higher stats in everthing else except GPA), but because they have higher GPAs, they are able to secure interviews or get in much easier right out of undergrad because of a c/sGPA higher than 3.5. GPA is everything. It makes sense because they are looking for students who will make it through their program and make them look good on paper. So let this be a reminder for you if you are still in that zone where your GPA is still easily influencable. Do good in your classes, make As and high Bs. You'll be golden and I commend you people who didn't make as much mistakes and didn't have any issues figuring it out quickly in undergrad. Whatever anyone says, 45% of what adcoms are looking at is your GPA. 25% is your PS, 20% is your HCE/PCE, and 10% is whatever it is you have left (even if you have great rec letters, unless one of your writers is a known colleague/friend of the adcoms). Some people may not like that I'm positing this, but honestly, that's the reality of it. If you're not in that high GPA category and you're late in the game, then work on getting high quality PCE, GRE over 300, and make sure your last 60 hours are above a 3.5 (make it majority As, if not all. No C's or D's). Regardless, I wish everyone good luck but play it smart. Don't waste money if you aren't ready"

However, my grades haven't translated to job opportunities. I am currently in my final year with jack shit in terms of experience. My friends on the other hand seem to do well. Some of these guys don't do so well academically but due to their personality, drive for success, and self confidence, they seem to get internships just fine. This has reinvigorated my self hatred. My brain goes into a mode where i think im smarter than all these people, i should be getting more results. Then there is the shame I feel when I realize im not celebrating my friends success. It's also pretty awkward when we hang out and past jobs become a topic of discussion.

So I graduated back in May 2018 with a bachelors in computer science and have been job searching since and well I haven't found a job yet.

My loans are through Nelnet and my first payment is coming up (\~2 weeks).

Just from saving from birthdays, graduation, etc I have enough money saved up just for the first payment (Wouldn't be able to pay anymore after that unless I got a job)

I owe **\~32k in direct stafford unsubsidized and subsidized loans.**

I could get a low paying job but to be honest I don't want to and the monthly payments would be high, i'd rather start off with a job that utilizes my degree (dont we all...)

Wanted to provide some backstory first, but to get to my actually question:

**Where should I go from here?**

\-I've been reading up on the best option and it seems I should go on IBR as my monthly payments will be zero and I can start repaying when I get a job (not sure about the pros/cons to this).

EDIT: I've signed up for IBR and it is processing, thanks for everyones advice.

**Are there any other options, better/worse than I suggested?**

\-Basically I have no intention of not repaying, I just can't and will definitely start once I get the job i'm looking for.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for taking the time to read this, any tips are greatly appreciated!

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: First off I want to say thanks to everyone for replying and giving tips and stuff. I will answer some lingering questions though:

\-I live in Chicago (So yes, I shouldn't have any issues getting a job but I am probably am because of the lack of experience or other reasons)

\-My main details on my resume are my skills, Academic project (large project over two semesters, my main experience that I end up discussing over the phone), some small internship that wasn't much programming (server migration), and volunteer work. So, I really have no good professional experience so that could be it and also have no personal projects (should really work on this). ( I could provide my resume if needed but I honestly don't think that's the issue as ill explain in the next bullet)

\-I've sent my resume numerous of times over these past months, some more/less than others but I do get a decent amount of callbacks. I usually get to the phone interview(usually HR not technical) and get rejected/no response after that. I've made it to the in-person interview a couple of times and end up getting rejected as well (so maybe there can be improvement here but I haven't had many so I just need to learn from my mistakes)

\-I've applied through numerous job posting websites (indeed, glassdoor, builtinchicago, stackoverflow, ziprecruiter, etc.)

\-Also should've stated I live with my Mom so don't be worrying about any other issues besides my job hunt and my loans. (I have a place to live and all that, everything is fine for now)"

So some backstory

We're both on a small vocal group, and we've been together for almost 10 years, and members of the group for 8years. The group is formed mainly on post-highschoolers and undergraduate people who have been doing music almost their entire life, but don't want to quit doing it after pursuing a  different career like engineering, lawschool, medicine, etc. We sing from academic music to the popular type. There are plenty more girls than guys. 

3 months ago all the male members of the group have had trouble going to rehearsals, myself  included. The reason ? We are all at different points in our careers, some starting university, some finishing up, some already working, and that sometimes can get on the way of singing. Noticing this, the conductor decides she is going to do the end of the year program with just the girls and build a program made to work with female voices. A cool way of handling the temporal absence of the guys. While picking the songs, the conductor asks my girlfriend if she could have a couple of Christmas songs arranged to work on the female choir, since she's been doing some self-taught composition, so they'd add them to the program. She agrees and delivers. They prepare during the three months for the concert. During this time she also finished and got her engineering degree.

Now, I'm finishing my degree on Computer Science and me and my friend are working on our dissertation/thesis, this is the last phase and we have to finish the project and deliver the paper this week. However, our project is quite big for an undergraduate project. When we started, our advisor, and also other advisors, told us it was a task closer to graduates. We dived right into the madness and went with it. Took also a part time internship at a software company.  Long story short, a year passed by and this is the due week.

The date for the recital, was last Sunday, late afternoon. She was really excited I was there to see her and the songs she arranged. I told her I would be there. A month ago I asked for a month permit at work so I could work full time on my thesis since there was no way I could finish working with them at the same time, they willingly granted it. Me and my friend are going every single day all day to the campus, Sunday to Sunday, for a month to work on it. Still managed to make time to see my girlfriend every Friday and Saturdays. We, myself and my friend, were at the university on last Sunday morning finishing the last details before collecting results, but something came up which could prevent us from finishing within the date limits, and my permit ended so I couldn't work on it the next day. I called my girlfriend and told her I may not be able to be at the recital since we had this problem, and needed to fix it, but will try to be there hoping she would understand. Stayed till late night at the university but we were able to fix the issue.

She was disappointed, and said she told me with time when the recital was. She's upset I wasn't there despite I explained why and now she thinks that her things are not important to me and that she always makes time for the things that matter but I couldn't make time to go to the recital.

Am I the asshole ?

TL,DR: girlfriend had recital on Sunday where she arranged the songs. My dissertation due date is the week after the recital, problem came up on Sunday and had to stay late night fixing it or else I might not be able to finish it and missed the concert. Girlfriend is now upset despite me calling her to inform her the problem came up and might not be able to go."

a0ph8h,7,2018-11-26,"Tips for non-social time, including when not receiving texts? And where did this anxiety come from?",humps11,extroverts,https://www.reddit.com/r/extroverts/comments/a0ph8h/tips_for_nonsocial_time_including_when_not/,"I'd been diagnosed with social anxiety in my early teens...but it wasn't entirely ""typical"" social anxiety. I have suffered a lot from the ""typical"" awkwardness, overthinking in public, etc., but with counselling I mostly overcame it or learned to manage it well. 

But on the flip side...

I haven't been able to conquer my extreme anxiety when I'm alone. This includes on the bus physically alone, and not receiving emails/texts, nor sending emails/texts. I thought I was ""cured"" last school year (I'm in uni), and it was the most peaceful I'd ever felt. But it came creeping back in the summer and in this current school year I've really been struggling off and on. The anxiety gets so bad sometimes that I feel severely depressed and unable to function or have hope, lasting days, and it feels so stupid because I know it's so irrational: of course I can't be connected to someone 24/7. 

Starting last school year (Sep 2017) my medication combo seemed to be perfect, finally. And I worked on alone-ness a lot because I had just had a very heartbreaking break up and then moved in with strangers, so I felt like I needed to fend for myself and learn to be strong alone. I then started dating an amazing guy who I believe is ""the one"". But I also felt very comfortable during my time without him! 

Summer was then a mixed bag. And since the beginning of this school year (Sep 2018), a few things have changed. My bf is a couple hours away for grad school, I live with only 2 other people whereas before I lived with maaaany more at once, and I have fewer classes, in part due to my honours internship. I definitely feel lonelier. Objectively, I think I am spending more time alone than before. Sometimes I get through my week and the loneliness is kind of a numb feeling, but a few times I've broken down into the depression I mentioned (currently in that right now). EDIT: Another factor may be that I'm nearing the end of my degree, which naturally comes with ""wtf am I gonna do with my life?!"", but I worry more about ""wtf will be my social life?!"".

Then even sometimes when I AM connected to people, physically or texting, I'm thinking over and over ""Omg this is nice RIGHT NOW but when's the next time this'll happen?! Ahhh!"" Or I'll think about it after the fact: ""Omg that was such a nice time together but when's the next time it'll happen?!""

I would love to know why I ""care"" so much, what started this in middle school. In elementary school I'd have my time at school, come home, do at-home stuff. I would like to achieve that again – in a more adult way, obviously, so just making my dinner, doing my dishes, exercise/Netflix/homework/whatever, sleep. And repeat. And of course, sometimes I will come home with issues on my mind still. I understand that and that happens. I am able to manage frustrating issues without severe anxiety - such as receiving a bad mark, not having a good work shift, even when I've lost my keys or broken my phone, I could manage my emotions and thoughts and not be consumed by it, and then see a solution.

Maybe it's because when everyone changed schools from elementary school to middle school, a lot of my best friends abandoned me. A lot of the natural awkwardness/uncertainty about self/puberty kicked in I think, but I think the rise of Facebook and smartphones/iPod Touches absolutely amplified this. I already spent a lot of time on MSN in elementary school, so naturally I spent a lot of time on Facebook, only to find that Facebook is a good medium for comparing yourself to others, not having a genuine conversation. And then with a smartphone, that went everywhere with me, and it went everywhere with my friends, too. I did a lot of comparing myself in-person and online, and I did a lot of analyzing my friendships in-person (while they were on their phones) and online.

Now I'm a lot more sure of who I am and only use Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter on my laptop or mobile browser because it's more annoying to log in and waste time scrolling. But the anxiety about my social life still persists, and I'm not sure why, or if it's actually fixable, and if I'm the only one who's experienced this to this extent. It's not so much the content of my anxiety, but the large, constant volume that is the problem. Maybe it's considered obsessive?

Anyway, thanks for reading, and any tips, hope, similar experience, etc. would be so appreciated. &lt;3"
a0ppju,2,2018-11-26,AITA for telling my in laws to quit shaming my three year old or are they the assholes for ignoring me afterward?,Wearebornintothis,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a0ppju/aita_for_telling_my_in_laws_to_quit_shaming_my/,"
 I had an amicable relationship with my in laws of 5 years then I saw them discipline my then 3-year-old in a way I did not like. While they were watching my two daughters (3 and 1), the older girl threatened to hit her little sister with a block when she knocked her tower down. My in laws response was to say they didn't play with ""mean"" ""bad"" girls and leave the room, ignoring her. When i came back from work, my daughter was crying and confused, sitting on the floor quietly. I asked what happened and my mother in law relayed the story nonchalantly--Oh we just told her we don't play with bad mean girls."" 

I told my in laws I did not like that discipline tactic. She acted taken aback. I left to go back to work, and decided to explain my reasoning via text. I said: 


""Thanks for everything. I appreciate you being with the girls. I always know they're safe. If M hits with anything, take it away. Tell her it's not OK. Try to validate and label her feelings. You're mad. That is frustrating, but we don't hit."" I want her to feel understood and accepted while also knowing the behavior is not OK. She is OK. She is loved. But the behavior is NOT allowed."" She responded by saying, ""I've always done what you say, just like I've always done what C (my ex sister in law) says."" 

This is where I might have taken it too far. I had just talked to my other ex sister in law (My husband has two brothers, and both of their wives have left them because they say they are narcisisstically abusive, but that's another post.). My ex sister in law had told me that my in laws talked bad about me on the regular, saying I had ""issues,"" and ""ways"" with the girls that were annoying. So I said: 

""I know you have, but I also know that you can be put out by it. I talked to R (my other ex sister in law) last week and she said you always said how I ""have my ways"" in a deprecating tone. I understand we have different methods. I'm sorry if I've ever made you feel judged by your style. I think you guys are great. But I also don't think withholding affection and love for bad behavior is a good parenting tactic. Shame-based discipline can have toxic affects."" Then I linked her to an article. 

This post is not about whether you agree with my discipline method. It's what I choose to do and what Id like anyone who watches my kids to try. It works. 
This is about whether I was too harsh with my wording, and whether their response was appropriate. After relaying my preferences and stating my boundary, my in laws responded by saying they would never be able to live up to my standards, that i wanted them to watch the kids with their hands tied behind their backs and that they no longer feel comfortable watching my kids since I think they dont love them.....

They said they would not be alone with the girls again. However, a week later, my MIL said she would still watch my girls while I finished my internship even though my FIL wouldnt like it (it was his idea to refuse to watch the girls).
Since this happened, my FIL has called my husband griping about me, saying I have them all walking on eggshells and that he isnt going to smile and pretend to his granddaughters that ""mommas always right when she's not."" He also listed a bunch of minor grievances that he had said nothing to me about (I let my three-year-old walk on the handicap ramp, the baby played by and on the bottom of the stairs one day, and he thinks I'm underfeeding the kids, etc.)  I tried to both call him and talk to him in person. When I called, and texted he rejected and ignored me, then told my husband to tell me to write a letter, and he would write a letter back--that he didn't want me to ""twist his words,"" and he wasn't going to pretend I was right in front of my daughters anymore. 

I then tried to talk to him in person, but when I enter the room and greet him, he gets up and leaves without acknowledging me at all. When i pick up the girls after a visit, my FIL stays in the room until I arrive then when I say hi to him, he looks away and walks into another room.

I am pretty stunned and annoyed at his behavior because I don't feel like I did anything wrong, but I feel oddly punished. i asked my SO to stick up for me and he says it's not his business and he thinks his dad is trying to avoid conflict in the best way he knows how. I disagree completely. I think he is being immature and is intentionally creating conflict in order to be judged as a victim and right.  He also called his other son, my husband's older brother and told him how I overreacted about their discipline strategies, and that brother text me, griping me out about it and telling me I dont know what it's like to have a healthy family because I come from a broken home. 

Im temped to not bring my kids over there anymore, so they don't have to see their mother being actively ignored for what I see as no reason, but I'm not sure if that is too extreme.

I had liked my FIL OK before, or at least tolerated him, but now i think he has problems with strong women. He has called my former sister in law a slut and a bitch behind her back before. Id found it repugnant and pathetic at the time, and now his word choice seems targeted more at women in general than that one specific woman. My FIL, MIL and their sons all say my ex sister in laws are ""crazy"" and ""bitches,"" and that the boys treated them wonderfully, but they ""used"" them... The SILs have different stories, of course. 

Anyway, who is the asshole here? Me for stating my boundaries? Them for making a giant stink about it and ignoring me?

TL;DR  I'm trying to get an internship for programming experience, but as a novice I have no confidence and am generally terrified of interviews.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a student in Biomedical Engineering at a university on the US, in a city full of mostly tech companies and not a lot of life science ones. I've recently started to try and learn programming on top of my life science studies to be more marketable, but I'm a novice to put it softly, and I really need some real-world experience. My classes are simply not teaching me what I need, and not teaching me fast enough, for me to compete well in the job market with jobs that may normally get filled by actual programmers.

That being said, I'm looking for internships with some programming applied to life sciences, but I'm an absolute wreck when it comes to interviews. I get extremely nervous, and cannot sell myself because I was raised to be humble. I don't know how to show people what I'm capable of when I don't believe in my own abilities. I also go into ""testing anxiety mode"" that I have to forcibly control during interviews, and I'm pretty sure it still shows though.

How did y'all overcome your nervousness, and could you give me any advice in my particular case?

Thank you guys in advance. Sorry for the rant.

* We have around 23 retainer clients.
* We currently have 3 managers that serve both as the main point of contact and the strategic lead. (we tried one coordinator for all clients, but it was spread too thin)
* We have a PPC Manager, a PPC Associate, and 2 Writers.

We definitely have more need for SEO and email/marketing automation resources.

I know many agencies use account managers, but I believe on of our competitive advantages is having strategic account managers that are experienced.

So a few questions:

* How many clients should one ""account manager"" be responsible for?
* What is the right mix of managers/coordinators vs. specialists?
* What mix of interns, junior positions, and experienced positions do you feel works?
* Does anyone have a structure that they feel works really well that they'd like to share?"
a0qr6z,2,2018-11-26,"[M4F] Ideas guaranteed to mess up your lipstick, not your mascara.",this-ismyname999,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/a0qr6z/m4f_ideas_guaranteed_to_mess_up_your_lipstick_not/,"Hey. I think lipstick is fucking sexy. And it only gets hotter when a girl leaves her mark on some lucky guy. So here are some brief starter ideas off the top of my head. I’m more than open to any tweaks, twists, and turns you'd like to throw or add to them. Just warning that I'm fairly vanilla, and not interested in much that's illegal/nonconsenual. Also please forgive me dipping in and out of 1st, 2nd, and 3rd person mid sentence here, I don’t do it during plays. 




You catch your boyfriend cheating and storm over to his apartment to get your things and get a little revenge. I'm his loyal BFF and roommate who he hurriedly begged to ""protect his shit"" before bailing, unable to face you. So we're alone together for the first time. There's a few ways this can go, but the general idea is that he was very possessive of you. It'd kill him to see your favorite lipstick smeared on another guy, much less his BFF. You could take my phone while you're riding me on the couch and text him ""She's gone. Door unlocked. I got pizza."" and then laugh to yourself and ask me to bend you over towards the doorway.





It's almost Christmas, so I'll go ahead and throw in a Mistletoe Party. This could be a neighborhood/suburbs affair thing, with a younger guy home from college and a bunch of horny, wild MILFs wearing red lipstick and hanging out under the mistletoe. The queen of the suburb would definitely want to re-introduce herself to this young man, and then walk around the party with him wearing her smooches across his cheek and neck. Or an office party, with the boss taking his fill of his employee's wives and somewhat cucking them, parading with different color lipstick kisses on his cheek, almost like collecting trophies from the women married to his subordinates. Fuck, that's kinda hot. Another twist could be the Boss' Naughty Slut Daughter. I could end up under the mistletoe with her before I recognize her. You'd purr at me, lying, ""Oh, I'm a new accounting intern"" as you plant another couple kisses along my jawline and glance across the room to see if Daddy notices yet. I don't want to get fired, so we could go somewhere more private, but then your pretty red lips would get a little more… messy.





Rainbow Party - you might remember this as some urban legend from Oprah. But it's been a fantasy of mine for a while. One version went that three girls invite three guys over. Each girl wears a different color lipstick, and sinks to her knees and starts sucking. After some time, each girl switches to another guy, then again to the final. So by the end, if each girl did their part right, each guy's cock would have three distinct different colored lipstick rings. Then I guess they can pick their favorite and cum in their mouth, or they keep trading until they cum, or it just turns into an orgy after that. But the idea of getting different shades of lipstick on my cock and somehow showing it off has always been a massive turn on and fantasy. This doesn't have to be a multiple girl character thing, it could totally be one girl who changes outfits/lipsticks/looks maybe throughout a night or party or something. 





Deepthroat Contest - Okay, backing up, this one is kind of a multiple character thing. There's not much to this - it could be two best friends, roommates, sisters, coworkers, whoever arguing over who can take more dick in their mouth. I'd be just any passing waiter or lucky dude that happens to be nearby. Maybe I'm someone that they know is ""notorious"" for being hung, since they know they need a long dick to prove themselves. Of course, the only way to prove where the girls' lips have been would be for both to put on a generous amount of some bold color lipstick…





Sci-Fi / Future / Fantasy / Vagueness - This is a bit of a last catch-all. I said I was kind of vanilla, but I do like some of this weird stuff. I had a hot prompt and couple stories go about mind control lipstick. I also wouldn't mind some kind of lipstick that makes the kiss-ee unbearably horny, or possibly one that enhances cum production when kissed onto a lucky man's nutsack. I also had another recent one about a sorority witch coven with spell casting lipstick and stuff that had some fun. 





Anyways, I hope any of this catches someone's eye. Part of this is just organizing my own thoughts and some ideas I could make into better, bigger, more full-fledged prompts. These are all aimed at women players, but I'm always open to messages from anyone just to chat about lipstick fetish/story ideas. PMing here is great, Discord is easier, haven’t used chat/KIK, but I’m willing to try them if it’s a dealbreaker for the right partner.

a0qx11,2,2018-11-26,My (21m) girlfriend (21f) and I appear to have grown apart over the summer. We aren't sure how to move forward.,trevor4098,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a0qx11/my_21m_girlfriend_21f_and_i_appear_to_have_grown/,"My girlfriend and I met in August of 2016 at college. We started dating soon after in September. We really hit it off and were both very satisfied with our relationship. Our freshman year, we spent most of our time together in my small dorm room. She also kind of forced me to join a student organization that I ended up really enjoying. We were on the same committee. 

That summer, I got an internship with a general contractor and she got an internship at a country club near where she lives. We both missed each other a lot. We live about 12 hours from each other. Where I was working was only about 8 hours from where she lived. That summer she came to visit me for a weekend. It made the summer more bearable.

Sophomore year, we picked up right where we had left off. We spent most of our time together. Although now, the time was more so spent doing separate things. I mostly did homework and played videogames or watched YouTube. She spent her time watching Netflix or playing computer games. That year, she also went out for a leadership position on the committee in that student organization we are both a part of.

So last summer, she got an internship and I did not. She was in an area with no cell service and very poor Wi-Fi. As a result, we hardly talked all summer. Which really sucked. When we did talk, she was distant and didn't really seem like she wanted to talk. She blamed it on having to work long hours. I grew to accept it over the summer.

This year, we are living together on campus. We have seperate rooms and spend time together in the living room area. She spends almost all of her time watching Netflix. She is incredibly distant compared to where we were. She never initiates conversation and when I do, she doesn't seem interested in talking. 

I know for a fact that she is not cheating on me. I have not asked her if she was but I know she isn't. I have asked her about how she felt multiple times. She said that she could not put it into words. She needed some time and space. I gave her that. I asked her how she felt about us again. She said that she though we lacking something. I said that it might he how little she talks to me and how little physical interaction we have. So we tried to talk more every day to try to get over this. Today I asked her how she felt again. She said that over the summer she grew to become more independent and was craving doing new things and meeting new people. She also said that she felt she lacked the want for intimacy in our relationship. That we were missing some sort of chemistry.

Another reason for the state of our relationship was my lack of independence. I am being put through school by my parents and they pay for everything. Also, the only job that give ever had was working for that contractor my freshman year. She said that independence is something that she is looking for in someone. She to my lack of independence, she has had a lack of want for intimacy with me.

I am an introvert. However, I also want to go out and see the world. We agreed to start taking day or weekend trips. Also, I told her how I couldn't really prove my independence until I was out of school. As opposed to her who has been working since she was 15 and this year had to partially put herself through school.

TL;DR
My girlfriend of two years got a summer internship and spent her summer cut off from most of the people that she knew including me. Things were fine before she left for the summer but during and after the summer, she was incredibly distant both physically and emotionally.

When I asked her how she was feeling and why we had gotten to this point, she said that she now wanted to experience new things and meet new people. She also said that it was partly due to my lack of independence.

We are going to start going on day or weekend trips to try to experience new things together in hopes we can get back to where we once were.

We are both committed to trying to fix what is wrong. We are having a hard time figuring what is wrong or how to fix it.

Question 
I am not entirely sure where we should go from here. I don't know what we should do to remedy the situation. Is there anything that we can do? Should we end it now?

I am sorry this is all over the place. I am still trying to get my thoughts together on this. If you have any questions, please ask. Any advice would be greatly appreciated."

Radar absorbing structures and radome, body conformal antennae surface hard aperture, flush air data sensors and frequency selective surface (FSS) radome are used to reduce radar detection. Stealth ability is enhanced by the use of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) and nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) during the construction of the airframe and in the airframe and instruments. Prevents detection of the aircraft from L band, C band and X band radars. The aircraft's thrust vectoring nozzle reduces infrared emissions to mitigate the threat of infrared homing surface-to-air or air-to-air missiles. Additional measures to reduce the infrared signature include special paint and active cooling of leading edges to manage the heat build up from supersonic flight.

Notes | This plane will be capable of taking off from ski-ramps given the Indian carrier designs, or from catapults. The airframe and undercarriage are reinforced to withstand the stress experienced upon landing. Folding wings, an arrestor hook, and catapult attachments will also be added, which is different than the HF-17, but crucial for Naval variants.
Cost | $80m/plane
R&amp;D | We can see full rollout by late 2029 to early 2030.


We currently have listed the Snecma M90 engine listed, but we would like to ask France for a more developed engine to achieve the Mach 2.2 we are looking for. However, if they feel that the M90 engine will achieve the desired speed, then we will continue to use these engines. Since the Rafale F4 uses these engines, which we are building on license, we do not see a need to ask for another licensing for the M90.

a0r5jn,2,2018-11-26,New Grad with a PV/Drug Safety Interview -- any tips/advice appreciated!,alwaysworthatry,pharmacy,https://www.reddit.com/r/pharmacy/comments/a0r5jn/new_grad_with_a_pvdrug_safety_interview_any/,"Hello all! I'm a new grad (May 2018) who never really had an interest in reddit, but considering my circumstances I'm in dire need of a community to help me out with my current situation so I made an account. I'd appreciate any advice you guys have!

A little background: I was licensed in October and only started seriously looking for jobs then. I'm based in the Bay Area, so the job market is quite tough even for retail positions. I don't have paid work experience -- only retail intern experience. I've done a total of 3 face-to-face interviews so far (all retail) and phone interviews with 2 pharmaceutical companies/startups. One of the retail chains seems to be highly interested in me and has been keeping in touch every couple of days. They are opening a couple new stores in the Bay Area come early 2019 and I will be doing another face-to-face interview with them soon so that seems like the only promising option thus far.

As I stated earlier, I had 2 phone interviews related to the industry field. One of the interviews was a sort of pre-screening interview for a Drug Safety Scientist/PV role. The rep stated that he'd forward my resume to the hiring manager and get back to me on whether or not she would want to interview me as well. Now the listing for the PV job stated that required individuals could have either a bachelors degree with 3+ years of drug safety experience ***OR*** an advanced degree (MD, PharmD, RN, etc.) in lieu of drug safety experience. However, the rep was pretty straightforward about mentioning that the hiring manager is looking for someone with more experience but that he would still send my resume over. Of course, I knew that with my lack of experience a job like this would be a long shot.

A couple days later, the rep contacts me again and says the hiring manager would like to conduct a phone interview (yay!). So I schedule that and again, the interview ends with the hiring manager stating that they have a lot of applicants for the position and that she herself would prefer someone with more experience.

**BUT**, she then goes on to mention that she is also a pharmacist like me and says something along the lines of, *""This might be a stretch, but would you be willing to come in for an on site interview? You could meet the whole team and see more of what the process is like as well as ask any questions you may have.""* At this point I'm shocked that I'm moving forward in the interview process. She then continues to say, *""When it comes to positions like this, I'd like to meet people who I might have to work with in person.""* (The hiring manager is a core member of the PV team)

I accepted, and the interview is scheduled for mid-December. I've been doing all the research I can about the company and trying to learn whatever I can about Drug Safety/PV and relevant databases and terminology. I've also looked at countless sample patient safety narratives. But I'm just so scared for the actual interview as I will be interviewing individual people for hour-long portions. As I mentioned earlier I have no experience and they are fully aware of that. And with it being a 6 hour interview, I really don't know what to expect or say or if this means I made a good enough impression to the hiring manager. Are they interviewing 3 people? 10? 20? Ahhh!! I'm confident in my drive, work ethic, people skills, time management, etc. but when it comes to experience I have nothing to bring to the table. Does anyone have advice as to how I can portray myself best w/ no experience?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR;** New pharmacist grad with absolutely no work experience but was lucky enough to land a 6 hour in person interview. Any tips/advice for the interview process??

a0rmda,9,2018-11-27,1.2 years of Nofap Minimal Progress,theouty,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/a0rmda/12_years_of_nofap_minimal_progress/,"For almost 8 grueling months I remained trapped in this flatline. In these months I endured an emotional roller coaster. There were times in December near Christmas where I thought I was almost near the end of my journey. I started feeling positive sensations, music was somewhat enjoyable, and hope was restored. Two weeks after, that glimmer of hope escaped from sight. I was dead again. This roller coaster happened for about 10 months from about late October all the way to August.

Near August, is when I started to see real stable changes. My emotions began to resurface, I became more concerned about my dreams, more in-tuned with my aspirations. I regained my standards and expectations, I had more of a sense of urgency. Music became more enjoyable. The main problem I face now is my chronic anxiety. Now however it is not so much social anxiety but general anxiety. I have to create coping mechanisms to stop from entering a panic attack. Matter of fact, I entered a panic attack in summer and it was terrible. I was in my internship and had to deliver a presentation the next day, and I guess I got overwhelmed with the circumstances and I immediately had a physical reaction: sweating, uncontrollable fidgetyness, and a racing mind that I could not stop. Luckily after a drink of water and splash of water on my face I was able to calm myself down.

Now, it is November and progress is very minimal. I have enjoyment for music most of the time, I am able to hold a conversation a little better but I am PLAGUED with exhaustion. I can't fight anymore. This has been 16 months of straight strain, uneasiness, discomfort, high stress, hopelessness, and I cannot wait to be rehealed. Consider my case is taking more than 6 times longer than everyone else I am starting to doubt if I will ever be healed. The progress made is so small and I still suffer from anxiety. Every day I try to simply calm myself down, and I don't have energy for anything else. The worst part is that I am stuck in this weird place where I care and want good but do not have the mental clarity, peace of mind, or energy to solve or at least work towards these problems. I tried speaking to a doctor and getting blood tests and they say my blood is completely normal. I look completely healthy on paper but I feel horrible. I cannot do this for another month, I am lost. Although, this journey has been the longest testament to my willpower as I was able to stay hopeful and continuing fight for almost a YEAR AND A HALF I have lost any energy to continue.

&amp;#x200B;

I know this is a lot but I just need help, advice, support, idk man. I just do not know what to do. I never felt like this before, and I want this to stop. I think sometimes if it was worth it for me to ever start this journey as I have lost so much. I am just lost. please."
a0rt45,9,2018-11-27,My internship was terminated and I am too guilty and depressed to tell anyone,its_all_fine_now,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/a0rt45/my_internship_was_terminated_and_i_am_too_guilty/,"I had an internship at a small company (50-60 employees) that dealt with software related things and going into the internship, I knew I was already underqualified because I came from a finance/economics background whereas the other two interns were studying comp/sci and pure mathematics. We're all penultimate students, I was the only one from an Ivy League college which I guess played a part.

&amp;#x200B;

Over time, I was delegated to more and more menial and wordy tasks such as writing 10+ page report templates, shifting away from coding (ie Python) which was basically the role that I applied for. These reports were so tedious....I had to write multiple reports, all of them were similar in content but the manager from another division wanted them to be unique which made them really hard to write. She was also often busy with meetings so I liaised with another senior on what he thought I should add and remove from the reports that I produced. Later that month, I was told that the reports were good but I had to make them more user friendly etc, so I scrapped 50% of the content and started from scratch. I was already annoyed that my seniors had intersecting views on how it should be done, which wasted a lot of my time which could have been spent on refining the reports that I had already finished or moving back into the software development team. 

&amp;#x200B;

After I was done, I submitted everything into our company cloud service and the manager who delegated me that task said she'd look at it later and thanked me. I then moved back into the coding team and helped with refining new features and helping our clients understand our software. After a while, the original manager tells me he's happy with the work i've put in (one of the analysts from the other team said I was very helpful) and that he'd be putting me on a new coding project with one of our clients. I happily agreed and they explained to me what needed to be done etc. The manager and another couple of analysts booked in weekly meetings with me to evaluate my progress and I got straight to it. 

&amp;#x200B;

3 days later, I had a meeting and I was called into a meeting room to show them my code. However, in my opinion, they were not 100% clear on what I had to do so my code obviously didn't impress them. It was clear that my manager was pretty pissed and he asked me if I knew what I was doing which embarrassed the fuck out of me. After the meeting, I tried my hardest to replicate what was required and everything seemed to be going back to normal. 

&amp;#x200B;

After about a week, I was suddenly called into the meeting room amidst my coding and I could immediately tell that this wasn't good. My manager got straight to the point. He told me they were letting me go and that they couldn't afford to have underperforming interns at a small firm, telling me to go to a larger firm, to go develop myself. I asked them what I could have done better and they told me I had no attention to detail and I couldn't follow instructions. I felt cheated because writing over 50 pages of reports and then rewriting a good 30 pages of those (complete with proper formatting and edited png. diagrams) was not what I had in mind and it was incredibly hard to stay motivated and acute when stuck with menial tasks like this. He told me my code was an example of how I couldn't follow instructions and that there were various little errors in the reports such as forgetting to add in page numbers for one of the reports and also forgetting to add an indent on one of the paragraphs. I accepted his critiques as they were fair and I offered to finish my internship without pay. 

&amp;#x200B;

He told me, 'No, we can't. Just take your stuff and slip out, nobody will see you'.

&amp;#x200B;

This was so humiliating to hear. He told me that they still liked me as a person but I was better off doing something else for now until I developed myself more. And then I left. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is the only place I've told anyone. I'm so grateful to be able to vent my most recent stress.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks and have a great day!"

###Philippines

The People's Republic of China is interested in using the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road as an opportunity to aid the Philippines' [Federal Industrialization Project 2020](https://www.reddit.com/r/Geosim/comments/9yfzb9/event_republic_act_10756_federal/) as requested by the Philippines Government. The PRC and the Philippines both will work to transform the economy into ""a newly industrialized country"" as proposed. The PRC has proposed to work with the Philippines in the following areas, to collaborate on the project, but deviate to develop several other areas and relations.

**Agriculture**

The [Zhongyi Agricultural Machinery Cooperative](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-03/20/c_137052886.htm) has been China's most modern developer in high-tech agricultural equipment. Notable achievements have been creating automated exhaust systems and solar energy equipment. In most recent times they have used drones to fly over farms and distribute fertilizer and agricultural chemicals. The Zhongyi Cooperative has collaborated with Qinghua University, Renmin University, and Beijing University of Science and Technology on numerous occasions to employ skilled graduates and fund cooperative research development projects. Zhongyi is not only interested in working with the Central Government to expand projects to the Philippines, but feels the recent project executed by the Philippine Government is the perfect opportunity to do so. The Zhongyi Cooperative would like to expand research projects to top Philippine Universities to begin collaboration on modern agriculture technology. President Xi has commended this action, saying ""This cooperation could not only help revitalize the Philippines, but help China reach their Made In China 2025 goals, both nations have a lot of work to do, but the benefits will exceed the efforts."" The Zhongyi would like to undertake projects in the Philippine farmland to send analysts to determine optimal areas for farming, and what crops would best be suited in crop rotations. The Zhongyi would also send workers to help implement healthy and sustainable practices that will increase output and the efficiency of the farms. The technology developed from the projects would be made affordable to the Philippine Government, so their farmers would be able to utilize the equipment. To aid this process, the Zhongyi will be creating a Agricultural Technology and Research Zone in Chengdu, and manufacturies in Tianjin to produce the new technology in compliance with MIC 2025 and the Jing-Jin-Ji Megaproject. The Philippine students and researchers will go to Chengdu to assist in planning, research and production of the equipment, where it will then be transferred and tested in the Philippines. All of this will take place under the supervision of the Philippine Government, and Zhongyi Analysts/Agriculture Experts.

**Price $10 Bn**


**Shipbuilding and Maritime Technologies**

Both nations are also working on developing their maritime technology capabilities, and knowledge. China has made the same industry a key ""region for development."" President Xi feels cooperation between Chinese and Philippine companies can make their industries grow exponentially, and in an unparalleled way, as both nations have their needs. China wishes to upgrade not only their naval shipbuilding, but also expand and improve their fleets for shipping and international trade, to expand international economic development. The Philippines is an island nation, and uses ships not only as their prime source of economic revenue, but as a livelihood to connect them to the world. China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation, China State Shipbuilding Corporation, COMEC, and Dalian Shipbuilding Industry Company all have a strong interest in helping the Philippines develop their capacity to produce equipment, and they are interested in working with the Philippines to develop technology for their shipping and naval vessels. China will assist in the construction of the Misamis Oriental, Cagayan, Panay Island, and Ligayen Gulf shipbuilding yards. In addition, Dalian Shipbuilding Industry Company would like to build 3 joint-run shipbuilding yards in the Philippines. China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation would like to invest in the Philippines Maritime Development Corporation, and work on joint research efforts to development new technologies. To do so, China would like to invite the Philippines Maritime Development Corporation to open a joint research and development facility in Tianjin where projects can be worked on together to power both of their industries. If the Philippines wishes, a similar site will be constructed in a location of their choosing, with Dalian Shipbuilding Industry Company as their primary partner.

**Price $15 Bn**

**Aerospace and Electronics**

China has recently increased their [own domestic capabilities](https://www.reddit.com/r/Geosim/comments/9vx12c/event_made_in_china_2025_aviation_spotlight/) which has caused in the explosion of the Chinese aerospace sector, originally considered a struggling field for the Central Government. CAIGA, Comac, and XAIC, all Chinese aerospace companies, have all benefited from extensive scholarship, talent-seeking, internships, co-op and research programs with universities in China that has allowed to use the university Aviation Experimentation and Fabrication Laboratories to test their equipment in controlled settings. If the Philippine also wishes to develop their capabilities, President Xi sees this as an excellent opportunity to create an Aviation Experimentation and Fabrication Laboratory Complex in the Philippines were the companies can work together in close proximity on experimental equipment and aircraft. President Xi's primary concern, is that these companies that deal with the Chinese Aerospace sector must agree to produce equipment that can meet American FAA regulations, as President Xi has made it a goal to expand Chinese operations globally. If this requirement can be met, the companies and the Central Government will have no problem moving forward.

**Price $11 Bn**

**Automotive, Resources and Heavy Industries**

Zhongjin would like to expand by creating three mines in the Philippines, to employ local workers, focusing on gold, chromite and nickel. In addition the following auto manufacturers would like build facilities in the Philippines to create large automobile manufacturing in the Philippines:

* BYD Auto
* Dongfeng Motor Corp
* SAIC Motor
* Tianjin FAW
* Dayun Group
* Changan Automobiles

**Price $16 Bn**

###Vietnam

**Transportation**

The People's Republic of China has been interested in the Vietnamese proposal to develop a high-speed rail to [link Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_transport_in_Vietnam#High-speed_rail). The proposal was scrapped in 2009 due to the projected costs of it being $56 Bn, however, China is willing to use the Belt and Road Initiative to help Vietnam connect the nation. If Vietnam will utilize the recent, Chinese-made, CRH 400, the Chinese Central Government is willing to foot 62% of the cost of HSR, making this Vietnamese dream a reality. The HSR will also be connected to the Chinese HSR network, making transfer of goods and people between nations an easier process for both parties.

The Chinese Central Government is also interested in laying down an effective, large, and good quality network of roads and high-ways to connect China all the way to Ho Chi Minh City in the south, to make the Belt and Road Initiative an easier process, and facilitate the transfer of goods.

**Price $38.7 Bn**

**Robotics**

The Vietnamese Science Community, especially [TOSY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOSY), has made ground-breaking developments in the field of robotics. The Chinese Central Government is very interested in working with Vietnam to develop both of their robotics sectors, and grow technology on both sides. China's robotics sector has been exploding, just in the last 7 years alone with [thousands of companies getting interested in the market and developing their own devices](https://www.roboticstomorrow.com/news/2016/05/10/the-5-chinese-robot-companies-that-cannot-be-overlooked/8137/). Turing Robot, Ecovacs, Ubtech, and Rokid, all Chinese robotics companies with an emphasis on robotic AI and deep learning technology have all been expanding and been extremely successful in developing useful robotics, making revolutionary developments in the field. The Chinese Central Government is interested in working with Vietnam on creating two robotics-based research facilities, one in Vietnam and one in China. 

**Price $5 Bn**

**Infrastructure**

Housing and urban development has been a cornerstone of Chinese involvement in Vietnam. As such it is only appropriate China helps Vietnam lift the quality of its housing and businesses up. State Grid Corporation of China and China State Construction Engineering have committed to increasing the quality of housing in both Ho Chi Minh City, and Hanoi, while developing several smaller cities with large housing projects. The areas of interest to the Central Government are:

* Hai Phong
* Thanh Hoa
* Da Nang
* Phan Thiet

**Price $17 Bn**

###Cambodia

**Transportation**

Cambodia has been working with foreign nations to significantly improve its transportation system. The Chinese Central Government would like to start with significant highway and road upgrades. This would include extending lanes, repaving, and developing more roads to link the country. While the Cambodian Government has shown interest in developing the system after a long series of government changes and civil wars, the recent government has proven stable to the international community, leading to large amounts of investment. It is China's desire to make the international investment fruitful for Cambodia, which will facilitate the Belt and Road Initiative.

In addition to the road development, the Central Government is interested in working with the Cambodian Government to develop a small high-speed railway system that can be further developed by the Cambodian Government and China after seeing the results of the current proposed system. The Chinese Government is interested in developing an HSR to connect:

*  Phnom Penh
* Ho Chi Minh City
* Siem Reap
* Battambang
* Poi Pet
* Sihanouk

**Price $22 Bn**

**Port Development**

COSCO Shipping and China Merchants Group are both interested in developing a large trade port and shipping container facility in Sihanouk. The port would be an upgrade from the current one in possession by the Cambodian Government, and would be a joint ownership by Cambodia's Port Authority and COSCO Shipping, and China Merchants Group.

**Price $5 Bn** 


###Thailand

**Electronics and Automotive Sectors**

Thailand is the leader in ASEAN for automobile manufacturing, and electronics is the largest export sector in Thailand. The Chinese Central Government acknowledge both of these strong suits in Thailand, and would like to invest in these growing industries.  Thailand is a large producer of SSDs, as a result Huawei, Lenovo, and TCL Corporation are all interested in opening manufacturing in Thailand. The manufacturing facilities will be manned by a joint-labor force of Chinese and Thai workers. In total, 12 manufacturing facilities will be opened in a new Free Electronics Development Manufacturing Zone to host both Chinese and Thai companies.

**Price $9 Bn**

**Rail Transportation**

The Thai Government has already been working on the Khon Kaen Light Rail. The Chinese Central Government would like to assist in its development. The Central Government has proposed to help the Thai Government speed up the construction and have it completed at the end of 2021.

The Chinese Government is also interested in working on a High-speed rail with the Thai Government. The Central Government has proposed an HSR railway to pass through the following cities:

* Bangkok
* Pattaya City
* Phnom Penh
* Vientiane
* Chiang Mai
* Phuket
* Hat Yai

**Price $17 Bn**


###Malaysia

**Port Klang Expansion Project**

Port Klang is the largest and highest grossing port in Malaysia. There is a considerable amount of goods that flow through the port annually. COSCO Shipping has taken notice of this, and is interested in expanding the Port Klang by seven berths and eight quay cranes. This would expand the output of the port by a significant amount, as COSCO Shipping needs a branching point across the Indian Ocean that is closer and in a more optimal location to cut costs and build revenues. Since this would nearly be doubling the size of the port, and it would be under joint administration with the port authority and COSCO Shipping, the costs of creating such a massive project would be very high. This would elevate Port Klang from the 17th to the 12th busiest port in the world, and no better location for such an expansion being close to the South China Sea.

**Price $12 Bn**

**Urban Development**

Over the course of Malaysia's development they have assimilated into four cities of growing size, with Kuala Lumpur eclipsing the 2nd largest city (George Town) by double. The Chinese Central Government would be interested in working with the Malaysian Government to increase the size and living space for more Malaysians as they continue moving towards the cities. While the industry is moving to the cities, people have been slower in moving to those locations to fill the jobs, calling for further housing development. China State Construction Engineering would like to build high-rise housing in:

* George Town
* Ipoh
* Petalling Jaya
* Shah Alam

**Price $24 Bn**


###Singapore

**Electronics**

Electronics is Singapore's second largest export, coming in 16%, as Singapore is largely financial and trading based. Being a logistics hub, the Chinese Government and private Chinese Companies are interested in moving some electronics manufacturing and research to Singapore due to its close proximity to ports given its size. Hytera, which produces China's radios and telecommunication technology and equipment. Hytera is interested in developing an experimental research and manufacturing facility in Singapore. In addition, Chunlan Group, that produces air conditioners and engines, is interested in opening a facility there. They will both reside inside the new joint Sino-Singapore Electronics Manufacturing Economic Zone. It will provide a sanctuary for businesses to move to and research in, while being within close proximity to the port and shipping options.

**Price $5 Bn**

**Petroleum**

Singapore, with their largest export being Petroleum, that comes in 23% of their total exports, is the second area of interest and development by the Chinese Government. Sinoenergy, China Natural Gas, and Sinopec are all interested in opening offices in Singapore. This will allow them to invest and carry out joint cooperation with the companies operating in Singapore. There are a large amount of oil reserves in Malaysia and around Singapore that have still yet to be tapped into. These companies are interested in working with other companies in Singapore, including foreign companies to discuss best extraction options and opening facilities of their own.

**Price $3 Bn** 


###Indonesia

The Indonesian Government has passed its ambitious [IFRIT Plan](https://www.reddit.com/r/Geosim/comments/9xzyxf/event_the_ifrit_plan/) other nations, such as India, have announced their interest in the Indonesian project. Due to the scope of the project, and the demands it will require to be satisfied being considerable, are unavoidable to the Chinese Central Government. President Xi has ordered the Belt and Road project in Indonesia to dip into the IFRIT Plan to lead towards its completion, while satisfying Belt and Road ambitions. 

**Borneo Development Project**

The Island of Borneo, strategic to the Indonesian Government, has lagged behind as far as regional development, except for in Balikpapan, the largest city on the island. The Chinese Government is interested in helping the Indonesian Government develop *Singkawang, Pontianak, Palangkaraya, Banjarmasin, Banjarbaru, Samarinda, and Botang*. These cities, growing, but are still small in size. They need strong industries to satisfy them and their growth, a means to effectively connect them, and a large port to feed the island that belongs to Indonesia, and not Malaysia/Brunei. The Chinese Government has laid out a multiple step plan to shake off the old industries of agriculture, and pursue fields more fit for the modern economy. However, this does not mean the total eclipse of the necessary industry that agriculture is. The Central Government has taken notice that mining, oil, and gas are all large industries in Borneo, and Brunei is extremely dependent off of Borneo Oil and Gas. This is an opportunity that Indonesia and China cannot pass up on. Several Chinese Companies have proposed the following cooperation on the island of Borneo, the Indonesian Black Gold Explosion:

* Pertamina-China Natural Gas (Investment, Massive Operation Expansion into untapped reserves)
* PT Lapindo Brantas-Sinopec (Cooperation, Joint Venture into untapped oil reserves)
* MedcoEnergi-Sinoenergy (Exploration Cooperation, Joint-Venture into tapped, but underutilized reserves)
* Bumi Resources-Chinese Engineering and Mining Company (Extensive mining ventures in inner-Borneo, Investment)

With these cooperations, the Chinese Central Government places Indonesia at the largest producer and exporter of natural gas and petroleum in SEA. The Chinese Central Government aims to develop the previously listed cities with extensive housing and urban developments to get Borneo ready for influx they will receive as part of the cooperation. China State Construction Engineering, and State Grid Corporation of China have proposed plans for the cities to develop to take on the population, mostly in high-quality high rises to prevent the development of slum-life due to the lack of housing.

While the development of these industries is all well, China notes that there needs to be an effective way to connect the island, and move people, and supplies around without interruption due to low quality roads/decaying infrastructure. China proposes the development of the already existing roads and extension of the lanes, finishing with a inter-Borneo repaving. However the loop around Borneo is long, and there needs to be a faster way to directly cross the island. For this issue, China will be developing the non-finished but started roads in Sintang, Putussibau, and Puruk Cahu and connect them near the center. This will be the primary way for supplies and services to move up and down the country, avoiding the long haul around the circle. 

There is still the question of moving people, especially in a cheap and efficient way. To solve this issue, China has proposed to do what China does best, build a high-speed rail that will operate on the newly produced CRH 400 of 600 km/hr. This proposed HSR will connect:

* Pemangkat
* Singkawang
* Pontianak
* Sintang
* Mangkul
* Sampit
* Palangkaraya
* Banjarmasin
* Banjarbaru
* Amuntai
* Balikpapan
* Samarinda
* Botang

and to Malaysia and Brunei via Serian, Sibu, Mukah, Bintulu, Bandar Seri Begawan, and Sandakan- effectively connecting the entire island on this ambitious project.

As previously mentioned, the Chinese project in Borneo could not be complete without the port to service it all- in Singkawang. The Chinese Central Government has proposed to develop a large port authority in Singkawang with 12 berths and 12 quay cranes. The port will be controlled 73% by private Indonesian Companies and the rest will be split between China Merchants Group and COSCO Shipping. This will make the Singkawang Port Authority at the most strategic location to service the South China Sea and make Singkawang one of the top 20 ports in the world.

**Sino-Indonesian Scientific and Education Partnership Agreement**

The Chinese Ministry of Education has proposed an agreement with the Indonesian Government to promote research projects and create relationships between the universities in China and Indonesia. Not only would this ease the flow of study-abroad programs, but both nations could benefit from the cross-cultural communications, and results of the projects. The Chinese Ministry of Education proposes the following:

* Syiah Kuala University-Beihang University
* Malikussaleh University-Nanjing University
* University of North Sumatra-Beijing Institute of Technology
* State University of Medan-Nankai University
* University of Indonesia-Qinghua University
* State University of Jakarta-Beijing University
* Sriwijaya University-Dalian University of Technology
* Indonesia Open University- Shandong University
* Indonesia University of Education- Minzu University of China
* Bogor Institute of Agriculture-East China Normal University
* Sebelas Maret University-Xiamen University
* State University of Malang-Harbin Institute of Technology

The Chinese Ministry of Education also proposed the following extended Chinese University campuses:

* Beijing University-Jakarta
* Qinghua University-Balikpapan
* Xiamen University-Medan

The Chinese Ministry of Education has also proposed the Sino-Indonesian Culture and Scientific Exchange Initiative for students in secondary schools of both nations. This will be a unique study abroad opportunity for one semester or one year of choice by the student in secondary school. It will be treated as a completely equivalent academic term in both nations. This will give Chinese students the unique opportunity to learn Indonesian at a younger age, before entering university to strengthen their application status with a study abroad experience. This will also give Indonesian students a unique experience to travel to a secondary school in China and learn Chinese, about Chinese culture, and continue their studies. The Ministry feels this will increase understanding between both nations and ""provide the pathway for the leaders of our future,"" where both nations learn to respect and understand the unique situation, language, and culture of both nations.

**Development of Indonesian-Sino Regional Aviation**

Sure, international aviation is a big deal, but all the money is made at the regional level, this is especially true for the unique layout of Indonesia, and the large migration during Chinese New Year back to the heart of China for working professionals. This situation, although different in both nations, calls for the very same requirements: a developed, advanced regional fleet. As part of the Made in China 2025 policy on aviation, President Xi has increased the technological knowledge of Chinese aviation companies, and aerospace companies. China is also completing a large amount of domestically produced aircraft that do in-fact meet FAA standards, a milestone in Chinese aviation- especially for entry into the foreign market. The world is largely familiar with FAA standards and regulations, and President Xi has made note of this to the Indonesian Government as a guarantee of technological advancement, and compliance of international safety regulations. While China has increased its capacity to produce aircraft to feed its own nation, it looks abroad to implement the aircraft, at a cheaper price than the Boeing or Airbus craft, but meeting the same requirements and regulations. COMAC and CAIGA would both like to open two large aircraft manufacturing facilities in Borneo. These companies would like to partner with Indonesian Airspace to work with their scientists and engineers to develop more fuel efficient and technologically advanced craft, in hopes Indonesia will also pursue a future in regional aircraft production. COMAC and CAIGA will host Indonesian Aerospace Talent Prospect programs to get young university students interested in building and producing craft of their own. Who knows, eventually this could pave way for Indonesian produced military craft, and extra-skilled pilots. In conjunction with this, the Chinese Ministry of Education has elected to award one university in Indonesia with their own version of China's Aviation Experimentation and Fabrication Laboratory to provide students with the facilities and research funding to build and test their own projects. This project has been very successful in China and has given students a platform to make their dreams of aviation a reality, and transferring from theory to hands-on study. If Indonesia will agree to purchase some of the produced regional aircraft to use in their own regional carriers, COMAC has agreed to produce a regional passenger jet with Indonesia by 2026, hiring some of the students to test their experiments and what they have learned. Also, if Indonesia is interested, China has opened several FAA-teaching and FAA qualifying flight schools opening student slots for Indonesian high-schoolers and university students to get their private pilot's licenses, and rates. China has elected to wave the rates, and provide visas for the first 115 students that are interested in this offer.

**Military Base**

The People's Republic of China is interested in opening a naval base near the new port authority in Singkawang. The PRC will of course cover the necessary costs, and manage their own construction as long as Indonesia will provide the 99-year lease.

a0t1q1,3,2018-11-27,Another (really long-sorry!) question about the diagnosis process.,Jaymeas,Narcolepsy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Narcolepsy/comments/a0t1q1/another_really_longsorry_question_about_the/,"I’m not sure what, exactly, I’m expecting from this. But as you all know it is SO difficult to get any support or direction in dealing with sleep issues, so I figured I would post here to see if anyone had any insight or advice. I’m not at all convinced that I have narcolepsy itself, but I know there is something wrong with my sleep/rest and recovery. 

Basically, I’ve had sufficiently disruptive sleep issues for at least 16 years now that I can remember (I’m 32 currently) and according to my mother had several years as a kid with bad night terrors, often seeming awake but clearly still in some terrible nightmare. Around age 7/8 I was diagnosed with ADD and started taking Ritalin daily. The kind of trance it put me in made me decide to stop taking the medication in high school (after trying Concerta and Adderall without any improvement on the zombiefication...). At that point I would crash at literally every opportunity (like taking naps in my car during my 15 minute break while working at Target) despite sleeping 8+ hours through the night and thought that was just normal adulthood. Then as a full time college student and then grad student I just assumed my friends hid their tiredness better than me but that we all felt completely drained all the time. 

After finishing my masters degree I had my first 9-5 office job and that was when I began to realize it really wasn’t normal to sleep from 8pm to 7am every day. At this point I also started having fairly regular sleep paralysis and lots of hallucinations (seeing things while falling asleep and jerking awake to sounds that didn’t really happen). At the same time I also began being more aware of waking up regularly throughout the night. 

I then decided to move from the US to the UK for a PhD. During these years I had sooo much ease and flexibility with my schedule that I should have been able to sleep enough to stop being exhausted but it just never happened. The waking up during the night became more pronounced. 

At that point I finally tried to see a doctor about it but the NHS where I was living was (is) a bad joke and it took literal months to get an appointment where, after five minutes and no listening to me at all, I was dismissed and told I shouldn’t have pursued a PhD if I didn’t want to be tired. (My research was in the social sciences on the topic I love most in the world and went probably as smoothly as it possibly could. So much so that I finished a year early. I am 100% confident that did not contribute to my issues at all). 

Now back working in the US as faculty I have a lot of flexibility in my schedule that lets me sleep 10+ hours a night and often work from home so I can be sprawled out on the couch most of the day. Once my insurance kicked in I went to the dr and in the past 2.5 years have had a home sleep study (ordered by gp) that showed I had lots of arousals but no sleep apnea, was then told I had to try a cpap for I think three months before they would consider anything else, then finally sent for an overnight sleep study (ordered by pulmonologist, after seeing ENT surgeon who evaluated me and said everything looked exactly how it should) to “confirm sleep apnea” which was, unsurprisingly, completely clear of any signs of apnea. Then finally sent for an MSLT (ordered by same pulmonologist). The test itself was problematic due to the technicians having what sounded like a rave through the first couple hours of the night and then the center director making calls on speaker phone in the office next to my room (who planned that layout?!?) during the naps. At the third nap I told the tech there was no way I’d ever sleep since it was so loud and was finally given earplugs, which did help some but by that point the stress of thinking I hadn’t slept at all for the first two naps had set in and I still wasn’t sleeping normally. 

Despite this the results did show that I slept in all five naps, but had sleep latencies of 16 and 23 in the first two naps but then 8, 4, and 3 mins once I had the earplugs, with no sorems—despite remembering dreams and hallucinating in two different naps. My doctor said the noise was irrelevant because if I had a real sleep issue I’d fall asleep no matter how loud it is and that my sleep latencies were all “normal”. I put up a fight and she prescribed modafinil. I tried that for two months and it seemed to make me have really drastic crashes that without medication I could usually fight off during the day and also made me sneeze almost constantly. So obviously I told her there was no benefit to me continuing with such side effects and I already have enough experience with the amphetamines to know the feeling of absolute nothingness I get when on them isn’t better than the exhaustion. She then said she gives up and referred me to the only other sleep doctor (also a pulmonologist) in the system here (I have Kaiser, so it is fairly restricted) and I’m set to see them in December. 

My mom was diagnosed with narcolepsy ten or so years ago and has been treated since then with xyrem and it has basically turned her whole life around (she never shared that she had sleep paralysis and hallucinations that were what led to her diagnosis until maybe two ears ago...thanks mom! Haha...). I live about 5,000 miles away from her now but was able to go with her to her sleep dr appointment when I was visiting in October and that doctor looked at my sleep study results and said it looked like I had more severe narcolepsy than even my mother. But I had no sorems and I kind of think he’s just on a mission to prove narcolepsy is inherited. And also just a nice guy who wants to try what he can to actually help his patients even if the standard findings aren’t there for the diagnosis. In talking with him it sounds like I do have cataplexy (laughing when sitting my head kind of falls to my chest and my arms go weird, while standing I always have to stop walking and usually have to lean on something/someone and when I’m talking to students about opportunities they get (getting accepted to the study abroad program they want or getting a good internship, for example) I almost always lose the ability to speak and often drop or fling a pen out of my hand if I’m holding one—I’m a sucker for kids doing awesome things). 

I think mostly I’m asking if anyone has had a similar journey and finally did get some support and, if so, what was it that you said to the doctor to get them to really help you figure it out? I live in Hawaii so I don’t have the option of finding a new doctor and have been told no neurologists or psychiatrists here do sleep medicine. 

I feel like if I go into the appointment with a new doctor and say “my mom has narcolepsy and is treated with xyrem, I think this is what I need” I’ll be laughed out of the office and have a note in my file that I’m like seeking drugs to abuse or something...

If anyone has actually read to this point, well done! Very much appreciated, even if you don’t have any insight to share :-) "
a0tl4j,2,2018-11-27,I hate most of my family and it breaks my heart. TW. Depression.,Kindly_Loquat,TrueOffMyChest,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/a0tl4j/i_hate_most_of_my_family_and_it_breaks_my_heart/,"Hello all.

I come from a family that appears well. We live in a nice house, really don't have food issues, so why should I complain? But yet I do. Am I selfish? We originally came from nothing. Early on, I realized I was different. The best way I can describe it is that I was a fairy kid.  My dad decided to beat it out of me: a six year old kid. This eventually stopped when CPS threaten to take us (my unborn brother at the time) away, but it skewed our relationship ever since. As I grew, I was the star kid. I did extremely well in school and every teacher said I had a bright future. I was always the obedient kid as compared to my cousin (who I was raised to see as my older brother) but that was due to fear. As I grew older, I started to become more comfortable with my gender and sexuality. My mother did not take well to this. She would throw away my clothes, spread rumors about me to the rest of the family, took money away from me, whatever it took. What broke me was when she confessed that she and my cousin were keeping tabs on me. It then dawned on me that everything I told him would get back to her. I started distancing myself from him. I became more depressed as I kept dealing with home issues. I was on antidepressants which my parents made fun of me for being on (despite my mom being on them herself) and I would get unexplained panic attacks. My dad would repeatedly mock me for it, making it so that I started keeping my health ailments to myself. I started retreating more to the online world. Everyday was another argument as soon as I got home. Yet I continued to be the ""star kid"". Eventually I got into a relationship in which my mother nearly pushed the girl to suicide. Every problem they had with me, they took it out on her. If I tried to defend her, they would take it out of her. They even threatened me explicitly that any problems they have with me they would take it out on her. They told me this to my face. Needlessly to say, that relationship failed. I was unable to protect her and it haunts me to this day. I told my grandfather these things as a way to vent, and he promised to take them to the grave. That was a complete lie. He told everyone causing a huge fight with me, him, my cousin, and the rest of the family. We didn't talk for several years and our relationship is shaky at best now. As the years went on, I came to terms with myself and came out as transgendered. I decided to tell my parents. They promised to support me which was a complete lie. Every day is another argument and I am sick of it. I feel so detached. When my parents are in a good mood, I feel threatened as many times, their happiness comes at my expense. I cannot trust them, I feel like with other family members, I cannot bond with them. The mother and father are held to high regard in Hispanic culture and I am seen as second class. This is despite me being the only one of my generation to succeed (I am doing okay) in college, have high potential (Ha!). My grandmother says I value gold, but if that is the case, why am I treated like shit? I am well at the age to move out but it isn't that easy over here...

&amp;#x200B;

At the same time I should mention that I am the oldest of three. My brother saw the arguments and decided to be a yesman in order to keep the peace. My parents never gave him shit for anything. He brings his girlfriend to his room and locks the door? Nothing, unlike me who at 18 would risk a huge fight; he is 15 by comparison. My brother looks up to me, and I have taught him all of my pitfalls. He rolls through high school like its nothing. He has an active social life, a great relationship with his parents, amazing grades...I am jealous of him I won't lie, and with how close he has gotten, I have had to keep our relationship professional at best. I help him with school, and thats it. I don't want to become close with him because I feel like he will hurt me like my cousin and grandfather did. My sister is completely the opposite. She is the most lax of the three of us, and gets heckled by my parents. She is 10 and is retreating to the online world like I did. Honestly she is the one I relate to the most. I've protected her so many times and I fear for her as she grows older.

&amp;#x200B;

My best choice is graduate school. I was lucky enough to get into a summer internship in which they told me for my field, they will get me a living stipend. I actually liked the program, I felt happy waking up and going to work. I feel like depending where I go, I could continue my transition more easily, I could date whoever I want and I can be free.

I am moving from Glasgow to Hong Kong for a few months of work (an internship) shortly after the New Year. In total, it will be 17 weeks/119 days to be exact. During my time over there, I will also be taking a 10 day trip to Japan. It's therefore a combination of work and leisure. I also hold a HK overseas resident ID.

I am unsure what type of travel insurance I need to buy (extended single? Multi-annual?), or whether I need it at all. Some people have said yes whilst others believe my company should cover me. I also wonder whether holding a HK ID would give me access to services anyway which would render the travel insurance a bit redundant; however I still need to be insured for any mishaps regarding my flight (cancellation, delays etc) and especially for my trip to Japan. 

I am therefore a little lost on what I should be looking at, where I should be looking, and what to look out for to solve this before I set off! Thanks in advance!"

I belong to India and my wife is going to San Francisco for a 3-month internship at her on-site office.

She will be in San Francisco from December Last week till 8/9th April. I am planning to join her around 23rd March and plan to return back to India around 8th April 2019.

As she will be free from her internship around 29th of March the plan is for me to see in and around San Francisco between 23-29 March and then on 29 we together start our small trip of nearby places and hopefully new york.

&amp;#x200B;

Between 29 March to 7/8th April we wish to cover the following:

1. Las Vegas
2. Los Angeles
3. Yosemite National
4. New York

I need your assistance in the following:

1. How much time should be spent in each of these places?
2. Is it better to fly from SF to LA or LV and just keep using flights or does it make better sense to drive down to atleast LA or Las Vegas from SF and then finally take a flight out to New York.

Are there any other places you would have us cover instead of the ones I mentioned in the given time frame.

Also do you think the given time frame is enough to cover all of this or should we remove one or two places from the agenda?

&amp;#x200B;

Also since my wife would be in SF for 3 months what are some places she can visit during the weekends in those 3 months?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance for any replies.

a0vje8,2,2018-11-27,A Story.,bre4et,Drugs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/a0vje8/a_story/,"Hello people of all ages!
I'm here to share quite an interesting life story of mine, maybe even expecting an advice in the end, or just some support that would be very appreciated.
Firstly, excuse my English, it's far from perfect.
So, my first experience with a drug was when I was about 16 years of age. At that time, I was about 136 kg heavy and we used to smoke some pot with my friend (which I am no longer in contact with) like once a week. We used to have a blast, dance around in my room, have fun etc, etc.
The problem started to grow in my eyes however, when I got home from school internship at Martinique and my eczema, that I had for my whole life has gotten significantly worse. At that time I also broke up with my beloved first girlfriend, and despite making myself happy with the feeling of first earned money and loosing weight the healthy way (I'm 95 kg as of now), running around hospitals made me very depressed and the vision of normal life as I was used to live began to slowly fade away. At that time, I smoked daily on regular basis and I somehow started losing all of my friends wondering why is that so, questioning my life and being sad over everything that occurred in the past. Just one ""friend"" stayed, and it was that guy I used to smoke pot with. One day, he offered Molly to me and after a while of thinking about it, I said that I really wanted to try it anyway, and so I did. This segment of the story is a bit longer, but to get to the point, I quite overused the substance. Not much, but to the point where my depression started to be slightly worse and one day, when I smoked pot as usually, I got so paranoid and questioning so many things, that I had to quit it for good. I managed to quit Molly as well, hit gym and try to be satisfied with the skin I have, but there's one problem I face till this day. Since that time I had that weed experience (and 2 lsd experiences somewhere in that period of time as well) I started being slightly paranoid, questioning many things and being sort of worried, that nobody likes me, also having fear of the future. Basically, I can't get myself to slow down and relax. When I think of weed, my heart feels like a stone and I feel lump in my throat. I can't joke around, I'm too serious and take everything personally. That guy I mentioned had a bad impact on me and when I finally understood that my goal is not to spend my whole life behind pc laughing to 9gag and smoking weed doing bullshit but to develop as a personality, I first tried to help him get on my track of exercising and when that didn't seem to be the way for him, I just completely wiped him out of my life, being afraid of falling back.
THE question for me is, is there anything at least sort of similar that has happened to any of you and how did you solve it?
Also, I don't know if this is against the rules of this subreddit,(if so, I'm deeply sorry and feel free to let me know, I will edit it out) but if any of you want to make me happy, you can visit my SoundCloud and maybe give me a listen and feedback that I strongly miss.

Thank you for reading, and thank you for any responses. Be safe and know when you have enough.

TL;DR: Feeling paranoid in daily life despite quitting every substance, combined with sad thoughts, looking for support and advice."
a0vpob,1,2018-11-27,engaged PhD students- what to do with my undergrad loans? how to save for home? retirement?,cc185212,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/a0vpob/engaged_phd_students_what_to_do_with_my_undergrad/,"Hi r/personalfinance! I've been a long-term lurker and am excited to get some feedback on my and my fiance's personal finance situation. Scroll down for TL;DR

I've been aggressively paying down my student loan debt since 2014 and am finally down to $10k remaining. Fiance is debt-free and we are getting married next fall. **I am looking for advice on a timeline for paying off the $10k, and how to start saving for retirement and a down payment on a house.** I'm tempted to pay off the $10k asap but perhaps saving towards a down payment might be more logical. I'm torn. 

**Background:** I am a 26yo, third year PhD student in the biomedical sciences in a low COL area. My graduate research stipend is $30,500/yr and my fiance is also a third year PhD student in the same field but different university. His stipend is $32k. I will be earning an extra $4k next semester for TAing. Health insurance is covered through our programs with no monthly cost- basically we get free appointments at the student health center, and only pay for the occasional prescription and co-pay at specialists as needed. We share a 2014 car fully paid off. **Post-PhD Plans:** I plan on transitioning into industry positions at a contract research organization (CRO) or biotech company. I am looking at regulatory affairs or project management. I am completing a business certificate through my PhD program where I can take MBA electives through the business school for free. I have a variety of extracurricular and leadership experience on campus outside of basic lab work because I don't want to get stuck being a postdoc earning $45k/yr. My program also offers paid internship programs at local CROs and biotech companies. I expect to make at least $65k coming out of my PhD. We are planning on staying in this area due to low COL. Our other options are to move back to one of our home states to be closer to our families, but we are both from high COL cities so that option isn't as appealing to us. We could get beautiful homes where we currently are for around $200-300k. My fiance has a computational bioinformatics background (Python, R, biostatistics) and could probably get a high paying job in industry but is very passionate about (unfortunately low-paid academic) research so I'll estimate his earning potential anywhere from $60-100k depending on if he stays in academia or goes to industry. Basically what I'm getting at is that for two PhDs, we are rather competitive candidates in our field.

&amp;#x200B;

**Savings:**

Traditional savings account: $25k

Roth IRA: $1k

**Debt:**

Student loans: $10k (in deferment since I'm in grad school, not collecting interest because they are federal subsidized loans, interest rate 3.8% once out of deferment)

**Monthly post-tax combined income:**

$4,100

**Monthly expenses:**

Rent + utilities: $1050

Parking pass: $85

Phone: $75

Groceries: $500 

Gas: $50

Car insurance (paid in full every six months): $75/month

Fun money: $400

Savings towards flights for visiting family/holidays: $160

**Remaining income after expenses:** $1700

**Upcoming expenses to consider:** saving for a second car that we will need after graduating in about 2-3 years, saving for kids in the next 5ish years

**TL;DR** We have $25k saved, $10k in student loan debt not collecting interest for the next 2-3 years, $4k post-tax income, $2k expenses. Should we pay off my student loans ASAP and be done with it? Should we prioritize saving for a down payment on a house over saving for retirement? We will graduate in May or Dec 2021.

So I'm 23, and about to graduate college. I have no debt, and I have a job lined up to start in January, that's going to pay me 75,000 per year (in Idaho).

I've paid my tuition for the past 4.5 years (4 years were about 60% covered by scholarships, so it was always pretty manageable to pay off with my internship savings), so while I have no debt, I don't have a lot saved up. I also made the mistake of not being as frugal last semester.

That's about it for my background. I've been able to save money by living with my parents, and while I'm grateful to them for letting me do that, living with them is starting to feel a little stifling, and I don't get along with them very well. I feel like I need to move out, and some distance would be good for my relationship with them, too.

My 5 year plan definitely entails being able to buy a house that I like enough to love living in, but will eventually be an investment property that I rent out in the future. While I think I'll really like my job, I also want to venture out and do some coding work on the side, such as freelancing or making an app of my own.

In terms of moving out, I'm looking at 1 bedroom apartments, that range between just under 900-1200, but I'm thinking that 1200 is my cap. I would wait until probably mid February to move out, just to save up to move in and get everything I need, comfortably. I'll also be touring apartments between now and when I graduate, just to get a sense of what I like, before it gets harder to do so with work.

Does this seem like a good/viable  plan? What are some things I should be wary about/consider? My  other concerns are that I don't really know the difference between a 401k and a Roth IRA, but I know they're important and potentially a great investment; do people usually get both, or is one better than another? Is it okay if I don't put as much in, for the first few years? Say like, 500-750 a month? What else should I be on the lookout for, in terms of saving and investing?

I want to thank you in advance for reading this, and giving any advice. If there are also general resources that are helpful and easy to understand for a noob, I'd appreciate being referred to that, as well :)"

Basically, all the women there just stay at home and take care of the kids while my precious MB works her butt off running a social media empire and is helping her husband start his own company! Along with ALSO being super involved with the church and her school-aged kids activities! On top of that, DB has to be out of town every other week and she still holds it all down!

It just sucks because I used to attend the same church and they are like that. I actually used to intern for them and was told I couldn't hold my boyfriend's hand even when I was off the clock because it was ""bad"".

I'll be working in DePuy so I'm okay with a house in Passage West, Carrigaline, certain parts of Cobh, Ringaskiddy, and Cork City. Does anyone have any sort of ideas or help to offer?

I appreciate your effort to read my plea and whatever help you can offer.


Thank you all."

a0xnr2,92,2018-11-27,Maharani tried to guilt BIL by outright lying to him and DH tried to gloss over it,BariBahu,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/a0xnr2/maharani_tried_to_guilt_bil_by_outright_lying_to/,"This happened months ago, but you know it definitely was immediately filed under [‘Proof Maharani Isn’t as Innocent as You Say She Is’](https://media.giphy.com/media/SuEFqeWxlLcvm/giphy.gif)... and I can’t wait for a chance to use it when I need it.

DH (FH at the time) and I were giving his youngest brother a ride to their parents’ house when we started discussing logistics surrounding the wedding dates. Our wedding’s main events basically ran Friday through Sunday with smaller shindigs at our homes in the days leading up to it (mainly Wednesday and Thursday). As a result, we told our nearest and dearest (bridal party and close family) that the earlier they could come, the better, but to please try and be in town by Wednesday night at the very latest. South Asian weddings tend to be a week-long party, if not longer, so family and close friends try to be around for the week leading up to the festivities.

Middle BIL was studying out-of-state (flight distance) around the time of the wedding, but planned to be there by Thursday. This still totally worked for us as it was important for his, you know, academic career, and he wouldn’t miss too much at all. Youngest BIL was applying for an internship that would keep him very busy so he could only take off for sure that Friday, although he said he would push to get off on Thursday too. Again, all totally fine by DH and I.

Youngest BIL tells us, however, that Maharani called him and told him that DH was really upset that his brothers weren’t going to be around for his wedding. [Um, what?](https://media.giphy.com/media/GmdFiZtdJtQty/giphy.gif)

DH was not upset in the slightest. **We didn’t even know about youngest BIL’s internship plans.** So he *definitely* said absolutely no such thing.

Both BILs were going to be there for the main three events we were having, and possibly even able to make it to the smaller ones on Wednesday and Thursday. They would simply not be as available to help out around the house in the days leading up to it, but DH totally understood this. (They’re also a little useless anyway so he wasn’t counting on them for much lol.)

[I turned to DH](https://media.giphy.com/media/wUqIw4TRbrfjO/giphy.gif) — half to make a point and half to clear things up in the very, very off chance that he hadn’t mentioned any of this to me — and asked him if he had even talked to his mother about his brothers not being able to make it. Nope. As I suspected, he had never discussed middle BIL's plans with his mother and didn't even have a clue about youngest BIL applying anywhere.

To further my point, I very emphatically (and rhetorically) asked youngest BIL: “So she straight up lied?”

BIL: [“I guess so, yeah.”](https://media.giphy.com/media/AssqAJR8ib5WmCNGOU/giphy.gif)

I looked to DH again, kind of exasperated, and asked ""Why the hell would she make that up?! What, she didn't think you two would talk??"" But of course, he totally shrugged it off as “Yeah, I don’t know why she’d do that.” 

If I was in his place, I would have immediately asked his mother upon arrival why she made this bullshit up. That's what I believe he *should* have done. But he didn’t. And I feel like this says a *lot*. If Maharani was really as innocent and non-manipulative as DH says she is, he would have been surprised and confused as to why she would do this. I got the feeling he wasn’t confused at all, but rather feeling resigned and a bit defensive.

Maharani's #1 weapon against her kids is guilt. (FIL too, actually. They're exhausting together.) About a year ago, DH and I realized that that has been their main method of parenting, and literally a day or two later our couples' therapist pointed out exactly that. But this was one of the very few times I caught her actually *lying* to manipulate her kids onto the guilt train. I *knew* she did it because she's 100% that kind of person, but I'd never seen it myself and DH would never notice/admit to it if she had. The fact that DH was refusing to acknowledge that my intuition had finally been validated was super frustrating.

But it’s okay. I’ll make sure it gets [put to use at some point.](https://media.giphy.com/media/2pjspMQCi70k/giphy.gif)

Just continually burrowing them further further down. 

But sometimes something so small can fill the bottle and send everything just tipping over. 

I’m in my last year of college and I’ve never been one to participate in class, but I have a legitimate issue at my internship I needed to talk about. I raised my hand forever and just kept getting over looked. I’ve never felt more invisible in my life. It took me so much courage to even raise my hand in the first place and to just be ignored. 

Normally I’d be able to brush it off and keep trudging through, but today that was the straw that broke the camels back. 

I cant stop crying and I don’t even know what I’m crying about anymore. All the emotions I bottle in try to forget about. 

A lot of the times I just tell myself to get through the day and get to bed, but I’m so tired of doing that everyday. 

I tried to talk to someone but they just don’t get it. I’ve tried to explain and explain and they just don’t get it.

So many kids come in heart broken and not knowing what to do after a breakup. “Should I text him? Should I talk to them and get closure?” 

It’s crazy because I was in such an unhealthy toxic relationship in high school and I remember thinking the guy was my entire world, and when he left I literally wanted to die. I didn’t know how to let go and kept chasing and chasing someone who was unavailable. This went on for almost 5 years. 

Thanks to this experience, I can spot the signs of these kids handling a breakup poorly and hurting themselves more. I can let them know “hey I’ve been there and it sucks” and guide them towards making better decisions—much better ones than the ones I made in high school. 

My ability to help these kiddos is thanks to my shitty breakup as a teenager, which led to me handling my most recent breakup a thousand times better. What I’m trying to say is, these breakups and painful moments truly are lessons, as cliche as it sounds. How else would you grow? How else would you know what you really want in a partner? You have to fall in order to get back up. 

I’m not over my ex by any means, nor am I perfect. But I do practice what I preach, including feeling sad all over again. We can’t expect to heal in a linear fashion and to do it all perfectly. But next time someone comes to us about their breakup, we’ll know exactly what it feels like and what works/what doesn’t. We’ll go from reaching out for help to helping the ones that need it now. "

Ich habe Anfang dieses Jahres von meinem Arbeitgeber einen Bonus in Form von Aktienoptionen erhalten. Die ersten Anteile ""vesten"" in ein paar Monaten. Die steuerliche Lage ist mir nach Internetrecherche nicht ganz klar.

&amp;#x200B;

Hintergrundinformationen: Mein Arbeitgeber X ist eine deutsche GmbH und Tochterunternehmen einer amerikanischen Firma Y. Die Aktienoptionen sind für Y. X/Y sind in Privatbesitz und durch Risikokapital finanziert. Nach meinem Verständnis ist X eine 100%-ige Tochter von Y und Y hat keine weiteren Tochterunternehmen.

&amp;#x200B;

Erste Frage: Laut Internetrecherche muss ich bei Ausübung der Option Einkommenssteuer (42%) auf den ""Gewinn"" (Differenz zwischen strike price und momentanem Wert) zahlen. Ist das korrekt?

&amp;#x200B;

Zweite Frage: Der momentane Wert der Optionen wird bei uns intern nur inoffiziell kommuniziert, womit ich mich nicht sonderlich wohl fühle. Ist die Firma in irgendeiner Form verpflichtet, regelmäßig offiziell Zahlen zu kommunizieren?

&amp;#x200B;

Dritte Frage: Wenn ich mein Optionsrecht ausübe während die Firma in Privatbesitz ist, wie weise ich dem Finanzamt dann den momentanen Wert nach?

&amp;#x200B;

Und jetzt zum eigentlichen Anstoß für meinen Post :)

&amp;#x200B;

Vierte Frage: Wenn ich heute mein Optionsrecht ausführe und die Aktie später im Wert steigt, zahle ich auf die späteren Gewinne ""nur"" 25% Abgeltungssteuer. Der momentane Wert der Optionen liegt bei &gt;2.5x dem strike price, daher scheint es mir sehr unwahrscheinlich, dass der Wert während meiner Zeit in der Firma unter den strike price fallen wird. Sollte ich in diesem Fall die Aktien so früh wie möglich kaufen, um im Fall von späterer Wertsteigerung weniger Steuern zu zahlen?

&amp;#x200B;

Fünfte und letzte Frage: Wenn ich die Aktien kaufe und später mit Wertverlust verkaufe (relativ zum Kaufwert, nicht zum strike price), kann ich dann den Verlust steuerlich mit anderen Aktiengewinnen verrechnen (d.h. andere Gewinne steuerfrei realisieren)?

However, if you call them 866-205-5973, you can definitely talk to a representative and get the rejection overturned.  What I did was that I asked them why I was rejected, and the person reviewed the file then said I was rejected because my credit age is not that lengthy which is why the system automatically rejected me.  He then asked to pull my credit report which I agreed to, then he approved me b/c of the credit score and gave me a 2500 credit limit.  For any college students or anyone lurking for this card or was rejected! Do call it's definitely worth it.

Just a little bit of background about me, current college senior, with a half decent credit score (around 750), and had my BOA cash back card for about 4 years.  I told them about my job offer as well as my income from internships + my income from my family properties that I manage.

All ordinary matter in the universe is **comprised of chemical elements**. An investment portfolio is no different, with a **tapestry of asset classes, factors, strategies, tools and techniques serving as the raw materials.**

The science of chemistry has long struck me as wonderfully analogous to portfolio construction. So much so that a few years ago I decided to take a trip down memory lane and revisit high school chemistry class. I thought it would be cool to visualize the taxonomy of diversification by creating a different kind periodic table, one with investments as the elements. With the help of our summer intern at the time (shout-out to Lea!), I put it together, made it look all pretty and…let it sit dormant in a file folder on my computer for five years.

Fast forward to this summer as our firm began the process of documenting and codifying our investment philosophy. I thought it would be the perfect opportunity to dust of the old periodic table, make a few modifications, and include it in the piece.

We started by bucketing each “element” into various color-coded categories.

[](https://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/inline-images/Snip20181117_2.png?itok=_oUOwuxS)

Each element was then assigned a primary objective and (in most cases) a secondary objective, using the seven options listed below:

Here’s an example of how to interpret the boxes in the table:

And now, the pièce de résistance…

_(Click to enlarge)_I fully expect that there are a handful of omissions, or perhaps a few areas where one might flat-out disagree with how I’ve laid things out. This was not meant to be 100% exhaustive, nor was it meant to be indicative of what one of our portfolios looks like. What I hoped to accomplish was to:

  - **Demonstrate the breadth of the investable universe that exists.** In an environment when many investors anchor to – and base expectations off of – U.S. stocks and bonds, it’s important to remember that the “market” extends well beyond the Dow or the S&amp;P500.
  - **Reinforce the [principle](https://bpsandpieces.com/2018/10/24/a-matter-of-principles/) that no investment is an island. **The ways in which different investments influence and interact with one another matters more than the individual line items themselves. While chemical elements are essential to life on earth, it is only when they form compounds that the magic truly happens.
  - **Stress the importance of knowing what you own and why you own it.** By assigning primary and secondary objectives to each investment, we can better understand the risk and return drivers of our portfolios. What works for one person might cause an explosion in the chemistry lab for another.

**_Compounds_** are the unique substances formed as the result of two or more chemical elements combining with each other. _**Compounding**_ is the long-term result of finding an investment mix aligned with your goals, objectives and risk preferences – and sticking with it through good times and bad. _(Terrible pun intended)_

a11hvp,5,2018-11-27,Next to Impossible to work as a law graduate and certificate restrictions don't help,Ididntwritethis2,auslaw,https://www.reddit.com/r/auslaw/comments/a11hvp/next_to_impossible_to_work_as_a_law_graduate_and/,"  

A request for advice and perspective. Also a bit of a vent.

I'm finding it rather impossible to find work as a law graduate. I graduated with a Law and Marketing degree from a local university and completed my Practical Legal Training about a year ago. I have some experience working admin as a volunteer but that’s it.

It seems that the employment prospects for law grads are abysmal. 

Any job ads posted online want 2- 3 years’ experience. 

The kind of law firms that hire graduates with no experience, hire from their internship or clerkship programs, which I would have had to apply for while still doing my undergrad degree and work there during the holidays. This wasn’t really an option for me since I was either doing unrelated but paid work during the university holidays, or I was overseas visiting friends and family.

From what I’ve seen, the only people from my university that got law jobs straight out of law school are those who either knew a lawyer personally and had an ‘in’, or those who had the time to do summer internships AND got ‘good grades’ through questionable academic practices. (Not that my grades were bad, I just didn’t want to go down the path of cheating with those people and get caught).

Applied for 50 jobs while doing PLT, and got nothing in the law industry. My resume isn’t terrible and I have some relevant side-qualifications that make me somewhat more employable.

I did get an offer, while doing my PLT, from a small law firm, saying that they would be willing to discuss me doing the required supervised training with them, and then look at setting me up in my own office location. The problem with this is that even after I graduate as a lawyer and get admitted, I would still need to work supervised for 18 months for 2 years, and I didn’t feel comfortable working by myself as it may risk breaching the supervised work requirement and I could be banned from working as a lawyer altogether. I brought this up and never heard back from the place.

I finished my final legal PLT course and applied at 30 more volunteer legal centres but nobody was looking even for volunteers, unless they had 2-3 years’ experience as a lawyer. The best I got was ‘We’re primarily looking for an administration person but some legal work may be made available’.

I then got work at a boutique insurance broker place, where I’ve been working quite happily. Great culture, great working conditions, but it seems my qualifications are being wasted. I do spend a lot of time reviewing expert evidence (engineer reports, plumber reports) about insurance claims, and writing submissions for the Financial Ombudsman Service, so it’s somewhat relevant, but at the same time, I could make the same money managing at a McDonalds.

I’ve been told that, the current place I’m working at is interested at bringing their legal work in-house, if I were to get qualified as a lawyer, and have me do it. This would be a great option for me as the place is growing, I love working there and the work would be much more interesting than filling out conveyancing forms all day as a desk drone. The only problem is that even if I get a practicing certificate, I can’t work unsupervised for at least the next 18 months. 

I’ve been told I can take a day off to volunteer at legal aid 1 day per week, to get my supervised practice hours up, but it would take over 7 years of doing this to reach the equivalent of the 18 month full-time work requirement this way.  
 

So it seems my options are:

1. Quit my current job for the next 2 years, bang my head against the wall of employment seeking until I can somehow get something, work for the 2 years to get my unrestricted certificate, and then see if I can go to my current place to work as a lawyer for them. This seems like a bad option because it would mean I would have to quit the current place I’m working at, and this would piss them off since they’d need to find a replacement for me and train the replacement. There’s only a couple of people where I’m working at now who can do my job in the meantime and they all do other things so it’s not like I can just leave for 2 years. Plus If I worked at a place full-time for 2 years, then left the moment I got the right to work unrestricted, that would look bad as well.

2. Quit my current job and try to find permanent work as a lawyer. Again, the employment prospects seem abysmal. I could perhaps get a job as a conveyancer, but from what I’ve heard, once you get into conveyancing and all your experience is there, it’s next to impossible to get a job in another field – and why would I want to work as a conveyancer for the rest of my life for 55k a year, when I can just stay where I am now, or find a job in Marketing. Maybe there are some government jobs out there but I haven’t seen many on job boards.

3. Stay where I am now, reviewing insurance decisions, writing reports for the ombudsman, but not really doing legal work. The other issue with this, is now that my current employers know that I have the legal degree, and I know the ins-and-outs of how the company and their associates work, they are quite interested in having me do proper legal work for them at some point in the future and I think they expect me to do something about it. The only problem is the damn practicing restrictions.

Any constructive advice would be appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

PS. I do know the reason for the restrictrions on practicing certificates; stopping inexperienced incompetency etc. etc."

Im a 26yo male, got my engineer degree a year ago and moved to the US for a great job. I met this girl (25F) who studies on the same area on Tinder. We went out for 3mo and it was INTENSE. I felt like I knew her for my whole life, sex was amazing and it was sort like we could read each others minds

She finished her internship and got a job on the other side of the country so we broke up a month ago. And I can't get over her.

Now this is where things get complicated. 

1) I have never had a relationship before. During high school and college I had hookups more out of initiative of girls - I suppose I look good enough although I hate my looks and 

2) I was sexually abused when I was 5yo by a relative who brought me to a room where he had some prostitutes and had oral sex perfomed on me and made me watch as he had sex with them afterwards

Needless to say sex is tough for me. I hooked up and had sex during college more to keep apperances and so people wouldnt think that there was something wrong with me then out of enjoyment - mostly both sex and hookups made me anxious.

Went to therapy for 3mo before moving out of my country and managed to talk about it for the first time in my life. And when I met this girl - it was the first time I actually enjoyed sex. It didnt feel like a obligation or a performance act. It felt like a physical manifestation of intimacy

Great stuff, honestly

Maintaining our relationship would be impossible but I cant stop thinking that she was my only chance to have a ""normal"" girlfriend. I feel Im too damaged to recover from this breakup and that no one will actually accept me since, well, girls notice when you are sexually distant.

Big rant, sorry about that. But I do want to know what I can do to make this go away. I felt happy and complete w her and I dont think I'll meet anyone like her

I am walking a codependence path that I know it will destroy a relationship and I dont know what to do"
a12oni,17,2018-11-27,Big 4 Staff 1 Concerns - Need to hear your thoughts,InformalDetail,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/a12oni/big_4_staff_1_concerns_need_to_hear_your_thoughts/,"Hello - 

I have read multiple posts on here and finally decided to write my own instead of trying to identify in other people's stories. I started in Big 4 six months ago, in a Top 10 metro area. I knew as I was accepting the offer, that audit is not an area I am truly interested in, but I could see a lot of benefits to starting in Big 4. I've never had anything recognizable in my resume (good internship experience, magna cum laude, and academic awards/scholarships - but no brand name), so I am happy to put a well-known firm name on my resume, and I am also not a US citizen, so not any firm is willing to consider hiring me. Basically Big 4 was my only option, if I wanted public accounting. 

I had a rougher start than expected. Things were going fine until a few weeks into the job, I started testing an account that took too long... I spent a total of 3 weeks on that procedure, with 2 of the first days updating a support tracker that someone before me had started... a waste of time that even my senior couldn't figure out yet insisted I do it. This testing procedure taught me to communicate more clearly where I am at and what issues I am facing, so I started drafting notes to myself in order to better communicate with my senior. I started waking up early not to study for the CPA exam, but to make sure I understand what I want to ask questions about and to seem prepared when my senior asked for updates. I was stressed out, to the point that one morning I went to the office before everyone only to start crying. 

I thought I would have a terrible review, but basically my review was that I need to improve on my time of delivery and take ownership of my work. One of the problems with the second area of improvement is that my senior is a micromanager, so it's quite difficult to take ownership in that situation. 

Then I had a short but very stressful busy season and I thought I was doing much better because some stress helps me stay organized. I had some rough moments during that busy season, including when my senior took over one of my tasks in order to expedite the process but two days later told me to finish it myself. My senior is the busiest member of the team, so I also learned to ask other seniors when I had questions. After busy season, my senior acknowledged that I had improved, but that I remain inefficient; he pointed out I have a good attitude and would stay as long as I need to get the work done. 

My second team is so much better - organized, clear expectations, I work with several seniors and no one is overworked. The team originally had me assigned for a month for a special project. We worked longer hours, but I was finishing my tasks on time and feeling pretty good. Then this team requested my time for a few more months, and my performance has been in decline since then. I am clearly over budget on one of my tasks, and when I started it, I thought I would finish under budget. The main reasons I am behind is that I got mixed opinions on what needs to be done, so that slowed me down, and I have had a lot of back and forth with the client. And most importantly, I lost my motivation. With studying for the CPA, I don't feel like spending time outside of the office to finish work. Some of these areas and balances are so insignificant it is difficult to worry about.  And I found out that after I finish with this team, I will be back with the first team - so more stress, unnecessarily long hours, unclear instructions, poor communication. I may never be back to work with this second team, but I feel as if I had already messed things up... (we're talking being like 10 hours over, but failing to communicate it properly until I was asked). 

While I am not passionate about audit, I don't want to be seen as mediocre. Sometimes I feel like it is not something to worry about, but other times (like tonight), I worry what my performance is saying about my work ethic, my communication skills, what these people will say about me when I leave, whether I would have a hard time transitioning outside of Big 4 due to my performance currently. I have had situations when I thought I would lose my job and/or not get promoted. One of my managers on a previous accounting internship I did told me she can tell I am not happy and we should talk. It is just very surprising that I am not doing well, performance, motivation, energy wise etc. I am known as a very capable and driven person. When I was on the first engagement, it made sense to not like it since it is a very poorly rated engagement. But now I've been with this wonderful team and I am still struggling. It just took longer for those issues to surface. So what is this telling me? What should I do? Thank you!"

Used to be able to do side gigs like uber but after a speeding ticket they revoked my privilege to drive for them so I had to get a restaurant job.

She is also in America on an internship so she is locked in on a fixed amount of money till all her powerwork is filled. We met last year then decided to get married this year. 

Throughout the year we’ve been making it each month a little harder than the last and finally with this wedding coming up makes it a little harder. We’re not tryin To have a big wedding or anything and trying to keep the cost super cheap so we can afford rent. I wanna give her the best I can but It’s hard when I can’t work enough to even pay own bills let alone Christmas gifts for her or my family.

More or less I feel ashamed that I can’t contribute as much as I think I should. 

Really anything would help. Just wanna give her the best.

I hate Economics so much. I hate moving numbers around on paper and talking about infinitesimal units of output and two-person economies instead of creating anything real. I hate competing for analyst positions with Business majors whose studies are less rigorous yet more prestigious and more practical. I enjoy Computer Programming but I suck at it, and even if I didn’t suck at it, I can’t pursue it because it’s too late to transfer into the engineering program at my university. I looked at the other majors within my own program but none of them interest me. I dread all my classes except programming, but even there I just feel so inferior because everywhere I look is some whiz who finishes the assignments in half the time that I take. I know I could work harder but I have no motivation and I’ve forgotten how to persevere. All I want to do is sleep. Sometimes I don’t eat until 5 pm. I’ve been posting in this subreddit since 2016.

I never thought he would keep something from me or deliberately mislead me. But I’m not the girl he fell in love with anyway. He had a crush on the girl on the school bus who was always smiling and got straight As and was president or captain of every club she was in. Now I’m a below average student who never has anything new to share or any passions to talk about. I am behind in all my classes. I haven’t landed an internship. I’ve lost all my friends.

I tend to overthink things. Because of this. I'm trying to only state facts of the situation.
I moved in with my boyfriend of 2 years so we can save money during college. Mostly everything is well aside from what Im about to ask about.

We both work. He works an office internship 4hrs a day, 3 days a week, $12.5h. I work at a retail store for at least 5hrs-7.5hrs a day, 4 days a week, $11.5h. 
We both go to the same school. But different degrees. Me being Graphic Design, him, a buisness computer communications major. We both are fully covered by scholarships and fafsa money because we are first gen minority college students. 
He comes from a home where his grandmother is living with them, cooks, does the laundry, cleans. I come from a home where Mom and Dad are always working, kids have to do what they can while they are away. In result, I can cook/he can't, I can fold laundry/he rather not, I get up earlier and go home later, assignments cost money for me + textbooks/he only needs to buy textbooks. 
Earlier this week, we noticed the pile of dishes and the sink haven't been touched. Its finals week for me (his is the week after) and I'm really stressed. I voiced this to him and he said if I had extra time from my projects I can do the dishes. I agreed and got to working on projects. During this time, he went to school, visited family, and got a haircut. Which I was okay with. I greeted him when he got home, he was very happy to see me but suddenly got a bit annoyed when he stepped into the kitchen. Keep in mind, I wasnt just sitting around. You can clearly see my 3d model on the computer and art supplies on the desk as I got out of my seat. I had texted him 3 hours before that I didnt think i would get to the dishes. He looked at the msg but didnt directly ask about it. So I thought I was in the clear. We had planned for a couple hours set aside for late night grocery shopping (only time we have free) and on the ride there, he said that he expected the dishes to be clean. And that it was typical of me. I admit that I get too tired and busy the past times where the dishes were piling up. But previous to this night, he had never asked me personally to do them. Now that he has asked, i made sure to inform him that it was not possible during this time. He is a very nice guy, caring, patient and a bit on the logical, stoic side. But I get upset when he expects me to drop everything to do something like fold his clothes or clean. Especially as he plays video games with his friends online. (I dont mind cooking because or else he starves...) but how can i bring this up to him without getting him to sound defensive about it? 

 Ive tried to talk to him about stuff like this before. I go in strong but I start to lose courage once he says ""So it's my fault?"" Im not looking to belittle or shift blame. I know what I didn't do but I just want more communication on how he makes me feel. I just hate that he thinks it's okay to act passive about it, get disappointed/annoyed at me. In the end,I love him and I hate that I let him down. I dont want to feel like a bad housewife, I want to be his equal. I'm tired. I just want to feel okay during this stressful time. Anything is help. Thank you to all that read my dumb rant.

a15gk9,5,2018-11-28,[BREED] Looking for help to find a good breed for me!,ProHitman47,dogs,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/a15gk9/breed_looking_for_help_to_find_a_good_breed_for_me/,"\*\*Introduction\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

1)Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

&amp;#x200B;

\* I had two dogs in total, one died when was 4\~5 years (not sure because i rescued her from the street so i wasnt sure about her age ate the time) and one with 9 weeks old died with tick disease (5 months ago i think), and some other dogs that my parents/family had but i dont had memory of or had any connection with.

&amp;#x200B;

2)Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]?

&amp;#x200B;

\* I dont, but all the dogs i had i rescued them, alwas wanted one with a single breed and not a lot mixed like the two i had, but i dont mind adopting again.

&amp;#x200B;

3)Describe your ideal dog.

&amp;#x200B;

\* I like big dogs, that can be a goof and serious on the right situations, doesnt need to be a guard dog but also doesnt ask the intruder to rub his belly, and have a personality of its own.

&amp;#x200B;

4)What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

&amp;#x200B;

\* I had been searching a lot about breeds, there are some of them that got my eye but only a couple i fully searched about, \*Australian Cattle Dog , \*Rottweiler,\*Husky , \*German Shepard , \*Border Collie and \*Pit bull

&amp;#x200B;

5)What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

&amp;#x200B;

\* The trainings i have in mind are more behavioral, doing some tricks (like giving pawn,roll and etc).

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Care Commitments\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

&amp;#x200B;

\* Beside having to work i spend most of my time at home, so maybe 2h\~3h per day and a lot of belly rubs on the rest of the day.

&amp;#x200B;

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

&amp;#x200B;

\* I plan on use the 2\~3h a day to go walk,play fetch or other toys to keep his energy down, i dont know any dog park on my region but if it have it will be in the list too

&amp;#x200B;

8)How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

&amp;#x200B;

\* I plan on brush him regularly every week and willing to do everything, just trimming the hair i would rather leave to a professional.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

9)What size dog are you looking for?

&amp;#x200B;

\* A medium to big dog (most preferable a big one)

&amp;#x200B;

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

&amp;#x200B;

\*I dont mind much about barking, but i would rather have a more quiet dog ( the dog i mentioned that died with 4\~5 years was poisoned by my old neighbor because she bark A LOT, wich i dint mind the bark,but im very away from him now), and not so much slobber.

&amp;#x200B;

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

&amp;#x200B;

\* I will only use a leash when i take him for a walk, at home will be free and when visits come by i will like to train him to behave and not have to lock him on the back of the house.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

&amp;#x200B;

\* I accept a independent dog but i wold like one that fells confortable with everyone, so i would enjoy any or a mix of these two

&amp;#x200B;

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

&amp;#x200B;

\* I have no preferance on that

&amp;#x200B;

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

&amp;#x200B;

""So are we clear on this point?"" you squeak, your large glasses sliding down your shrunken nose before pirching precariously on the tip.

""Aww! That is sooo adorable!"" She giggles as you try to push them back up with your blouse sleeve covered hand.

""I'm not adorable! I'm your boss!"" You snap, craning your neck up at her to emphasise the point.

The look on her face as she looks down at you is one someone would have at a little chihuaha that thought it was an attack dog.

Just to reinforce the point, your glasses lose the little balance they had and clatter to the floor at her feet.

""Dammit..."" your little high pitched voice sighs as you wobble in your over-sized shoes.

Gingerly, you start to bend down - but a larger hand beats you to it and grasps the glasses.

You watch as they pass your eyes and are raised high above your head.

""Give those back!"" You squeal, reaching for them but frustrated as they stay high above you and firmly out of reach.

""I'm in charge here! You can't treat me this way!"" You whine as you struggle in vain to take them from the grinning younger woman, who holds them out of your reach with ease.

""This is hilarious!"" She giggles again as you continue your futile struggle.

""That's it!"" You snap, red faced, ""You give those back this instant or... or... you're fired!""

The intern looks at you seriously for a moment before bursting into laughter.

At that instant, you feel small... you're the CEO but nobody seems to be taking you seriously! You just fired this young woman... but instead your anger does nothing, leaving you feeling impotent!

""That's sooo cute! Are you a gwumpy little bawss?"" She sticks her bottom lip out mockingly at you.

She can't talk to you this way! You're the big boss around here! You pride yourself on being the one others look up to... yet, you seem to be the one looking up now...further and further up...

Interested in a scenario where you lose power and authority? Where you go from being on charge and respected to the humiliation of being helpless and too small to be taken seriously? 

Drop me a message if this sounds of interest... :-)"
a179od,3,2018-11-28,AITA for choosing myself when friend is having a hard time?,needmypeace,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a179od/aita_for_choosing_myself_when_friend_is_having_a/," I am doing a fulltime internship to graduate, doing homework in the evening and dealing with the aftermath of ptsd. I take it slow, plan one or two times a week to meet friends and family. If I do more then I have energy for, my body protests by a panic attack and throwing up. I watch myself, am doing fine 90% of the time and have started therapy again cause I noticed I still have triggers I would like to overcome. I can manage this internship this way because I take it slow, they assist me, are very understanding and I can work from home if I want. 

One of the things that trigger me is unexpected touching and someone claiming my attention or demanding my time at the moment when I am already very busy or in a not phone friendly environment. That is just rude behaviour, in my opinion.. 

This one friend kept pushing it, called me multiple times while I was driving, making me think there was a death (family of mutual friend was hospitalised day before). I tried to call her back but couldnt get a hold of her. She had said in a groupchat to call her immediatly. So I blurted out, ‘glad someone is not death, I am very busy today’(as I was having a busy day with family) when she did answer over chat. Apparantly she was having a really bad time herself but had already planned to meet up with mutual friend and spoken on the phone to two other people.Before I left home I had told them about my busy day and that I wouldnt be available. 

This friend has pushed my boundaries multiple times, she is one of those people thats hit you out of the sudden in a playful way. I asked her to not do that to me cause I can react badly to being touched like that, even from friends or family. She would have heated arguments when she and boyfriend where over(at my place), made me and everyone uncomfortable so asked her to tone it down til they got home or take it outside. I dont like being around people screaming at eachother, I dont like fights, I freeze or panic as I am still working on it. I am not telling her how to live her life, I just asked her to keep me in mind as I work on myself.

Now she and boyfriend broke up, she expects a lot more from me and mutual friend. Today we had an argument over the phonecalls and my reaction and she said that I abandond her and is hurt. And that I put her problem in a bad context by asking if someone had died. I am having a hard time seeing it from her point of view. All I want is peace and quiet and graduate succesfully. I feel like I didnt abandon her because I knew she had spoken to 3 other people and I did try calling her back. She said it was unclear to her that I wasnt available, I dont know how that was unclear cause mutual friend did know this from the same group chat and I told her personally as well. She then said I got more from the friendship then she did and I have no idea what that means? I did not tell my friends most of what happend to me, when I felt rock bottom depressed I got help from professionals or called my assigned buddy. So I never ‘claimed’ someones time and would never do so.

I cannot tell her how to deal with this break up, I do wish she was more independent, it would be better for her own happiness as well. I am not saying she cant grieve or talk to me about the break up, she does and I have seen her two times the week of the phonecall to let her vent. One of those times I got a panic attack she witnessed.

I tried to not get in on the argument as I was at work at the moment and didnt have time. I tried to be as nice as possible but lost it when she started making those weird accusations and telling me what I should have done.I know I am not as good as a friend as she needs for now, but I do all I can.

So now she has broken up the friendship, honostly I dont feel that bad. But id like to know if I did the right thing, my vision is blurred cause I know I can be tense over the boundary thing, its just what I need to do. Am I a bad friend?"

Ive been looking for work around Lisbon since I got my degree (sociology) and so is everyone else. I even continued with a masters program just because it was /some/thing productive I could do before I had to deal with the economy. The employment situation here is so bad, the only ""jobs"" are unpaid internships that dont even pay for public transportation and dont lead into paid jobs. I wouldnt even turn down an internship if it was within walking distance or paid travel costs so Im not depleting what little money my family has in order to work for free but no such luck.
My parents insist that all I need to do is pound pavement and ask door to door for work until a job is offered, but 1.) That doesnt work in this day and age and 2.)a lot of other people already do that also. 

Compounding my problem, I also have a weak heart and I can't handle physically demanding work like many of my peers who have already left the country for manual labor jobs, so unskilled agricultural or construction work is also out.
My ever optimistic girlfriend insists that somewhere there's jobs that can use someone with my computer, research and language skills (I'm self taught native equivalent in US english) but I have no idea how to even go about looking for jobs in other countries in the EU i can legally work in, or finding visa sponsoring positions elsewhere, much less how a 28 year old that has no formal job history would even have a chance of being hired for one of them. Good office jobs dont come easily (or at all, around here). 
I dont want to get rich. I just want enough to live humbly by myself and maybe not so hand to mouth I can set aside a very meager savings for the future. I dont want the world, just a job that affords me a life of any kind. I don't care if it's in my degree field at all. 
-where should I be looking?
-how should I be marketing my skills on my CV?
-How do I get a job with no work experience and no internships around? 
-What skills can I learn online that might make me more hirable? My girlfriend suggested picking up a third language (spanish?) or trying out a programming language. Another friend suggested learning computer programs many companies need but most people dont know. (No details on WHICH programs I should learn however.)

Part of the reason for that is because all of the existing applications that are out there are, well, extremely expensive to integrate with our ERP. Additionally, due to the way we operate with our order and picking process, i think some of the existing programs would either be cumbersome or require customizations. I would like to move to an android based barcode scanner (Eg. Zebra). 

I consider myself a poorly educated hack when it comes to programming. I can write SQL and some C++ stuff, and I have an interest in learning java and maybe C#. I'm not really on a timeline, if it gets done it gets done sort of thing. I would not necessarily be looking to sell whatever i conjure up. Most of the time investment would come after hours. If i get it done by this time next year i'd consider it a win. 

Alternatively, I am considering hiring someone to write it. In there interest of saving money (because, what could go wrong? /s) I wouldn't mind throwing a bone to an intern or newer developer (preferably somewhat close to my location) looking to get an app into their resume. I would be ok spending somewhere in the $2-4k range and expect to have a working prototype in 3-4 months. I could help/work with the SQL portion. I would handle the final integration with the ERP.

**The software company has suffered a data breach that would have compromised all the domain accounts**

OSIsoft has issued an alert on a security breach affecting employees, interns, consultants and contractors, as reported by information security and digital forensics specialists from the International Institute of Cyber Security.

The company offers real-time data management solutions; its main product is the open enterprise infrastructure, PI System, which allows connecting data, systems and people based on sensors. OSIsoft customers use PI System to collect, analyze, and view data to improve their internal processes, according to experts in cybersecurity and digital forensics.

Malicious actors used stolen credentials to remotely access the company’s systems, as reported in the company’s incident notification, filed with the California Attorney General Office.

“OSIsoft is experiencing a security incident that could affect employees, interns, consultants and contractors. Stolen credentials were used to remotely access OSIsoft’s computers”, the company mentioned in the [data breach](https://www.securitynewspaper.com/2018/11/22/data-breaches-in-schools-how-should-an-academic-institution-report-a-security-incident/) notification.

“OSIsoft’s [digital forensics](http://www.iicybersecurity.com/digital-forensic.html) experts alerted the IT team about anomalous actions in the company’s systems. Our information security service provider has collected direct evidence of the attack, as well as access theft, a situation involving 29 computers and 135 accounts. The evidence has allowed us to conclude that all OSI domain accounts have been affected”.

Threat actors would have accessed the OSI domain logon account name, email address, and user password.  Although Active Directory (AD) uses cryptographic protection methods, users’ personal credentials may have been compromised.

Thanks to the notification that the company presented to the California prosecutor, it has been possible to know that the company is not exactly aware of when the incident was presented, since OSIsoft has stated that it occurred sometime between March 23 2017 and July 26 2018.

The company is still investigating the security breach, meanwhile, has developed a risk mitigation strategy.

OSIsoft is re-establishing committed passwords, also encourages affected users to change their passwords for other platforms if they are the same passwords they use for their OSI account, and invite the user to inform the enterprise on suspicious activities, as well as disabling or restricting remote access and file sharing functions on users’ devices."
a18dwc,4,2018-11-28,I want to change my name and would like some feedback,Nycprodigy,asktransgender,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/a18dwc/i_want_to_change_my_name_and_would_like_some/,"Hey trans peeps. I wanted to talk to you all about name changes. My parents kicked me out of their house in September cuz homophobyuh.

I've been managing my resources pretty well since then and have been receiving support from all over. So I promise I'm doing okay at the moment. But I recently had someone call me Mr. Familysurname. My parents are absolute narcissists and nightmares to be around. I've cut contact with them and being referred to by their surname set me off a little so I know it's not a name I want to keep later in life. 

So my best friend and I have been workshopping a couple of last names that would fit me and wouldn't sound regrettably embarassing after a while. I thought of some real out there ones like Bartholomew, Bronze, Best, Bolden, Bearden. My best friend gave them all her most severe eyerolls, but I promise you they got much better. And coincidentally both me and her decided on the perfect last name at separate times. After writing some of my ideas on paler over and over, I've been writing one for about a week and change. It sticks like glue. Makes my smile. Brings up times where I've felt determined, empowered, loved, and simply golden. That's a feeling I want to carry to my grave, not in spite of life's up and downs, but in acknowledgement of them.

I told her last night what I want to change my name to and she got real sad. I got worried and started picking her brain a little before it clicked and I realized that she must have thought of it too. I asked her if I was right and she admitted that she thought of the same name but didn't tell me earlier because it didn't start with a B. I laughed and told her it's okay. I was just so excited that we both had the same banging idea. At first I said she should be excited too but figured she could be sad because I think both our reactions were beautiful and already adds more depth to the name. She started expressing all the reasons why she thought that name would be a perfect fit and I honestly couldn't stop smiling. It was everything I was thinking and then some.

My new name will mean a lot to me and I want to build on that meaning the more I use it. I've looked into different naming cultures and have seen what choosing or changing a name means to different people, what the process is like post-marriage, and what it means for trans peeps, especially when it comes to being deadnamed. I empathize with a lot of the pride people have in their names and how haunted they can feel by their past because of a name that was assigned to them.

Right now I'd be changing my name at a kinda convenient/kinda inconvenient time. My driver's license, passport, and ID all expire by the end of this year and need to be renewed. That gives me a great opportunity to just get the name change over with in one go. Also I currently live in NY and all my IDs reflect that.

However I know the process will take some weeks and while I have a job currently, I'm still in the process of applying for more career and academic-oriented opportunities like internships. On top of that I will be graduating this December and  I'm waiting for confirmation on whether I'll have my tuition reimbursed from my school.

In addition, I've researched that the process of amending docs like my birth certificate, social, etc. could range between $300 and $500 if I'm lucky. I would be able to pay that off without much problem but the cheap ass in me knows that's good money that could be going towards groceries.

I anticipate that the next career opportunity I'm applying for would be a more long term investment and the academic internship I want to do (if I get accepted this time) would end in the summer.

This community was very helpful to me before so I'm reaching out again. Hope you all don't mind.

Would you all say it's wiser to wait until after the summer to start the name change process or get it out the way now before I end up having more important things under my old name that I'll have to amend?

Also, (if you have) what did changing your name feel like to you and how do you feel about your new name now?

Thanks in advance for any thoughts or feedback"

I am a 22F living with my  grandparents. I moved in with them last year after living with my mom hoping for a better home life. It has gotten to the point where I cannot  handle the pressure from them and I feel suffocated.

&amp;#x200B;

Background:  My family has gone through a lot together. My grandparents and my mom  don’t have a good relationship due to her drug and alcohol abuse when I  was younger. I was taken away from my mom to live with my grandparents  at 10. As I grew into my teenage years, we would have blow up fights and  it got so bad that we decided it would be better if I moved in with my  mom again. These moves were literally across countries, that's how bad  it was. My mom and I were good friends but she was unstable and made  poor decisions. When I was becoming an adult, I felt like the better I  did and the happier I was, personally and academically, the more my mom  resented me. One day she was very mean to me and basically told me to  move out. I contacted my grandparents (who I had a great relationship  with and took flights to visit twice a year), and asked to move in with  them and go to college in their city.

&amp;#x200B;

At  first, it was great. It was similar to when you first start dating  someone and they have their best face on, but their flaws start coming  to the surface later on. I am a very authentic person, good or bad. I  cannot be someone I am not. I was very honest about what I want and who I  am. What I want is to do well in school, do internships to build my  resume, spend time with my friends and do what everyone else is doing,  and have time with my family. At first, when I first moved in I was very  depressed, I had no friends and I cried almost every day. I felt like  my family didn’t have any sympathy for that because as far as they were  concerned, my job was to get my degree and be with my family.

&amp;#x200B;

As  the year went on, I felt more judgement when my life developed into  what I wanted. When I got my first internship, I was asked how I will  handle that with school and my job instead of a congrats. Recently, I  reconnected with friends and I've been happier than ever! But they think  my priorities aren’t straight and I just want to party. I work 30 hours  a week with my job and internship, not including school. I feel like I  am constantly reminded of what I do wrong. Recently it was thanksgiving  break and I went out with my friends on a Wednesday and Saturday, and  because I didn’t join them for church in the morning, they were livid.  And I have a curfew of 12 at 22! I am constantly thinking all day about  what they are thinking and it just keeps getting worse. I always feel  like they are mad at me.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been  threatened that if I continue this behavior (being with my friends etc),  they will take away my car and only let me use it for work and school. I  plan on moving out soon with my friend. I'm not sure how I will be able  to financially manage this but I want to cut monetary ties with my  family. If I need a student loan, fine. The pressure of them paying for  my school, my car and even the nagging about my phone data is getting  too much. I’ve talked about moving out over this year a lot. But even  with my phone, I’ve offered to pay for my own plan and they say no. They  want to control everything.

&amp;#x200B;

I  go to church for them every Sunday, have dinner with them, go to the  symphony. I really am trying my best to be successful, happy and make  them proud. I love them a lot, I really do. But sometimes I just want to  cry from how stressed I am. What I want to know is: am I really that  bad of a granddaughter, are my priorities not straight, are they right,  and will they take away all support from me when I move out?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: My grandparents that I live with are controlling to the point I am stressed everyday and scared to tell them about my social activities. They believe I party too much. If you were in my situation, what would you do?

I frequent other subreddits like r/jobs, so job hunting woes aren't just relevant to me. Regardless, job hunting really takes its toll. I feel exhausted and like a waste of space these days.

I graduated last year in June. I did a couple internships during college, then a summer internship post graduation at a non-profit.

A few months later I landed a copywriting job at a startup. The start-up was a shit show. Sorry, but there were so many issues. Once we had a client come in who we later found out through research had been arrested for sexual extortion. Another time there was a drunk guy passed out in the women's bathroom. We got paid once a month, and it was often late a few days or even weeks. And I never got paid for my last month there, despite my boss saying ""money is coming in"" all the time. My co-workers have (had?) it worst though, they haven't been paid since April for all these months of work. I think the start-up is dead at this point. But anyway, the startup job lasted about 6 months. I love writing and got some blogs posts published (unfortunately not under my name).

Then this year in May I had secured non-profit job. It was a job that was 2-in-1, both a development assistant and an executive assistant to my boss who was the CEO. It was exciting to me because I really want to be a development professional/grant writer. I didn't really get any form of training for this job, so had to learn about the orgs donor database, how to event plan for galas, how to write/edit donor letters, how to send Save the Date emails, etc. My boss was a little hard to understand too because they often kept things/ideas closed up inside but expected you to do the right task at the right time. I asked questions as needed and tried not to jump to conclusions or do assignments without as much knowledge as possible.

I got laid off in August because my boss felt the job was too advanced for me. I didn't really like how it happened; my boss wasn't even there to tell me this. My boss instead told my co-workers and my co-workers told me I was getting laid off. But whatever, getting laid off is getting laid off. I tried my best to succeed but the expectations didn't match my experience.

Since August I've been looking for a new job to call mine.

I do volunteer a few hours a week right now for an ESL school for adults, so that keeps me occupied. I did a lot of volunteer work for the past decade or so. This year I had some grant writing volunteer gigs and learned on my own about LOIs, grant proposal drafts, etc. Self motivated work but it's more forgivable because volunteer work isn't designed to be structured for professional development, it's more about helping others. The volunteer work provides good references too, thank God.

But still, I feel like I'm seriously struggling to prove my worth to employers. I have applied to internships and AmeriCorps (entry-entry level, I suppose) as well but nothing has come of it yet.

To sum up:

- I hate how employers interview you and then never speak to you again, or make you take a test/homework assignment then ignore you without letting you know about the results/feedback, or schedule an interview with you then change their minds and don't bother to let you know without you contacting them first (ghosting, oh so much ghosting).

- I hate doing 3-5 different interviews a week (on average), and having to prove I'm passionate and do all the research for these different places and hope I can move forward with one of them.

- I don't know if I am legitimately too young/inexperienced for a non-profit development career, if this is the wrong career for me. I never feel good enough. One place wants me to have a few successful grant awards under my belt, another wants me to have good graphic design skills so I could help make in-house marketing materials for fundraising purposes, another wants me to know a database inside and out for an entry level role without any training, etc. I can't be everything for everyone and I don't know which direction to go in."

Some Redditors who previously commented may say I told you so, but this update has an exciting twist and I can’t wait to share it. 

Since our hotel rendezvous with Dan from a couple months back, Ashley and my sex life has been the best it’s ever been. It’s been more frequent, with more passion, and more fun. That said, we haven’t talked extensively about that night since it happened. The only time Dan’s name has been brought up was when in preparation for an upcoming wedding we both planned to attend, I asked Ashley if she would feel uncomfortable sitting at the same table, knowing that the bride and groom would most likely seat us together, given our close friendship. Ashley said she wouldn’t feel comfortable at all so we just moved on. 

Fast forward to the day of our mutual friend’s wedding in Northern New Jersey this past weekend, Ashley and I were getting ready and I noticed little things about her preparation that piqued my interest. She put lotion on her entire body, shaved absolutely everything, was wearing a matching pink G-string with a pink lace bra, with a tight form fitting silk black cocktail dress, with her heels. None of this would strike someone who didn’t know her as out of the ordinary but more me, knowing her as well as I do, this was all somewhat out of character, given her fairly innocent persona. Maybe the night with Dan changed her I started to think?.... Anyway, we left our kids with the babysitter, who was kind enough to stay overnight, as we planned to book a hotel room pending how much fun or intoxicated we got. 

When we got to the venue, we were greeted by many of our friends, along with Dan and his new girlfriend Mia. I hadn’t had the opportunity to meet Mia before, so this was the first time for all of us. Dan and Mia got together shortly after our night with Dan from a couple months back so their relationship was in its infancy. I asked Dan if he has said anything to Mia about our night with Ashley and he assured me that he hadn’t. The wedding proceeded as any wedding normally does. Drinking, dancing, telling stupid stories, and generally having fun. There was a moment during the evening where I lost track of Ashley and it was just myself and Mia at the table together. We engaged in that awkward tell me about yourself conversation to pass the time before we hope Dan and Ashley would return, we then mutually realized that Ashley and Dan were up on the dance floor slowing dancing together. I got nervous and in an effort to de-risk any conflict, again, not knowing Mia, looked at her and asked her if she wanted to dance with me. She said, absolutely, let’s do it… 

Now, just a brief summary of Mia: She’s a little younger than us, I’d say 28/29, 5’1, Italian complexion (olive skin, dark eyes, flowing brunette hair), probably 110-115 lbs, with what appeared to be through her dress a nice butt and B cup breasts. 

Back to the dance: Mia and I danced through the slow song and to my surprise, Mia asked what Ashley and my plan was after the wedding was over. I told her we planned to get a room for the night if one of us couldn’t drive home. She stated he would be smart to get a room and to go check it out now as she heard people were having a hard time as they were now fully booked. I got nervous, ended the dance with her and ran to the front desk where to Mia’s confirmation, the hotel had no rooms available. When I went back to the table, Ashley and the rest of our friends were there and I told her I would stop drinking so that we could drive home in a bit as the wedding was soon ending. About 10 minutes later I got a text message from Dan saying that Mia offered to allow us to stay in their room with them, it appeared Mia thought we were nice people and was worried about us getting home safely. They had apparently booked one of those suites with a bedroom and a living room with a pull-out couch so I told Ashley privately and mutually we were not sure what to do. Ultimately, we decided we both had too much to drink, an Uber would be too expensive, so we ended up saying yes to their offer. 

When the wedding ended, we got our bags from the car and met Mia and Dan at their room. When we walked in they were already in their pajamas so we had some catching up to do. They gave us some privacy so we could get out of our wedding clothes and get the pull-out couch ready. Once we were all settled we all chilled around a table that was near the kitchenette in the room and drank some mixed vodka drinks that Dan and I prepared. Our expectation was that we would have a couple of drinks and all go to bed. All 4 of us were fairly tipsy but everyone seemed like they were in complete control. It all changed when Mia made the comment “You guys seem like such close friends, I have some catching up to do!”. She asked if we wanted to play a “never have I ever” drinking game to better get to know us. I had a suspicion where this might lead but said sure, sounds like fun. 

The game started innocently enough, with questions like “never have I ever gone skinny dipping, or never have I ever had sex in a public place, etc etc”. After many rounds, it goes to “never have I ever had a threesome”. Ashley, Dan, and I all drank, and when Mia did not, you could tell she felt kind of left out or at least surprised that the 3 of us had, not knowing it was with one another. Ashley looked at me kind of nervous at this point that the whole night could go south on us and none of us were in the mood for any drama. The next question after that was “never have I ever gotten a lapdance”. Now, I’ve gotten hundreds from girls at strip clubs but I thought I would be funny and claim I had never gotten one before so I didn’t drink. Mia wouldn’t believe me and after a couple of minutes of keeping my game face on she became astonished by this fact. Dan whispered in Mia’s ear (neither Ashley or I could hear what he said) and Mia’s face turned bright red and turned to Dan with a “are you serious” look. After a brief pause, she looked at Ashley and I and asked if it would be okay if she gave me one kind of jokingly because she “felt sorry” I had never experienced one. I looked at Ashley and she was like “whatever dude” so I said sure.

Mia and I made it over to the pull-out couch, which I had to put back together for this effort, and I said down with my shorts and t-shirt on. She was wearing loose fitting sweat pants and an oversized t-shirt. She seemed very coordinated at this point and sat down on my lap facing away from me, she did this very slowly, all in the view of Ashley and Dan mind you. She very slowly started to move her hips back and forth, holding onto my knees as she slowly grinded her ass into my crotch. It was impossible to not get aroused at this point and it was impossible that she couldn’t tell I was getting aroused. She turned around and sat down on me facing me, her long flowing hair draped over my face she grabbed onto my shoulders and slowly grinded into me. This all went on for about 5-10 minutes when I realized Ashley and Dan were no longer sitting at the table. They had disappeared, but I started to hear kissing noises come from the bedroom, which was right behind where Mia and I were. Mia obviously heard and realized this as well but proceeded anyway. As the grinding continued she subtly started to breathe on my neck and kiss/nibble on my ears. All of what was going on seemed crazy but we just carried on. I got more aggressive as well and started to feel Mia’s ass, put my fingers into the straps of her sweatpants and started to feel her small breasts as she grinded away. 

After a few minutes, we heard what could no doubt be confused for sucking, as in blow-job sounds. I knew my wife at that point was in the other room sucking on Dan’s cock and it was at this point that Mia, put her hands down my pants and started to jerk me off, she slowly got down on her knees and started to suck my balls and cock as well, almost staring at me with her big brown eyes. It was almost as if Mia and I were one step behind those two always trying to catch up. After a few minutes of this Ashley and Dan came into the suite room and Dan sat down right next to me, followed by my wife Ashley, both completely naked at this point. Ashley looks at Mia and I and asks Mia if it’s okay if she can ride Dan’s cock. Surprised that she would even ask at this point, Mia says yes and then asks the same of Ashley, which she nods with approval. Like synchronized swimmers, they grinded and bounced on our cocks, as we grabbed and smacked their asses. Ashley was moaning loudly as Mia talked dirty to me saying “I love your cock, fuck me like you fuck Ashley”… I picked up the pace and was bouncing Mia’s little body off my lap pounding her hard, which Dan did intern to Ashley. They bounced on us for what was probably 15 -20 minutes when I started to feel like I was about to cum. I pushed Mia off of me and asked her to suck me off, she jumped off and sucked like crazy as I came in her mouth, all while watching Dan absolutely slam Ashley next to me. Mia swallowed every ounce of my cum as Dan pushed Ashley off of him and Ashley got on her knees to suck Dan off. Ashley sucked and looked up at him and begged for his cum as he came down her throat. All 4 of us, now naked, sweaty, and out of it just kinda laid on the ground, on the couch, completely out of breath not knowing what to do next. Eventually, we all got up, Mia and Dan went into their room while Ashley and I passed out on the pull-out couch. When we woke up, Mia and Dan were gone and Ashley and I got ready and left shortly thereafter. Like last time, we didn’t really say much afterward. As of yesterday, I got a text from Dan, expressing that Mia had a great time and that she would be into something like that again. I never in my mind figured that initial night with Dan would turn into something this crazy or a regular thing, but for the folks that called this happening again, kudos, it did happen again, just with a little twist.

a1abud,2,2018-11-28,How can I prove to my ex that things would be different?,RifleLA,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a1abud/how_can_i_prove_to_my_ex_that_things_would_be/,"Warning, long, but I'm in a rough spot:

&amp;#x200B;

My ex-girlfriend and I had a crazy go. We were together for about two and a half years. When we met, she was going through a divorce, and was completely open to the world and dating another person. I didn't care, I was so in love with her. And I knew she would come around, and she did. We dated long distance, between countries for a while. I had just switched careers, and was broke, degree-less, and in debt. She had just gotten out of a marriage where her immigrant husband couldn't find work, and she was supporting them on an intern's salary. We met through a mutual best friend, and when we finally met, it was fireworks. However, I represented some of the same challenges her ex posed: Immigrant, no job, no money, in debt, a threat to her independence. I went to her country and basically squatted, looking for work, and told her I'd prove her wrong, that she wasn't repeating. We had a rocky time, but I did.

&amp;#x200B;

I got my first choice job, one of the best companies in the country, and sponsorship. I immediately was doubling her salary. But, I had to onboard in a city that was two hours away. Of course we took it, and I was at her place every weekend. We had some rough times with the distance, and some other problems arose as a result of communication and just personal differences. Under everything, we had a deep, deep, connection, that was otherworldly. It made all of the bad times worth it. 

&amp;#x200B;

She is the most incredible person I've ever met. She exposed me, saw straight through me, and made me realize things about myself I had no idea and hadn't addressed, but would have to at some point. For examples: Insecurity, anger, stubbornness, defensiveness, an inability to internalize love, and the need to protect myself for fear of getting hurt. Not to sound like a douche, but I can be really charming, and past partners have just really enjoyed being with me for the fun and excitement. This was different. I was raw and exposed, met and challenged for the first time in my life. 

&amp;#x200B;

She made necessary changes that she needed to make: She stopped criticizing me, stopped comparing me to past partners, and accepted me fully for who I am. She told me that she was ready to commit to me forever. I couldn't say the same thing back. I built up walls, I guarded myself, I projected all of my insecurities onto her. She told me changes that she wanted to make, like internalizing her love, trusting her implicitly, and knowing that she understands me, and I was resistant out of ego. I was in over my head at how someone else saw me so clearly. In my life I thought I had all the answers, and here I had met my match.

&amp;#x200B;

Long story longer, I ended up talking to another girl from work. We never hooked up, or got dirty, but we spoke in a way that felt like how you get to know someone at the start of a new relationship. It was wrong, and totally out of bounds. I told my ex about this, and she was devastated. I handled it horribly. If I need to edit this and go into detail, I will. Suffice it to say that I just didn't give her what she needed, and I caved. I didn't make the harder, right, decision.

&amp;#x200B;

This past summer, we broke up for real. At first I was fine with it. I was ego driven. I thought, ""She's a moron, she'll come around"". We kept on talking, and fighting, and making no progress, because each of us dug our heels in and didn't concede. We made no progress and didn't hear each other. I was asking her to try again, go to therapy, and she was reluctant. I was also still talking to the other girl periodically when we were broken up, but at the same time as I was asking my ex to get back together. I know, I know, I was a total fuckwit. I moved out, and finally she agreed to a therapy session, which was really amazing. But she said she didn't want to keep going, and that she didn't want to try anymore. 

&amp;#x200B;

After a quick trip out of the country apart, we came back and started hooking up. Wanting to always get back together, I thought this would be the way it happens, that we would rekindle our love. We agree to do this until the other finds another person. We both were on dating apps, and going on little dates. During this time, we keep fighting about the history of our relationship, and making no progress. But through it all, we still just love each other so god damn much, and we're both in pain at the gridlock. Finally, she hooks up with someone else. I was devastated. I wanted to disappear. And I broke down to her, saying she's all I want. She says, ""I would have loved to know this months ago!"" I thought it was implied, but I was also really cavalier when we broke up, really stubborn, really fucking proud. I didn't get it. 

&amp;#x200B;

This was a huge wake up call. I was like, ""Holy shit, she could be gone forever"". I want everything with her. Kids, marriage, everything. She's perfect. 

&amp;#x200B;

I started going to therapy weekly. I started going to the gym every day, and I started writing every day, too. About my thoughts surrounding us. I wrote her this crazy letter, where I ONLY detailed my contribution, my role, and took ownership over all of the shitty things I've done and ways that I've acted, that have prohibited progress. I replayed scenarios, and didn't beg. I focused on what I did, and came without ego, hubris, and just humility and honesty. I think she received it well. She told me that it made her respect me again, and view me as an equal. We were so close, and then got so far. 

&amp;#x200B;

She said she needs space, and we've talked seldomly. She said that I really made her question her instincts, with how I accused her of being unloving, not trustworthy, not understanding. I really just projected a whole bunch. I'm in this crazy place where I have had this serious wake up call, like, ""Holy shit - you have so many things you have never addressed and tried to acknowledge and grow from"". I see the history of our relationship, and how I acted in such a different light. I see how I COULD have acted, and how there was such a better approach. She gave me herself, she tried everything she could with me, and I let my darkness and issues get the best of me. I started the relationship vulnerable, and then slowly closed off when things got hard.

&amp;#x200B;

She knows where I stand - she knows I want to try again. She's telling me that although I'm amazing, she doesn't see a future with me right now, and that she needs to get back in touch with herself. She's telling me that serious change takes time, and right now she's just concentrating on getting back to herself, and being grateful for the things she has like friends, family, and health. She's really centered, even though she's still processing all of this craziness. I don't know if she's seeing anyone, she might be casually.

&amp;#x200B;

I get that she's scared and dubious to try again with me. I would be too, I'm a flight risk. Why would she want to go back to a relationship with shitty patterns, she feels like she's going to repeat. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like part of her is still there. I feel a deep, deep shift in me. I'm working through it in therapy. I'm not talking to any other girls or looking to date. I'm sitting in my loneliness, accessing friends and family. I'm not working on contingency plans for validation from other people. I know for us to be together, if it were to ever happen, it will take time. 

&amp;#x200B;

How can I get her to trust me again? How can I show her that if she were to try again, things would be different, and I would bring a better self, the self she always saw in me? How can I show her that change really is possible? I told her I don't care how long it takes, or how much space and time we need, but that I'm never giving up on us. 

&amp;#x200B;

a1aufj,2,2018-11-28,Quality of Computer Science degree?,Luke_Joy,TTUCSC,https://www.reddit.com/r/TTUCSC/comments/a1aufj/quality_of_computer_science_degree/,"As the title says, I'm considering going to Tennessee Tech for a Computer Science degree. I really like Tennessee Tech, but I want to make sure that I'm making the right choice. 

So I have a few questions:

1) How large/small do the lower and upper division classes get? 

2) Do you only get two electives for the CS degree with a concentration in Cybersecurity? I saw a catalog but I'm not sure if I fully understood it. 


3) How are the internship opportunities? I'm not afraid to be go-getter, but I feel like it'd be a lot easier if I just got an interview. 

4) How are most of the profs?

That's all I can think of for now

.

took me 8.5 Semesters to get the M.E. in structural engineering, and B.S. in civil engineering

My relevant experience is: hands on (labor work as apprentice for construction), hands on (mechanical, automotive), design (bridges and buildings), 3d modeling (solidworks, csibridge, etc.), FEA (ansys, csi products, etc.), as well as niche skills like concrete canoe and building and tuning a Naturally Aspirated vehicle

.

\-got an internship in feb.- presently there--&gt; got an offer for 65k, 14 days PTO (bridge work, did not feel that I would have good growth within the company, so i DECLINED)

.

pulled some strings, got another interview for precast concrete industry, they couldnt meet what I wanted (which was 70k, this place was much further away as well)

.

went to structures summit in Chicago, met big boy owners (such as owner of CSI, and other influential individuals within the structural engineering world),--&gt; got business card--&gt; got interview--&gt; big boy said hiring freeze currently, and gave contact to another individual

.

the other individual, let's call him Mr. S, --&gt; got an interview, went well, extremely interested since it is within the loop, forensic engineering (good because this exposes me to many markets such as concrete, steel, and wood which would effectively prepare me for S.E. and P.E. for potential side business prospects upon acquiring my licenses) 

.

Mr. S called me today saying they cannot hire until Q1 of 2019 due to internal company, and this is only potential

another company called me today, gave me an offer for 65k, and basically 3 days PTO --&gt; i only interviewed with them for shits and giggles after a campus career fair --&gt; powergrid industry --&gt; will not really prepare me for my S.E. and P.E.

.

I am traveling to Europe soon (2.5 weeks), and my other prospect was another bridge engineering firm (can match 70-80k apparently), however will not meet/speak with me until I come back from Europe since it is so soon. 

.

My worries are:

1. Will not find something till February/March
2. the other bridge engineering firm will screw me over (i got a whiff of that with the forensic company as well as the powergrid company)
3. my position within a company will not prepare me well for the S.E., P.E., and overall growth within engineering as a discipline, and the company itself.

.

My options:

1.  Go back to said original bridge company, and reapply for position (i am cool with the supervisor, and everyone in the office, and homie basically said you are always welcome back)

2. Risk going without a job (and effectively decline powergrid offer)

3. Pursue a completely different (maybe niche) market (I was doing some physical modeling for fitness/tuxedo start ups/brands, and/or do mechanic/car work/labor contractor work) , and at the same time give my try at FOREX

.

What do you all think I should do? 

I've made a risky decision before, and making another risky choice like that seems to be pushing my luck (as well as, I hate talking to my parents, LTR, or acquaintances about this type of sensitive decisions).  I am leaning on going back to the original company...

I'm currently a full time student and completed a finance internship in the summer which (gratefully) earned me a significant sum of money. I am aware that I was taxed at a higher tax bracket than what I actually made (because it was on a salary basis but I only worked ten weeks) and will get a tax refund. 

My concerns revolve around the fact that I am 21 years old, will graduate and go full time into the finance job next June, and currently claim as a dependent on my parent's tax return.

Here are my questions (also please feel free to add any additional insight):  
1. When I file a tax return as a dependent for this tax year (which includes the summer internship), will I lose out on tax refunds that I could've received if I was not a dependent?

2. If I file as a dependent, will the relatively significant sum of money that I earned cause my parents to pay more taxes/lose out on tax benefits? 

3. Should I claim as an independent starting this upcoming tax return (since I will be going full time within a couple months of the tax filing) or is there a reason to stay on one more year? 

Thanks!"

a1cale,15,2018-11-28,If the MCU was constructed like the DCEU.,CannonProductions,DCcomics,https://www.reddit.com/r/DCcomics/comments/a1cale/if_the_mcu_was_constructed_like_the_dceu/,"Here's a little mental experiment that I thought up a while back that kind of demonstrates why the Marvel films work so well and why Warner Brother's attempts with their DC Properties have flopped so spectacularly. Ultimately, it comes down to respect for what a cinematic universe should be and importance placed on character rather than marketing.

Our first film will be a gritty re-imagining of Captain America called ""Super-Solder"". Ditching the World War II setting almost immediately, the film begins with Captain America being created in the lab and almost immediately cutting to present day. Cap mopes around for most of the film, yearning to be back in his own time and constantly reminding everyone of how alone he is, with the only distractions being from flashbacks to his World War II days, where even then he was mopey and miserable because of his powers and Peggy Carter investigating reports of the return of the fabled ""Super-Soldier"" from WWII. Midway through the film, this angst is sidelined for The Winter Soldier, who was also frozen and the rest of the film is nothing but dark CGI driven action that ends with Captain America brutally murdering The Winter Soldier by decapitating him with his shield, despite being his best friend.

The next film will, of course, be Civil War and introduce Iron Man into the picture. Most of the film will focus on Iron Man and how he hates Captain America for the destruction caused in Super-Soldier. He is currently in the process of grieving War Machine, who's armour is seen for about three seconds and never verbally acknowledged. Tony's rage is further exacerbated by the dreaded Baron Zemo, who in this interpretation is an ex-Hydra agent who took a bad dose of super-solder serum that makes him extra crazy. Zemo's motivations will change every five minutes and eventually settle on his fear of Thanos and Loki coming. For what little time Captain America is in the film, he is constantly whining to Peggy about how Captain America doesn't exist and it's just a dream an eight year-old came up with or something equally pretentious. When the showdown between Iron Man and Captain American finally happens, Iron Man will be in his Hulkbuster costume that he made after he saw a video of a green monster along with other videos of a bow and arrow wielding vigilante, and some of kind of hammer-wielding electricity man, all sent to him by a mysterious red-haired Russian woman he met at a party.

The fight between Cap and Iron Man lasts about five minutes, with most of it being Iron Man beating Captain America to a pulp. Just before Iron Man can finish the job, Cap shouts out Tony's father's name - ""HOWARD!"". It turns out that Cap and Howard were totally BFFs in WWII, so that causes Iron Man to stop. By the end of the film, Iron Man and Captain America must team up to fight the newly created ""Abomination"", who was created by putting The Winter Soldier's body into the same machine that created Steve and combining it with Zemo's DNA. Joining them in the fight is Black Widow, who had sent Tony the videos earlier and they have a massive fight on an abandoned island, because people complained about collateral in the last movie. The film ends with Iron Man defeating the abomination with the Hulkbuster armour, but the armour is destroyed in the process and Tony declares that he will never build armour like that again, for any threat. This victory is short-lived, however, as Captain America is assassinated by someone hired by Tony as a back up plan. Iron Man, racked with guilt, decides to form The Avengers. Zemo is sent off to prison while warning of aliens coming.

The next logical step in this cinematic universe is, of course, the Thunderbolts. This incarnation will be based off Red Hulk's Thunderbolts, because that was the most recent one at the time. The film will spend the first thirty minutes establishing the existence of Red Hulk, Deadpool, Elektra, Agent Venom, The Punisher, Ghost Rider and Flatman, all narrated by Norman Osborn who wants to put this team together. Flatman will, of course, be killed as soon as the team starts, because we need to show the stakes are real. Red Hulk will be shown fighting The Hulk at the beginning and Agent Venom will be shown fighting Spider-Man and The Punisher will be apprehended by Iron Man. The team will be finally set out on their first mission about an hour into the film and immediately have to stop Ghost Rider, who will become the villain of the film as he tries to bring Mephisto back to life. Elektra will be pursued by Daredevil the whole movie, and the marketing will build him up as the main antagonist to the Thunderbolts, only for him to have a grand total of five minutes of screen time. Deadpool, who is always talked up as the ""Merc with the Mouth"" the entire film, speaks a grand total of three times and is only funny once. The film will end with Johnny Blaze being freed of the Ghost Rider curse and everyone being sent back to prison, only for the Daredevil to break Elektra out. The mid-credits scene will feature Tony Stark getting pictures of the future Avengers members from Norman.

The next film will be Black Widow. It will be it will be an epic spy-thriller prequel set in the 80s, that is faithful to the comics for 85% of the film, have a lot of well-rounded, meaningful characters and really set a new precedent for these Marvel films before devolving into a CGI disaster for the last 15 minutes. The film will begin with a flash forward to modern times with a Stark-Industries truck being seen briefly.

And finally, we reach The Avengers. We begin with an iPhone video of Captain America saving a puppy from a tree and he's approached by a young child. Cap is now comic book Captain America and will remain this way for the rest of the film ,with no mention of his dark and gritty portrayal in the previous entries. Chris Evans also had a beard for Snowpiercer at the time and couldn't shave it, so Steve's face looks like Play-Doh. Soon after, we flashback thousands of years to the Norse Gods fighting against Loki for control of the Cosmic Cube. In this fight, we see Asgardians, Namor-style Atlanteans, Inhumans, Wakandans and Mutants all fighting of waves and waves of Chitauri. There is even a Black Panther who is killed in three seconds by Loki. All of this will be rendered with Playstation 1 levels of CGI and this level of quality will continue throughout the rest of the film. Eventually, they overcome him and hide away the Cosmic Cube in an Asgardian vault on Earth as Loki is taken back to Asgard. Tony, still grieving about Steve's death, joins Black Widow to form a team.

Unlike the grim and grizzled Tony Stark of the previous film, this is a much more jokey Iron Man, though none of his jokes are actually funny. He first approaches a crippled, alcoholic named ""Donald Blake"", who lives in a small farming town in upstate New York and spends most of his time watching re-runs of old soap operas on his black and white television. Tony recounts a legend of the thunder god that would always be seen in the shadows at the dawn of spring to make sure that the rains always nurtured the crops. Donald refuses to acknowledge any of this and Tony leaves. After his departure, Donald raises his cane into the hair and transforms into Thor. This version of Thor is played by Jason Momoa, has a long brown beard and blonde highlights in his hair as opposed to being fully blonde. He's also a complete dude bro, because Thor from the comics was lame. Thor flies to the Asgardian vault, only to find it being pillaged by Loki and his Chitauri. This is the first time Thor has met Loki and loses his fight against him as Loki gets away with the Cube.

Back with Tony, he goes to another character named ""Bruce Banner"", a scientist in his early 20s who loves K-pop. Tony states that he knows who Bruce is, but Bruce coyly denies it before Tony shoots him in the face with his Iron Man gauntlet, that he had under his coat. Bruce realises Tony is Iron Man and immediately decides to join him because ""No one wants to be friends with a guy with anger management issues"". This is never made a poignant part of his character and is mainly played for laughs. Over with Black Widow, she recruits Hawkeye, who is taking down a bunch of robbers with his trick arrows. There is no shared history between these two and it is the first time they meet. Hawkeye turns her down, preferring to fight crime on the mean steets rather than punching monsters, but after his weapons expert ""Bangs"" is kidnapped by the Chitauri, he decides to join them. The team eventually joins together and fights the Chitauri in a dark sewer underneath New York, but they are no match for the forces at play.

Iron Man eventually decides it's time to resurrect Captain America, and we have a wonderfully comedic scene of Bruce Banner and Hawkeye digging up his grave, with Banner saying he refuses to use his Hulk form because ""He would turn him into super-solder koolaid"". When we see his body, it is inexplicably perfectly preserved and the Wikipedia article will fill in this plot hole as ""the super soldier serum kept his body in perfect condition"". Tony tells Thor to shoot the fuck out of him with lightning and this brings him back to life. Steve, however, is crazed like The Winter Soldier and begins attacking everyone. He forms a makeshift shield out of a manhole cover and throws it at Thor, knocking him out of the fight, and Banner before he can Hulk out. Hawkeye fires several arrows at him, but they all miss and Cap knocks him on his ass. Black Widow tries strangle holding him with her legs, but he just tosses her off. Eventually catches wind of Tony, who despite being in full Iron Man gear, is hiding behind a car. Tony tries to fly away, but Cap uses his makeshift shield to knock out Tony's suit and grab him by the neck, recycling a line from Civil War to him. Tony tells his suit's AI to deploy Plan B and Peggy comes out of nowhere to make Steve docile again.

With that plan failed, the team regroup to fight Loki in Russia, who is putting the final touches on his plans to turn the world into an ice planet by transporting it toward Pluto. The team form together and fight through Loki's army, but they are no match for Loki himself. Just as all seems lost, Captain America pops out and decks Loki in the face with his shield, before helping Hulk to evacuate civilians in the area. Afterward, him and Thor soon get to work on disabling the cosmic cube and it works. Loki is defeated and torn apart by his own Chitauri, and the day is saved!

Everything returns to normal, Tony goes back to being a swinging playboy, Steve joins the army again, Hawkeye goes back to patrolling the streets, Black Widow goes back to Russia and Bruce is given an internship at Stark Industries. In the post-credit sequence, Zemo is broken out of prison and meets with Task Master on his boat. Zemo is inexplicably wearing his comic book outfit now and states that ""Now that good as its avenging titans, evil will need masters of their own"".

And that is it. As you can see, it becomes very clear where the DCEU went wrong in comparison to the MCU when it is laid out that way. The MCU isn't always perfect, but there is always a sense of structure and a respect for character and consistency. The DCEU, meanwhile, was very much cobbled together by Warner Bros. just to compete with Marvel without any artistic vision or aspirations beyond financial gain on their part and it shows.

Leave your thoughts below. Was I completely off the mark? Or is this an accurate analogy for the mess WB's shared universe is in?"

I’m an American who is set to graduate from high school in May of 2019, and of course, I’m stressing exorbitantly about where I will go immediately after graduation. For many reasons, I want (and need) to leave where I am currently living, pretty much immediately after I’ve graduated. I’ve decided that Berlin is one of my best options, and so I’m trying to research how I could set myself up a nice life there; however, I have a few questions.

1. I would love to study Computer Science at a university in Berlin, but I don’t believe my German language skills will be up to par by the time the next winter semester rolls around. I’ve found pretty much only one university that teaches CS in English, though it seems a little expensive (the college is SRH Hochschule; its fees are going to be around $850 a month for international students pretty soon). Are there any other universities that offer CS programs in English? Does anyone have any experience with this university? Are there any other opportunities to study CS? 

2. The job market. How easily will I be able to find a job in Berlin as an immigrant? I have a few technical internships under my belt and my software portfolio is continuing to grow, but how ‘picky’ are software jobs in Berlin (and I guess Germany in general)? For context, in America, many of the entry level tech jobs require a bachelors degree, or at the very least, a pursuit of a bachelors degree. Aside from that, how easy is the process to get jobs such as waiters, cashiers, etc? 

3. Learning German. I know an English taught degree might not be entirely possible, so what types of programs exist to solely learn German? Are there any university course or programs that exist solely to teach German (that are not too expensive) so that I could learn German and then apply to a German taught course? This is probably my biggest concern. 

4. Kind of a side question, but is a minimum wage (or around) job enough to support oneself in Berlin? I mean for an apartment primarily. "

TLDR; looking for books/resources to better learn how to look at data and write reports?

# So some context:

  
I graduated in 2018 summer. I've held a market analyst internship role at 2 different companies using exclusively Excel (total of 9 months). Both were for startups and had no other analysts there so I basically figured stuff out on my own. I recently finished an internship in October and have been looking for an entry-level analyst position. I've taken up learning SQL (Stanford SQL series) and it's been a fun/interesting process! 

&amp;#x200B;

I've had 2 interviews and I've failed twice at the same stage (where they've given me a project). One was for a pricing analyst position. I was given hotel pricing info and had to answer 3 questions using the data given and include a paragraph in my answers. I felt like I had trouble really figuring out how to write the paragraph. In my second interview, I was given sample data in Mode Analytics and asked to write 3 SQL queries for them. I felt like I had written the correct queries but where I had trouble was again, coming up with a written response to their questions. Below is exactly the questions and answers I had responded with. I would love any type of feedback on how I could be better and any type of resources you all can recommend. 

# 

# Sample Questions from the Interview and my answers at that time: 

*Question 1) We're making a push to increase our prices. What is our trend in monthly average order value? Are we making progress?*

One positive trend that has been consistent is a gradual increase in average total price. DATE\_TRUNC allows me to round the timestamp to the interval I need (month) which allowed me to see the increase at a month to month basis.

*Question 2) We're interested in running an email marketing campaign to our top customers. What is the lifetime revenue for each user? Please order the results in order of lifetime revenue, from highest to lowest.*

I used a simple historical Life Time Customer Revenue formula where you simply find the sum of profit from each unique user. GROUP BY allows us to partition our relations into groups and then compute SUM functions over each group independently.

*Question 3) We need to report to operations on current order status. What is the most recent status for each order and when was it set to that value?*

Everything seems to be either shipped or delivered. The inner query gets a row number for every row and then when using partition gets a new rn for every matching order\_ID once and then sorts up\_dated by descending. rn = 1 is a filter that is used to select the records in the order\_status\_history table of all of the distinct order\_id's along with their corresponding most recent update\_at's.

&amp;#x200B;

*Are there any resources that you guys could suggest on maybe writing a report after looking at data or even how to really look at data? I feel pretty lost right now and would love any type of direction. Thanks a lot guys.*

a1ekpy,1,2018-11-29,Need some personalized career advice,davypi,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/a1ekpy/need_some_personalized_career_advice/,"Sorry, for a long post, but I think details here might be important.

I am currently in my mid 40s having graduated from college in the mid 90s with a degree in mathematics.  Lets just say life did not work out according to plan and I've been working the past 15 years doing financial analysis for a litigation consulting firm.  (Prior to that, I have six years experience in computer technical support.)  A big frustration with my employer in the past was that I was very good at data input and the company I work for had me pigeon holed in that specific duty while people with lesser qualification and poorer reviews were promoted over me.  So, in frustration, I decided to go back to school and work on an accounting degree.  Notably, at the time I started going back to school, I was making a shade over $30K and accounting internships were paying about $40K, so I was looking at getting a good pay raise right out of the gate.  

However, over the past three years, quite a lot has changed.  My employer has given me a salary adjustment to compensate for the years I didn't get raises during the great recession.  I've also received two promotions and am now in a position where I am doing more analytical work that is better suited towards my math degree than the menial input I had been stuck in for decade.  The end result is that my minimum salary is now $52K, but between quarterly and discretionary bonuses, I'm set to clear $56K by the end of the year.  I'm not entirely sure that I would want to do this, but if I were to put in the hours to get some SAS training or a CFA or CFE certification, its plausible I could set myself up for another promotion within a couple of years.

I finished my accounting degree in March of this year, but due to some circumstances going on at work, I've been working 55+ hour weeks since April and have not had time to get back to accounting studies, although my hours will be going back down to 40-45 now that we have resolved our staffing problems. My family and I would like to move to a smaller city in a few years (i.e. someplace less than 1MM population, maybe closer to half that) and everyone keeps saying that getting a CPA is a ""golden ticket"" to having job security no matter where I go.  On the other hand, its not clear what I kind of job I could find in a more rural area with this skills I have.  So if I do want to ""make the switch"" into accounting, I need to start doing this now.  However, what is making the situation uncertain for me is that, as noted above, my work situation now is nearly reversed from what it was even two years ago.  I would now have to take a significant pay cut to transition into a entry level position at a CPA firm.  (A small pay cut I wouldn't mind, but down from $56 to $40 is a big drop.)  Additionally, most CPAs I have talked to transitioned out of accounting to go into finance but I'm trying to go the other way around.  So unless I can find a firm who values the financial and forensic experience I already have, its beginning to feel like taking an accounting job might be a step backwards.

For some additional context, I live in a southern suburb of the Portland, OR area.  I have no desire at all to work for a big 4 firm.  Aside from requiring over an hour commute to get into and out of downtown, I really do not wish play the fast pace rate race game that I've heard typically goes on in those companies.  I'm getting to a point in my life where I value my work/life balance.  In particular, I have a medical condition that can result ulcers if I encounter too much stress and I've actually had an illness once this year due to the extended hours I've worked over the past 8 months.  (I can handle 50+ work weeks for about for two or three months at a time, so tax season would be OK, but what I've been doing lately is more than twice that.)  Everything I've read indicates that a small/local CPA firm is more likely going to provide the kind of atmosphere I'm looking for.  

So questions....

Is it really worth switching careers for me at this point?  

How are firms likely to view my ""haitus"" from my accounting studies since getting my degree?  If I explain to them I was working crazy amounts of OT for seven months, will that be looked on positively, or at least satisfactorily?

My job search skills really are not very good.  I can get some help with the counseling office at the university, but it takes over a month to get an appointment with them, so its really hard to work with a counselor on a regular basis.  Are there other resources out there for helping accountants find jobs?  Given that I'm being a bit ""picky"" about what kind of firm I want to work for, how much am I hurting myself in my job search?  (My GPA reported on my transcript is 3.96, if that matters.)

Any other constructive advice would be welcome."

We tried being friends but that just led to some very emotionally draining interactions for the better half of the semester. That was the second time I had broken up with her for lying and threatening self harm if I didn't do what she wanted. I guess I wanted to stay connected to her just so I knew that she kept taking her meds and going to therapy. She was the first girl I ever loved and I wasn't strong enough to cut her out of my life. 

We both agreed that this ""friendship"" would be just that and there was no possibility of getting back together again. I bottled up my emotions to try to be a positive influence during a dark time for her. Little did I know, she still had feelings for me. Months later, when she confessed them to me, I felt betrayed and used, but also conflicted and confused. She saw through my bluff, even though I had kept my cards very close. I knew 100% that if I let myself fall into the same trap we'd both get hurt again. I told her no. She didn't take it well. We cut off all communication. That was a little over three weeks ago. This has been the longest we've gone without talking to each other since we first started dating three years ago. It was really, really tough. I had never felt such pain before in my life. 

Today was a pretty good day. I connected with an alumnus of my university for a referral to an internship, I got a really good grade on my final paper for English, and it wasn't too cold. Tonight, I went to the library to do homework. I go here almost every day since it's very close and my house is usually very noisy. My routine usually consists of walking in, going downstairs to the vending machine to get some coffee, and heading to my usual quiet spot in the corner of the second floor. So I walked in, went downstairs, got my coffee, and there she was. We only locked eyes for a second in passing but it felt like an eternity. My stomach curled into knots. My mind started racing. It felt like all the progress I made towards moving on had been undone. I looked away, kept walking, and just went home. All my insecurities and anxieties flared up again. ""Did she know I was going to be here?"" ""Was she trying to see me?"" ""Is she doing better now that I'm gone?"" I felt uncomfortable and paranoid so I lost all the focus I had on getting work done. 

This happened an hour ago and now I'm just sitting in my bed at home and I don't know what to do with myself anymore. I thought I was doing so good but now I just feel helpless."

**The Lure Of Apprenticeship**

An apprenticeship is an arrangement in which a trainee learns a trade by while working with an experienced person, usually under a written or unwritten agreement. The trainee is called an apprentice.

# Advantages of Apprenticeship

· Provides you with exposure to the real work environment. 

· Equips you with job-specific relevant skills, bridges the gap between education and employment.

· Improves your confidence and employability quotient even though you join as a trainee. 

· Pays you in the form of a stipend to learn and gain practical work experience.

· Enhances your future career prospects.

**Apprenticeship training** serves as a means for creating skilled manpower for the industry, making use of the available training infrastructure of companies without additional financial strain for investment in training facilities

# Employing apprentice

Companies also have multiple benefits if they **hire an apprentice**.  Employing apprentice means having manpower eager to learn.  They get trained according to business needs. There is saving in cost as you can get work done from the apprentice during the apprenticeship in lieu of a nominal stipend. Also with the attrition rate on the rise, losing trained manpower also adds to losses for the company. Also, the company can decide whether to have full time, part time apprentices depending on its business needs.

# Apprentice Online Registration 

Any person being an Indian citizen, above the age of 14 years and not enrolled for full-time school or college, can undergo an apprenticeship program. To become an **apprentice, registration** at the appropriate center is a must. 

‘**National Apprenticeship** Promotion Scheme’ (NAPS), an initiative by the Government of India aims to impart skills to a sizeable population of Indian youth. The Government has agreed to lighten the burden on the employers by contributing a share in the stipend to be paid and the training costs that would be incurred. The empowerment of youth can happen via the acquisition of new skills and a network has to be established to support them and for that Government of India has partnered with some companies to promote NAPS.

There are a plethora of **apprenticeship jobs** in varied fields. Careers to begin with an apprenticeship are many ranging from lab assistants, technicians in various fields including architecture, computer, tourism, health and safety, journalism etc. Many manufacturing companies provide **ITI** (Industrial Training Institute) **apprenticeships** that provide an opportunity for ITI students to get trained and acquire the practical job skills under experts.

Once you register on their websites for apprenticeship programs, your profile is shared with other agencies and companies.  You may get shortlisted against vacancies available. You can check out the latest **apprenticeship vacancies** on the registered website. 

Once you are selected for an internship, a legal contract is signed between the apprentice and the company after mutually agreeing to the terms and conditions of the apprenticeship. There is an initial probation period. This period lets you, the apprentice and the employer familiarise with the arrangement and decide whether it should continue further.

Experience the world of apprenticeship, and reap rich dividends."

I'm bitter because one of the reasons why he broke up with me was because all I do is cry and complain and do nothing to make my life better and that all I do is dragging him down, and seeing him already a step closer to success than I am to my career goals makes me feel like shit all over again. 
My current bf told me that he's proud of me because I got an internship at a hospital, I'm graduating a semester early and during my under grad I managed to pull my gpa up from a 1.98 to a 3.02. I already planned out what's the next step for me with room for adjustments and back up plans, but seeing my ex in pharmacy school makes me feel like he was right and that I'm not doing much with my life. If I am, I would have already applied for nursing school with high hopes, not nervously checking in on my job applications to see if the hospital had approved or rejected me.

a1gbl8,2,2018-11-29,Why ‘Contact’ Is the Most Important Space Movie Ever Made,Mexicutioner_1,GGdiscussion,https://www.reddit.com/r/GGdiscussion/comments/a1gbl8/why_contact_is_the_most_important_space_movie/,"[The film inspired a generation of scientists](https://medium.com/s/space-time/why-contact-is-the-most-important-space-movie-ever-made-bdea86d0c8d0)

Imagine for a moment that you’re a radio wave traveling at the speed of light. You leave Earth, passing the moon, Mars, the asteroid belt, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. You’re going so fast — 299 million meters per second — but it still takes you five hours to reach Pluto. A collage of sounds from Earth travel alongside you as you zoom out of the solar system and arrive at a star called Vega, 26 light-years away. This is how the 1997 movie Contact begins.

In a later scene, nine-year-old Eleanor Arroway — played as an adult by Jodie Foster — sits on her bed and talks with her father about the vastness of space and whether people on Earth are alone in the universe. “The universe is a pretty big place,” he replies. “If it’s just us, seems like an awful waste of space.”

I was a teenager when Contact came out, and after only a few minutes into the opening sequence, I was frozen in my seat, completely awestruck. At 13, I was already captivated by space and the big questions it raised. You know, the ones that can keep a person up at night: Why are we here? Are we alone? What does it all mean? I became obsessed and read everything I thought might give me a hint of an answer: books, poetry, you name it. Then came Contact.

When we meet Ellie as an adult, she’s on an impressive trajectory. She graduated from high school two years early, received a bachelor’s from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a PhD from Caltech. She’s turned down a teaching position at Harvard to pursue a job with the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence group (SETI) at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico. She loses funding but eventually finds her way to New Mexico, where she detects a signal from an intelligent alien civilization. That discovery leads to the construction of a spacecraft, and Arroway fights to be its passenger.

I’d never seen anyone like Ellie. Most people hadn’t. Twenty years ago, when the film was released, few space odysseys featured women in leading roles. Today, we have films like Interstellar and Gravity, but the depiction of women in popular culture as scientists, engineers, and leaders is sadly still quite scarce.

In the many years since Contact was released, I’ve become a writer focused mostly on space. Through my work, I’ve met several women and men who also came of age around the time of the film, and many of them took careers in science. The film comes up often in conversation, and I started to wonder: How many of us became scientists or took a science-adjacent job because of this underrated sci-fi film from the 1990s?

So, I did what any writer would do on deadline and took to [Twitter](https://twitter.com/shannonmstirone/status/1049331193424957445?)

A Twitter poll is pretty unscientific, and while most people who responded said they didn’t go into science because of the movie per se, I received several exciting responses from women in space-related careers who say the film inspired them.

Erin MacDonald, an astrophysicist and aerospace engineer wrote:

&gt;She was a big inspiration to me, and the first time I operated the Green Bank Telescope all I could think of was Ellie, and that I finally made it. Feel free to contact (hehe) if you'd like to talk more!

Kim Bott, an astrobiologist at the Virtual Planetary Laboratory wrote:

&gt;I saw it at 12 &amp; thought Ellie was the baddest bitch in the universe. Was already sciencey but I was OBSESSED. I asked to rent it every weekend, dad got me the poster &amp; got (himself) a telescope, I read the book &amp; was convinced it was about me. I drank earl gray no suger no milk

“Seeing Contact left a lasting impression on me,” says Jillian Yuricich, an aerospace engineer who sent me a direct message. “I first saw the movie when I was around eight or nine, and while I didn’t appreciate the nuance of the debate on faith until some years later, seeing a blonde girl be strong and determined and then stepped on by the men around her and then strong and determined even still… she was one of the most important role models I ever had.”

“I’ve watched that movie and read the book countless times since, and I always see myself in Ellie Arroway,” Yuricich adds. “While I’m sad she’s fictional, I know her spirit lives within many women.”

What continues to make Contact compelling is the fact that the character Ellie Arroway remains so relevant today. She’s brilliant and irrationally driven and constantly up against the men who control the purse strings to her research.

Carl Sagan, who wrote the book Contact that the film is adapted from, based Arroway on a real scientist named Jill Tarter. Tarter received her bachelor’s of engineering physics degree from Cornell University — as the only woman in her class — around the same time that Sagan was a professor there. Her graduate work at UC Berkeley and career at SETI inspired Sagan to base his story’s heroine on her. Science writer Sarah Scoles, my friend and colleague, wrote Tarter’s biography, fittingly called Making Contact. It was published last year, exactly 20 years after the film was released.

“I saw Contact when my family got it from Blockbuster,” Scoles says. “I was immediately engrossed and obsessed with the idea that there was a scientist who got paid — kind of — to ask these big questions and investigate them.”

“Contact taught me that I wanted to do radio astronomy,” she says. “I got to do an internship at Arecibo and stay in the cabin across from where Jodie Foster stays in Contact, and I felt very proud of myself.”

For me, the film continues to inspire. I think about it often and watch it once a year. It’s not just that Ellie is a woman, but the fact that she represents a person so many of us see inside ourselves. I take great comfort knowing that there are so many women actively seeking answers to questions about space and humanity in part because of a film they watched two decades ago.

Toward the end of the movie, Ellie finds herself onboard a spacecraft, destination unknown. She’s faced with the very real possibility that she won’t survive her quest. The pod shakes violently as it begins to take off, and fear shows on her face as the countdown clock creeps to zero. “I am okay to go. Ellie to Control, do you read me? I am OKAY TO GO,” she shouts.

I continue to wonder: Would I, and can I, be so brave?

Me (22M) and my ""friend"" (21F)",looowkeydude,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a1gc2t/what_should_i_do_in_this_kind_of_relationship_me/,"First of sorry if this is hard to read 'cause english is not my first language

&amp;#x200B;

So here's the problem

My friend and I have a kinda complicated relationship, 

we've known each other just for about a 6 months, during an Internship

after 2 months of knowing her and liking her, I confessed about my feeling to her. But at that time I don't know that

she's already close to my friend (20M) and have a crush on him, so do my friend, but he's already have a gf, so he rejected her feeling

after few weeks of my confession she's told me to be her best friend instead, and told me about her situations with my friend.

after being rejected and friendzoned still keep on having a good relationship with her as a friend but I still can't shake my feeling for her.

so I consulted in her bff (22F) about it and the bff said that she's (my ""friend"") already liking me in a long time ago, and she (my ""friend"") doesn't want to hurt my feeling by accepting my feeling after being rejected by my friend.

fast forward a few months to recent times, she's keep asking me out on a date, and I keep accepting her invites

and she act like we're already a couple when we going out, concerned about my wellbeing like my mother would, but she's never make it clear what our current relationship.

Concerned about this her bff told me that I should ask my ""friend"" about our relationship, but recently my ""friend"" talked about how she's being confessed by other guys and she told them off by telling them she's currently not interesting in a relationship rn.

And I know that when she says about something like that she's serious about that. but her behavior when she's with me keep making me confused about our relationship. Because if I keep going with her flow I'm scared that I overstepped my ""role"" as a friend, and she hate me for that

&amp;#x200B;

So what do you guys think, what should I do? should I make it clear to her or should I say like this? or maybe you guys have a different advice?

a1h8mn,84,2018-11-29,I am author T. Frohock here to support Worldbuilders. Here’s what support means to me…,TFrohock,Fantasy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/a1h8mn/i_am_author_t_frohock_here_to_support/,"I suppose this is the perfect time for me to talk about support, because I’ve certainly been fortunate enough to have a lot of it lately. So much so, that’s it’s kind of hard to pick and choose which thing to tell you about.

In 2017, I almost quit writing fantasy for good. It was a hard choice, but I felt like my career was going nowhere, I’d lost my agent, and I was sure my proposal would be rejected. My audiologist had just activated my cochlear implant, and for the first half of 2017, my hearing remained profoundly impaired.

Months later, the proposal that I was sure would be rejected acquired a three-book deal, and I have a new agent who has my back. My brain adjusted to all the new sounds and now I feel much more confident in my newfound ability to hear.

And what sustained me during those long hard months between nothing and something was the emotional support I received from family, co-workers, and my writing friends. For the purpose of this post, I’m sticking to the writing aspect; otherwise, I'd never stop.

Authors have all experienced times when our careers have stalled. For most of us, we always seem to be in a state of famine or feast. It’s those long periods between where we prop up one another. Sometimes all we can do is share a shoulder to cry on and say, *“hey, I feel you, I’ve been there, too.”* Other ways we support one another is by spreading the word about our friends and their stories.

Another way is by giving back.

So this year, when another author friend of mine suggested that I might be a good fit as a [Pitch Wars](https://pitchwars.org/) mentor, I applied. For those of you who have never heard of Pitch Wars, it’s a “mentoring program where published/agented author, editors, or industry interns choose one writer each, read their entire manuscript, and offer suggestions on how to make the manuscript shine for an agent showcase. The mentor also helps edit their mentee’s pitch for the contest and their query letter for submitting to agents.”

The board accepted my application, and I’ve been mentoring Elvin Bala on writing techniques to take his manuscript to the next level. Frankly, I think I got the better end of that deal. I give advice, but it’s Elvin who is doing all the heavy lifting of revisions, but that’s the way it’s supposed to work, because mentoring isn’t all about giving, it’s about **empowering** someone to take charge of their own lives.

It’s all a lot like [Worldbuilders](https://worldbuilders.org/), which is why I’m here with you today. When I’m in one of those rare feast phases of my life, I like to use my riches, however meager they may be, to give back. Sometimes all we need is an encouraging word. Sometimes we need a little more.

What I like about Worldbuilders is simply this: we’re not giving handouts. Instead, we’re giving someone a way to empower themselves. We give and the recipients of those gifts do the heavy lifting, making the most out of those gifts.

Now that I’ve prattled on a bit longer than I ever intended for this post, I want to hear from you.

When has someone empowered you? What do you like to do to give back to others?

And if you don’t want to share about those things, then feel free to use this as an AMA and ask me anything. I’ll be popping in and out during odd times of the day to answer questions and read your responses.

Thank you for allowing me to be a part of this year’s fundraiser for Worldbuilders."
a1i9qz,1,2018-11-29,Opinion about Master in Data Science in Melbourne vs Sydney vs Tsinghua vs Nanyang Technological University vs KAIST,Mr4321,unimelb,https://www.reddit.com/r/unimelb/comments/a1i9qz/opinion_about_master_in_data_science_in_melbourne/,"Hi guys, this is a little long but I would really appreciate your opinion about the following:

I am from Latin America and I got accepted to the master in data science at Melbourne University (2 years), master in data science at the University of Sydney (1 year), and the master in data science at Tsinghua University (shenzhen campus, 2 years) . I am also thinking to apply to KAIST University (Korea advanced institute of science and technology) and probably to Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. 

The question is how hard will be to find  a job as an international student in Melbourne or Sydney after the master program?
 Personally, I prefer Sydney just because it is 1 year program. But I heard that you need to study 2 years in Australia to get the PR that will help you to get a job. 
Since I have never been in Australia, I don't even know if I want to stay there after the master program. Is it hard to get a job in Asia after studying a master in Australia as a non-Asian? How hard is to get internships during the master program? I guess the main problem I have with Australia is the high tuition. I am really scared of finishing my master program and go back to my country where I would need to work many years to pay the tuition.

The second option is Tsinghua. I studied two years in Beijing and I like China. The program is in Shenzhen , the silicon valley of China. Full scholarship. The main problem is that the salary in China is low and IT companies in china don't hire too many international students, especially since they can hire a local). I consider myself good in Chinese (HSK 5).

The third option is Korea. I did an exchange program in Korea and I love the country ( I have been already 4 times there). I know some Korean but of course not to the level of a master program. However, I am pretty sure I can get a full scholarship in Korea since I have a good GPA. The salary is average. I am not sure how hard will be to find a job as a foreign. However, it seems a little easier to get the PR than in Australia after the master program.  

The last option is Singapore. I have never been there but I heard is easy to get the Singaporean PR after graduating in any IT master program. Also, I heard that most companies want to hire international people. I do not think I can get a scholarship,  but  I dont really care since the salary in Singapore is great (Even higher than in Australia??).

So basically the question is which is the best option?
Thank you!

Mikhaila Peterson eats just under one kilogram of beef per day, mostly chuck roasts fried in beef tallow.

The daughter of celebrity academic Jordan Peterson doesn’t use salt much anymore, [she recently told Geoffrey Woo, CEO](https://hvmn.com/podcast/meat-heals-the-autoimmune-disease-case-ft-mikhaila-peterson-episode-92) and co-founder of HVMN (pronounced “human”), a Silicon Valley company that sells supplements. The pink Himalayan rock salt made her excessively thirsty, therefore she lives on just beef and water now, and sometimes bourbon — a hyper-extreme diet she credits for putting her arthritis, chronic fatigue and occasional hypomania into remission. The carnivore cleanse has also “fixed” her father’s depression, fatigue and weight gain, Mikhaila Peterson reported on her blog, [Don’t Eat That.](http://mikhailapeterson.com/about-me/)

She’s now offering $120 per hour consultations, and has more than 6,500 subscribers. Meanwhile, a Facebook group called [World Carnivore Tribe](https://www.facebook.com/groups/worldcarnivoretribe/about/) has reached more than 22,000 members since debuting last December. On Instagram, there are more than 41,000 posts with the [\#meatheals hashtag.](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/meatheals/?hl=en)And, in Silicon Valley, some tech workers are stocking the office communal fridge with rib eyes and steak tartare, [the San Francisco Chronicle reports](https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/Tech-workers-seeking-an-edge-on-their-peers-do-an-13377065.php), in the belief going “carnivory” will give them a competitive edge.

While [Jordan Peterson](https://nationalpost.com/tag/jordan-peterson) says he has dropped 23 kg on the diet, some people are asking how is it that people aren’t dropping dead? Why don’t they have clogged arteries or colon cancer? How are they not getting scurvy? The eating plan defies everything nutritionists have said about the importance of fruits and vegetables. Even Canada’s new food guide, due out in 2019, is expected to lean far more plant than cow-based. The National Post asked experts to explain what it would mean to eat nothing but meat.

**What is the carnivore diet?**

It’s an extreme extension of [low-carbohydrate diets](https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/food-plans-that-replace-carbohydrates-with-protein-and-fat-are-giving-wrong-advice-says-new-study). “This is the keto diet on testosterone,” [wrote Jonathan Jarry](https://www.mcgill.ca/oss/article/health-nutrition/carnivore-diet-beefy-leap-faith), of McGill University’s Office for Science and Society.

The carnivore food pyramid focuses on fatty meats, especially ruminant meat (cattle, lamb, goat, antelope, elk, deer). Processed meats like bacon, sausage and deli meats are permitted, and eggs and dairy if you can tolerate it (including lard, duck fat, ghee, butter, hard cheese and heavy whipping cream). Lots of water is recommended, as well as sodium to prevent muscle cramping. No fruits, vegetables, grains, legumes, nuts, seeds or plant-based spices, oils or seasonings.

Purists eliminate diary. They also don’t take supplements.

**What are the claims?**

That it can help people lose weight, improve their cardiovascular health, increase mental clarity, alleviate autoimmune symptoms, clear acne and other skin issues and ease depression and anxiety.

**Is it new?**

No. One of the earliest converts was Harvard-trained ethnologist Vilhjalmur Stefansson, who was born in Gimli, Manitoba in 1879. Stefansson spent over 11 years exploring the arctic, nine years of which he lived, and ate, like the Inuit, almost exclusively on meat and fish. In 1928, he and a fellow explorer voluntarily agreed to live solely on meat for one year while they continued their writing and lecturing in the temperate climate of New York. The study was partially supported by a grant from the Institute of American Meat Packers. Despite initial bouts of nausea, diarrhea, constipation and an odd craving for calf brain, at the end of the year, “there were no subjective or objective evidences of any loss of physical or mental vigour” in either man, the researchers reported. The men lost weight during the first week due to a shift in the water content of their bodies as they adjusted to the low carb diet, but then their weights remained practically constant. The meat diet didn’t cause any elevation in blood pressure, nor was there any evidence of vitamin deficiencies.

One of the more popular apostles of going carnivore is [Shawn Baker](https://www.shawn-baker.com/), a former orthopaedic surgeon and power lifter who, in 2017, voluntarily surrendered his licence, at the insistence of his New Mexico licensing board, over “incompetence to practise as a licensee.” [According to Baker](https://www.shawn-baker.com/), who has railed against vegans and their “plant-based religious zealotry” on social media, prior to agriculture, humans evolved eating a highly carnivorous diet. “They were stronger, they had thicker bones, they even had larger brains,” Baker said in a promotional video. Meat isn’t causing health problems. “It’s the other stuff.”

**Why no fruits and vegetables?**

The theory is that lectins, gluten and phytic acid found in many plants are toxic to humans. Lectins, in particular, were singled out as demons in the 2017 book The Plant Paradox, by U.S. cardiologist Steven Gundry. Found in seeds, grains, skins, rinds and leaves, lectins protect plants from predators, but, according to Gundry, once ingested by humans they cause inflammatory reactions leading to weight gain and serious health problems.

However, Heidi Bates, director of the Integrated Dietetic Internship at the University of Alberta, told McGill’s Jarry that, while people can experience gas or stomach upset if they eat a lot of beans or other high-lectin foods, “there is no research to suggest that we should avoid all of these nutrient-rich foods.”

Celiac disease is caused by an immune reaction to gluten, but only one per cent of the Canadian population has this condition.

**What about the evolutionary argument?**

Modern meat isn’t like the meat our Stone Age ancestors ate, said Lisa Sasson, a clinical professor in nutrition at New York University. “When was the last time a woolly mammoth was in Whole Foods?” Meat from prehistoric times was very lean, unlike the processed, salty and high-fat meats many people eat today.

Our Palaeolithic ancestors also consumed a high-fibre diet from a variety of plant foods — wild plants, berries, or whatever they could forage. Their calorie needs were also very high (perhaps more than 4,000 calories per day) and they moved a lot more. They also died a lot sooner, with a life expectancy of around 30.

**What are the risks?**

Too much protein can be a problem for those with kidney disease. Excessive amounts of meat can also increase uric acid in the blood, which can crystallize in the joints, causing gout. There’s also evidence linking grilled meat and cancer. When muscle meat is cooked at high-temperatures, like pan frying or grilling over an open flame, chemicals form, including heterocyclic amines, which are mutagenic, meaning they cause changes in the DNA that may increase cancer risk.

“You see lots of pictures on social media where proponents of these diets proudly post pictures of these dark, charbroiled steaks,” said family physician Dr. Aric Sudicky. “There’s good evidence that if you eat charbroiled grilled meat multiple times a day it comes with a significant risk of cancer.”

**What about nutrients?**

Red meat offers zinc and iron, as well as a number of B vitamins, but not much calcium, and zero grams of dietary fibre, said Montreal cardiologist Dr. Christopher Labos. The carnivore diet permits eggs, which contain some vitamin C. So does raw meat, like steak tartar, as well as liver.

“It takes time for scurvy to present — you won’t notice this in a few weeks,” said Dr. Joe Schwarcz, director of the McGill Office for Science and Society. It took weeks or months at sea without any vitamin C for scurvy to develop. “It’s not an immediate effect, and we haven’t had enough people on this diet long enough. (But) maybe there are people out there who are developing scurvy.”

There are no carbs in meat, but the body can convert some protein into glucose, the main source of energy for the body and brain.

**Can it really cure diseases?**

It’s not that meat heals, but rather that some people end up eliminating foods they might be reacting to.

However, there are no randomized clinical trials to support claims the carnivore diet can cure autoimmune diseases, which can wax and wane. Other purported benefits are even harder to quantify or measure.

“Mental clarity? How do you prove that,” Sudicky said.

It’s true that saturated fats don’t come with nearly the same risk for heart disease that researchers warned of during the fat hysteria of the 1950s and 60s. But it’s a false claim to say saturated fats can protect against heart disease or stroke, Sudicky said.

**Will you lose weight?**

It’s not magic: People will lose weight because they’re removing multiple food groups, including the foods most people gain weight from — high-fat or high-sugar snack foods. The fat and protein in meat also helps satisfy hunger.

The “transition” period can be rough, with people reporting symptoms such as brain fog, chills, gut issues, constipation, foul breath, dry mouth, sore muscles, insomnia and nocturia — excessive nighttime urination.

**Is it safe?**

“Long-term research on the carnivore diet is simply absent — and no, that one-year study of two men in 1930 doesn’t count,” Jarry said.

The U.K. government recommends people limit their intake of red and processed meat to 70 grams per day, to reduce the risk of bowel cancer. But colorectal cancer doesn’t develop overnight.

“It may take years of being on such a diet to manifest problems,” Schwarcz said.

**Why is it so popular?**

Fad diets offer hope and a relatively easy solution to complex problems. Extremism in anything is never the answer, Schwarcz said, but extreme sells better than the boring, age-old advice: reduce your calories in a reasonable manner, and try to be more active.

I’m 26, Pomo and Scottish. Woke up last year in September, faded until feb this year and was shunned by my family for inactivity and then disowned when I was disfellowshiped in September this year for being a “spiritual warrior commuting acts of war against the almighty” blah blah

Meeting :
Nervous as fuck having to explain all the shit that happened that caused me to be depressed in 2013, taking antidepressants and having a reaction to the pills resulting in cyclothymic disorder. Then finally having medication to help in September last year and that’s when I woke up to it all. 


Since leaving I’ve :

- joined a local amateur American football team and playing as offensive lineman.

- fought my way into college doing hnc computing

- battling the local bus company over poor service and who are demanding more money from college to provide the routes they are meant to provide. I managed to get the local papers run a couple of stories, I’ve got the msp and mp office involved, I’ve got college fighting my corner as well and providing all the information to build a case.

- actually managed to keep up at college, passs assessments and have good attendance despite all the issues with my health and cult being dicks.

- i also starting a club at college for using Lego, raspberry pi, arduino kits and python to make robots to participate in local competitions. College is backing me and sending me to a nearby college to check out there setup

- I’m the class representative 

- course representative 

- student ambassador 

- and I may be offered an internship.

- I’m starting a gaming clan with people I met over Xbox. In fact one of them is asking if I can try to apply for a summer job in USA and if possibly lodge at his. 

- I’ve got some good Friends who are my friends because I am being me. I swear like the Scotsman that I am, I smoke weed like the student I am. It helps finding people who have your back, such as /u/Noeggfoyoufatboy 

I don’t say these things to come across as an arrogant asshat, but rather because i realised today that I’ve accomplished a lot and that I’m dam proud of what I’ve done. Im also proud that I’ve managed to do all this during one of the most life altering years of my life and survive. 

TLDR : the cult says you are nothing and have no one without them. It isn’t easy but be proud of the little things you do accomplish.

I am currently a student at a large state school in a different state and I am considering transferring to UW-Madison for a couple reasons and I would like some advice. A large part of it has to do with the social scene. I am involved in greek life and the university here has basically shut down greek life. There are very few house parties and the only real way to go out is at the bars. I have been to Madison probably about 4 or 5 times and the nightlife is definitely better there. Also, Madison has some better programs for what I want to major in and more internship opportunities in the city. If I transfer, I would be transferring at the beginning of the spring semester of 2019 and likely living in the dorms. My main concern is that I would be leaving behind the friends I have here and I may not get the experience that I am expecting because I have already missed much of the social parts of freshman and sophomore year and it may be hard to make new friends.

It's a Computer science class and we  have to work in a group throughout the semester to finish it and write  the report on it. For each group someone has to be elected leader, for  ours it was me because the person with the highest grade chose me to get  out of being the leader and no one said 'no'.

One of my group members is someone I've been in class with since I  returned to school (I got distracted by a really well paying internship  for a year or two). During our first two classes together he seemed to  be a good student, got homework done on time, got decent grades. Then we  don't have classes together for a year/year and a half. Now we're in  class together and he's in my group and he isn't doing anything. If he  is doing something minimal effort is made. I have separate issue with  the professor (we've had arguments about how he shouldn't expect a  specific answer if he's asking a vague question), but as a result the  group is aware we probably need to go above and beyond just in case.

I thought I could trust him by giving him some templates, and the  methods to reference when writing his part of the report. The day we  needed it he doesn't get to it until I text him an hour before class. It  wasn't something we could turn in so I re-wrote the whole thing after  mentioning it to other group members. I told him I would be doing this.

Today he's asking what he can do to help and if he should tune up the  final report by deleting what I had, assuming ""it belonged to another  section because it has too much detail"" (the section it was in was  analysis...something that is often associated with details in the world  of computer science). I told him it would help if he starts helping  other group members with the PowerPoint (the group decided by majority  that I'm not allowed to touch the powerpoint because of what happened in  a technical writing class when I tried to make one \[it was so bland and  boring\]). He says ""sure whatever"" and we all know what whatever means.So I ask him what the issue is and he thinks I went behind his back to  do his section of the project. This is currently through text. First I  told him directly I needed to fix what he did. Then I told him what he  made wasn't workable, that we finished our project later than most  groups so the report needs to be better than half an hour of effort,  that he ignored the templates the group has been using, that he's  doesn't even know what the big terms and concepts we were supposed to  apply from class were meaning that regardless someone would need to add  those in, that he doesn't show up to class or meet with the group, and  that when a project needs to get done someone is going to have to do it.  Now I know all that sounds like the stereotypical shit you hear from a  bad boss, so as you'd expect he's upset and isn't talking to me.

What should I do, apologize? Everyone in the group gets the same  grade (syllabus says so) otherwise I would have just held my tongue and  let his grade communicate to him the same issue. If I should apologize  how should I go about it? I don't really feel bad for what I told him,  is the issue so I don't know how to apologize.

Tl:Dr - classmate and I had group project, he contributed less than bare minimum. I started to do his parts for him due to the end of the project fast approaching, he get's upset. I lay into him about his lack of contribution. Should I apologize?  


Edit: He sent me a text apologizing and saying he can only work on things last minute and I don't know how to respond. I told him he's not a burden and he doesn't need to apologize, just when others depend on him it would help if he at least showed up or gave input to the rest of the group. Was this a bad response? Should I say anything else?"

I recently began reviewing material for my tax/intermediate II finals , and I’m getting so incredibly discouraged about my future as an accountant. I’m sitting here trying to rework learnsmarts, outline chapters and reread presentations, and it just makes me feel so stupid. 

With McGraw Hill, it is incredibly easy to find answers to everything through chegg/online resources, which I have done quite regularly throughout my time in college. As far as I can tell, this is extremely typical of accounting students in similar curriculums, because they struggle to understand the textbooks. Besides this making me feel shitty about myself &amp; work ethic, I feel like I’m preparing myself for utter failure once I attempt to enter the work force. I know so many people who have had internships who claim they didn’t need to know anything from their classes in order to do well, and that they were taught the “real-life” stuff once they got there.

I feel like I’m a fraud for not understanding so much of this and using chegg/quizlet to BS my way to answers. It feels really, really bad, and I can’t just listen to my friends who say “this is just how it is” without feeling even worse.

I guess I just want to know if it’s normal to feel this way, and if it means I’m doomed or not. College just feels like a right-of-passage that most majors half-ass through/that costs a lot of money, and I’m not really developing any true accounting skills that will help me later. I want to know if cpa preps are anything like McGraw Hill, if these feelings are necessary, and if I just need to get through this to get to a brighter tomorrow.

I have a good GPA and an awesome resume outside of experience, but these feelings that completely void me of any confidence at all make me wonder if I’ll make it once I’m done with college. Are there any professionals who understand how I’m feeling? Does anybody have advice?

First of all I want to apologize for this mess of a post, I don't know what to say and where to start.

For the past, I don't know how long, I haven't really been happy. I don't see a light at the end of the tunnel and I don't know what to do.

Last August I completed my IT apprenticeship and got my certification, I've been unemployed since then, but recently got an internship through some state organized thing or whatever. It's not IT related, but I get to help people, which is what I enjoy doing. 

However, it's incredibly boring and I cant wait till I get home everyday, nothing new, I know. But when I open my front door, and see my empty apartment (my roomies recently split and moved out) I just let out a big sigh, and I realize there was no reason to look forward to coming home. Today I skipped work, because I have no energy and nothing to live forward to.  
There are so many things I need to talk about, but I can't see myself going to a therapist, or anything. I feel like I can't really talk about this with my friends either because they can't do anything about it and they can't know how I feel because I can't express it. I've hosted a couple of parties recently with my friends, and usually something pops up in a conversation that really hits a nerve, I don't know what it is but I completely break down and I can't talk without pouring my eyes out. As an example, last party, my friend mentioned something about suicide and it not bothering him, and that he didn't care if he died or not, which I totally get. I got so mad at him because he's a really close friend and thought that nothing bad would come from him dying, which pissed me off because he didn't seem to understand the fact that it's extremely inconsiderate and selfish to just leave. For some self-reflection, I think I got that upset because I feel the same way, but I have my principles. I'm not going to kill myself, because I wouldn't want to hurt the people I care about feelings.

&amp;#x200B;

Again, this was probably messy and I'm sorry if you took the time to read this, but I have no idea where to start.

&amp;#x200B;

Additionally, what kind of internships should I be looking for? If my grades after this first semester are good, there's a good chance I'll be able to spend some time externing on the D.C. Circuit. Would that be a good place to start? It seems like a shiny line to put on a resume at least, and getting into one of the above law firms as a 1L is nearly impossible. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any ideas would be appreciated.

Currently in school for civil engineering and if everything in my career goes perfectly right I can expect to make ~$55-60k for solid 40 hour weeks. Possibly make low six figs 7-8 years down the road for 50ish hours.


As bad as NEETdom is, I absolutely can not imagine working 60 hours either. That's the stuff of nightmares. Shit even 40 hours seems like alot to me but my current internship work is reasonably chill and interesting so whatever I can bear it. Also it starts early in the morning so I also get to enjoy my free time later in the day



Sometimes I wonder if there's some kind of perfect balance between the two and if I'm close to it.


Worst case scenario: Long hours, shitty, high stress, physical, meaningless job with low pay.


Best case scenario: Low stress, six figs, less then 40 hours, enjoyable job but this is possible for only 1% of people and no job I can think off has this.



 So, i'm wondering if there's like a golden attainable ratios for the rest of us. What can we do? What is the perfect balance?"

I originally posted this on PersonalFinanceCanada and have been advised that fican may be more appropriate.

I'm looking for any investment advice or corrections to my current investment strategy. Some information that may be relevant:

\- My goal is to retire early (40 or earlier)

\- Currently have no kids, but would like to have 2 eventually

\- Income is \~90k a year with 10-20k bonus (works out to be $2700 semi-monthly, plus bonus)

\- No debt, scholarships covered my schooling expenses

\- Rent is $750/month, no utilities as my roommate covers all that

\- Discretionary expenses are \~$500-700/month

\- Remaining funds are invested into my portfolio (see below)

\- Fiance makes approximately the same that I do, similar expenses (we are very alike). He also has no debt and has net asset of approximately $50k

My investment portfolio consists of the following:

\- $250k in is XAW, VCN, and ZAG, allocations are roughly 60/20/20 respectively. Max'ed TFSA contribution and remaining in a taxable account

\- $50k is in an RRSP, allocations are long term etfs

**Question:** **Am I have too invested in index tracked etf's. Should I be more diversified?**

I am considering buying a condo in the neighbourhood of $350k and condo fees of 400/month. However I have not done so because I am likely to move due to my job and likely won't have a place to settle in for the next 3-5 years.

Any advice would be appreciated.

Thanks!!!

Edit:

People may wonder/ask, so I will explain the path I took to get to my current net worth for those interested

\- Started working at the age of 13, at a fast food restaurant. This was a pretty typical working age for fast food/retail jobs as it was before the financial crisis and it was very easy to find jobs. Almost all of my co-workers were in the 13-16 age range. My shifts were Saturday and Sunday 2pm-10pm. I always saved half of my money if not more. During the summer break, I would work 40 hours a week. I was not forced to do this, in fact I really enjoyed going to work because I had good friends (same age group). Had $10k by the time I was 18 doing this.

\- Started tutoring at the age of 16-23. I was very good at Math and Sciences and thought this would be better than fast food as it's higher pay and I won't need to commit as many hours. Originally was charging $20/h, went up to $40/h as I gained more experience and got references. Most of this was side money as I would average 5 hours a week, but this can go up to 10 hours in busier times (when report cards went out).

\- Got a large scholarship and several smaller scholarships. Totaled roughly $40k. Went to a local university and lived at my parents house until I graduated. Tuition was $6k a year. Still tutored off and on during my entire time at university. Had $50k before I started my internship.

\- Got a very good 16 month internship. Made $60k a year roughly. Still lived at my parents house. Still tutored during internship about 5 hours a week. Had $100k after my internship.

\- The company I interned at extended my contract to part time for my last year of university. So I would go into work before/after school. Not many hours though I kept it at around 10 hours a week so that I can still survive school (lol). Had probably still $100k after graduating, went on grad trip, etc etc.

\- The company hired me back full time when I graduated. I was very lucky and am still grateful to this day because this was not typical in my graduating year. Was (and still am) saving &gt;80%.

\- This year at work, I took on an out of town assignment which gave me nearly $40k in bonuses, in addition to my regular bonus.

It's 50% luck and 50% hard work. And for those still wondering, I travel 2-3x a year (it's one of my passions, budget travel usually) and go out with friends."
a1mi5r,6,2018-11-29,Sorry Mr. but you need experience to get experience,Isley_,recruitinghell,https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/a1mi5r/sorry_mr_but_you_need_experience_to_get_experience/,"Sorry but I'm gonna vent a little here. 

So, I finished my studies in August, I studied Computer Engineering in what would be a community college in the US. I did well. Not an expert but I know my stuff. Out of the 10 students we were I can confidently say I'm the one who knows the most about what we studied. 

I stated looking for jobs and got some interviews for programmer, IT assistant, tech support, but didn't get the job. All of them want one year of experience or more and there were always 30+ candidates (120 for the IT assistant one) to pay the equivalent of 394 USD per month. It isn't that good of a salary there but here it's not bad.  

I started getting desperate but I got an offer to work online. 6 USD per hour, six hours a week. All I needed was to know English which thank Zeus my mom sent me to a private school and learned it. If you do the math that's way more than what I'd get pay at the jobs I applied for. I worked for a little more than a month and saved about 1,000 USD. I helped with some house expendes with that. 
I'm my free time I studied about things I didn't learn at school so as not to get rusty. I wanted to practice programming but my PC is dead. I plan on buying a new one with what I've left. 

And so, a few days ago I got an offer for a junior programmer position saying experience wasn't needed, and Java school projects would do. I was happy, I have some projects in Java and C#. But in the phone interview they started asking if I'd used like 10 differnet Java and JavaScript frameworks.

I felt ashamed and disappointed with myself for having to say no to all of them. I know JQuery but that's about it. I'm no expert in any programming language I have some knowledge about. They told me they would contact me later -I didn't expect them to- and you can guess what didn't happen. 

Never stopped looking for jobs but it's always they same, I need more experience. That's logical. So I looked for some internships and apparently I need 6 months to one year of experience not only in programming but project management and some process stuff. But aren't internships for gaining experice? What did I get wrong here? 

I feel sad and also angry because some of my classmates, the ones that barely paid attention in class and didn't learn shit, they have jobs.         
The kind I applied for. They don't know shit, seriously. I knew this was going to happen since they have contacts and are always in parties and stuff but holy shit. Even my friend, the second in class, doesn't have a job related to what we studied and is barely making 200 USD a month. Why me? Why us? What the f*ck?

Sorry, this may not even be that related to this sub but I needed to get this off my chest. "
a1mket,5,2018-11-29,Closing the distance with some worries,confused33,LDR,https://www.reddit.com/r/LDR/comments/a1mket/closing_the_distance_with_some_worries/,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

I've been a lurker in this sub now and then when I needed some support from others in an LDR but it's time to post a wall of text mostly because I just need to tell my story to someone who might understand. 

&amp;#x200B;

My SO (M/24) and I (F/27) have been in a LDR for 5 years (!) and counting. We met and really hit it off for the 3 months doing an internship together where we practically lived together. I was hesitant to be in another LDR after a previous one that didn't work, but somehow we made it work all this time. For 2 years I was going to grad school on the east coast about 4-5 hours from him and we got to see each other twice a month or so. After I graduated, I moved back home to the West Coast and got a job while he got into an MD/PhD program in the deep South and since then, we've only been able to see each other every 3-4 months. Every time we visit, things are always smooth sailing and we're happy to be together. We have visited each other's family many times and everyone had always got along.

&amp;#x200B;

It makes the most sense that I would be the one moving since he's in school, so I've been looking for a job there since early this year.  I recently landed one in my field and pays enough so at least I'm not sacrificing my career when I move. However, my parents are traditional and mom is a bit worried about our future together and doesn't like the thought that I'm ""chasing after a guy"".  Moreover, my whole family/friends are here and it breaks my heart to leave them. I had already accepted the job and the move is in January but it was a difficult decision.  I don't know if I have fully processed the full scope of my decision yet and it's making me more nervous/scared than excited.  We plan on getting engaged in December partially to ease my parents worries, but I also wanted the commitment. There hasn't been any bad moments in our 5 years that would indicate us not working out and I feel like if I don't do this I would never really know if we would actually work in the future. It'd also bother me if we keep doing this LDR for another 4-5 years until he's done with school and hopefully move here.

&amp;#x200B;

With all that said, we've already made plans to move back to the West Coast once he's in his residency years after about 4.5 years if possible, and our end game is moving back here to be closer to my family. He had said he have no problem with that and understands how important my family is to me and how much I love the West Coast. I know everything is as planned out as someone could possibly hope for in a relationship but there is still part of me that is still worried and sad about how this had to proceed and how long 5 years is. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone here have made or is thinking about making a similar decision? Would love to hear your thoughts and how it have turned out if you have made the move already!

&amp;#x200B;

TL/DR: LDR for 5 years between West Coast and deep South. Almost picture-perfect relationship besides the distance. Getting engaged next month. I got a job and am closing the distance in Jan. but am nervous/sad/scared about leaving family, friends, and amazing area behind but feels like I cannot realistically take another 5 years of LDR until he's done with school. End game is already planned: move back to the West Coast together after \~5 years and he's optimistic it's going to happen. I'm still nervous as hell and it's getting in the way of feeling excitement of finally being together.

But it's been almost a month since my ex and I broke up. It has been a roller-coaster of a month but I'm in a much better place than I thought I would be at this point. I have made some new friends and cut out some toxic ones out of my life, I've had interviews for new internships I'm excited about, and things are overall improving. It hasn't been without major set backs of learning my ex is talking to other guys already, and he broke up with me for different reasons than what he told me.

I'm seeing a lot of the red flags that I missed while we were together. I'm realizing how blinded to all of the problems I was by the love I had for him. He was mean to me behind my back and I don't think he actually loved me for quite some time. I have mainly moved on from being sad to being angry. I don't really want to see him or talk to him ever again. He hurt me so much that I hope he gets some sort of karma from all that he did the last month of our relationship.

Things are getting better and will continue to do so. For everyone out there struggling, I know it doesn't feel like it'll get better but it does. Just give it time and keep yourself busy! Stay strong:) "

Vraag 1  
&amp;nbsp;    
Kent u het bericht ‘Ik probeerde de vaderlandse verkiezingen te saboteren via Facebook. Ging aardig’ van Brandpunt? 1&amp;#41;  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 1  
Ja.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vragen 3, 4 en 5  
&amp;nbsp;    
Kent u meer voorbeelden van nepadvertenties die de afgelopen tijd daadwerkelijk op Facebook zijn geplaatst? Zo ja, welke voorbeelden kent u? Zo nee, waarom niet en bent u bereid dit alsnog te laten onderzoeken?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Kunt u bij benadering aangeven hoeveel Nederlanders de afgelopen tijd zijn geconfronteerd met dergelijke nepadvertenties? Zo nee, waarom niet?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Kunt u aangeven welke entiteiten dergelijke nepadvertenties verspreiden? Zo nee, waarom niet? Zo ja, welk percentage is afkomstig van buitenlandse mogendheden?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord vragen 3,4 en 5  
&amp;nbsp;    
Er zijn mij geen voorbeelden van dergelijke geplaatste advertenties bekend, ik kan daarom ook niets zeggen over hoeveel Nederlanders bereikt zijn met dergelijke advertenties of wie deze advertenties verspreiden. Facebook heeft mij toegezegd een archief voor politieke advertenties te maken, dat ook alle verwijderde politieke advertenties zal bevatten en de advertenties die maar kort zichtbaar zijn geweest. Dit archief zal openbaar toegankelijk zijn. Onderzoekers en journalisten kunnen hier eveneens gebruik van maken.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Vragen 2,6 en 8  
&amp;nbsp;    
Deelt u de mening dat het in Nederland bijzonder makkelijk is om via Facebook nepinformatie te verspreiden en daarmee de verkiezingen te beïnvloeden? Zo nee, waarom niet? Zo ja, wat gaat u daaraan doen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Deelt u de mening dat het voorkomen van dergelijke nepadvertenties een lage prioriteit heeft bij Facebook? Zo ja, wat gaat u daaraan doen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Hoe kijkt u aan tegen de verplichting een identiteitsbewijs te tonen als iemand een politieke advertentie wil plaatsen? Bent u bereid dat in te voeren? Zo nee, waarom niet?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord vragen 2,6 en 8  
&amp;nbsp;    
Met Facebook spreek ik regelmatig over de maatschappelijke verantwoordelijkheid die bedrijven zoals Facebook hebben aangaande de betrouwbaarheid en kwaliteit van berichtgeving die wordt verspreid via online platforms, het vergroten van transparantie dienaangaande en welke maatregelen zij nemen. Zodoende heb ik hen ook aangespoord om maatregelen te treffen. Ook vanuit Europa worden bedrijven gestimuleerd om maatregelen te treffen. Als onderdeel van de Mededeling van de Commissie inzake een Europese aanpak van desinformatie is een gedragscode ‘Code of practice on disinformation’ opgesteld door onder andere bedrijven en adverteerders. Facebook heeft deze code ook ondertekend. Ik hecht aan transparantie in het algemeen en in het bijzonder ten aanzien van politieke advertenties. Een gedragscode vind ik een geëigend middel om transparantie te bevorderen.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Facebook heeft de afgelopen tijd een aantal maatregelen genomen, waaronder het bieden van meer transparantie over &amp;#40;politieke&amp;#41; advertenties. Ook detecteren en verwijderen zij nepaccounts, en verminderen zij het economische gewin voor degenen die onjuiste informatie verspreiden. Deze punten zijn ook opgenomen in de gedragscode.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Ik zal hieronder ingaan op de inzichtelijkheid van advertenties en de maatregelen die Facebook neemt zoals dat aan de orde is gekomen in gesprekken met Facebook. Het is wel mijn indruk dat het bedrijf de problematiek rond dit soort advertenties serieus neemt. Uiteraard dient het beleid van Facebook ook geïmplementeerd en overeenkomstig uitgevoerd te worden. Het bericht van Brandpunt maakt duidelijk dat de uitvoering van hun beleid op punten nog verbeterd kan worden.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Geplaatste advertenties in Nederland zijn te herkennen aan de tekst ‘gesponsord’ die bij een post staat. Sinds afgelopen zomer is er een tab ‘informatie en advertenties’ toegevoegd aan iedere Facebookpagina. Deze tab laat zien welke advertenties een pagina heeft uitstaan op Facebook, Instagram, Messenger en hun partnernetwerk. Ook de advertenties die niet gericht zijn op de gebruiker zijn daar te zien, ook als deze de pagina niet volgt. Daarnaast kunnen gebruikers onder deze tab informatie vinden over de pagina zoals de datum dat de pagina aangemaakt is en of deze naamswijzigingen heeft gehad.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Voordat advertenties geplaatst worden zegt Facebook een evaluatieproces door te lopen waarin o.a. de afbeelding, tekst en doelgroep van de advertentie bekeken worden. Advertenties kunnen niet goedgekeurd worden als ze niet in overeenstemming zijn met het advertentiebeleid van Facebook. Hierin staat onder meer dat misleidende of valse advertenties verboden zijn en advertenties die de community richtlijnen van Facebook overtreden. Zo mogen er geen berichten mogen worden geplaatst die kiezers belemmeren te stemmen, bijvoorbeeld door het noemen van verkeerde data, locaties, tijden en methoden om te stemmen. Gebruikers kunnen advertenties ook rapporteren wanneer deze geplaatst zijn. Op basis hiervan kan een advertentie alsnog verwijderd worden. Naar aanleiding van het bericht van Brandpunt heeft Facebook gemeld intern te onderzoeken hoe het kon gebeuren dat de in het artikel genoemde advertenties werden goedgekeurd.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Facebook werkt aan het verbeteren van de verificatie van politieke adverteerders door middel van het gebruik van een Identiteitsbewijs en de locatie van die adverteerder. Facebook is, zoals gezegd, tevens van plan een archief voor politieke advertenties te maken. Een dergelijk archief is in de Verenigde Staten en Brazilië reeds ingevoerd. Facebook kon mij geen exacte data noemen waarop deze functionaliteiten beschikbaar zullen komen, maar het richt zich op het voorjaar van 2019. Facebook zegt deze functionaliteit in alle EU-landen beschikbaar te willen stellen met het oog op de verkiezingen van de leden van het Europese Parlement, maar geeft tegelijkertijd aan dat het een complex proces is.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 7  
&amp;nbsp;    
Deelt u de mening dat dergelijke nepadvertenties onze democratie kunnen ondermijnen? Zo ja, kunt u de Kamer garanderen dat dit voor de Statenverkiezingen is uitgebannen? Welke maatregelen gaat u daarvoor nemen? Zo nee, hoe kunt u dan nog eerlijke verkiezingen garanderen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 7  
Het is zorgelijk dat deze advertenties door het evaluatieproces zijn gekomen en daardoor geplaatst hadden kunnen worden. Dat is natuurlijk niet de bedoeling. Door het signaleren hiervan, zoals Brandpunt heeft gedaan, vervullen media hun controlerende taak. Daarmee wordt Facebook op scherp gezet en kunnen zij hun procedures nagaan en verbeteren. Garanderen dat zoiets zich niet opnieuw kan voordoen, kan ik niet. Dit betekent echter niet dat er dan geen sprake kan zijn van eerlijke verkiezingen. Het evaluatieproces van advertenties van Facebook is slechts een van de maatregelen die bedrijven nemen om transparantie te bevorderen en desinformatie tegen te gaan. Transparantie over advertenties kan mensen helpen bij het beoordelen van de informatie die hen bereikt. Ik ben daarom positief over het feit dat verschillende partijen, waaronder Facebook, de ‘code of practice on disinformation’ hebben ondertekend. In de praktijk moet nog blijken in hoeverre de inspanningen van deze bedrijven voldoende zijn.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Facebook heeft in aanloop naar de verkiezingen van dit voorjaar een multidisciplinair team samengesteld dat de grootste uitdagingen aan het analyseren is. Daarbij probeert Facebook ook de Nederlandse context in ogenschouw te nemen.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 9  
&amp;nbsp;    
Deelt u de mening dat ook in Europees verband maatregelen nodig zijn om vrije verkiezingen te beschermen? Zo ja, welk initiatief daartoe gaat u ondernemen en aan welke maatregelen denkt u? Zo nee, waarom niet?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Het onderwerp online desinformatie staat vanwege het grensoverschrijdende karakter nadrukkelijk op de agenda van de EU. Verschillende partijen hebben inmiddels de “code of practice on disinformation” ondertekend.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Nederland is positief over deelname van bedrijven aan de gedragscode op Europees niveau. Middels deze gedragscode committeren sociale mediabedrijven zich onder andere aan het nemen van hun verantwoordelijkheid om maatregelen te treffen ter bevordering van transparantie online. De Hoge Vertegenwoordiger en de Commissie zijn tijdens de Europese Raad eind juni uitgenodigd om voor het einde van 2018 specifieke maatregelen te presenteren voor een gecoördineerde aanpak van desinformatie.

Hello ladies of APP

I am a male looking to play younger with a female looking to play older. I would be the dominant partner in this particular scene and it would focus on the younger partner using you for his desires, working out his frustrations with girls his age on you. 

It would, ideally, involve him sitting on your face and smothering you with his balls and undercarriage. That’s not all it would include, but that is a particular favorite of mine that I would like to explore more. 

I’m flexible on to roles though I would like to avoid direct incest — if you’re a good enough writer I will consider it, it’s just not my favorite. Currently I’ve been enjoying the concept of a teenage summer intern and the female boss who is supposed to be in charge but finds herself submitting. 

If you’re interested, please send me one of those orange envelopes. Thanks!"

&amp;nbsp;    
Vragen van de leden Omtzigt en Ronnes &amp;#40;beiden CDA&amp;#41; aan de staatssecretaris van Financiën en de minister van Financiën over ING, dat de balans met 180 miljard euro bijstelde, de accountant die niet weet wat onder die post valt, de bank die zo bankenbelasting bespaarde en vervroegd staatssteun afloste in 2014 en begon met het uitbetalen van bonussen &amp;#40;ingezonden 6 november 2018&amp;#41;  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 1  
&amp;nbsp;    
Herinnert u zich de antwoorden op Kamervragen over het bericht dat ING dat haar balans over 2014 en 2015 aanpaste met meer dan 180 miljard euro? 1&amp;#41;   
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vraag 1  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ja.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 2  
&amp;nbsp;    
Heeft u kennisgenomen van het stuk “Fiscus liep 153 miljoen mis doordat ING haar balans oppoetste – foutje bedankt!"" 2&amp;#41;  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vraag 2  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ja.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 3  
&amp;nbsp;    
Herinnert u zich dat u geen voorbeeld kon noemen van enig ander bedrijf in Nederland dat ooit zijn balans heeft moeten bijstellen voor 180 miljard euro en heeft u ondertussen al een ander bedrijf kunnen vinden dat ooit zo’n gigantische balanscorrectie heeft doorgevoerd?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vraag 3  
&amp;nbsp;    
In mijn brief d.d. 16 oktober jl. ben ik ingegaan op de presentatie van cash pooling in de verslaglegging van banken. De internationale verslaggevingsstandaarden staan toe dat bedrijven, zoals ING, cijfers op netto basis presenteren indien naar de mening van het bedrijf en haar accountant aan de door de International Accounting Standards Board &amp;#40;IASB&amp;#41; gestelde voorwaarden wordt voldaan. Mijn begrip van de openbare verslaglegging was toen - en is nu nog steeds - als volgt. In de verslaglegging van ING over de jaren 2014, 2015 en 2016 is cash pooling op netto basis gepresenteerd. Deze verslaglegging is voor zover bekend op dit onderwerp niet bijgesteld of gecorrigeerd. In de verslaglegging over 2016 zijn vergelijkende cijfers voor de jaren 2014 en 2015 op bruto basis gepresenteerd.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 4  
&amp;nbsp;    
Herinnert u zich dat u ABN Amro en Rabobank noemde als andere voorbeelden van banken die hun balans hebben bijgesteld en kunt u aangeven voor hoeveel zij hun balans over die jaren hebben bijgesteld?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vraag 4  
&amp;nbsp;    
De verwijzing zag op het feit dat meerdere banken, ten aanzien van cash pooling, in de verslaglegging zowel bruto als netto bedragen presenteren. Ik heb in die beantwoording niet gesteld dat de verslaglegging bij deze banken is “bijgesteld”. Voor het verschil in omvang tussen de bruto en netto posities verwijs ik u naar de openbare verslaglegging van de desbetreffende banken.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 5  
&amp;nbsp;    
Is het dus waar dat de correctie op de balans bij ING, die in een summiere voetnoot werd toegelicht, uniek was in omvang?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vraag 5  
&amp;nbsp;    
In het algemeen leidt het netteren van cash pooling activiteiten in de geconsolideerde balans tot een lager balanstotaal. Ik beschik niet over informatie dat hier sprake zou zijn van een unieke situatie.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 6  
&amp;nbsp;    
Heeft u gehoord dat op de hoorzitting in de Kamer van de zijde van Ernst &amp; Young &amp;#40;EY&amp;#41;, medeverantwoordelijk voor de accountantscontrole bij ING, door prof. De Bos op vragen van Kamerlid Ronnes over deze 180 miljard euro correctie is geantwoord: ""U moet me niet vragen wat de onderliggende posten zijn"" ? 3&amp;#41;  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vraag 6  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ja.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 7  
&amp;nbsp;    
Wat is de waarde van een jaarrekening, als je die voor 180 miljard euro mag corrigeren en als de accountant niet weet wat de onderliggende posten zijn?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vraag 7  
&amp;nbsp;    
Op basis van internationale verslaggevingsstandaarden mogen bedrijven het nettobedrag opnemen indien de onderneming: &amp;#40;a&amp;#41; een in rechte afdwingbaar recht heeft om de opgenomen bedragen te salderen; en &amp;#40;b&amp;#41; voornemens is om de verplichting op nettobasis af te wikkelen of om de vordering te realiseren op hetzelfde moment dat de verplichting wordt afgewikkeld. Met andere woorden, zowel in juridische zin als in economische zin moet er een rechtvaardiging zijn om te netteren. Ik hecht aan een goede vergelijkbaarheid van de financiële positie van beursgenoteerde ondernemingen door aan te sluiten bij deze internationale verslaggevingsstandaarden.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 8  
&amp;nbsp;    
Weet u wat de onderliggende posten van de correctie van 180 miljard euro zijn? Zo ja, wat zijn die dan?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vraag 8  
&amp;nbsp;    
Cash pooling wordt met name gebruikt door bedrijven met meerdere rekeningen en activiteiten in verschillende landen. Bij het poolen van meerdere rekeningen van één klant kunnen positieve en negatieve standen van de klant worden gesaldeerd. Die saldering kan ertoe leiden dat cijfers op grond van internationale verslagleggingstandaarden ook op netto basis gepresenteerd mogen worden.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 9  
&amp;nbsp;    
Kunt u specificeren waar de post 'other' onder customer deposits op pagina's 228 en 229 van de jaarrekening 2016 uit bestaat? Bevat die post uitsluitend cash of ook andere financiële instrumenten? Betreft de volledige correctie uitsluitend 'notional cash pooling' producten?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vraag 9  
&amp;nbsp;    
Zie het antwoord op vraag 8. Hierover heb ik niet meer informatie dan beschikbaar in de openbare verslaglegging.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 10  
&amp;nbsp;    
Indien u niet met absolute zekerheid kunt zeggen wat die onderliggende posten zijn, wilt u dan bij ING en/of de accountant en/of de toezichthouder opheldering vragen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vraag 10  
&amp;nbsp;    
Het is niet aan mij om “met absolute zekerheid” uitspraken te doen over onderliggende posten van individuele banken. Het ministerie is niet verantwoordelijk voor de inhoud van de verslaglegging van individuele banken. Het is aan de accountant om de jaarrekening te controleren op basis van de standaarden. De AFM houdt toezicht op de financiële verslaggeving van effectenuitgevende instellingen.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 11  
&amp;nbsp;    
Weet De Nederlandsche Bank &amp;#40;DNB&amp;#41; als toezichthouder wat de onderliggende posten van de correctie van 180 miljard euro zijn? Zo ja, wat zijn die dan?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vraag 11  
&amp;nbsp;    
Het is aan de prudentiële toezichthouder om - los van de jaarlijkse verslaggeving - te controleren of de prudentiële rapportage door banken volgens de daarvoor geldende regels geschiedt. De prudentiële toezichthouder doet geen mededelingen over het toezicht op individuele banken. Het is aan de accountant om de jaarrekening te controleren op basis van de standaarden. De AFM houdt vervolgens toezicht op de financiële verslaggeving van effectenuitgevende instellingen.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 12  
&amp;nbsp;    
Herinnert u zich dat u via een grafiek in bedekte termen meedeelde dat de leverage ratio van ING eind 2015 3,6% bedroeg, na de balanscorrectie?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vraag 12  
&amp;nbsp;    
Uit publieke jaarverslagen valt af te leiden dat ING over de jaren 2014 en 2015, de leverage ratio, met cash pooling zowel op netto basis als bruto basis rapporteerde. Met cash pooling op netto basis bedroeg de leverage ratio van ING 3,6% over 2014. Op bruto basis was dit 4,1%. Het is aan de prudentiële toezichthouder om - los van de jaarlijkse verslaggeving - te controleren of de prudentiële rapportage door banken volgens de daarvoor geldende regels geschiedt.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 13  
&amp;nbsp;    
Is het waar dat de minimaal vereiste leverage ratio van ING 4% bedroeg in die tijd en dat ING met een leverage ratio van 3,6% helemaal niet de laatste staatssteun had mogen aflossen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vraag 13  
&amp;nbsp;    
In 2014 heeft de toenmalige minister van Financiën aangegeven dat de Nederlandse systeembanken tot en met 2018 moesten streven naar een leverage ratio van minimaal 4%. Dit was geen wettelijke ondergrens. DNB heeft toen aangegeven dat alle banken een leverage ratio doelstelling hebben opgenomen in hun meerjarige kapitaalplanning. In de toekomst zullen consequenties gelden bij het niet voldoen aan een wettelijke minimum leverage ratio eis.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 14  
&amp;nbsp;    
Indien de kapitaal ratio 3,6% was, had ING dan toestemming gekregen om de laatste tranche staatssteun terug te betalen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vraag 14  
&amp;nbsp;    
Zoals ik ook onder vraag 13 heb aangegeven, speelde deze situatie niet bij de terugbetaling van de staatssteun. In 2008 nam Nederland een maatregel waarbij de Nederlandse Staat 10 mld euro aan effecten, uitgegeven door ING, in handen nam. Met de Europese Commissie zijn afspraken gemaakt over de terugbetaling. De laatste terugbetaling is in 2014 voldaan.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 15  
&amp;nbsp;    
Is het waar dat alleen omdat ING de staatssteun had afgelost in november 2014, in maart 2015 kon worden overgegaan tot forse salarisverhogingen voor de top, zoals voor de heren Hamers, Nagel en Flynn en de uitkering van bonussen? 4&amp;#41;  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vraag 15  
&amp;nbsp;    
Met de Europese Commissie zijn, naast het vragen van een redelijke vergoeding voor de steun, ook afspraken gemaakt over beloningen. Naast deze afspraken gold sinds 2011 voor ING in verband met de staatssteun onder meer een verbod op salarisverhoging en uitkering van variabele beloningen voor de top ingevolge de voorloper van de Wet beloningsbeleid financiële ondernemingen &amp;#40;Wbfo&amp;#41;.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Vanaf terugbetaling van de staatssteun gelden deze beloningsregels en afspraken niet meer, maar gelden onverkort de regels van de Wbfo, waaronder een bonusplafond van 20% van de vaste beloning en de mogelijkheid tot terugvordering en aanpassing van variabele beloningen &amp;#40;claw back en malus&amp;#41;. Daarnaast moet de beloning voldoen aan de vereisten voor een ‘beheerst beloningsbeleid’. Hierbij blijft het van belang dat de raad van commissarissen van banken zich steeds rekenschap geeft van de maatschappelijke context en de huidige situatie in ogenschouw neemt.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 16  
&amp;nbsp;    
Herinnert u zich dat u schreef: “het ministerie is in 2015 door ING op de hoogte gesteld van het feit dat het wel of niet netteren van «cash pooling» van invloed kan zijn op de totale blootstelling van een bank en daarmee ook de leverage ratio""?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vraag 16  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ja.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 17  
&amp;nbsp;    
Kunt u de datum noemen waarop het ministerie op de hoogte gesteld is en het desbetreffende document &amp;#40;brief, memo, e-mail of dergelijke&amp;#41; waarin dat staat, aan de Kamer doen toekomen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vraag 17  
&amp;nbsp;    
Op 29 januari 2015 heeft ING tijdens een bijpraatgesprek op het ministerie aangekaart dat het wel of niet netteren van cash pooling van invloed kan zijn op de leverage ratio. Naar aanleiding hiervan heeft mijn ambtsvoorganger intern gevraagd om meer informatie over de nettering van cash pooling binnen de berekening van de leverage ratio. Daarna is mijn ambtsvoorganger geïnformeerd dat het aan de prudentiële toezichthouder is om - los van de jaarlijkse verslaggeving - te controleren of de prudentiële rapportage door banken volgens de daarvoor geldende regels geschiedt. Zoals aangegeven in eerdere beantwoording, eist het voorstel van de Europese Commissie ten aanzien van de kapitaaleisen dat fysieke saldering van cash pools dagelijks – of naar mening van de toezichthouder frequent genoeg – plaatsvindt. De onderhandelingen over dit voorstel zijn nog niet afgerond.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 18  
&amp;nbsp;    
Waarom heeft uw ambtsvoorganger toen hij dit hoorde geen actie ondernomen op het gebied van terugbetaling van staatssteun en terugvorderen van de bonussen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vraag 18  
&amp;nbsp;    
Dit was toen niet aan de orde. Zie de antwoorden op vragen 13, 14 en 17.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 19  
&amp;nbsp;    
Heeft ING een foutherstel doorgevoerd of een stelselwijziging, aangezien dit niet staat in het jaarverslag?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vraag 19  
&amp;nbsp;    
Voor zover ik op basis van openbare stukken kan zien heeft ING geen “foutherstel” doorgevoerd ten aanzien van de verslaglegging over de jaren 2014, 2015 of 2016. Of dit nodig was is overigens niet aan mij maar aan ING en de controlerend accountant. In de verslaglegging van ING over 2016 wordt uitgelegd dat ING in de loop van 2016 haar beleid heeft gewijzigd waardoor saldering aan het einde van elke verslaggevingsperiode plaatsvindt. Dit wordt toegelicht op pagina’s 121 en 122 van de verslaglegging van ING over 2016 en leidt tot een wijziging van de vergelijkende bedragen. Zie voor de juiste terminologie mijn antwoord op vraag 20.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 20  
&amp;nbsp;    
Indien ING voor de wijziging een vrijwillige stelselwijziging heeft doorgevoerd, heeft u dan in de jaarrekening kunnen aantreffen &amp;#40;conform International Accounting Standards 8.29&amp;#41;: “de aard van de stelselwijziging; de redenen waarom het nieuwe stelsel betrouwbare en meer relevante informatie geeft; het bedrag van de aanpassing voor de huidige periode en voor elke voorafgaande periode; het bedrag van de aanpassingen met betrekking tot perioden voorafgaand aan de perioden die in de vergelijkende cijfers worden gerapporteerd; indien van toepassing, de omstandigheden die ertoe hebben geleid dat het praktisch niet mogelijk is om de stelselwijziging geheel of gedeeltelijk met terugwerkende kracht toe te passen en een beschrijving van hoe en vanaf wanneer de stelselwijziging wel is doorgevoerd.” Zo, ja waar heeft u die kunnen aantreffen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vraag 20  
&amp;nbsp;    
Officiële vertalingen van IAS-standaarden treft u aan in het Publicatieblad van de Europese Unie. Daar wordt niet gesproken over een “stelselwijziging”. Wel wordt gesproken over “wijzigingen in de grondslagen voor financiële verslaggeving” &amp;#40;ook wel: “changes in accounting policies”&amp;#41;. In de verslaglegging van ING over 2016 wordt uitgelegd dat ING in de loop van 2016 haar beleid heeft gewijzigd waardoor saldering aan het einde van elke verslaggevingsperiode plaatsvindt. Dit wordt toegelicht op pagina’s 121 en 122 van de verslaglegging van ING over 2016 en leidt tot een wijziging van de vergelijkende bedragen. Het is aan de accountant om de jaarrekening te controleren op basis van de standaarden. De AFM houdt vervolgens toezicht op de financiële verslaggeving van effectenuitgevende instellingen.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 21  
&amp;nbsp;    
Indien het een verplichte stelstelwijziging betrof, heeft u dan kunnen ontdekken welke wijziging inging?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vraag 21  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ik verwijs naar mijn antwoorden op vraag 19 en 20.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 22  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ben u op de hoogte dat de International Swaps and Derivatives Association &amp;#40;ISDA&amp;#41; master netting agreement/Credit Support Annex niet voldeed aan de verrekeningscriteria onder de International Financial Reporting Standards &amp;#40;IFRS&amp;#41; en daarom een probleem opleverde toen in 2013 IFRS 7 werd ingevoerd, omdat derivatenposities niet genetteerd mochten worden?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vraag 22  
&amp;nbsp;    
Nee, deze specifieke casus is mij niet bekend. Wel zijn er onder de internationale standaarden eveneens strikte regels verbonden aan het netteren van derivaten, net als dat geldt voor cash pooling. Zo mogen er bijvoorbeeld geen verschillende tegenpartijrisico’s tegen elkaar weggestreept worden. In beginsel is netteren alleen toegestaan op het moment dat dit economisch en juridisch gerechtvaardigd is. Het is aan de accountant om de jaarrekening te controleren op basis van de standaarden die voor verslaggeving gelden. De AFM houdt vervolgens toezicht op de financiële verslaggeving van effectenuitgevende instellingen.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 23  
&amp;nbsp;    
Kunt u melden, nu banken zoals Deutsche Bank melding maken van het feit dat deze master netting agreements niet voldeden, hoe ING Bank dat sinds 2013 &amp;#40;presentatie IFRS 7&amp;#41; heeft opgelost?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vraag 23  
&amp;nbsp;    
Nee. Het ministerie is niet verantwoordelijk voor de inhoud van de verslaglegging van individuele banken. Indien het netteren van bepaalde derivaten op grond van de internationale standaarden niet zou zijn toegestaan, worden ze bruto getoond op de balans.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 24  
&amp;nbsp;    
Is er tussen ING en uw ambtsvoorgangers en/of het ministerie in de jaren 2011 tot het einde van de staatssteun gesproken over de problematiek met betrekking tot de master netting agreements? Zo ja, kunt u daarover details geven?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vraag 24  
&amp;nbsp;    
Zie mijn antwoorden op vragen 22 en 23.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 25  
&amp;nbsp;    
Hoe beoordeelt u het feit dat ING gewacht heeft tot begin 2017 met een megacorrectie, terwijl de bank al bij brief van accountant EY van 29 februari 2016 erover was ingelicht dat een correctie nodig was? 5&amp;#41;  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vraag 25   
&amp;nbsp;    
In de bron &amp;#40;“brief van accountant EY van 29 februari 2016”&amp;#41; wordt niet gezegd dat een correctie van eerdere jaarverslaglegging nodig is noch was. Zie o.a. ook het antwoord op vraag 8.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 26  
&amp;nbsp;    
Weet u of de vraag aan het International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee &amp;#40;IFRIC&amp;#41; van november 2015 afkomstig is van ING, een van haar accountants &amp;#40;EY of KPMG&amp;#41;, dan wel een van de andere Nederlandse staatsbanken? Zo ja, van wie is deze vraag dan afkomstig?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vraag 26  
&amp;nbsp;    
Nee het is mij niet bekend wie die vraag heeft gesteld. Overigens kan elke “stakeholder” een vraag stellen aan het IFRIC.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 27  
&amp;nbsp;    
Heeft ING extra bankenbelasting &amp;#40;rond de 160 miljoen euro&amp;#41; betaald vanwege de aangepaste jaarrekening?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vraag 27  
&amp;nbsp;    
Op grond van artikel 67 AWR kan ik geen uitlatingen doen over de fiscale positie van een individuele belastingplichtige.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 28  
&amp;nbsp;    
Moet een bank in zijn algemeenheid bankenbelasting nabetalen als het zijn balans corrigeert en maakt het daarbij nog uit of het om een foutherstel of om een stelselwijziging gaat? Kunt u dit toelichten?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vraag 28  
&amp;nbsp;    
Bij de heffing van de bankenbelasting is het de verantwoordelijkheid van de belastingplichtige om tijdig een juiste en volledige aangifte in te dienen en de verschuldigde belasting te voldoen. Het is de verantwoordelijkheid van de inspecteur om toezicht op deze aangifte uit te oefenen.   
&amp;nbsp;    
De bankenbelasting wordt geheven over het &amp;#40;geconsolideerde&amp;#41; balanstotaal uit de commerciële jaarrekening ultimo boekjaar, verminderd met – kort gezegd – het kernkapitaal, de onder een depositogarantiestelsel gedekte deposito’s en verzekeringspassiva. Een aanpassing van de balans kan leiden tot een toename van de grondslag en het belastbare bedrag. Indien dat het geval is, dient de belastingplichtige – voor zover al aangifte is gedaan – een herziene aangifte in te dienen. Mocht de belastingplichtige dit nalaten, dan bestaat er voor de Belastingdienst de mogelijkheid om een naheffingsaanslag op te leggen.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 29  
&amp;nbsp;    
Welk overleg hebben u en uw ambtsvoorganger, dan wel ambtenaren namens u, gehad met ING en zijn accountants over de jaarrekeningen van 2014, 2015 en 2016? Kun u een lijst geven van gesprekken en zaken die besproken zijn?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vraag 29  
&amp;nbsp;    
De minister of staatssecretaris van Financiën zijn niet verantwoordelijk voor de inhoud van de jaarlijkse verslaglegging van individuele banken. Dat zijn de individuele banken zelf. De controlerend accountant ziet erop toe dat voldaan wordt aan de internationale verslaggevingstandaarden. De minister of de staatssecretaris voeren dan ook geen overleg met banken of hun accountants over de toepassing van de internationale verslaggevingstandaarden in de praktijk.   
&amp;nbsp;    
De inspecteur van de Belastingdienst voert wel gesprekken met individuele belastingplichtigen, maar niet namens de staatssecretaris of minister van Financiën. Het is aan de inspecteur om te beoordelen of een belastingplichtige aan zijn fiscale verplichtingen heeft voldaan. Op grond van artikel 67 AWR kan ik echter geen uitlatingen doen over de belastingpositie van een individuele belastingplichtige.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 30  
&amp;nbsp;    
Bent u ervan op de hoogte dat de accountantskantoren die ING controleerden &amp;#40;EY en KPMG&amp;#41; ook feitelijk de asset quality review &amp;#40;AQR&amp;#41; in 2014 bij het begin van de bankenunie hebben uitgevoerd?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vraag 30  
&amp;nbsp;    
In 2014 heeft de toezichthouder ondersteuning gezocht van externen voor het uitvoeren van audits, taxaties, controles, modellering en procesbegeleiding. De prudentiële aanpak was echter een andere dan de gangbare verslaglegging op basis van internationale verslaggevingsstandaarden. DNB heeft mij laten weten dat de selectieprocedure van externen potentiële belangenconflicten in ogenschouw nam en dat geen accountantskantoor werk uitvoerde voor een bank waarvoor zij op dat moment ook externe accountant was.  
&amp;nbsp;

I'm a junior in college and am looking for a UI related internship. I was wondering what the competition is like across the US for Interface Design jobs. For example, I know San Francisco (and the general Bay Area) is *very* competitive, whereas Washington DC might not be as cut-throat. How does the software culture differ across different cities? Are there any other hot spots around the US in city-like settings that have demand for interns?

My company is getting ready to start advertising for seasonal help for the upcoming rental season. Usually, we hire on two leasing agents in January to show properties during the on season and keep them on for about eight months, give or take the success of the season overall. 

One of the conundrums we've faced in the past is not finding quality candidates. The state college in town used to require an internship for their real estate business program but after changing their requirements, it's been very difficult to find qualified candidates who have an interest in real estate/property management. 

Have any of you experienced this? How have you overcome the associated difficulties?

Thanks, all! "

He was really nice and we ended up hooking up. Then one night his friend said that the other guy had said I was kinda a slut and that he would like me.

Bit of an unusual post, but I need to vent. I've been streaming for the past 2.5 years, had many ups and downs and recently started my job after graduating from uni. While I was in uni I had a few internships which caused me to stream way less, but I always kept the passion. Now I'm working and I feel like I've reached the end of my channel. I dont have a schedule and when I stream there are way less people than the period between graduating and starting my job. I was really growing. But when I started working it all seemed to have calmed down and now my streams are 40% of viewers than I normally have. The reason I haven't quit yet is because of my community. I can't leave them behind. There are people that have supported me for years. But I feel unmotivated. I want to spend my time with my SO, rather than stressing about Twitch. But I also can't quit streaming, because it has always meant a great deal to me ..

Any advice? I really appreciate it. ♥️

Thank you and have a nice day/evening. "

Heroes of the Realm,

&amp;nbsp;

Thanksgiving is over and Oryx is well aware that his Turkey is nowhere to be found. The busy God he is, he can’t just leave his castle to search for that green-feathered escapee.

&amp;nbsp;

Oryx sent his intern Craig to the Realm to find his Turkey and bring it back. While Craig was searching for it, he came across some treasures hidden in the Realm. Being a great and generous guy, he decided to collect them all and put them in an event chest, for all of you! But don’t tell Oryx, okay?

&amp;nbsp;

To keep both the chest and himself safe from Oryx’s wrath, he put a spell on the treasure box so that it appears only when the realm is closed.

&amp;nbsp;

Race against the clock to find the Chest and break it open! Some valuable things can be found inside it.

Its been an phenomenal experience and I believe I had much success in it. Since I've hit the 2-weeks left mark, I've this tremendous anxiety about being leaving the internships unemployed. Since the beginning, I've always told myself everything is earned and nothing is given, don't ever except a full time offer to come your way. To this day, there's has been nothing. Yesterday, the department had a lunch and they all told me that the work I did was excellent and I should be very proud. While I think I did my best to put on a happy face, inside I just felt this feeling of panic. To them, it was time to celebrate the hard work I did, but to me my mind was going on overload to think about what's next for me. I just felt this overwhelming fear and sadness at a lunch that was supposed to be joyous. I don't consider myself a very anxious person but this has just been taking an absolute toll on me. I'm doing everything in my power to buckle down and get the finish line with a smile on my face. However, each day closer just makes me more anxious.

a1uzbh,46,2018-11-30,[GIVING ADVICE] The importance of believing you CAN get BETTER at screenwriting,writerlike,Screenwriting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/a1uzbh/giving_advice_the_importance_of_believing_you_can/,"I’ve always been the type to believe anyone can achieve just about anything if they put their mind to it. Even though I struggle like anyone else with self-doubt, it is this steadfast belief that I can become better, faster, stronger as a writer the more I work at it that keeps me going. 

I often see people, some on this sub, with limiting beliefs. Saying things like “I’m not good at this or that” so I’m not even going to try. Or basically just being defeated and making it sound like they will never get where they want to go. The truth is, if you believe you can’t, you won’t. 

If you believe you can, you at least have a chance. 

I’ve been working on my craft as a screenwriter since the very first screenwriting class I took in college thirteen years ago. We had one assignment for that class which was to write a short film. It took me an entire semester but eventually, I completed a nineteen page short. The first piece of dramatic writing I had ever done in my entire life. 

Let me tell you — it was garbage. The formatting was wrong, the characters were paper thin, the description was overwritten and the dialogue was almost entirely cliches. It was so bad that if someone had read it and wanted to tell me that screenwriting probably wasn’t for me and maybe I should pursue a different career, they wouldn’t be faulted for thinking that. 

But I persisted. I worked in production, I learned how to shoot, light and edit. I competed in film races. I spent the better part of the next six years working in every aspect of the business I possibly could. I took development internships and read tons and tons of scripts. I worked for a talent agent. I was a producer’s assistant. I directed TV commercials. I did a lot of things that were tangentially related to the craft of screenwriting that gave me insights I’ve taken with me and used in my own work. Yet, after all of it, I still wasn’t writing enough or at the level I needed to if I wanted to have a screenwriting career. 

So seven years ago I decided to put my efforts into screenwriting at a level I hadn’t yet before. Truly committing to it and deciding that if I was going to get better at it, I needed to practice — a lot. Over the course of the last seven years, I’ve written more shorts than I can count, more practice scenes than I can count, four features and two pilots. And currently, I’m halfway through my fifth feature that I hope to finish before the end of the year. 

I also spent nearly two and a half years taking screenwriting classes that were invaluable to my growth as a writer. Don’t sleep on workshops. They can and do work if you’re willing to open your mind up and be a sponge. 

My first feature was crap. My second feature was worse. My third nearly got optioned by two different production companies. My fourth is better than my third in some ways but worse in others. My fifth however, is already turning out to be better than all of them — by a long shot. 

My reason for sharing all of this is to point out just how important it is to have a positive outlook and believe that you can improve at something if you practice enough. There’s a weird thing in screenwriting where people seem to think either you’re good at it, or you’re not. You either have talent, or you don’t. And if your writing is really really bad, you’re hopeless and should give up. I’m here to tell you all of that is bullshit. I was a bad screenwriter. A really bad screenwriter. But over the course of thirteen years (yes, this is a long time), I’ve reached a point where I sold one short script this year and nearly had a feature optioned (and it still might happen)— both things that would have seemed impossible when I first began this journey. 

It may not happen quickly or when you want it to, but given enough time to grow, you can achieve the unimaginable. Don’t let anyone ever tell you to give up. Don’t let anyone tell you you’re not good enough. Don’t even tell yourself things like that. They will limit you and prevent you from achieving your goals. Believe you can improve. Believe you can get better. I know you can because I’ve lived it. I’m still not where I want to be as a writer, but I know I’m going to get there because I’m going to keep putting the hard work in to earn it. And even once I do get where I want to go, I will never stop learning because this is a lifelong journey and I’ve only just begun. 

Believe. It’s possible. 

Happy writing.

a1uziy,3,2018-11-30,How do you get off a team / client that makes you miserable?,canyaplsthrowmeaway,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/a1uziy/how_do_you_get_off_a_team_client_that_makes_you/,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. Long post ahead.

I work for a Big 4 firm in advisory (assurance and internal audit, so IT audit), and I’m in a rough situation right now. I’m a first year that’s 2 months in to doing client work. I’m currently on a different team as well, and neither of these clients or teams are in my office (if that’s relevant). My undergrad and masters are in accounting (working on CPA). I didn’t intern with this firm or anywhere. I’m not shy about being upfront with my teams about what I don’t know (to politely level the expectations). 
The following is why I feel pretty dejected and miserable about this client ...

• Manager: is kinda AWOL if you’re not sitting at the client site with him. This week I’ve pinged him and emailed him with questions and updates and gotten no reply (no senior). Doesn’t do a lot of explaining either before sending me out blind to make meeting and evidence requests (I know I shouldn’t expect my hand held, but I’m also still learning what I’m doing). Has led me down the wrong path as to what kind of testing to perform as well as cleared review notes from someone else in a WP I was doing the thee half of testing on; this went to the partner for review and has to be almost completely redone ... by me because ...

• Team structure: people roll on and off this project like crazy. The person who made almost all our evidence requests rolled off in September and is gone “for good” off the project. The people who sat through the walkthroughs aren’t here anymore either.

• Partner: very worried about disappointing him and being flagged as a first year that you’d rather not work with, decreasing my chances of being staffed in my local office (he’s from my local office, really nice man)

• Client: very unhelpful most of the time. They haven’t adhered to our deadlines super well, and if you don’t keep pestering them, they won’t give you the evidence (website they use doesn’t track 
outstanding requests, won’t use ours). And it’s not readily apparent that evidence requests go unfulfilled until the person testing it can’t find the documents in the folders. We’ll email out requests to the person that the head of IT told us to reach out to... and then find out “hey I can’t help you, try someone else!!” only when we follow up again a week later. Wont give us read only access to applications so we can obtain evidence ourselves but also drag their feet for things that should be relatively easy followups, even when we stress how critical the deadline is.

I just feel really stupid and unsupported. I’m booked on this project until February (interchanging a few weeks with my other team). I don’t think I have an option but to suck it up until then, which I accept. Is there a polite way to request that once I’m done with this clown fiesta for FY18, I don’t go back on next year? I haven’t talked to my coach yet and will try to meet with him soon. I know there are things that are just going to be growing pains. However, I can’t help but feel super dejected and just want to get myself out if possible without ruining my “career” here. 

TL;DR: Client is a mess, and the team is dysfunctional as well. The lack of direction from my manager and cohesiveness on my team (as well as the client dragging its feet to comply) has made me feel very frustrated, unsupported, and incompetent as a first year that’s only a few months into doing client work. I don’t want to place the blame just on the situation, as there are definitely areas in which i need to improve and will learn about. However, in some ways it does seem like I’m not set up for success, so I’d like to be off this team after the audit is over without burning bridges.

Advice is appreciated, but thanks for just reading the rant if you made it this far. (edited for format and clarity)"

* Trying to troubleshoot an issue where files are randomly corrupted upon save with no error notice (issue unresolved - blamed end-users and Adobe)
* Trying to get a price quote for a non-profit /educational account for a client (agent quoted directly off the website and had no idea what I was talking about)

Every single time I had an endless disorganized exchange back-and-forth with people whose communication skills were very poor and who think deflecting the issue is an acceptable way of closing out tickets.

a1vid7,21,2018-11-30,For Joules and Joules... the ups and downs of my adventure to Jool,Drakkith,KerbalSpaceProgram,https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/a1vid7/for_joules_and_joules_the_ups_and_downs_of_my/,"\*Kerbal Alarm Clock goes off\*

Ah! My transfer window to Jool is here! Wonderful!

&amp;#x200B;

1.5 million space bucks later I've launched a 15-ton probe on its multi-year long journey to the Green Giant. Why so expensive and heavy you ask? Well, this isn't your everyday probe. 6 argon-powered electric engines (from a future tech mod?) and accompanying fuel tanks give this weighty beast a delta-V budget of more than 4,000 m/s, more than enough to stroll from moon to moon at a somewhat reasonable pace.

Strapped to the underside with the most advanced Kerbal strap-on technology (totally not duct tape and regular decouplers)  are 4 mini-probes, each with another 800 m/s delta-V each to allow them to get into low orbit after release from mama-probe. Each probe has a full suite of advanced scientific equipment manufactured to within the strictest tolerances. No more ""I found this thermometer in my pocket"" nonsense from Bill.

Electrical power is provided by nine RTG's on the big probe and four more from the smaller probes, augmented by six massive solar panels. More than enough to power those hungry electric engines.

&amp;#x200B;

Many many days and cycles of unpaid interns later:

\*Kerbal Alarm Clock goes off\*

Ah! We've arrived at Jool!

&amp;#x200B;

After banging on the communications equipment with a rusty hammer, my professional mission control team finally powers up the communications dish and makes contact with the probe. Instructions are beamed into the void and the spacecraft begins its slow capture burn.

&amp;#x200B;

Mistake 1: All that electrical equipment? It's not enough.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't even run 2 of the 6 engines at full throttle and Mama-probe is reduced to making 50 m/s burns followed by time-accelerated recharging. No problem. It will just take a little bit longer to do the burns. Mission is still a go. Shortly afterwards, an intern wipes an old smudge off of the main screen and my team discovers something truly shocking.

&amp;#x200B;

Mistake 2: Jool has 5 moons, not 4.

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, no big deal. Mama-probe can just do all the science for the 5th. She was designed to handle unforeseen problems like this after all. With the next crisis handled my team begins their work. First up is Pol. The intercept burn is completed without any hiccups and the first mini-probe is launched.

&amp;#x200B;

Mistake 3: all the mini-probes are oriented backwards.

&amp;#x200B;

Prograde is retrograde. Normal is anti-normal. Cats and dogs living together! Krakens and Kerbals cohabiting!! Again, no big deal. Just click the opposite SAS option and all is well. The probe manages to enter an elliptical orbit of Pol and I get a wealth of science data from high and low orbit. Mission control celebrates! Jeb high-fives Val! Bill takes his own temperature! The interns receive a 100% pay bonus! Everyone is happy!

After breaking for brunch, the team rushes back to the control room when they remember they still have 4 probes in orbit of another planet that need guidance.

&amp;#x200B;

Next up is Bop. After swinging around close to Jool, a burn is made to bring the probes on a course with the lopsided moon. The next mini-probe (who I've named 'Hale') is released and another maneuver is calculated to bring the other probes in line for an intercept with Tylo. Probe 'Hale-Bop' enters Bop's sphere of influence and begins its retrograde burn, getting down to a periapsis of \~20 km. Back in mission control Valentina bites her fingernails as the first images of Bop come in to reveal a *massively* irregular surface, with large peaks at altitudes approaching the 20 km periapsis of Hale-Bop. Everyone holds their breath as Hale-Bop screams by the largest peak, clearing it by a meager few kilometers. Mission control breathes again. Science data streams in (from a probe with only 0.5 ec/s and at too low of an altitude to use time acceleration. Shoot me). Mission control rejoices.

&amp;#x200B;

During all this, Mama-probe has lined up with Tylo and released another mini-probe, followed by another course correction for the Laythe encounter.

Now, at this point a fair bit of head-scratching and save-scumming took place, as mission control thought the laws of physics were being violated. You see, apparently a bug in the terminal software at mission control showed an intercept of Laythe with a periapsis of 11 km. Perfect for my heat-shielded probe, whose mission was to make the first descent into Laythe's atmosphere. But this wonderful intercept was a lie! A big lie! A great, damnable lie of preposterous proportions! A half-orbit of Laythe later revealed an hitherto hidden encounter with *Tylo!* This would, of course, completely throw off the Laythe encounter, causing a periapsis about 6 orders of magnitude larger than the 11 km predicted earlier, far too high for my probe's meager engines and fuel reserves.

But, after discovering the bug and praying to the Kraken gods to rewind time once more, a successful correction burn was made during the Tylo encounter to put the probe back on track for its atmospheric entry, descent, and landing (it's not reentry if you've never been there before!). Speaking of Tylo:

&amp;#x200B;

Mistake 4: Wrong intercept with Tylo.

&amp;#x200B;

Not wrong in the sense that the Tylo probe missed, but wrong in the sense that the approach velocity is about 3x too fast for the probe's 800 m/s delta-V budget. After burning all its fuel in a futile attempt to get the probe captured, an intern at mission control cries and throws their lunch at a coworker. No joy. Capture burn unsuccessful.

&amp;#x200B;

But then, a silver lining appears: the retrograde burn, done completely in vain and without thought of the future, brings on an encounter with Vall just a few hours after leaving Tylo's SOI. Mission success!?

A few golf claps go around mission control and Valentina comforts the hungry intern. The encounter with Vall goes according to hastily-made plans and the scientists at the R&amp;D center stop playing tennis on their modified radar terminals (purchased at a substantial discount and re-purposed for break-room use) and begin digging through the data.

&amp;#x200B;

Meanwhile, after burning in Tylo's influence, Mama-probe releases the Laythe probe and then burns anti-normal to bring its inclination in orbit of Jool up beyond 44 degrees in preparation for a 135-day study as dictated by contractual obligations. One interesting tidbit: out of the 4,000 m/s available delta-V, less than 1,000 has been used. Amazingly, after Pol, all subsequent moons required little more than a 50-75 m/s burn to encounter. Talk about lucky, eh?

&amp;#x200B;

The final and most nail-biting encounter remains. Laythe EDL (entry, descent, landing). Screaming in at more than 3,500 m/s, the probe begins to encounter Laythe's atmosphere. Vibrations run from the heat shield all the way to the engines. Ablative begins to char and red-hot gas and bits of heat shield fly by the spacecraft. G-forces climb. One-gee. Two-gees. Scientific instruments soak up data and the communications dish struggles to transmit through the ionization. Five-gees. Bill's pocket-thermometer would melt if it were placed in the imaginary excrement hole of the heat shield. Nine-gees. Velocity falling. Twelve gees. Max Q. The fires of EDL go out and the g-forces begin to fall. The probe lapses back into consciousness and lets loose a great sigh of relief at its own survival. Four gees. Two gees. Velocity a mere few hundred m/s now. Metallic clanking and the sound of explosive bolts firing fill the air as the heat shield is jettisoned. The probe turns upright in preparation for parachute deployment.

&amp;#x200B;

Mistake 5: there are no parachutes on-board.

&amp;#x200B;

Oh crap. Interns cry. Bill lapses into depression. Valentina saves Jeb from quitting the space program. A janitor cleaning up the spilled lunch from earlier points to a monitor. The engines! A suicide burn! There's still more than 300 m/s delta-V left! Velocity is a mere 100 m/s and still falling! We can do this! Jeb gives a rousing speech to the interns! Valentina types furiously at the keyboard! Slide rules erupt from pockets! Engineers begin calculations! Results are called out down the line of control stations! Mission control runs like an old engine just cleaned and lubricated for the first time in years! Valentina types in the final commands and hits the 'send' button. All eyes are on the main monitor.

&amp;#x200B;

Altitude: 5 km

C'mon!

Altitude: 4 km

We got this!

Altitude : 3 km

Almost there!

Altitude: 2 km

Begin burn!!

Altitude: 1 km

Velocity falling!

&amp;#x200B;

Mistake 6: ""Officials at the local space center are blaming an intern for the miscalculation that resulted in the destruction of the Laythe-landing craft. As you may know, the spacecraft slammed into the surface of Laythe after a tense entry that was complicated by the apparent failure to install parachutes. Flight directors say the intern was fined two-days pay and will not receive free lunch for the next week.""

These were my ups and downs on my journey to Jool. I think this encapsulates much of what is great about KSP.

You can do it too.

All you need is Joules and Joules.

Edit:  Title is a reference to Alan Shepard saying his golf ball went for ""miles and miles and miles"" on the Moon, it obviously rhymes with Jool, and it's a reference to the fact that rockets require energy to function. Triple play!!"

I'm in a dilemma. I've currently applied for multiple entry-level IT internships. Yesterday, I interviewed at an amazing company. I've never seen a workplace so open, casual and flexible. They have a room full of couches, tons of snacks, tea, coffee, and everyone is very easy going. Today, I got a call saying I've been accepted for the position. 

I've also have an interview in a few days with a Police Department for an IT position. I've also heard working with the city/government is never a bad idea. It's safe, has great benefits and it just looks good for the future when you have a well-recognized name on the resume. 

I know beggars can't be choosers when it comes to internships,  but how do I choose? Another drawback for the position I've been offered is that the commute is almost two hours one way. "

a1w38l,42,2018-11-30,Best online tools to refresh your memory with R before an interview?,Ziddletwix,statistics,https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/a1w38l/best_online_tools_to_refresh_your_memory_with_r/,"I'm looking to apply to PhD internships in data science soon. Likely, if I receive any interviews some part of them will be quizzing me on my listed programming language of R. I have several years of experience, so there shouldn't be much I have to explicitly *learn* in advance of this sort of interview. However, I haven't been regularly using R during this academic year. Sometimes when I go to code something up, I notice I'm a bit rusty on the details.

Are there any online resources that are useful for practicing the sort of questions you might be asked in an interview? (Particularly the basics of data analysis).  I can certainly find online *courses*, but I'm looking for something a bit more focused because I really just want practice, rather than to be slowly taught something. Obviously, I can always just make up a small project to do, but I find that having an outside resource is helpful. For example, if I stare at a dataset, and think ""What could I do with this"", the tasks I can think of off the top of my head are the sorts of ones I probably best remember how to do. It's more effective if I have someone quizzing me to do something I wouldn't naturally think of."
a1wabo,34,2018-11-30,[Vent] Halfway through med school and an inch away from finally quitting...,MyRoomWithAView,medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/a1wabo/vent_halfway_through_med_school_and_an_inch_away/,"Hi everybody,

As the title suggests I have recently finished my third year of medical school in Germany (hence English isnt my first language, sorry for any mistakes... ) and have been unhappy with it for quite a long time. I have seriously considered quitting multiple times before, but now I feel like I'm closer than ever and I'd really love some advice.

First of all I'll try to explain my situation a bit: Objectively everything is going well, meaning I've never failed a test in my three years of med school and generally cope quite well with the whole theoretical/academic side of things. I could probably finish med school without any major problems in that respect. But here comes the thing, I hate every minute I spend at the hospital. And I mean HATE it, to the point where I just want to scream and cry and hurt myself. I've always been a very introverted and shy person, and I've always preferred working quietly by myself. Hence long days in the library dont bother me at all, but I am absolutely miserable whenever I have to work in loud, hectic situations with lots of people involved. I don't enjoy working with patients at all. I don't want to see them, touch them, talk to them. I hate the fact how hospital work is so unpredictable. Theres no fixed schedule, you never know whats going to happen next. I just really, really want a quiet job with that doesn't require me to pretend to be sociable and spontanious all day long. Because I'm not. (Don't get me wrong, I always try my best to be friendly to everybody, it just takes up SO much energy)

It's always been like that for as long as I remember. When I did my first internships in a clinical setting during my first year, I'd often drive to the hospital crying because the thought of having to interact with so many people was unbearable. After somehow getting through the day I'd drive back home again and burry myself under blankets and pillows. There was no way I could have mustered up the energy to go out with friends or even go for a walk to take my mind of things. I literally could only lay there waiting to calm down and trying to recharge my batteries.

Back then I still thought that I'd get used to it eventually, but I never did. Patient contact stayed every bit as exhausting, and if anything it has gotten worse. The thought of having to go through another three years of med school (that will be increasingly practical and hospital based) makes me want to die. Like LITERALLY, I'd rather be dead that go through the last couple of years again. I can't do it. Med school has taken such a toll on my life. Actually I'm not even sure if you can still call that a life. Im constantly exhausted and grumpy, I snap at people I like all the time. Tiny little things make me cry. There is no energy left in me. I have had sex exactly ONE TIME in the last three years, because I'm too fucking miserable and exhausted to go out and actively pursue anything. I've never even been close to being in a relationship, for the same reasons. I used to be an avid writer, I've published my first book a couple of years ago, and always dreamed of making that my career one day. Now I don't have the time, energy or inner calmness to sit down and write for an hour. I dislike the city I'm studying in. It's grey and noisy, and I miss nature so much. I'm so fucking lonely and homesick. I'd love to have a pet, but there's no money. I miss my family so much it feels like constant heartbreak. I don't sleep very well. My weight goes up and down as it pleases. Med school has made me someone I never wanted to be. I just can't deal with it any longer, even the thought of having to go into the hospital and surrounding myself with so many unfriendly, loud, exhausting people makes me want to scream. I'd rather scrub floors (not joking, I have worked as a hotel maid before and was happier doing it).

I am aware that not every doctor has to work in direct patient care, which is what made me stick with medicine until now. I always figured I'd just become a radiologist or pathologist and then I'd be fine. But now I just don't see a way how I could possible make it through the last three years. Honesty, if I try to force it, I think theres a good chance I'll end up dead. I feel an inch away from doing something really radical (not necessarily kill myself, but... something. Because I really cannot take this life the way it is any longer).

So after being really, really miserable for a long time, I had some sort of full mental breakdown a couple of months ago. Crying, screaming, hitting walls so hard I broke my hand... followed by weeks of not really being able to do anything. So I decided to take half a year off and move back in with my parents, which is where I still am at this moment. I have recovered a little, but the thought of having to go back to med school makes me sick. I don't feel ready for it. I do go to psychotherapy where we try to work on ways to cope with extreme introversion/social anxiety etc.... but honestly I don't feel like I'm making a lot of progress. And even if I did... I don't want to just BARELY get by without breaking down. I want to do something I like. I miss enjoying getting out of bed in the morning. I miss finding some form of fulfillment in what I do. I miss doing sports and eating well. I miss having time for myself. I miss growing as a person... I feel like med school is making me smaller and weaker everyday, until one day not much of me will be left. At the moment I almost start crying as soon as I smell hand desinfectant somewhere :(

And the more I think about it, the more I feel like I need to quit. I'm not suited for med school. I'm not sociable. I'm not resiliant. I'm not willing to sacrifice my alone time to jump up and down hospital wards. I'm not a leader. I'm not spontanious. I'm not confident. I don't get happiness from talking to my patients. It just seems to be a horrible fit.

But I am hardworking. I love learning. I work well on my own. I'm reliable. I'm diligent. I'm happy to spend my days behind the scenes. Why shouldn't I just do something more suited to my personality? I'm thinking along the lines of either something laboratory based or something in the direction of clinical documentation/medical informatics. 

This is probably one of the harder choices I had to make so far. You could absolutely argue for and against both options:

1. You have already made it through the first half. You just have to persevere and everything will be better after you finish. Quitters never get anywhere.

2. If it seriously makes you unhappy, just stop. This is the only life you'll ever get. Don't spend it clinging to things you hate.

Both seem like plausible options, so how do I decide which one is the way to go? My parents luckily don't put too much pressure on me to finish, and as theres no tuition fees in Germany I am pretty much debt free. So all in all, starting something new wouldn't be impossible. But I do have trouble finally letting go of medicine because if - IF - I could get through the next three years, I could just disappear into a laboratory and have a well paying job that I'd probably enjoy, plus I won't have to feel so defeated by giving up med school. But then I try to imagine myself going back to uni in a couple of moths.... and suddenly it feels like a victory bought at much to high a price. My life could potentially be so much happier if I didn't constantly try to be somebody I'm just not. I want to be happy again. I want to do something that I like - or at the very least that doesn't make me want to vomit everytime I think about it. I want to be closer to my familiy again. Now that I've temporarily moved back in with them I realise how terribly alone I really was the last couple of years. I've missed out on so many things over the last years and im SO hungry to live again. I want to start writing books again. I want to experience having a boyfriend, just for once in my life. If I died tomorrow, I'd be really unhappy with how I've lived my life so far. Of course it can be necessary to pull yourself together and battle through sometimes. But the more I think about it, the more I feel like that's not a good way of living. I just want to feel... content again. 

I know this was a terribly long text, but I really needed to get this off my chest. What do you think, am I silly to throw three years of hard work away? Have you been in similar positions? I'd love some input from you guys to help me make up my mind, but honestly, after so much dread and hatred towards medicine, I don't really feel like there's a going back for me.

Thank you so much for reading and I hope you have a wonderful day!"
a1wofw,7,2018-11-30,Will my medical record disqualify me from becoming a Correctional Officer?,ThomasGalbridge,OnTheBlock,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnTheBlock/comments/a1wofw/will_my_medical_record_disqualify_me_from/,"Hello, I'm a college student from Panama City. We were recently hit by Hurricane Michael earlier last month, but this has caused a lot of available jobs. I've been looking into ways of paying off my remaining tuition at a university before I transfer from my local state college. I came across a job fair with a couple of entry-level trades, and I applied and underwent an interview for a CO at a state prison. They said they would gladly call me back after they performed a background check, this upcoming week. I'm a U.S. Citizen, 20 years old, have a very clean criminal record (the worst I've gotten was a traffic ticket for not wearing a seat-belt), and I'm currently majoring in IT Management.  


However, there's one thing that I fear will hold me back, and it is my medical record. I have been diagnosed with a low depressive disorder known as dyshymia and autism spectrum disorder. Back in my eighth grade year of middle school, I went to a behavioral hospital for about a week since I wasn't exactly a good kid. My junior year of high school, I had plenty of family problems and I started stressing myself out with future plans in college thus went to have a psychological evaluation. When I went to the same behavioral hospital, they didn't see me as fit to be committed and saw that I was stressed out at the time, so they instantly let me go.

&amp;#x200B;

Four years have passed, and I've attended college while working and doing internships. I've had experience with stressful situations, and have remained cool-headed. I do believe I can very well prove to them that I'm psychologically fit, however I don't know if those two diagnosis will be what ultimately holds me back. The recruiter told me that the job offers a decent starting pay and tuition assistance, which is an opportunity I don't want to miss."
a1x4uo,2,2018-11-30,"Not entirely happy, but not unhappy.",pinkflamingo94,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/a1x4uo/not_entirely_happy_but_not_unhappy/,"I usually don't feel the need to post on Reddit, and have always been more of a lurker. When it comes down to stuff like this I usually feel as though I need some guidance. Seeing as I feel as though my friends will always have bias towards me, I don't feel completely comfortable talking about this with parents, and my siblings are not much help. With all of this being said I have decided to throw myself at the mercy of the internet. 

For the past year I have been dating this awesome guy who's kind, gentle, honest, cute, and just an all around ""good man"". He's perfect and everything most people look for in a guy. The relationship started out a little rocky but we pushed through and kept it going. I felt intense feelings for him for a little while but then they subsided and then the relationship kinda just seemed like a friendship with never ending complements, kisses, and sex every time we saw each other.  For some reason though I have been having these nagging thoughts of ""*is this it*?, *am I supposed to feel more after this year mark*?, *I love you ,but I am not IN LOVE with you*"". - Those kind of thoughts, they have been happening while in the relationship and I've kind of just been ignoring them because I love spending time with him. 

He and I have a little bit of a long-distance relationship going on as he lives 27 miles away from me so we see each other anywhere from 1 to 3 times a week. He has been telling me that he loves me a lot more often and that he misses me when we're apart, and most of the time I would reciprocate but it's gotten to be so often that I am now at the point to where I am asking myself if I really feel the same as him. I have done a lot for him throughout the relationship throwing him a birthday party, building him up as a person to boost his confidence, motivating him to be the best version of himself he can be, and always reminding him to approach things with an open mind and heart. 

&amp;#x200B;

At the beginning of the relationship I didn't feel conformable doing somethings with him like giving him a small kiss out in public, holding his hand as we walk through the mall, (doing ""normal couple stuff"" is a little different when you're gay) and now after a year I am able to comfortably hug him, put my arm around him, hold his hand, and every now and then give him small kisses while out in public. He's changed me for the better and has made me more comfortable with my sexuality. 

Sometimes I go on long speeches and take over a conversation and he listens to me and looks at me as though he's hanging on to every word that comes out of my mouth. I love him, and care for him so much but I am just feeling on the fence about the relationship. I told him that I when I graduate from college and have enough money saved up I wanted to get my own place and move out of my parents house. He wanted to move in with me and I kinda felt bad because I didn't want him to move in with me. I wanted to try to live and take care of myself for awhile but told him that he can come and spend the night with me anytime, and this was a good answer for him. 

About a month ago I was at work and after my shift was up and my male co-worker went on his break I preformed a sexual act on him. I felt extreme guilt for cheating before the act, during the act, and after the act. My boyfriend found some messages between my co-worker and I on phone of me begging my co-worker not to tell anyone and that what we did would never happen again (and I was serious). My boyfriend found out, comforted me and told me not to call him or text him (my boyfriend). I spent a weekend we had planned together without my boyfriend and felt like complete shit. I ended up calling him anyways and he picked up and asked if he wanted to see a movie with me which he agreed to. He said after we hang out he didn't want to speak to me until I found another job. I was completely devastated by this and could not help but cry because I didnt have any leads on a new job. Even though he was standing right in from of me when he told me this I began to miss him already. But I was not having it and pursed my boyfriend and rebuilding the relationship anyways, and he allowed me to continue speaking to him and going out on dates together. I have found another job since. We no longer talk about what we call ""that Friday"" / my cheating. 

For the past week or two he's been busy and so have I with trying to wrap up my classes for this semester. We have been seeing each other and talking on the phone like normal but they have all been very brief conversations. 

The other day I went over his house after a long day at my internship and school and was extremely tired so I pretty much just ate and went to sleep and he was trying to kiss me and tough me but I just wasnt into it and chalked it up to being tired. So the next day I took him out for breakfast as that's what we do when I spend the night at his place, we go to breakfast the next morning. We sat down, talked, ate, laughed like normal, but when we got back to his place I went to the restroom and I just felt that nagging and started to google articles. My google search was full of stuff like: ""*a lull or the end of a relationship*? , *Should I Breakup With My Boyfriend*? *am I afraid to break up with my boyfriend*?, *when to stay when to go*."" - stuff like that. 

I went back to his room where he was laying on his bed, and I cuddled with him. I began to think of him as a person, and how wonderful he is. I began thinking of how good he is to me, how he'd bend over backwards for me, how willing he seemed to always be there for me, and with all of this thinking I began to cry and he noticed. He asked if I was okay, and I said yes. He then asked me why I was crying and I told him: ""I don't know if I'm as invested in you"" after saying this, I began to sob. He held me and told me everything was going to be okay and I was trying to explain to me how I felt. Trying to explain that I loved him and cared for him but did not know if the relationship was something I should stay in, and I told him that I didn't want him to stay in a relationship with someone whose heart was not completely in it. He went on to tell me that he was proud of me and happy that he was hearing this now and not further in the relationship.  Then he asked if I needed some time away. I said yes and to give me about three weeks. But later on that night and this morning I couldn't help but call him and talk to him. Even if it was about nothing. The phone call last night was me trying to articulate what I was trying to explain earlier in the day, and he told me that I did not have to explain to him, and that I should take as much time as I need, and If I did not want to continue the relationship to just shoot him a message saying so and it'll be okay with him. He said he's a little upset and sad but cannot change the way I feel. 

I'll admit that sometimes I do sometimes wish I was single ,and that I do sometimes feel like I'm the only one who is trying to make myself better. I go to school, work part-time and work at an Internship so I am working on myself. But sometimes I do feel like he do not have as much direction.

I miss him, and Love him so much but I don't know how I'm supposed to be feeling. I don't like feeling like there may be more out there for me, but I don't want to risk losing him. I feel like he's become such a big part of my life that I don't want to see him go. (I am embarrassed to say that this is the longest relationship I've ever been in)

Sometimes I'm on the fence and sometimes when I think of him I get a little teary-eyed because I think of how awesome it is I have him in my life. He face timed me today and I was super happy to see him, and I always travel that 27 miles to go see and spend the night with him. Or have food delivered to his job or take him out.

I don't want the three weeks to be up, get back with him, and then breakup with him. I want to figure it out within the time frame that I gave myself.

Please provide me with some perspective. Is this just a lull, or should I just call it quits?

We are both a part of the same internship, so I see him every day. I see him joke around and act completely normal with everyone else, and then coldly ignore me. He barely even looks at me when I’m speaking. It hurts so much, mom. The worst part is that I haven’t even done anything — when I confronted him about it, he told me it was because I reminded him of his previous relationships. He is basically mad at me for just being myself. My existence is triggering to him — that’s a great self-esteem boost for ya!

I’ve tried so hard to be the bigger person, the mature adult. I’ve continued to act friendly towards him, even when his answers are curt. I still go to work every morning forcing myself to have an open mind and believe that today he’ll act at least half friendly with me (it’s literally the only way I can convince myself to even show up at work nowadays). I’ve forgiven him countless of times even though he’s never apologized. I refuse to be mad at him. I know it’ll only fuel a downward spiral of hate and bitterness, and the only thing I’ll get from it is more misery.

But mom, it’s so damn difficult.

It’s so hard to be the only one trying. He doesn’t even care that he’s hurting me. Sometimes I just want to give up and be a child and scream in his face that the way he’s acting is not fucking okay. It’s so damn unfair. All I ask of him is to just pretend he doesn’t hate me for three more weeks until the internship ends, but it seems like it’s too much. If anyone is justified in acting all pissy, it’s me — yet I’m the only one rushing to keep everything together even though I haven’t even done anything to deserve the way he’s treating me.

I just miss him a lot. Not only as a boyfriend, but as a friend — we were so close just a month ago, now he could just as well be on the moon. I just want to be friends with him again. I miss laughing at his stupid jokes.

To top off the shitty cocktail, all of this has made me feel so unlovable. Like I’m not worth anyone’s time and I’ll never hit that one-in-a-million chance that someone might actually like me for who I am. I’m just too much for anyone to deal with.

Mom, I’m sorry for being depressing. Everything is just hard right now.

a1xnh0,4,2018-11-30,Could I please tell you guys our story?,tapp23,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/a1xnh0/could_i_please_tell_you_guys_our_story/,"We were very young when we met, each only 21 years old. We lived in different countries but he moved up to where I was living to be with me. We found each other in difficult moments of our lives. He had just recently lost his grandmother months before and I was recovering from a rape that ended in an abortion. In a way, we saved each other by loving each other. We were inseparable from the moment we met. He is my first love.  Our relationship was sweet, loving, and supportive despite all of the pain.

&amp;#x200B;

I was beginning university and he was still in flux. I told him to hitch his wagon to mine,  join a course at our university. Come home with me for Christmas, all away across the Atlantic. You're my family now and I'm going to take care of you. I was so wildly in love with this person and so grateful to him for loving me.  He taught me so much about love, about sex, about everything to do with life. I was enthralled with this beautiful new reality. I had my doubts about certain parts of his personality, but brushed them off as we all do in the early stages of love.

&amp;#x200B;

He struggled in this new country and new university program. He wasn't as outgoing as I am, wanted to spend time at home playing video games versus going out with my friends. I began to realize he wasn't as socially adept as I but didn't yet have a way to describe it. Later, I would realize too late that he has mild Aspberger's. We decided to move in together after 7 months of dating. A month before, I was hit with crippling depression that left me a shell of myself. We began arguing. 

&amp;#x200B;

I suggested he and I both take an internship in his hometown. I wanted to live in this city he loved so much and always brought me back to. I'd met his family at that point, after only knowing him for a couple months. It was clear to both of us that our relationship was the real deal. When we moved to his hometown, things changed. He was once again on familiar territory. He spent less time with me than he did throwing himself into his work. He clearly needed to brush off the failures of university and find validation in success with this new task. The fighting worsened and I became needy and scared of him leaving me.

At this point, we'd been together a year. We would stay together for two more before ultimately ending our relationship.  In between there, we began fighting relentlessly. It started to create a void of mistrust between us. That snowballed into a horrible summer after I graduated university and he had flunked miserably. I decided to try law school in another country and we moved again, for the third time. He began working in his hometown again, I became even more fearful of abandonment and made the greatest mistake of my life. I cheated on him while he was gone, multiple times. We moved again, to another city in the same country. I dropped out of law school. I told him about the cheating and it was like our relationship ended as we knew it. There was so much hurt there that he didn't know what to do but seek solace in us.

&amp;#x200B;

The months to come would be punctuated by screaming fights, broken furniture, the worst kind of anger and grief imaginable. He was so angry with me and I hated myself for what I had done. We isolated ourselves, not making friends and spending all of our time together. The mistrust and anger grew. We were destroying ourselves and becoming toxic without realizing it. 

&amp;#x200B;

After discovering a health problem during a vacation to see my family, I decided to stay behind in my home country across the Atlantic. He was fearful of this decision and wrote me a letter stating all of his insecurities about our separation. He felt I would break up with him while we were separated. I assured him we would not, but secretly needed a break from the toxicity. Weeks wore on, my family life imploded. My father cut me, and I bled on my ex (figuratively). My abandonment and impulsive behavior were triggered and I snapped back into old patterns. I wrote an email breaking up with him. I tried to take it back. He was overwhelmed with work and university and this new identity separate from our pain. He couldn't see a way forward. He waited a week and wrote me a beautiful and kind letter, saying there was no longer a future for us. I am completely devastated with grief and can barely comprehend that I have lost him.

&amp;#x200B;

Our relationship ended one week ago after 3 years together. My therapist says that it should never be this hard. My ex also said in his breakup letter that our relationship had endured more pain than any relationship ever should. I realize how much I've hurt him and I want to set him free. 

&amp;#x200B;

Some part of me hopes for reconciliation. We haven't seen each other in two months and the breakup has only been final for one week. His mind was made up when he wrote the letter and all of the things he said were true. I just can't face the reality until he says those same words to my face. 

I will return across the Atlantic to his hometown, full of memories, to gather all of my things. I don't know if I'll stay or return immediately to the warm but limited embrace of my family.  We have a troubled but colorful relationship that I believe will only get better with age. Growing up alongside someone else is tough. Finding yourself is tough. 

&amp;#x200B;

I want to hold him again. I want to overcome these painful mistakes we've made together. I want us to try. I just don't know if he has it in him anymore. That is what I fear the most.

Thank you for listening."
