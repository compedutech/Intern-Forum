I'm an intern who's been put in charge of finding a means of searching documents on our company's file server and possibly our intranet.  Does anyone have any suggestions for something like this?

There are roughly 800 employees at this company, and maybe 450-500 computers.  It's an all (or nearly all) windows environment.  The primary goal of this would be for searching Microsoft Office documents (doc/docx, xls/xlsx, ppt/pptx) and PDF files.  Maybe searching through our internal web servers as well.  Any solution would probably need to take into account the contents of the files, not just titles.  There are probably less than 100K files to search/index.  

I've found Microsoft's Search Server Express, which seems like a pretty good solution.  However, I thought I'd see what the more experienced users of reddit had for suggestions.  Let me know what you think!"

I have found the basic sites out there with java interview questions but I want to be as prepared as possible. I am a good developer but haven't been coding that much the past 9 months. My internships were J2e development with some basic odds and ends in other languages but I'm definitely rusty.

 write the code to iterate over a list in java
  
write the algorithm to insert a value into a BST

I am moving to Dublin for four months in May (I'm a law student from Canada on an internship), and I am mid-apartment hunt at the moment.

I'll be working in the south side of the Dublin 1 area, and was hoping to live in Dublin 2, because I heard it was the nicest, and also very safe. My source for that information is a friend who lived in Ireland for seven years, and has friends still living in Dublin that he double-checked with. As a young female who has never been in the country before, safety is certainly a factor.

That said, I am finding a lot of rooms to rent in Dublin 1, and very few in Dublin 2. So my question now is, just how unsafe is Dublin 1 at night for a female foreigner? Is it worth an extra couple hundred euros a month to be in Dublin 2?

Also, general tips and advice about different locations/things to avoid/things to do is also welcome. If anyone happens to know someone who is renting a room for the summer in Dublin 2, that would be even cooler.

Hugs and thanks."

bna8l,10,2010-04-06,I'm pretty messed up Reddit,thewalkindude,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bna8l/im_pretty_messed_up_reddit/,"This post (http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/beu53/i_think_there_might_actually_be_something_wrong/) inspired me to do something about my life. Looking at it, my situation is similar, but different in many ways, although it could be like that in a few years.

Let me start out by saying that I know I'm depressed, and that I'm on medicine for it. The problem lies in the fact that I feel like I have to be perfect. Lets see if I can lay out what my philosophy is.

   1. You are either perfect or flawed
   2. If you are flawed, you have to feel bad about yourself
   3. You are not allowed to work to become perfect, because that is admitting you are flawed and then you have to feel bad about yourself.

That last point is probably the main reason that I'm avoiding professional help. Hell, posting this here is a big first step for me. I'm doing mediocre in college and feel bad about it, but I can't study, because I'd feel bad about that, and I don't know how to begin, anyways. People say that I'm smart and well-liked, but I just don't feel that's true. If it were true, I'd have a 4.0 GPA and be always out with friends, without having to work at it at all. I don't have a driver's license, and so am pretty much dependent on my parents to get me places. I don't like this either, and I want a license, but I'm afraid to practice, because practicing means you're flawed. People always tell me that you have to seem like you really want a job in order to get one, and to always follow up on the interview, but I feel like if I do that, then the employer will just think ""Oh, there's that annoying guy again, we're not going to hire him."" I'm graduating from college next year, and have never held a job that you could interview for. I feel like all my relationships are balanced on a razor's edge, and one stupid move will ruin them forever. These stupid moves include calling people, because they obviously don't want to do things with me. If they did, then they'd call me. That's part of the deal with getting a job too. They obviously don't want to hire me, because if they did, then they'd call me for an interview. I don't understand how not to take things like rejection from jobs personally. They might as well be saying "" We won't hire you because you're a terrible person who will never amount to anything"". So I get mad at them. I still hate the college that rejected me, up to the point where I can't even go past it, because I feel like it's mocking me, saying ""You could have had a perfect life if you had went here, but we decided you don't deserve it."" You either have to hate the one who did the rejecting or the one who was rejected, and I'd rather not hate myself anymore than needed. I got rejected for an internship today, and it's the end of the fucking world. They say ""Unfortunately we were unable to give you this position"" but that's absolute bullshit. All they're saying is ""We don't think you're good enough, and you should feel bad for even trying. We could give you the position if we wanted to, but you're not good enough for it."" This is an internship with an organization I know, and the people who got it are my friends, and I still want to strangle them, because they think they're better than me, and they have the right to look down on me.  If they wanted to give me the position, they would have. If they wanted me they would have created another position or given me one over the people who did get it. I don't want to hate the organization, but if I don't then they get away with treating me like shit. Overall, I feel like I'm the most pathetic person in my life, and if it weren't for the internet and people like Chris-chan, I'd probably think of myself as the most pathetic person in the world. You know, this is the first time I wrote out my big bundle of problems, and I hope you can give me some advice

bouwz,11,2010-04-09,"Hey Reddit, I need your help and support. I'm obsessed with my gay boss, and it's causing me mental problems.",weirdohio,lgbt,https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/bouwz/hey_reddit_i_need_your_help_and_support_im/,"Hey Reddit, I need your help and support. I'm obsessed with my gay boss, and it's causing me mental problems.

Let me start out by saying I used to be a perfectly happy, sane, normal human being. Everything was great. I loved life. I'm a 20yr old College student, having an excellent time. Oh and I'm a straight, heterosexual guy (or at least I thought - I had never even become slightly aroused by any of the male form. Period.)

Then ~6 months ago I met a lovely guy; a ~30yr old gay man with a an apparently attraction to guys younger than himself. I suspect it was this attraction of his that drew us together, though he didn't try to rape me, so I was fine with it. We met through a mutual friend.

Things were great. He (at least was) a really awesome, loving, caring guy. I mean, we were really good friends, spending most waking moments talking to each other on msn; I dare say, for a short period, the best friend I ever had. Many a weekend I would make the 3-hour drive to visit him, we would eat out at a lovely restaurant, get drunk, cuddle up in bed and try the occasional handjob/BJ (hell I even enjoyed it a little). I know I'm not a gay guy - but he could easily make my dick hard given the chance. Looking back, I think he considered this just a bit of playful fun, but to me it was more than that. No-one had been this special to me before. Though it may not have been, this was certainly the closest I'd come to love.

He had also managed to snag me a (highly useful &amp; interesting) internship at his company. I was really excited; I would get to move into his neighborhood for the summer, do interesting work in the day, and hang out &amp; enjoy ourselves together in the morning. It sounded awesome.

However after maybe January this year he started to lose interest in me. Subtle signs at first; not being quite as talkative or flirty on MSN, his SMS messages now without a once-obligatory 'X' at the end, etc. Since January, 100% of my attempts to meet up and hang out together have been declined. He will usually make up a bad excuse such as he's 'busy' or 'tired'; and when I suggest he chooses another date, he dodges the question.

This was when I started to go a little mad. I could not understand why he would not want to see we; we had such fun! So when he turned me down (on numerous occasions), I would become really upset - and made this clear to him. This would always decend into argument.

In one of the more recent incidents, I kept pushing him and complaining that he wouldn't see me. He then came out with 'you act like i'm your boyfriend or something, it is weird'. And I think he was right. I was acting like he was my boyfriend, expecting to see him. That's what it'd become, to me.

So I started my internship two weeks ago. I hate it. By far the worst two weeks of my life. All I can think about is him, I am in tears crying every night and losing lots of sleep. He is merely my boss now (and my direct boss at that). He has not been very supportive at work; if anything mean to me. We do not speak on non-work-related matters. When I moved cities on the Saturday (before starting work on the Monday), he would not even welcome me by turning down my request to share a beer; instead he chose to stay at home and watch tv. He doesn't give a shit about me any more. But I do about him. I really do.

What can I do? The love-part of my brain wants him back in my life, but the math-part of my brain says it will not happen. If I am to let him go completely and accept the status quo, how can I do it?

*Any* words of advice would be really appreciated. I can't talk to any friends about this, I feel like I have no-one to turn to. Please help me before I really get even worse.

I am not clean myself and I hate cleaning up after both of us.  How do I make him clean?**

My boyfriend and I moved in together two years ago, and we've been living in relative squalor ever since.

Here is the backstory:  I'm not a very clean person anyway.  When I was a teenager, my carpet was knee-deep underneath one huge pile of discarded clothes.  My desk has never been clean.  I even think better (I'm sure of it) with a small amount of clutter.

My boyfriend is the same way.  When we first moved in together, I tried to make sure that we wouldn't fall into our regular habits.  However, it soon became me cleaning everything.  Well, as I said, I am not a very clean person and I heavily resented being the maid.  I am a full-time college student, and I also work part-time and have an internship with a local non-profit organization.  He just goes to school.  He was uninterested in any sort of negotiation on the cleaning.  It was either split 50/50 or he didn't want any part of it--by which I mean, he wouldn't clean.  When I pointed out that I was busier, he said that I was insulting his achievements.

Well fine.  But he never actually lifted a finger to do his 50% anyway.  At a certain point, I decided  that ""50/50 or nothing"" could be my prerogative as well, so I simply stopped cleaning.  

Reddit, I lived at least eight months in the most filthy conditions you can imagine.  Most days the apartment smelled like rotting food, which even began to seem pleasant to me toward the end.  Dishes were everywhere; we didn't do them until we ran out of random things to be used as forks and plates.  Trash was everywhere.  Every article of clothing I owned was dirty (and on the floor).  We used the same towels and sheets for most of this time period.  Ultimately I could not live the way we were living anymore.  It took me several weeks to clean the house from top to bottom.  Now I routinely clean (I still have the same busy schedule--even busier) and he helps me if he's around.  

**Problems:**

* *If he's around*.  This is a key plot point.  If my boyfriend does not witness me cleaning, he somehow manages to pretend as though it never happened.  Say that I spent the whole day cleaning the apartment.  He gets home and suggests that we take the trash out.  I ask if he will do it.  He gets angry because I'm not doing anything.

* He half-asses everything.  Dusting, to him, means that he dusts the front and top of an object.  Sweeping crumbs means that he doesn't have to move the toaster (underneath which is the crumbiest part).  He puts dishes in the dishwasher regardless of whether they are caked with dried old food.  If I say anything--anything at all--about this, he tells me that I am too fastidious, a control freak, and bossy. 

I am starting to get really nervous about this.  I am a very career-oriented person and I have absolutely no intentions of being someone's housewife.  I don't even want to stay home with a baby if it means that I have to be in charge of the cleaning.  I don't know how to say this any clearer: I hate cleaning from the depths of my soul.  I am not even a clean person; I am a complete and utter slob.  Being a woman doesn't make me any more inclined to do the cleaning, and I'm not going to do it.  

I've been thinking about my own parents.  My dad is a slob and my mom is too--she just got stuck taking care of my dad.  Their relationship has been full of resentment.  I've also been thinking about my dreams of a gender-equal household in the future.  I keep imagining having a baby and not being able to trust my half-assing boyfriend--or having to take care of the baby 24/7 because someone's got to do it and *he's* not motivated enough so *he* doesn't want to.  I mean, he can't even dust behind the television because he doesn't want to move his arm an extra few inches.

Other relevant details:  I am going to be making a shit ton more money than he is after college.   Also, he is very fond of holding our eight-month slob-fest against me and saying things like, ""Well you didn't clean anything for several months!"" even though he didn't either.

Tips to get my boyfriend to clean?  Stories from people who married someone like this?  Did it get better or worse?  Is this still a danger sign if everything else is going well?  

The last thing I want to mention is that I DON'T WANT TO KEEP THE MENTAL LIST.  In my head lives a list of things that need to be cleaned.  The sheets need to be changed within a few days, the laundry needs to be done, the dining room table needs to be oiled.  I do not feel that I should have to tell my boyfriend what to clean.  It should be evident.  I do not want to tell him to clean, period.  I want him to see a dirty table and think, ""Oh, that needs to be cleaned.""  You know, just like a real adult."

bvr84,15,2010-04-25,13 years ago I began a University degree...,shaard,reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/bvr84/13_years_ago_i_began_a_university_degree/,"... and this past Wednesday I wrote my last final towards its completion.  I am now a Computer Science graduate!  For anyone that feels that their degree program is dragging on, or that they think that they can't do it cause they're ""too old"", I call you out and say that it doesn't matter!  So long as you accomplish what you set out to do!

My path was a little more convoluted and I wasn't in university that entire time, however 6 years ago I returned to part time studies to finish it off, finally transitioning to full time studies (plus a year long internship) 3 years ago.

I am now off to celebrate and hunt for a dev job.  Anyone hiring?"
bxlej,8,2010-04-29,Need Advice /r/Design. Regarding an internship decision.,KorgRue,Design,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/bxlej/need_advice_rdesign_regarding_an_internship/,"So this summer I accepted an internship. Really fun agency. Will be interning in their interactive design and development department. In a really great district of the city. Really cool old building. Casual, jeans and button down type work environment. Good client base. Only catch is that it is an unpaid 10 week internship.

Today, another agency contacted me offering an intern position with their interactive department. Conservative ad firm. Pretty well known. Some really big clients. Located in a nice suburb. Shirt and tie type work environment. Well paid internship.

Possibility of full time employment with either company next year after I graduate.

What should I do? What would you do?

**EDIT:**

Thank you all so much for the feedback. I made my decision this morning in part from your feedback and in part from other information that I should have revealed when I posted this question.

I am a 34 year old disabled vet. I worked for 10 years after I got out of the military (due to injury) for a stuffy shirt and tie company, in a stuffy work environment, with stuffy co-workers. The pay was **really** good, but I was miserable and creatively crippled. I quit my well paid job and went back to school in a field that allowed a larger degree of creativity, that did not require a shirt and tie (in general), and would put me among other creative people. The thought of working for a conservative ad agency in the type of environment that I quit my career over is what makes the decision so difficult.

Money or Happiness?

I had to go with happiness, and selected the ""fun"" firm. I called the other firm and declined the offer a few minutes ago. I have a secondary source of income, and although the extra money from the paid internship would have been helpful (who doesn't want more money?), I decided to put my happiness (and sanity) in front of the money. 

Again, thank you all for your feedback. It was seriously appreciated in helping me make this decision."
