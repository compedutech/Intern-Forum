I'm an intern, my internship isn't supposed to be for programming but I've gotten a bit of a side project with ruby on rails. My programming experience is all in computational physics and networking dynamics simulation (math) so I'm not really a web developer. I know a few languages but not ruby at all. 

I would love a quick overview on how ruby works (especially the directory structure and stuff). I've been editing files and attempting to see what happens to no avail. 

How do I push updates to the code to be live?

Anything important I should know?

Thanks a lot in advance. "
92c7y,2,2009-07-18,"Reddit, I'm sorry, I love you, but Redditjobs kinda sucks. Many of us are unemployed, and there are only a handful of positions listed, and from a while ago. I would love to work for a place that appreciates Reddit -- can someone at Reddit kick up the outreach?",snoosnoo,reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/92c7y/reddit_im_sorry_i_love_you_but_redditjobs_kinda/,"Once when I was an intern I was part of a new media company's attempt to start a job board as well. They had me emailing hundreds of recruiting officers, following leads from job-postings and Craigslist, offering incentives like featured placement of a job in ad space, etc. Even if I only got back a dozen responses to 100s of emails per day, that was still a dozen potential jobs.

I think Redditjobs is a great idea, especially in these times. I keep hungrily returning to it, only to see the same stale postings from a month ago. There are currently 19 jobs posted (most of which are probably taken by now), and 500,000+ people are losing their jobs every month. Do we see the disparity?

I know there are jobs out there -- especially, and luckily, for people of the computer-savvy mindset. It would be much appreciated if Reddit could maybe set a hapless intern or two in pursuit of finding more companies that want to be considered by Reddit's considerable talent pool.

I'll be happy to do it, if you're hiring."

I have pretty bad chronic insomnia (ba-dum-tish), and the only thing that does the trick is marijuana.  Lack of sleep has been effecting my work lately, so I've been trying to get some.  Not to mention I love programming while high.

If I were to be in CA longer I'd get a medical card.  I've managed to get small amounts from street dealers a couple of times, but I just hate dealing with the shady people around here.  You can only stretch a dime so far.

Today I was on the prowl for some, and as I was turning the corner onto a fairly prime area, I saw five police cars drive up, and pull their guns on two black dudes.  They proceed to shove them to the ground, cuff, and frisk them.  Fucking racists.  I don't know the full context, but I'm sure it was drug (and probably weed) related, and that firearms and general roughness certainly wasn't necessary.

Anyway, this scared the shit out of me.  I'm not going to try to get any in any kind of public setting again, at least until I'm back where I'm from.  For the police there it's essentially decriminalized.

What's a good, safe, unsketchy way of obtaining some?  The friends that I have made here so far are pretty unchill regarding this topic, categorizing weed smokers as ""druggies""."
9397i,5,2009-07-21,Could use some advice.,just_a_girl,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9397i/could_use_some_advice/,"I had been dating my boyfriend for four years.  We had been long distance for the past two years, and not-so-coincidentally have broken up twice in the past two years.  We were both finishing up our junior years in college and were planning on living together this summer to the West Coast (we're from the East Coast).  We decided this back sometime in February; I had been looking for internships for months with no success.  My dad offered to hand in my resume to his company in the Midwest and I figured it couldn't hurt.  The boy finds an internship with great ease (naturally) and immediately takes it.

See, last summer, he got an internship in the DC area and I, who wasn't thinking about the post-college world yet, didn't have any better prospects than a cashier job, so I went down with him, which caused huge fights between me and my parents, including threats of withholding payment for school and estrangement.  I did end up getting a job down in DC, and at the time I believed my parents to be strongly overreacting, but I wasn't in a good spot financially and hated fighting with them constantly, so naturally, it wasn't exactly something I didn't want to repeat again.

Come April, I still didn't have anything in LA (where the boy got his internship) and I was getting nervous.  Come May, I didn't have anything in LA, but an interview with my dad's company, and, being a jobless worried person, I took the interview and got the job.  So my parents are like 'You should take it!' and my boyfriend is like 'You promised you would come out with me to California!' because, in his words, California was going to be the best and greatest thing for our relationship and was going to fix everything and put us on the right track, etc.  So naturally a lot of fighting occurs - I want a job, but I also desperately want to be in California, for it had been a personal dream of mine and I was just getting out of a pretty deep depression and thought that if I could live a dream of mine, if I could achieve a goal that I set for myself, it would be a sign that I had control over my life and that I could do what I wanted to do, etc.  So, long story short, my parents yell at me and make me feel worthless and I make my mother cry and she says that my father won't speak to me if I go gallavanting off again, while me and the boy are driving to California, and I tell the boy that I have to go to the Midwest and he drops me off at the airport in Denver and drives off.  And he's *angry.*  And, given the way he had been talking about this trip, and given how angry he was when he just decided to leave me at the airport (about 15 minutes passed inbetween me talking to my crying mother and me being left alone at the airport), I figure that our relationship is over and I'm bawling in the airport, my parents pay for a flight home, etc.

OK.  So fast forward a few months.  I dig myself out of yet another depressive state that I immediately spiraled into from the moment I step into the Denver airport and I have a quarter-life crisis, of sorts.  I believe I have to sort things out and figure out issues between me and my parents and stabilize my own personal and emotional state and really figure out who I am after all of this and all of that.  And the whole time, the boy keeps on calling me and calling me and calling me, saying that he doesn't understand what he did wrong and how could I ever feel abandoned in Denver and how could I ever think that me not going to California = me leaving him and why I don't deal with how 'emotionally abusive' my parents are and so on and so forth.  I've told him that this whole thing has been really hurtful and that I'm very confused and need time to figure things out, but the most I got was three or four days without contact.  I just really need some space, and he doesn't understand it.  He doesn't understand that at this point, I really just want to be alone and by myself so that I can sort my life out and get back on track.  At this point, I'm not getting back with him.  You reach a breaking point, you know?  And he says I'm taking my anger out on the wrong person and everything, but I really just want to be alone.  It's not like I don't care about him and it's not like I don't love him, but I really just need to be alone, sans contact, and it is so hard to do.  How do I go about this without hurting him (as though such a thing were possible)?

**tl;dr** (and you don't have to tell me twice about the tl part, sorry...): I have a lot of personal issues involving my psychological well-being and emotional relationships and want to be alone for them but the boy won't leave me be.  How can I convey any clearer that he needs to let it be?"
93jak,210,2009-07-22,My whopping FREE emergency room visit in a land of socialized medicine,carlgorn,politics,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/93jak/my_whopping_free_emergency_room_visit_in_a_land/,"It seems to be ""oh the horrors of socialized medicine!"" story time!

Yeah, so last spring I was studying abroad in Ecuador and I was interning at an orchid reserve in a cloud forest by Quito. I was doing what foreign interns love to pay money to do; manual slave labor. So I was lifting some rocks and I felt a sharp pain on my finger which I thought was the rock poking me. Then I screamed ""Holy fuck shit cock damn oh my god fuck shit!"" and I ran to the nearest stream and threw my hand into the cool water hoping this would somehow ease the pain. My finger then started to turn red and swell and it doubled in width. I felt a little uneasy about the pain and swelling and gripping my hand I stumbled around a bit and sat down wondering if this was serious. I knew it wasn't a snake, since the only poisonous snake there is freaking huge. I thought it must have a been a spider or scorpion, which is still pretty bad. After minutes of contemplating my situation, my arm sunk into numbness and I started to feel a bit dizzy, probably from my anxiety attack.

I then realized this is potentially bad and I needed to get my ass out of the forest and to a hospital. I left the garden and went across the street to the reserve's restaurant, where I explained my situation in terrible spanish to the old crazy reserve owner, who told me it was probably a crab. I thought ""ummm, I think I'm going to go ask someone else now....."" Thankfully, some couple at the restaurant overheard me and offered to drive me to the nearest town's hospital about 10 minutes away. So they drove me to the small town of Nanegalito, which was the area's only hospital.

We then went into the emergency room where I waited about 1 minute to receive help. They promptly took some of my blood and shot me full of painkillers (Sweet!) and did some sort of test thing to it to determine if I needed an anti-venom. While waiting, they asked me questions about who I was and where I was from and why I was in Ecuador they didn't seem to care that I didn't have proof of any of what I was saying. After 10 minutes, they told me to come in 6 hours to make sure that the venom in me is not serious enough to warrant me to carry around a baggie full of anti venom. I came back 6 hours later, and everything was A-OK!

I'll admit, I was kind of afraid to go to hospital in the middle of nowhere in a developing country. But all the doctors seem well trained and had new needles and gloves and plenty of medical supplies and training. They also must have known of all the local poisonous animals since they told me it was a scorpion based on the symptoms and the blood testing thing.

How much did this all cost me? Nothing! Not once did they ask for money and they did not even care that I was foreigner! Their main concern was to make sure that I was not in any danger of harm and to make me comfortable and feel better. Oh socialism, so evil.

But no! The insurance companies here would have us all believe that because I was in a third world country with socialized medicine, I would surely not have received medical attention and would have died if the poison was lethal!
