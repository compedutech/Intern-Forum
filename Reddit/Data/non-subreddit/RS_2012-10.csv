10rt0x,1,2012-10-01,Stuck in a country that I don't like,clustergouda,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/10rt0x/stuck_in_a_country_that_i_dont_like/,"This is something that has been eating away at me every day for the past 2 months or so.

I'm currently living abroad in a country, where I went to college. It was never my intention to stay here after I graduated because of a couple of things: 1. I don't speak the damned language (which I don't even like. I took one semester of it and just hated it) 2. Majority of the people don't speak English  3. I don't like the people in this country 4. It's difficult to find employment and to get a working permit 5.Its even more difficult to find a place to live 6. Its really expensive.

Then during my second last semester of college I just had to fall in love with a girl (Lets call her Lauren) who went to the same school as me. Lauren was in her first semester so it would be a while until she would finish school. Things got really serious with her and I fell head over heels in love with her and she with me. Then of course I decided to stay and find work here until Lauren would finish school.

Things seemed to work out well, I found a job at a company that didn't care for me speaking the language and this September Lauren went back to school.

I started my job in July and since the first day it was a nightmare. My employer didn't take care of my work permit application which led to problems for me in finding an apartment. Finally I had to take care of my own application procedure and find an apartment which is now registered to the company, not me.

The company itself turned out to be a complete nightmare as well. I have no idea how it has survived thus far. We are 4 employees and all of us are planning on leaving (Well, one of them is an intern and will finish in less than a month anyway). The company is an empty shell with a run down owner/manager that is running it. He is completely full of himself and tries to micromanage everything when he is in the office. Thankfully, he travels a lot.

My work contract is for 6 months so it terminated this december, which I am super grateful for. Still, I need to find a new job ASAP to be able to stay in the country. Me and my girlfriend dont believe in long distance relationships so if something would happen and I would have to leave the country then the relationship will be over.

Every day that I go to work I feel like I die a little inside. I hate my boss and I hate my job. I hate this country and I hate the hordes of white wannabe gangster teenagers that I see every day hanging out on every street corner and area with a bench. I hate not having any buddies to hang out with any more like I used to. 

But I love my girlfriend and I will keep on trying to find a new job like I have been doing these past weeks. I will keep on enduring my stupid pompous asshole boss until I tell him that I will not be resigning my contract with his sorry excuse for a company.
I will keep doing this even though I only get to see my girlfriend on weekends, because it is still worth it. I truly believe that I will never find anybody like her if I should lose her.

This felt really good to get off my chest. Thanks to anybody that read this, I hope that it provided some sort of entertainment!
If anybody else is in the position where they find themselves stuck geographically because of relationships then know this: there is someone out there that knows EXACTLY how you feel

Its really been depressing me that I can't find a job so I'm turning to reddit to help me find one. I'm not looking for money, I'm from a rich family, but I want to live my own life right now and having no job isn't helping, I'm prepared to move to any part of the world, flip burgers, whatever (honestly I got turned down from a burger flipping job for being over qualified)

I kind of know why I'm not finding a job though, its because I cut and run at my internship (Worked at Johnson and Johnson / DePuy). I was trying to get into med school, i had flunked the entry test, so I quit to retake the test but after a while I found out my grades just weren't good enough to get into medical school (off by about 5-6% overall), so I'm just looking for any ideas on what to do, its 6AM here and I havent slept all night, I'm 22 and living with my parents, which really sucks and has depressed me into even having suicidal thoughts at times, I only leave my house to go to the gym and then just come back, apply to jobs, or watch tv on my computer or go on reddit. 

I've already posted my qualifications I'll post a little ""about me""
I'm a cool guy, excellent liar (I guess might come in handy if CIA is recruiting), honest and open to the right people (bit of a contradiction but oh well..), multilingual, speak english, hindi/urdu and sindhi fluently and I'm okay at german. Interests include, bodybuilding, fashion, guns, science. I don't know any programming etc, but I'm okay at MRP/ERP software like alliance MFG and SAP.

I'll edit if people want more info, this just feels pathetic now :(, any other sub reddits I should post this to? I'm hoping someone on reddit works for a company looking for mechanical engineers or something, I dont have high expectations, I'll work any job as long as I have food on the table and roof over my head, preferably many miles away from here.

I know this is a long shot, but who knows maybe the right person will see this. I have an account on Career Center, and I've been going to the job fairs, but a lot of the hiring work places are too far away from me. 
I'm looking for a place within 10 miles of USF, and I'm available to work anywhere from 15 - 30 hours a week.

I'm tired of working a mundane cashiering job and would love to work in a company where I'm gaining experience and using learning for the career I want. The ideal opportunity for me would be to intern for a while and once I graduate, get promoted to a full time position. But, I'm okay with a temporary internship as well. 

I have a good GPA (3.35) and I have a lot of drive to do well in my field, once I know what to learn I will go all out making sure I can do the best I can. So if you or anyone you know is looking for a quick-learning dependable intern, shoot me a message and we can discuss it further. Thanks!

Edit: I have experience with Java (It's been a while since I've used it), C# and C++, I've taken Data Structures and am learning Algorithms and Operating Systems. I've taken many more classes, but I find these are the most relevant and what I've learned the most in!"

I am a fairly recent graduate (2008) from Western New England College with a BS in Electrical/Computer engineering. 

For the past three years I have been working as a Field Applications Engineer here in MA, employed by a leading edge enterprise class SSD design/manufacturing firm based out of California. My job responsibilities included providing our local customer with onsite analysis of any production or customer failures as well as maintaining and presenting weekly updates of root-cause failure analysis efforts. I was a primary point of contact between our design/production/manufacturing engineering teams and the customers' qualification/quality engineering teams, driving product and manufacturing improvements.

Prior to this position I held several internships, where my responsibilities included conducting FMEA tests, testing circuits to determine points of failure, calculating component deratings, and participating in ""first unit teardown"" analysis, inspection, and reporting.

Through my education and employment I've gained beginner/intermediate level skills including: 

* Matlab
* MathCAD
* C/C++
* VHDL
* RTL	
* Assembly Language 
* Solidworks
* MS Office

In addition to the aforementioned skills, I have always been a quick learner and would love to continue my education to improve upon any of these (or other) skills necessary in a future position.

Moving forward, I would like to enter a field which will allow me to incorporate my personal passions for mechanical and electrical systems into my career; possibly working with control systems in the aerospace, automotive, or biomedical/biomechanical industries. Depending on location, I may be willing to relocate for a position, however I am primarily interested in employment in any MA/NH/S.ME locations. 

Please feel free to contact me for a more comprehensive/detailed copy of my resume.

Thanks

10wemr,6,2012-10-03,I [M--22] just broke up with my girlfriend of nine months [F--21] and want to know if I did the right thing.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/10wemr/i_m22_just_broke_up_with_my_girlfriend_of_nine/,"**tl;dr** I [M-23] just broke up with my girlfriend of nine months [F-21] because I didn't feel cared about. She's very busy on an out-of-state internship and stressed, and part of it is my being too needy. I think she really does love me, but she seems like she isn't committed enough to the relationship. I'm not sure how much she cares or how much she wants me. I think she's confused on some things and I feel like I may have given up too easily, even though others said I put up with more than I should have. I'm wanting to know if I did the right thing.

I'll keep it as short as possible. It won't be very short.

We were together for nine months and broke up once before, for about five days. When we first started dating, we both knew she'd be going away this fall. I thought I'd give it a shot anyway, just in case we felt like keeping it going. She never led me on. I always understood it was a long-shot.

We had our issues. I had some issues with her. I didn't like the fact that she smoked now and then, because I thought it'd become more. I didn't feel comfortable with how close she was with guy friends. I felt like she was emotionally distant and often immature. She said shit while dating me that I feel like one shouldn't say in a committed relationship: ""I really want to date a girl some day."" Ugh.

But overall it was good. I dealt with it. I sucked it up and did my best to love her and be good to her. 

We broke up for the first time on June 30th, 2012. I asked if she wanted the relationship, and she said she didn't know. She decided she wanted to call it quits there, because she was focused on her career and didn't want us to blow up and deal with that while away.

Five days later we were back together because we wanted each other, and because she said she didn't realize how much she actually appreciated me. 

From then until she left, it was up and down for a while. It was good, then I was feeling bad about things and wanted to end it often. I felt that she wasn't giving me much of her time, even though she could have. She lived fifteen minutes away but I only saw her once or twice per week. I felt that she wasn't really trying. 

Then it got really good. I started hearing stuff from her that I never expected to. ""Hey, this is going to be difficult, this next semester. But if we can make it through, I really want to work on us."" One night she looked me in the eyes and I could see how genuinely important I was to her. I forgot what exactly she said, but it was probably the most serious, deep moment of my life. She was serious. She wanted me. She wanted us. She had progressed... evolved. She wasn't the purely career-driven, cold, uncaring businesswoman that I had first started being with. There was more developing. 

So she moves off. We almost never Skyped. I had to ask her to talk on the phone. She would mainly just do text messages. I felt like I had to beg for her attention. She was (and still is) really, really busy with a very serious internship. She's also under a lot of stress. I really don't even know how bad it is, but she says she almost never gets a moment alone.

I tried to be understanding, but I still felt like she wasn't taking what opportunities she had. 

I told her that I felt like I was the lowest priority for her. I told her I felt like she didn't care. I told her that I really wanted her and to be with her, and that I loved her. I told her I understood that I'm a bit more needy than average, and that she's a bit less. I was trying to get her to just fight me on that. I wanted her to convince me that she cared and to fight to keep the relationship. 

She didn't fight, though. She told me she wanted me and wanted to be with me, but that she's not surprised I felt this way. She just said, ""Yeah, maybe we should end it."" I didn't want to end it, and I told her this. We both thought about it for like a day. I felt so much better for getting it off of my chest. She told me she loved me. 

That evening I talked to my mother on the phone, and kind of just came to the realization with her help that I was more committed than she was, and that that's probably a good recipe for getting hurt. That basically, if she couldn't make me a priority when I was making her a priority, that it was a bad situation.

The next morning I told her this, and gave her some examples of things I'd do for her that she wouldn't do for me. She agreed. I said that if she can't make me a priority, that I wanted out. 

I can deal with the distance. I can deal with not feeling cared about, or not getting everything I want. But only if I know that it's temporary and situational, and that she's committed to me. That she wants a future and wants to work with me. I didn't need her to promise me that she would always be with me. I just needed to know that she wanted to legitimately try. I'm afraid that I may not have been clear enough on that last point.

I wish I could tell her these things now:

+ ""I love you. I feel connected to you in a way that I don't really feel like wanting to connect with anyone else.""

+ ""I wasn't asking you to promise me that you'd always be with me. I only ask that you'll make our relationship a serious priority, as important (but not more important, at least not now) as your career goals.""

+ ""I was honestly making an effort to be with you forever. I didn't think it would work. I was just *trying* for that. I wanted to know that you wanted to *try* for that too.""

Anyway, I told her that she can email me if she needs advice or someone to talk to. I also told her that I hope to try again with her in the future.

I learned recently that she may be accepting a job where I live. This was something that I had hoped might happen as a way to facilitate us being together. So I feel almost like the stuff that I'd wanted to happen was slowly happening with her in the way I'd hoped it would, except I fell off the train. 

In this relationship, so far, my patience has paid off. I felt like giving up many times. But when I didn't, things got better than they were before. She became so much more than I thought she ever would be in a relationship, even though she's not quite there yet. 

I generally feel like I did the right thing but I love this person and I'm worried about how she'll do without me. I think she does love me. I feel like despite our issues she makes a great match for me, and would only get better with time. I feel like I broke up with my best friend. She's seriously one of the best people I've ever met. She's brilliant and strong and beautiful. She's going to change the world. 

I just hope I'm completely over her before I start seeing her on the news for the great things she's doing.

I avoided posting this under my main account. I wanted to, because I wanted her to see it. I wanted to contact her. I wanted to reach out to her. I wanted to post something for her to see when she stalks my Reddit profile. But I'm not doing it. I'm trying to stay tough and move on. 

Did I do the right thing? My mother says I did. My friends say I did. Rationally, I think I probably did, but I'm not sure. Emotionally, even, I feel like I probably did. And I'm not just completely devastated over this, which to me indicates that maybe it wasn't really meant to be. But I don't feel so tough right now, and I don't trust myself. I'd rather have this issue between us fixed and be back with her than have a billion dollars.

10vysb,65,2012-10-03,-100 lbs My weight loss journey,masterofpuppets8986,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/10vysb/100_lbs_my_weight_loss_journey/,"For those that don't want to read here are the [pictures](http://imgur.com/a/05PHj).

It all started a few years ago.  I was feeling pretty down about myself.  I decided that I needed to do something.  I was 360 lbs. and I hated looking in the mirror, having my picture taken, etc.  The first thing that I decided to do was to cut out soda from my diet.  That went pretty well I lost a good 10-15 lbs. in a short amount of time.  About eight to twelve months or so.

I realized that I need to do more because I was still very large.  So I joined a gym with my dad (who had the looks of a model by the way...not an easy thing to live with or up to at all)  and my brothers and I started going a little bit at a time a couple of days a week to get some excerise.  I would ride the recumbent bike for an hour and burn about 700 calories or so according to the machine.  I dropped about another 15 lbs. or so in about six months and hovered around 330 for about a year there.  In the summer of 2011 I had a full time job, plus an internship so I had about 5-10 days off total for the whole summer (which ended up being a convenient excuse to not go to the gym very much).

After the holidays in 2011 so about midway through January I decided I needed to up my days at the gym.  So I started to go four days a week with a break in the middle.  I would start to lift some weights on the machine and I would ride the bike for an hour.  I did that for a couple of months and lost about 10 lbs. or so but kind of plateaued. I decided to step it up.  I do have weak knees (big bone spurs that are a result of Osgood Schlatter's disease) so I was afraid to push myself, but I took the leap and stepped up to the elliptical for an hour.  I worked my way up so that I would be burning around 1100 calories in a hour (again according to the machine).  I did this and I was at about 290 and very happy with the way things were going.

At the beginning of the summer there was a weight loss competition at work that the ladies convinced me to join.  So I said well if I'm doing this I'm going to win the damn thing.  I upped my days to five days straight at the gym every day lifting weights on the machine and an hour of cardio on the elliptical.  Near the end of the competition (late July) the machine was reading a total burning of 1100-1200 calories every time.  I ended up losing about 15-20 pounds during the summer alone.

Now I needed more.  I didn't seem to be gaining any upper body strength, and the cardio was good - but it can only be so effective.  So I turned to the expert.  At the beginning of August I started to see the personal trainer at the gym. (I did my research and she checked out.  Also if you are thinking about doing personal training really make sure that the person you are training with has some sort of education -there are A LOT of unqualified trainers that get hired by gyms)  Since then I have been going to the gym six days a week, I have a wide variety of exercises that I do so it keeps things fresh and my body guessing.  I have been having a lot of great intense workouts and she haves my keep a journal of things that I eat using myfitnesspal.  This last week I officially passed the 100 lb. barrier and I weigh (depending of the scale) in the 255-260 range.  I am extremely pround of my accomplishment and the work that I put in.

My diet now doesn't really revolve around calories but I eat A LOT of protein, I try to minimize the ""bad"" carbs - grains, pastas etc.  I do eat those carbs but only whole wheat or whole grain and never at the end of the day.  Also I am told all of the time that I need to eat more fruit and vegetables (which I feel like thats all I eat aside from protein).  But I feel great now and I am working hard everyday.

That's all that I can think of so I'm going to stop rambling now.  Thanks for reading!"
10vnt1,1,2012-10-03,"Simple, yet great idea (I think) to get firms hiring College Grads",[deleted],business,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/10vnt1/simple_yet_great_idea_i_think_to_get_firms_hiring/,"One of the biggest obstacles after graduating from college and trying to find a job is the fact that you have little to no ""real world experience"".  I know, profound realization right?  I don't think this hurdle is as big of a problem on the part of the graduate though, I think the big issue is the fact that employers know they have to spend a lot of time training you before you provide them the ability to generate your own revenue. 

In short, the way to solve this issue can be summed up as: Get firms hiring college grads, but don't incentivize it so much that people with experience are being regularly beat out for jobs.  My proposal is simple.  First time employees (in real jobs, your previous internship or stint at Burger King doesn't hurt you) within 1 year of graduation are able to work and the employer gets an additional tax deduction (say, for example, up to 50% of their salary) for one year.  A firm hiring a new college grad for an entry level marketing position (for example) at $40,000 per year could actually deduct $60,000.  This can help curb the costs of training somebody new, additional costs associated with getting a new employee (computer, supplies, etc...), as well as help promote firms to look at the inexperienced, and just get some more opportunities going.

The main point is this shouldn't ""cost"" the government much in lost tax revenue as those jobs probably wouldn't even exist in the first place.

I can imagine issues arising with small firms in need of people with simple tasks just hiring and firing a college grad every year to take the extra deduction (since they know the ""training curve"" would be short), so there may need to be an allotment (say only 5% of your current employees per year) so that if you had a small 10 employee firm you could only do this once per year.  This could help keep openings available for current experienced workers.  

Anyways, just a thought.  I know within my own company (engineering firm) that right now when the economy is slower, firms are reluctant to take on a noobie only to have to spend a year training them before they are very productive.  Something like this may just help."
10vn6v,19,2012-10-03,[20 F] How to deal with boyfriend's [21 M] relationships with his ex?,throwhaaway,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/10vn6v/20_f_how_to_deal_with_boyfriends_21_m/,"I'm 20f, the boyfriend is 21m.  We've been dating a little over a year.  Sorry about the wall of text that's coming.


A little background first: I've only had one serious relationship before this with a guy back in high school that I dated for three years.  I do not have nor desire to have a relationship with said ex beyond the polite greeting when we pass each other in public, which doesn't happen often (and only when we're both back in our hometown during breaks from college).  My boyfriend has had five previous relationships, none of which have been as long as ours.  He is on good terms with most of them, and will still talk to them on the occasional basis, maybe attend a birthday party, etc.


My issue comes from one particular girlfriend from his hometown, we'll call her M.  My boyfriend's and my hometowns are about forty five minutes away from each other, so our summer break was not an LDR.  However, I was waitressing over the summer and worked five days a week (and always on Friday-Sunday), and he was working at a tutoring clinic, so we didn't get to see a lot of each other.  A lot of the boyfriend's friends were also out of town due to internships, so he hung out with what friends were still in town.  Unfortunately, one of these friends was M.


M and my boyfriend never hung out 1-on-1.  My boyfriend was always very open about when she was going to be in a group he was hanging out with, and showed no signs of trying to hide anything.  I trust him completely and do not even have the slightest notion that he cheated on me.


However, I was still uneasy every time I knew they were hanging out.  Since I don't have a relationship with my ex, and my ex didn't have any previous relationships before ours, I had never had to deal with a situation like this and thus didn't know how to handle it.  However, I didn't want my boyfriend to miss out on spending time with friends simply because she was there, and I trust him, so I let it be.


At the time, my understanding of their past was that they had dated for a few months their junior year of high school, she dumped him without reason, and they gave each other the silent treatment until making up their senior year.  However, about a week ago, my boyfriend and I were sharing amusing stories about our high schools, and he started a story with ""During the second time I was dating M...""


I froze.  ""Second time?"" I asked.  Apparently, they had dated twice.  Both for about the same amount of time, both with her ending it without giving a reason.  He found out this summer that she broke up with him ""because he wasn't moving the relationship fast enough"".  He ""thought that he had told me"", but I stated that I would have remembered something like that.


This made me feel incredibly uneasy and questions started flying through my head.  He obviously had enough feelings for her to date her a second time, so who's to say he wouldn't have tried for a third time if he was single this summer?  He had said before this summer that he didn't care why she had broken up with him because it was over, so did he find out by her offering the information, or was he lying and actually did care?  Her reasoning sounds rather bs to me (why couldn't she move things along if they weren't going fast enough/talk to him about moving things faster), so was that not the actual reason?


I shouldn't care about any of this because it has nothing to do with me.  He's with me now, and I know he'd never cheat on me.  However, I can't keep myself from thinking about it.  I know I have some insecurity issues from my ex, who wanted to break up with me for months but never had the balls to until I confronted him about his aloofness.  I know these insecurity issues have me asking myself 'how will I be able to tell if a guy looses interest in me?' in the back of my mind.


So the question is - how do I get myself to stop thinking about it?  How do I stop myself from dwelling on the subject, which does nothing but bring me down?


**TL;DR: I don't have/feel the need to have a relationship with my ex, so I'm having a hard time accepting my boyfriend's relationship with one particular ex.  Would appreciate advice on how to get over it.**"
10ved1,196,2012-10-03,At 23 I dropped everything and moved to Europe with a 5 month plan. At 26 I'm still here. AMA,[deleted],IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ved1/at_23_i_dropped_everything_and_moved_to_europe/,"*TL;DR - I am 26 and have lived in 4 countries, worked in two, and studied in two. I've lived in Europe for almost 3 years now and started my trip here with a 5 month enrollment in a University in Sweden. During my stay I was officially given deportation papers but successfully contested it. Currently I am living in the Czech Republic with plans to return to the US in a few months with my fiance.*

**Proof at the bottom**

I've seen a few people comment in the past on how they want to just give up on what they are doing and travel the world or move to another country. Almost 3 years ago I sold or moved all of my stuff into storage and moved to Sweden with a 5 month plan. I am not the best in terms of story telling and I have a hard time when it comes to my memory, so please bear with me.

After a 2 year relationship I decided to do a few things different in my life. I didn't have a college degree and I had wanted to move to Europe for quite some time, specifically Sweden. I decided to push myself to do that. I found out that I could go to school there for free (the rules have now changed for non-EU citizens). Before I applied or set anything in stone, I went to Sweden. I wasted quite a bit of money on this trip, but felt comfortable with going back. So after that summer I applied for University in Sweden for the second semester of the 2009-2010 year.

I had a few issues getting the visa in time as I had applied late, which you should usually only do if you're an EU citizen as the visa takes time. But, the Swedish Embassy was very helpful and understanding and gave me the direct number of the person handling my visa. I called him and he found my application and ""put it at the top of the stack."" I ended up getting my visa at the last minute, after rescheduling my flight once. I got to Sweden in January of 2010 with about 5,000 USD, clothing, sheets, and a few other things. I had missed a week of class by this time, but my main concern was that I had actually done it, I was in Europe. Now what?

I didn't even have a place to live when I arrived at around 10pm in the middle of winter. Fortunately someone on the train helped me and the next day I was able to slip into a student dorm which I had contacted before via email. They hadn't guaranteed me anything for another week and a half, but were able to work me in when I arrived at the dorm. This, I come to later realize, was a life saver and a rare occurance.

So I lived a college life with a dorm full of international students. I dated a French girl the 5 months I was in school. I applied for a 3 year English program so I could stay after those 5 months ended. But by the end of the 5 months I had run out of money. That is when I stopped drinking alcohol (I didn't heavily drink before or even drink a lot, I would just have a couple beers when going out. But in Scandinavia, a couple beers is expensive if you're at a club or bar.). But this is when things started to get tricky.

The relationship with the French girl ended as she went back to France. I was hit really hard by this and basically locked myself in my room even though a bunch of my friends were leaving after her and I didn't quite say goodbye properly. (I did when they left, but I wasn't with them the days prior to them leaving.) It wasn't until I developed a crush on a Swedish girl that I actually moved on. That lead no where (except trying a new drug), but at least got my back on my feet emotionally. But I then hit another problem.

When getting a visa for education (I'm assuming in a lot of countries it is like this), you need to show a bank account with enough funds to cover your entire stay. I didn't have that money. As I didn't come from a wealthy family, they didn't have that money either. So I was not able to extend my visa or continue with college. So, I kinda of sat on what I was doing (not much) for a month until I decided I should return back to the US. By this time I was getting some money from my parents (and not spending very much of it unless I had to). I didn't like getting money from them (as I never had before), but I wasn't going to let my pride stop me from continuing. Very shortly after my decision to return home after my ""fun"" I met someone.

She was a Russian girl. She came quickly into my life and also left quickly, but she left her mark. Because of her I stayed long enough to have another bridge built. I extended my stay for 2 months and again considered going home. I was speaking to one of my friends whom I had met in one of my classes, a German friend. He convinced me to stay with him in Germany with his family over Christmas and then go with him to Austria where he was living to learn German and stay in the EU. I took him up on his offer.

He is what kept me in Europe. His family was a warm, welcoming, and wonderful family. He is one person whom I know will stay with me the rest of my life and I am extremely lucky to know him. He was part of an organization that does exchanges for internships. His then girlfriend (also a friend of mine), called me one afternoon and asked if I wanted to go to the Czech Republic to do an internship. This was in January of 2011, a year into my European trip. I, of course, said yes. It would pay for my food and my bed, which was all I cared about at that time.

Within a few days I was off to Prague and then to Ostrava in the Czech Republic. I was giving presentations and speaking to students in High Schools about the United States. I was with a group of international students, one from China, one from Brazil, one from Russia, one from Peru, and for the first two weeks we had someone from Macedonia and someone from Serbia with us. We would spent a week at each High School and then go to a different one. We traveled throughout the Czech Republic for 8 weeks in many different towns.

In one of the towns I received a FB message from a girl whom I had never seen before. I asked the people I was with if they knew her and they didn't recognize her either. She wanted to meet me, but I was confused a bit as to who she was. But, I looked through her FB and decided that I should meet her (I based it off her pictures...), and so I agreed to it. It turns out she was a friend of someone at the High School and was very interested in foreigners, especially Americans. It also turns out that she was very, very shy. Her mother had given her the final push to even send that first message.

The first date I was the cocky guy trying to ""get"" with her. But by the end of the night things changed and I actually wanted to be with her. I bailed on another date to be with her and haven't looked back since. That was in March of 2011. I would visit her every weekend throughout my stay in the Czech Republic and then ended up moving in with her after the internship was over.  She is now my fiance and we are in the visa process for her going to the US to meet my family and get married. But, that skips ahead a bit.

I found a job as a conversation English teacher in a town near to where she lives. I was very lucky to have found this because up to this point I have been living off what my parents gave me and cheap housing from friends. I got a full-time job that paid relatively well (relative to Czech wages) and moved out of her parent's into our own apartment together. If you remember, I had never gone through the visa process again after I didn't have enough money to extend my visa previously. While in the process of getting everything I needed I was down to only getting my visa. I had a work permit, I had the contract, I had everything I needed except the visa. But that was a ways off.

I was given deportation papers the first week of my work. I told the head of my department. I am not sure if she fully understood what I was saying, but either way. The foreign police here were helpful (not the ones at the main office who do paperwork, but the ones who actually deal with the cases and investigations). They didn't care that I was working, they just cared that I wasn't legally there. I contested the deportation and was able to continue working during the months that it was being appealed. Eventually, just before the end of the first semester, I received word from Prague that due to my relationship with my now fiance, I cannot be deported. There were a few more snags along the way, but I ended up getting a 5 year residence permit without having to leave the EU or take a day off from work (except I missed a few morning classes because I had to go in to the foreign police).

Now I am preparing to go back home. In these 3 years I've seen my brother once (October of 2010) and my mom once (August of 2012). Other than that, I've seen no one from the US. I will have culture shock when I go back and just thinking about seeing my friends and family almost brings me to tears. Eventually I will come back as neither myself nor my fiance are to keen on staying in the United States permanently.

I will add that without the support from my family, both monetarily and simply being supportive of my ""adventure"", I wouldn't have been able to do this. I have a hard time with motivation and only have bursts of energy to do things. So without them I don't know where I would be right now. I've had so much help along the way that I have never and will never say that I remotely ""did this on my own"". I don't like when people say they are proud of what I did, unless it is immediate family, as I don't feel like I did anything special.

So, if you have any questions after this shell of a story, please ask me anything. I'll be on for about 3 hours until I have to walk my bunny.

*Edit - During this time I have visited many countries to see friends or just to travel. Other than the ones I mentioned in the story I've been to Norway, Italy, Slovakia, Hungary, Slovenia, Luxembourg, and Poland while here. I forgot to mention those in the story.*

*It was also pointed out to me that the females seem to be a ""bulk"" of the story. I didn't mean it that way. I mentioned the ones that affected my stay, and I'll admit I can be affected by relationships a bit much at times (which is why they affected my stay in terms of how long). This was over a period of over a year before my fiance, so I did not date that much considering the time frame. But in clumping them all together in the story, it might have magnified them too much. Not my intention.*

We've both been with other people but this is our first serious relationship (just over a year together, with numerous visits). I feel like you have to be serious and commit to some degree before you really 'commit' when you're on opposite sides of the country.

But I'm going to be honest and say it's terrifying to think that in 2 years, either I'll be moving to him, or we'll be meeting somewhere in the middle (where I can find a job). I know I can't just 'get over it' but... is it crazy to be committed to spend the rest of your life together after only knowing them for 3 years? I've been so on edge lately and I think it's because I'm applying for internships and thinking about the future and it's affecting us a lot. How do I bring my fears up without scaring him? Should I bring it up now or when I see him in person next month? Thanks guys."
10v1fi,8,2012-10-03,I feel like I'm losing touch with friends because I'm introverted/busy? ,sailboatsairplanes,introvert,https://www.reddit.com/r/introvert/comments/10v1fi/i_feel_like_im_losing_touch_with_friends_because/,"This semester I've been pretty busy with school and my internships, plus stuff for organizations I'm a part of at college. After all I'm in my junior year, and I'm starting to get more into my career. I leave my house daily at 8 a.m. and don't get back until 9 p.m., and that small chunk of time I have after I get home and before I go to sleep is devoted to eating, showering, studying and getting ready before the next day. In the past semesters, my schedule was always way more relaxed and I stayed up with friends until 3 or 4 a.m. just hanging out. I feel like this semester I'm just so busy that I don't have the time or energy to spend with them, and I'm starting to see the effects of me flaking out on them. 

Basically their expectations are different from what I am comfortable with. They're the kind of friends who spend every day together just sitting around, but this year I just don't have the energy after my long days to do that. I'll hang out with them for special events, for example if they were going out to eat somewhere or watching a movie at home, but I don't see the point in me driving over to their house just to sit around.

I'm also pretty family-oriented so some weekends I'm not available because I go home to see my family. I'm also not huge into partying. Sometimes I'll get in a certain mood where I actually want to, but that's rare. 

I just feel like my friends think I don't want to spend time with them. I always get comments asking where I've been lately. It's just that every day, I have a list of things that I need to accomplish, and I just do it more efficiently on my own. Like going to the gym for example, I don't ever go with anyone because I feel like I get the best workout on my own because I can just focus on myself and not get distracted. 

I have a friend who also constantly says I don't tell her anything, especially pertaining to my love life, but that's just because nothing especially noteworthy is happening to me at the moment. I also tend to be pretty private sometimes. 

Basically what it boils down to is me being afraid of losing touch with friends because I constantly tell them I'm busy, which I truly am, or I just don't see the pros of participating in an event they're doing (like partying; I'd much rather stay at home). 

I don't want my friends to perceive me as not wanting to hang out with them anymore or that I'm some party-pooper who hates parties, but I don't want to do stuff that I don't enjoy when I could be doing something else, just to make my friends happy. "

I've been writing a blog on games development and things related to programming games and I thought it might interest some people here.

Currently I am a student studying games programming (they do it as a course at many universities, if your interested you should try it!) doing an internship at a small java based company (not games related but very interesting). 
I try to update regularly but haven't really had an audience as of yet so I haven't had much feedback.

The blog is located at http://lyndonarmitage.blogspot.com/ I'm currently attending JavaOne in San Francisco so won't really be able to add anything greater for the next few days; I have a post I am working on related to Neural Networks and the possibility of using them in games which I will hopefully finish by the start of next week.

A few specific posts on it that might interest you guys:

I've always had an interest in computers and tech, but had it hammered into my brain in HS and college that I couldn't pursue computer science because it involved too much math. I've dabbled in programming a bit, but have a hard time sticking to it on my own. I could really use the structure of school (which would be financially difficult) or an internship of some sort where I get to actually learn as I work on projects. Most internships that I've found only take current students, so that doesn't seem like a valid option.

I've taken a look at some open source projects, but I really don't know where to get started. I feel like I need a mentor of sorts to point me in the right direction.

Any advice on learning to code/learning CS/building skills for a new career?"

**Started in 1988.  In 1987, there were issues at the start of the race and so the BAA felt a need to hire someone to help address those and so, voila!!  They hired me as the Technical Coordinator, then I was called the Technical Director and then the Race Director in 2001…all along my job responsibilities remained about the same….just making sure there are no mess ups!**    

*How many Boston Marathons have you run?*

**I have run 40 in a row…15 during the day and then 25 at night after my duties as race director are over.**

*What’s your best memory as race director?* 

**Probably helping to direct the 100th Boston with almost 40,000 in the race.**

*If you could change things and go back and redo your path to where you currently are, what would you change?*

**Business wise (I own my own event management business – DMSE, Inc.) maybe “own” more events then just managing them.  Seems like there is a huge market out there now for events!**

*What advice would you give to someone interested in working in the running industry, be it a sales rep, a race director, or anything in between?*

**Nothing better than to work at something you love and are passionate about but it is very, very labor intensive…you get “married” to it and the toughest part is slowing down and/or saying no sometimes.**

*The Boston Marathon is arguably the most famous marathon in the world, what have you done as the race director to preserve that image and prevent the Boston Marathon from losing that luster?*

**My job is to maintain the quality of the race itself and make sure that it all goes well for ALL the participants in the race.  I hope I have succeeded at that over the past 25 years.**

*This year you made it harder to qualify for Boston by making the qualifying times lower, what was the impetus behind that decision and what has been the general reaction to that decision?*

**The worst thing was turning qualifiers away. Didn’t make sense…people work hard, qualify, think they are in but in the end they are not. We had to respond to the marketplace and did.  It is working like a charm now.**

*The Boston Marathon is already a massive race, one that is planned out years in advance, how do you plan to continue to grow the name of the Boston Marathon or grow the actual race?*

**To grow participation wise, you need more real estate.  We just don’t have it.  We are not going to jeopardize the quality of the race for quantity. We could just be maxed out where we are right now…maybe room for slight growth but not much.**

*Do you foresee any big changes in the “marathon world” that you perhaps would be more privy to knowing compared to runners who don’t work in the industry?* 

**Nothing earth shattering but you never know.  Technology seems to be driving a lot of what we do now so nothing will surprise me.**

*What has been the greatest challenge for you as the race director of one of the most notable marathons in the world?* 

**Probably making needed changes (like changing the start time or instituting wave starts) while also maintaining the history and tradition of this 116 year old race.**

*What do you see as the greatest threat to the continued growth of the Boston Marathon over the next 5 years? 10 years?* 

**As stated above, SPACE, or lack of.**  

*How is the Boston Athletic Association and therefore the Boston Marathon adapting to the ever changing world of sports with particular emphasis to social media? E.g., Twitter, Youtube, LinkedIn, Facebook, Blogs, etc.* 

**Not my area of the race but I do believe the BAA is keeping pace with social media as much as possible and reasonable. I find all of this overwhelming myself!!!**

*How is the Boston Athletic Association and therefore the Boston Marathon encouraging the growth of distance running among young American athletes considering that distance running is often an overlooked sport and one that does not necessarily “captivate” the hearts of the masses?*

**The BAA does a lot with local schools and youth running.  We have numerous youth programs in place already and will continue to develop those programs over the years.  This is a very important initiative of the BAA.**

*What do you see as the general direction/trend of distance running and what do you think is the driving cause of that direction/trend?* 

**Continued growth in participation. The walls of intimidation have crumbled.  People get it now.  It’s not as much about competition as it is about participation.  It’s about building self-esteem and self-confidence.   I think we are still seeing just the tip of the iceberg.** 

*I plan on doing my internship over my last two semesters with the U.S. Air Force Marathon. If you could offer any suggestions that a new intern could bring to a fast growing and successful marathon such as the AF Marathon to make a very positive impact, what would that be?* 

**Maybe try to be involved in EVERY aspect of the event to gain an appreciation for what everyone does.  As a Race Director, I actually consider myself a “conductor” like in an orchestra.   Thus, my main job is to surround myself with the very best in all the different areas of the event.  I just keep them all going, all motivated, all inspired so as to insure that the end product is the very best that it can be.**

10y4sb,5,2012-10-04,"Full disclosure, or take the hint?",Dr_Santa,AskWomen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/10y4sb/full_disclosure_or_take_the_hint/,"Hello /r/AskWomen, I would like your help on getting some perspective on my situation.
The long story of this goes as follows: I have always been a chubby kid, and I adapted to my situation by putting on a thick skin and trying to be funny. In high school I was bullied by some people I had considered friends, and of course they would make fun of me for being fat. I believe this contributed to me developing a rather negative self-image, which put a damper on my ability to show interest and pursue relationships with the ladyfolk. Consequently, I have never had a serious relationship or any type of sexual contact, and I am 23 now. That situation is not good, in fact I would say it is very bad.


I think I sort of went into a downward spiral when I moved away from home to go to college and my bad consumption habits had free reign. I was at a personal worst last December: no job, out of shape, very fat, ate nothing but fast food, smoked a lot of pot, played games all day, and I was doing the bare minimum for my classes. I felt really unhealthy and I eventually had to confront myself and make some changes to avert impeding bodily disasters like a heart attack or diabetes


A few months prior to hitting rock bottom I had become friends with a rather peculiar but very cool young lady through shared our shared interest in marijuana. I think getting some perspective on her life made me realize how, well… pathetic I felt. She was a much better student than I, working an internship, in good physical shape, and just seemed to have her life in order. Even though she was three years younger than me, she had far surpassed me in overall life excellence. I considered her a remarkable individual and I had an interest in pursuing a romantic relationship with her, but it was apparent to me that she was out of my league. On the 1-10 scale I estimated her to be a solid 8 and I was like a 4. With such a disparity of apparent worth it seemed it would be inappropriate and rude for me to make any non-platonic advances towards her. 


But still, I felt like we had really good mental chemistry and she was like everything I could want out of a romantic partner. We are both very logical, analytical, well read, cultured, sophisticated as fuck, sarcastic, slightly evil, and somewhat conceited. With these traits, I don’t think either of us often meet people we really click with. With a lot of people I feel like even when they are present I am mentally alone, and I believe she feels the same way.


Anyways, starting in January I made some changes, started eating healthier, started exercising, and really tried to grow as a person and cultivate a better life for myself. I have sworn off soda, snack foods, fast food, started running daily, working out at the gym, and just spending more time outside and less time on the internets. I have lost a lot of weight since then, I’ve dropped ~75lbs and gained some muscle mass. Friends and family frequently comment on how I’m looking great now, which is sort of uncomfortable for me but still very cool. I felt really unattractive before, but I like what I see in the mirror now. I would say my lady friend inspired me to strive for greater personal excellence, and I would like to tell her about this.


I would say I’ve been working on my body image as a means to work up the nerve to ask her out, so for me there has been a lot of build-up to this. About a week ago I got drunk while we were hanging out and I made a pass at her by saying something to the effect that I find her very cool and very attractive, and she reciprocated by saying she thinks I am pretty cool and she values our plutonic friendship. I am wondering if I should tell her just how deep my feelings go, and the effect she has had on me, or if I should take what seems to be a very clear social cue that she is not interested in me in that way and let it go. So I turn it over to you, /r/AskWomen, how would you respond if you were put into a similar situation?



TL;DR: Developed a crush on a friend, used that as motivation to lose weight and improve self-image. 75lbs of weight loss later I politely make a pass at her, and am politely turned down. Want to know if I should press further and let her know what’s up, or take the hint, let it go, and move on?

10xg5s,6,2012-10-04,My pain-in-the-ass struggle; I'm asking for help /r/stopdrinking.,FeelingAlive,stopdrinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/10xg5s/my_painintheass_struggle_im_asking_for_help/,"I know what 'setting myself up for failure' is. I know what 'going from being a know to a doer' is. I even know all the benefits of not drinking, or quitting drinking is. I've gone dry for a maximum of maybe two weeks at best. Yet, I keep setting myself up for failure, being a knower, preaching what I don't practice, and generally being an asshole. I keep winding down this path of self-destruction. Walking down the steps of madness into the basement of self-pity and laying on a cold ground of lamentation. Alone again, depressed again, buzzed again.


As of writing, It's a little past four A.M. and was awoken by my roommate laughing her stupid ass off, drunk as a skunk. Meanwhile, I couldn't sleep because I myself have been drinking. I figured this out when I looked at my bank statement seeing I took a cab home, and realized I'm yet another forty dollars lighter in the wallet. Everyone thinks I've gone dry to a degree. I'm buzzed, not drunk. I'm certainly depressed, and most certainly angry with myself. I can't seem to get myself together anymore. No matter what I do, I end up doing the same stupid shit: looking for a way to drink. Every stupid-fucking day, I look for an excuse, or a way into a drink, a way out of a drink, it's something that teeter-totters in my mind. It's that loose pendulum: instead of laying watching it fall towards me about to cut me in half, I opt to just jump into it. I'm sick of it and can't figure it out.


A little preface: I'm recently twenty-four. I've been drinking every day since about the age of twenty-one. I'm a senior in an art school. I would've graduated earlier but since I decided to fall in love and drop out, here I am, the oldest kid in an art school. I live in a bullshit city where everybody drinks (Chicago) and am growing tired of it. Everywhere there is a bar, a liquor store, a hipster looking for an angry fix, a group of dopes walking to the next bar, a fucking drunk begging for quarters in the middle of the street. I've become so isolated because everyone knows I want to quit drinking, yet, a few know that I keep doing it. I've tried going dry, and have had minor success but end up hitting the pink-cloud and drowning in a mug.


The night before I had a long day. I had school early in the morning, I'm on my way to becoming a tutor. Rather than discuss the readings involving pedagogy, we made clay bones for some stupid girls internship. I came home, and my roommates were already drinking, it was in the middle of the fucking afternoon, I.E. it was noon. I sat and played Nazi-Zombies to block it out. An hour later, I had to go to work. Bear in mind: I hate my job, I'm a barista, I won't say where, but it begins and ends with S and it certainly 'sucks.' After a long tiring day, I take the bus home, and mind you, it's two busses considering Chicago was designed by a schizophrenic because of the stupid grid system.


Guess what? I walk into a bar alone and start drinking. I tell myself I wouldn't do that, but I do. Why? I sat there alone, drinking shitty hipster lager and bullshit well-whiskey, hating the people next to me, hating the person sitting on my stool. I hate the bartender for asking me if I wanted another one. Why didn't I say no? Why didn't I smash the shot glass against my forehead and plead guilty to alcoholism? I lied to her, another five dollars to the wind, another unsuccessful night.


Fast forward to this afternoon: I get home after a wretched mentoring session. Part of becoming a tutor is shadowing, and the person I shadow under is a timid idiot-sophmore script-writer with doe-eyes and no conviction. I get home, and then invite my wast-of-life roommate out for drinks. Why the fuck do I do that?! Now who has no conviction? We eat pizza, drink crappy beer, and I go off to do homework at the local cafe. Guess what? I drink more. Even worse: It's expensive! Overpriced dare I say. I sit there, trying to do homework but by this time, I'm deep into it.  


About an hour ago, I wake up needing to go to the bathroom. I can't sleep anyway because I feel so shitty for myself. My roommate is laughing her stupid ass off, looking at pictures of cats (Who doesn't) only she's wasted. It's the idontfuckingknowhowmanynights in a row she's been drunk. I get up, pretending to walk to the bathroom. I stand and look at her, my only words: ""What."" She laughs, saying she killed a bottle of merlot, saying 'I should go to bed.' and stumbles into her room where her boyfriend is passed out from being a champion at life (the one I was drinking with earlier). It's an image that sticks out: Her red-face, surrounded by garbage, a full ashtray, empty cans that have been there for days, her beat up brand-new mac book, and cursive-eyes and inability to sit up straight. Worst off: that stupid, indiscriminate stare coupled with a hanging laugh in her throat. She was me a year ago before I realized I had a problem, and she's always drank more than me.


The thing is, is that I know it's fucking crap: I don't like drinking, I hate drinking. I hate sitting there, sipping the same stupid shitty fucking beer or whiskey and paying for it too. Yet, I keep doing it like it's the only thing I know how to do. I'll tell anyone that I don't like drinking. I'll say I hate drunk people. I'll lose sleep over this like I am now. I'll tell my friends I'm going dry. I'll lie to them and say I've gone without a drink. I'll lie to myself and make up the amount of days I've gone without a drink. Even if it's just a beer, two beers, I hate it. Yet, it continues, 'and so it goes' I'm told, 'we all have a vice' I'm told, 'the drinking will continue until the economy/morale/state of mind/state of the union/state of affairs/credit reports improve' I'm told. I know it's a lie. I know it's stupid blue-collar bullshit mantras that make it seem like alcohol is an acceptable daily ritual. Hell, I watched fucking Cheers on a night where I craved the worst. Who the fuck laughs at that shit? Norm is an alcoholic and in a real world, would have had his drunk ass divorced knowing he was at that bar nightly.


I know I'm surrounded by alcoholics: all my life I have been around it too. Both my parents. My bi-polar brother. My parents split on a night of heavy drinking. Two uncles died of this shit. Every family argument starts from this shit. My long-time girlfriend dumped my sorry ass because it blurred all my problems into me being in a zombie-like comatose. My stupid classmates update their Facebooks with ""Omigerd heres a picture of my retarded cat, I'm drinking forties!"" Meanwhile, my classmates don't do their homework, and complain of hangovers, meanwhile, I can't get my stupid homework done because I too was drinking to incapacitation, and I'm not hungover, feeling like an asshole. My apartment is a mess because my roommates are either drunk or high, and one of them works only ten hours a week. My birthday was a week ago, I get a text from that same ex wishing me well and that she couldn't come out. I was told to have a few for her, the irony kills me. Even my father called wishing me a happy birthday, but since he's somewhat of idiot, he told me someone I knew was killed by a drunk driver. Happy birthday family style right?


How do I break this cycle? No really Reddit. I know, I know damn well. I'm sick of it. I don't like it, I crave it, but I hate it. I don't want it, but I end up needing it. I don't enjoy it, yet I do it. How do I break the hand thats rocking the cradle? How do I fight the isolation? If I don't drink, the am I not participating? How does one beat the lonely submission? 


""How do I break from the cycle of drinking?"" Is what I'm asking. Because I know there are some atoned fellows here (I read, never post) and I need your help more than ever. Thanks.

10x99j,83,2012-10-04,"IWTL how to stop feeling inadequate about my intelligence. In other words, how to stop feeling stupid.",whyamidumb,IWantToLearn,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantToLearn/comments/10x99j/iwtl_how_to_stop_feeling_inadequate_about_my/,"Throwaway account here. A little bit about myself. I grew up in a family of scientists and engineers...really brilliant and hardworking people. Growing up, my parents constantly told me my (small) accomplishments weren't good enough. I was constantly compared to my higher achieving friends.

My entire life I've worked my ass off in school to get good grades. Not necessarily because I wanted to ""succeed"" and have a good career, but to prove to myself that I wasn't stupid. I grew up with the belief that I wasn't as smart as other kids, so I had to work twice as hard to get the same results. I have average intelligence, but a killer work ethic. That's the only thing I pride myself in.

Right now I'm pursuing Computer Science. Math/CS courses kicked my ass, and I'm barely holding on to a 3.1 GPA. I can't find the words to describe how much I studied to barely get B's. Despite being discouraged, I continued to fight my way through.

Lately I've been a little depressed. It's not even school that's getting me down, but my peers. All the CS geeks in my classes are so fucking brilliant. Oh my God. They're so smart and can solve difficult problems in their sleep in a matter of seconds. I work my motherfucking ass off to get 50-75% of the solution but I'm never quite there. I can't live up to them. They're getting such stellar internships and amazing grades, and I for some reason doubt I can ever live up to that.

My coding skills are mediocre at best right now. I'm working everyday to improve which is more than other people can say, but progress is incredibly slow.

My inadequacy pervades all my thoughts. All day I think ""I'm not good enough, I'm not smart enough..."" over and over and over and that's the only reason why I continue studying. To prove that I'm NOT stupid. Waiting for one day for the lightbulb above my head to turn on and make me realize ""Holy shit! I'm actually pretty smart!"".

So I'm not really sure what to do. Before haters tell me drop out and do something else, kindly fuck off. I'm hell-bent on finishing this degree. Despite all the negativity above, I do actually enjoy programming, so it's not like I hate my subject. I love the major, just hate feeling stupid."
10zze4,18,2012-10-05,My husband won't get a job and I work 40+ hours a week to support him. Should I leave him?,justcarrie,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/10zze4/my_husband_wont_get_a_job_and_i_work_40_hours_a/,"Reddit users- please help. I've been going through this since last January and I just don't know what to do anymore. I'm so close to giving up.

I married my high school sweetheart. We were together for two years, then, broke up, because my now husband was in college and caught the typical ""frat boy"" bug. Three years later, I was in college and he was in the military. Feeling nostalgic, I contacted him and we started to talk again. A few months later, we resumed our relationship, long-distance. After graduating in June of 2010*, I moved several states to be with him. Things were great at first, until we started talking about committing further. 

I was extremely stressed at the time- I could only find minimum wage, part-time positions on top of an unpaid internship. He asked me one night if I was ready to be engaged, which of course, I was. I was hesitant to tell him that, but he forced it out of me. When I told him I was, he told me he wasn't ready yet. I was embarrassed and humiliated. I considering ending our relationship then, but tada- turns out my overall feelings of stress and fatigue were because I was pregnant. 

He was incredibly supportive. He told me he wanted to marry me, wanted me to move in with him and start our life together. I agree- a bit hesitantly, but I loved him and knew he could come through. Shortly after we were married, I suffered a miscarriage. We stayed married, and for the most part, were happy. He was in the Army, I found a full-time yet low paying position. Things were great- until he ended his contract with the military. 

After leaving the Army in January 2012, he decided he wanted to finish his college degree. He only had a semester left. I had found a better job in a different state, and moved to take it. The pay was great and I knew it could support us until he finished school. He finished up in May and ""officially started his job search"". 

This job search consisted of applying to 10 jobs a week at first. Eventually, it became 2-3, and then, none. I tried to be supportive. He stayed up all night playing XBOX and playing computer games, and slept until 2 or 4 in the afternoon. We started to have trouble paying our bills. To try to help, I took two freelance jobs to help us get by. I started working about 50+ hours a week to make ends meet. We had to borrow money from our parents. Finally, our lease was almost up and we could no longer afford to pay rent. 

Thankfully, the stars aligned- our friends invited us to stay with them until we got on our feet. They have just bought a house down South, where the cost of living was less. A job opportunity was available at our friend's company for my husband. My work was flexible, and agreed to let me work from home for a few months while they found a replacement. We decided to move. We did it, and so far, it's been better, but I'm starting to see similar patterns from my husband.

He let the job opportunity fall through, and makes a minimum effort to find another one. I work all the time, and have started to get so stressed and frusterated, I take it out on him. I just started applying to part-time jobs around here, hoping to find nightly work so we can move into our own place and continue to pay bills. He seems content letting this all fall on my shoulders, and I've grown to resent him for it. 

Sorry Reddit- I just desperately need advice. Has anyone else had similar issues in their marriage? Am I selfish for wanting out? The thought of leaving him scares me, and I don't want to, but I can't help but feel a little relieved just by thinking about it. 

NOTE: Sorry- I accidently wrote June 2012 instead of June 2010. I've been married for two years. "

I hope you will consider me for the position of Bullshitting Assistant at Assbeards Inc.

I was very excited to see the position open up on your company website. As a loyal consumer of Assbeards products for the past 0 years, I was thrilled to discover that my credentials are actually a great match with the position’s requirements.

It has been my very recent dream to work for this company. In fact, I first learned about the existence of Assbeards Inc. approximately 30 minutes ago, when I stumbled across the job opening on the Jobs section of my local newspaper. I skimmed the listing carefully, noting with a sigh of elated relief that it was a paid position.

I immediately proceeded to your website. A quick series of clicks on the ‘clients’ page confirmed that you are not a scam. That was all I needed to go ahead and start the application process.

As swiftly as a coursing river, I robotically entered all of my information into your online application system. I uploaded a PDF of my resume. I copied and pasted a plain text form of that same resume into a box; I tinkered with the headings, the paragraphs and the bullet points until that dreadful wall of text looked presentable again.

Now let me tell you about myself. I graduated from a decent university in 2012 with bachelor’s degrees in business and a foreign language. During my junior and senior years, I completed two internships that paid me not with money but with humility, knowledge of workplace etiquette, two recommendation letters, and the exact same skills your listing requires.

Although I am currently able to subsist on my part-time job and some savings, I dread the day when I have to admit defeat and move back in with my parents, who, despite being perfectly good and kind people, are very much OCD, domineering, invasive of my privacy, and highly skilled at weighing me down with feelings of guilt and inadequacy. So please, Assbeards, give me a chance. Save me from that fate.

And this is the part where I talk about how much I want to work for Assbeards. I would like to work for Assbeards because the money would pay for the roof over my head and the food in my fridge. I would be willing to put in 100% of my energy, passion and diligence into my work at Assbeards, not because I love Assbeards, but because I, like many college grads, have been screwed over by the recession and will cling on fiercely to any job that I can get.

I do not know how working at Assbeards would be a more rewarding experience than working at Dickhairs or CatTits because most companies in your industry and area appear to be variations of the same thing. I believe that your website has a green color scheme, and Dickhairs has a yellow one, but I could be mistaken about that. I would be lucky to get an offer from any of you. The company that doesn’t turn me down is the best company.

As I draw closer to the end of this letter, I am already imagining myself sitting in a cubicle at Assbeards, chugging coffee and doing work. After I submit this application and go to bed, I will fantasize about this job some more. One of two scenarios will play out later. In the first one, two weeks roll by, three weeks, four weeks, and I come to the eventual conclusion that I am out of the running.

In the second one, two weeks roll by, three weeks, four weeks, and I get an email. You want to bring me in for an interview. I show up in my best clothes, sweaty, nervous, but prepared to tackle your toughest questions and shower you with insincere compliments on the office décor. The interview goes well because it’s my 1,800th interview. “You’ll be hearing back from us in about a week, either way,” you say with a smile. I leave. A week rolls by, two weeks, three weeks, four weeks. I never hear from you again. Fuck you. I never wanted to work in your crappyass soulraping ceilingless office anyway.

Thank you so much for taking the time to review my application. I hope to hear back from you soon. If you have any questions, please contact me at bitterjobseeker@email.com or 123-456-7890.

Sincerely,

Bitter Job Seeker

P.S. You used Taleo? Fuck you again. In fact, fuck you four billion times.

We dated for almost two years, the first time we broke up was 6 months into the relationship, he dumped me out of the blue in a coffee shop at 1am with no explanation. I cut off communication with him and started dating other people. A few months later he calls me wanting to get back together.

Since the reunion things were a constant struggle, he couldn't fathom that I would date someone else after him and had constant insecurity issues and was pretty much emotionally abusive towards me (tried to convince me I was an awful person with bad morals, that I shouldn't go to graduate school, that I couldn't travel abroad for the year but he could go on an 8 month internship in the states..it goes on and on) so I finally ended it this summer. 

I found out in September he is now in a relationship on fb with this girl who was suppose to be my friend. She is from his circle of friends who I got close to in the two years I was with him and we spent a fair deal of time together. 

I feel like I was doing great following the break up, deleted fb, hit the gym, started my masters, living in a new city, then some other bitch messages me because she 'thought I should know', she also mentioned in detail the pictures they have been posting of them kissing, how they slept together shortly after our break up and he went on vacation with her.

Leaving him was the best thing I've ever done for myself but hearing this news brings up all new kinds of anger and hurt. &gt;:("
111xce,1,2012-10-06,Intern seeks help getting fit with unpredictable schedule and limited funds,[deleted],Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/111xce/intern_seeks_help_getting_fit_with_unpredictable/,"I've been at my internship for a month or so now and I'm spending a significant portion of my free time getting fit. I didn't really eat well, exercise regularly or doing anything that beneficial for my health in college, but I'm now trying to build muscle mass and lose a little bit of weight. I try to maintain a strict schedule, but my job at a local theatre sometimes requires long hours that are hard to predict. [The show must go, etc.] It's also worth noting that my job is fairly strenuous as I'm usually building scenery/hanging lights/being generally active. I'm looking for any advice/guidance/suggestions on my current workout plan/diet in the interest of specifically building muscle mass(bulk) and becoming generally more fit.


Here are some quick facts to start with:
Height: 5' 11""
Sex: Male
Age: 22
Weight(10/4/2012):188lbs
No medical disorders or injuries to speak of.
Non-smoker. (Though I will admit to smoking occasionally while with friends drinking.)
My history of exercise is varied, as I had a few limited stints of running regularly in college. I've never been devoted to a weights routine for long, however. 
I have access to a local gym. (YMCA)

My diet is limited to ~$40 dollars worth of groceries a week. I almost never eat out/get fast food because it's generally unhealthy and more expensive. I do drink beer and whiskey weekly. I eat almost the exact same thing every day, with a few variations.

Breakfast 1: Yoplait Light Yogurt, Two Pieces of French Bread, 1 oz Sharp Cheddar Cheese, 24 oz of Black Coffee
Breakfast 2: Yoplait Light Yogurt, 1.5 cups of Honey Bunches of Oats w/ Almonds, 1 cup of 2% Milk, 24 oz of Black Coffee

Lunch: 1-1.5 cups of Kroger Vegetable Medley(Broccoli, Cauliflower, Carrots), Orange/Apple/Banana(2/3 daily, rotates), 1-2 cups one weekly rotating main dish(ex. Chili, Chicken Alfredo + Garlic Bread, Beef Spaghetti + Garlic Bread, Cream Chicken + Rice, etc.)

Pre-running snack: One Clif Bar
Pre-lifting snack: One Clif Builders Bar

Dinner: Varies. Usually a couple more slices of bread, sharp cheddar cheese, and another piece of fruit.

(Note on diet: MapMyRun is a tool I use to keep track of my workouts/runs and do basic caloric calculations. Under the ""Exercises multiple times a week"" they suggest 2950 calories a day based on my weight. As I log foods, it appears that I'm not getting anywhere near that amount and typically have way less(only ~60%) than my daily required intake. I'm not sure of the accuracy, but I try to overestimate what I eat and typically work out 6 days a week.)

Currently, I rest one day a week, run three days a week and lift three days a week. So:
Running days: 4~5 miles, ~35:00-~45:00
Lifting days:(I struggle with the last two or three reps with each of my 4 sets)
All of these exercises are machines and I typically warm up by running around the track for 5-10 minutes. I make my rounds with a 32oz Nalgene water bottle and drink water significantly between sets/exercises.

4x10 Pectoral Fly-120lbs
4x10 Rear Deltoid(SP?) Fly-90lbs
4x10 Dual Axis Pulldown-130-150lbs
4x10 Tricep Extension-105-115lbs
4x10 Bicep Curl-70-80lbs
4x10 Abdominal Crunch Machine-100lbs
4x10 Lower Back Machine(?)-160lbs
4x10 Overhead Press-70lbs
4x10 Leg Press-195-235lbs(Just added this recently, haven't found my correct weight yet)
4x10 Pectoral Fly(Closer)-50lbs

How can I tweak my diet to be inexpensive and effective for my fitness goals? How can I tweak my cardio/lifting ratios to build the most endurance, strength, and bulk? Is there anything I'm doing horrendously wrong that I should stop immediately? Is there anything I'm not doing that I should start immediately?

Currently I've been on this schedule/diet for about a month and I'm already more energetic, have more endurance and can see some muscle growth(or fat loss.) My weight varies from 186-192lbs.

Thanks for reading and thanks for everything Reddit!

P.S. My first post ever!

[I consider buying this pair of shoes](http://imgur.com/a/Hbw1Y) but I'm not really sure in regards to the advice given in the [Shoe Guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/p7usf/shoe_guide_v20/c3n7ffi).

According to the Shoe Guide square toes should be avoided but chisel toes are fine. I'm having a hard time to see the exact difference and to decide in which category the pair given above belongs.

The context is that I'll start an internship at a bank next month and I want to avoid looking like (complete) a fool.
The linked pair is the only one I found online with a leather sole (which is rather important from what I understood :x) in my price range (&lt;=150e). Do you guys think the shoes are okay?

If you want to recommend other/better shoes please consider I'm from Germany so shoes only available in the USA aren't helpful. :/

Thanks and with best regards! :)"

Truth be told, I'm kind of happy that I finished the series because it was a powerful addiction costing me sleep.  The best sitcom I've ever seen that lasted beyond 5 seasons (and in my top 5 of all sitcoms).  I'll leave with two parting ""gifts"".

Comic book guy observations:
The penny truly being the cause of the stuck door as indicated in the Finale was not possible as the door was jammed when J.D. arrived on his first day.

Janitor reminiscing about giving Lady a duck on their first date to swoon her couldn't have happened because he tried with a squirrel midway into their relationship and she hated it and he quickly agreed with her.

Chocolate bear used in college memory as J.D.'s nickname for Turk was introduced during the series as a new nickname J.D. was trying out with Turk.

Favorite episodes (in order from most to ""least"" favorite--least still being I LOVED IT)

You may disagree with these, but some were my favorites because of either an especially poignant ending, a great character insight (e.g., Kelso knew about the doctors working around insurance issues) or both.

**My Screwup (Season 3)**
Jordan's siblings, Danni and Ben (Brendan Fraser) visit to celebrate Jack's first birthday. Carla tells Turk she will only take his last name if he has his mole removed. Dr. Cox is dismayed to learn that Ben has not been to a doctor for followup since his remission. Dr. Cox angrily blames J.D. for a patient's death and excuses him from his duties.This episode received an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Writing in a Comedy Series.

**My Musical (Season 6)**
The arrival of a patient who hears music all the time results in Sacred Heart turning into a full scale Broadway musical. Elliot tries to tell J.D. that she doesn't want to be roommates with him any more, while Carla attempts to decide whether she should return to work or not. The episode guest stars Stephanie D'Abruzzo. 

**My Old Lady (Season 1)**
The three interns have to face death for the first time: J.D.'s patient is a headstrong but kindly old woman, Turk's is a young man who just needs some company, and Elliot's is a Hispanic woman who does not speak any English. The episode's writer, Matt Tarses, won the 2002 Humanitas Prize in the 30 Minute Category for this episode. 

**My Porecelain God (Season 3)**
Dr. Casey (Michael J. Fox) and J.D discover the toilet the Janitor installed on the roof, which earns the name ""epiphany toilet"" after every Sacred Heart staff member finds a solution to a problem or a revelation after using it. Dr. Kelso closes down an entire wing of the hospital to save money; Dr. Cox and Carla fight back by using his own office as a patient room. Turk asks J.D. to be his best man, but J.D. is hurt to discover that he wasn't Turk's first choice. Noticing how helpful Dr. Casey has been to her fellow staff, Elliot seeks advice from him on intubation after she botches the procedure.

**My Lunch (Season 4)**
After repeatedly running into annoying recurring patient Jill Tracy (Nicole Sullivan), J.D. feels guilty when she dies of an appararent drug overdose and he didn't act on warning signs. Carla and Elliot convince Todd to admit to being gay, but contrary to what they had hoped, this does not change his personality for the better. Dr. Cox initially consoles J.D. but struggles to follow his own advice later on. 

**My Roommates (Season 4)**
J.D. is having some trouble with Kylie. Turk and Carla ask J.D. to move out to give them space. However, his absence causes them to realize they're having problems with their relationship. Meanwhile, Dr. Cox believes his friend's child has autism. The episode guest stars Michael Boatman. 

**My New God (Season 5)**
Dr. Cox's born-again Christian sister, Paige Cox (Cheryl Hines), visits the hospital and wants him to participate in his son's baptism: Dr. Cox wants nothing to do with it, and her for that matter. Elliot tries to convince Turk why Carla finds babymaking to be romantic. The Janitor and J.D. begin a friendship, which is sabotaged by one of Janitor's more elaborate pranks. The song playing during the Janitor's 'Evil Stare' is ""Koyaanisqatsi"" by Philip Glass. 

**My Scrubs (Season 6)**
Unbeknownst to Dr. Kelso, J.D. and Turk try to beat the system to treat the Chief's uninsured friend. Elsewhere, the Janitor blackmails Carla with a case of mistaken dog identity. Meanwhile, Dr. Cox tries to convince Elliot that a reformed drug addict isn't quite clean. All the while the entire staff is condemned to wearing dirt brown scrubs when Kelso suspects a clothing thief in their midst. The episode guest stars Alexander Chaplin as Sam Thompson and Victoria Tennant as Maggie Kent.

**My Overkill (Season 2)**
After Jordan revealed that she slept with J.D., he expects the worst from Dr. Cox. Elliot, embarrassed by Jordan's revelation about her lingering feelings for J.D., is avoiding J.D. at all costs. Carla is angry with Turk for not telling her that Dr. Cox was in love with her, and Dr. Cox is annoyed at Dr. Kelso for being played for a non-existent promotion and at J.D. for sleeping with Jordan.A new design for the opening credits was introduced with this episode, with Neil Flynn (the ""Janitor"") listed as a regular cast member. The network behind Scrubs did not approve of the opening scene, featuring Colin Hay performing an acoustic version of ""Overkill""; such a scene had never been done by a sitcom.[1] The episode's title is derived from the featured song ""Overkill"", which Colin Hay performs onscreen. 

**My Big Bird (Season 4)**
J.D., Elliot, Turk and Carla are all formally interrogated following the death of a patient, where it is learned that J.D. and Turk were unnecessarily visiting a patient's home, Carla was gathering the staff to purchase lottery tickets in a group effort, and Elliot was dealing with the wife of a married man she kissed. The episode guest stars Jason Bateman as Mr. Sutton and Peter Jacobson as Mr. Foster. 

**My Big Brother (Season 2)**
J.D.'s older brother Dan (Tom Cavanagh) drops by for a visit, but J.D. can't hide how ashamed he is of his brother's life. Turk learns a lesson when he makes a bet with Dr. Cox on whether a patient lives or dies. Meanwhile, Sacred Heart staff is in costume for Halloween, and one person in particular is wreaking havoc in a gorilla suit, much to Dr. Kelso's disgust. 

**My Nickname (Season 1)**
J.D. and Carla's relationship changes when he starts to have more medical knowledge than she has, and takes offense at her nickname for him (""Bambi""). Elliot treats Jill (Nicole Sullivan), a patient who's just as nervous and neurotic as she is. The Janitor comes up with a new nickname for J.D. 

**My Cabbage (Part 1) (Season 4)**
J.D. tries relentlessly to get rid of Keith while sticking up for his favorite intern ""Cabbage"", while the staff says goodbye to Mrs. Wilk. The Janitor keeps a magpie in the hospital which proves very adept at stealing things, much to Dr. Kelso's displeasure. The episode features a cameo appearance by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. His Story IIINarrated by The Janitor: J.D. begins a video postcard for his mother, but gets locked in a water tower for the day by the Janitor. Finding himself with free time, the Janitor bonds with a severely quadriplegic patient who can't communicate. Elliot and Carla argue over an intern's mistake. Turk is embarrassed by his impending fatherhood when Dr. Cox accuses him of having a stereotypically white personality. 
 
**My Friend With Money (Season 6)**
Elliot is enjoying private practice a little too much, causing J.D. and Dr. Cox to show a little jealousy. Carla's post-partum depression symptoms worsen. Dr. Cox and Janitor try to co-exist in the hospital's new luxury suite. 

**Honorable mentions:**
Elliot remembering Carla watching out for her
Kelso's dance routine on his ""one happy approachable day of the year""
Fantasy sequences
Cox bringing people back down (maintaining humanity) such as when they were celebrating not being the source of the error causing the person's death.

11362y,3,2012-10-07,Should we break up because we want different things? 23[F] dating a 22[M] for 5 years (x post from r/relationships),singleusethrowaw_ay,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/11362y/should_we_break_up_because_we_want_different/,"So, my boyfriend of 5 years and and have been dating since our first year of college. It's been a long distance relationship for the entire time, as our colleges are around 7 hours drive from each other. (We knew each other while we were in high school, but did not go to the same school). Before I list all our 'problems' I would like to say that I love him, we get on amazingly on a day-to-day basis, we have lots of common interests and I think we communicate well. It's just our overarching aims that are different.

We come from very different backgrounds. His mom had him at 18 and his father was an alcoholic. My parents both went to college, met while volunteering in a disadvantaged community and moved to Nepal to train nurses when I was 5. They are still passionately in love with each other and with planet saving. They have their heads screwed on well, and have good judgement on a lot of things, and they don't like my boyfriend. I am unsure as to whether its because they think we are incomparable or because he has different religious beliefs. I hold their beliefs and he doesn't, and they are worried it will be a problem. It might be a problem if we have kids.

He wants to get married and have kids. As soon as we can afford it. I think I want that eventually, but I want to live in the same place for a year or so first to see if it works. I definitely don't want kids within 5 years. Also, I would like to take a couple of years off when I do have a kid and I can't see that happening if I earn most of our income.

He wants to live in the country. I love the city! I also need to work in the city because I work in a very specialised area.
I am going to finish my degree in water engineering in July. Not to be overly boastful, but I went to a good school and have good grades. Also, through an intern program, I have landed a job for when I graduate on a $60,000 salary doing my dream work- flood analysis. He did less well in high school and his school is not as good as mine. His grades are terrible, and after 5 years, he has failed so many subjects that he still hasn't finished his bachelors degree in mathematics. Some of the failing is due to him driving to come and visit me instead of studying, which I feel guilty about. So, he has decided to drop out and work as a day labourer in his step father's business in order to move back to where I live. If he passed everything next semester, he would finish his bachelors and could transfer to teaching, which is what his original plan was, once he knew post-grad math was off the table. I am really angry at him for putting our relationship in a difficult place for 5 years for no apparent gain and a hell of a lot of debt. I don' t understand why he doesn't want to stick it out. It will only take 6 extra months, then he can move back and do the teaching degree here. I don't know why he is willing to give up on his dream. I don't know if this anger is justified or not. Am I being unreasonable?

He is my best friend, and I am worried that if I break it off I will never find someone else I can relate to as well as him. He has made far more sacrifices for our relationship than I have. I am worried that I would be breaking up him because of what other people think. I am worried that he loves me more than I love him. Our relationship is really unequal from a social status point of view, but I would hate to be a person who broke up with someone that I really loved solely because of that. Is all this crap worth pushing past? Or are the practicalities of life going to mean that it is better if we call it off now?

**tl;dr: Is it possible for a relationship to work when you want vastly different things? Can massive compromise work, or should we call it off now?**

112yys,1,2012-10-07,The Life and Times of the Perpetually Single 28 Year Old (Spoiler Alert: It's me.),[deleted],ForeverAloneWomen,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAloneWomen/comments/112yys/the_life_and_times_of_the_perpetually_single_28/,"I cannot even begin to express how grateful I am for this place.

I'm a 28 year old FA lady. I often want to talk about my experiences (or lack thereof, ahaha) but find that other subreddits aren't always understanding of the issues surrounding perpetually single women.

Please, please, allow me to ramble for a moment.

I have never once had a relationship. I've never had sex. I've been kissed a handful of times, and always in a platonic way.

In high school -- which is when most of my friends started hooking up -- I had extreme family issues, to the point where the very idea of finding a boyfriend was ridiculous; I was too busy worried about not becoming homeless, the extreme legal battles my family was involved in, fighting off the local media as they tried to take photographs of me and my family for the local papers. I had no room for romance. I had no room for much of anything, really. It was a horrible, terrible time.

I was accepted to a ton of universities but ended up having to take a year off because of my family situation. When I finally got things together enough to leave my crappy town, only one school would take me. I suffered from depression, PTSD, reoccurring nightmares and flashbacks and a crippling anxiety disorder. I gained weight, I got awful haircuts, and I generally didn't care about much of anything. Once again, even in college, boys weren't on my radar. I was too busy trying to survive myself.

Eventually things got better; I got my depression and anxiety under control, I started taking better care of myself, I got rid of some awful ""friends"" who used me only to feel better about themselves, and I worked really hard in my classes. I stopped caring so much about my family situation and I started caring a lot more about myself and my real friends. I lost weight, I won a place on an internship to China, I got a 4.0 GPA (compared to my previous 1.9, woohoo) and I became a much healthier person.

But by that point, college was just about over. There was no point in even thinking about romance, since I had accepted a job in Japan and was going to be leaving the country anyway.

So here I am. I've been in Japan for over four years. I absolutely love my life here... except for the total lack of a love life. And I need to talk about this, because it drives me nuts, but it's an issue that is absolutely taboo in any Japan-related online forum.

There are, of course, exceptions -- I know a few -- but, for the most part, Japan is a desolate cesspool of loneliness for western women. Western men are a different issue, and I fully suggest any FA guys reading this to come teach English here, because you WILL find a cute, adoring Japanese girl who wants to be with you, it's almost guaranteed. But western women have no such luck, so I've been absolutely torn about what to do with myself. Should I leave and go home to try and prioritize finding a boyfriend? Or should I continue living my enjoyable life here and just accept that it's not in the cards for me?

Japanese guys -- of which I am very attracted to! -- tend to prefer Japanese girls. This is totally understandable. Western guys in Japan -- in my experience -- also tend to prefer Japanese girls. This is also totally understandable. I had just hoped that I would have found a guy here, of any race, creed, whatever, who'd happen to both click with me and find me to be dating material.

I've pretty much determined that I have to go back home next year anyway, because I want to get experience in a job that doesn't involve teaching English before I turn 30, but I'm increasingly worried that my total lack of romantic experience will hinder me from ever even getting started. I'd like to find a partner, I'd like to be with someone, but I never have before, and I'm so used to being alone that I'm nervous I'd totally fail at anything beyond a simple friendship.

Bla bla bla, this is long enough already, but THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE, COMMUNITY, and I wanna hear your stories as well.

TL;DR: My life has terrible timing and that's one of many reasons why I'm super single. How about you?"
112xso,2,2012-10-07,You guys are inspirational!,[deleted],NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/112xso/you_guys_are_inspirational/,"Long story short, I did an internship over the summer and kept myself busy by going out, working hard, and going to the gym. I went from fapping once a day to once a month. I asked a girl out at a coffee shop, something I've never done before. I was very comfortable with talking to girls in general. After returning, I went back to my old ways and am fapping once a day. I realize the time it is wasting, and how I am no longer as forthcoming to meet chicks. After reading your stories, I know this is an issue that is worthy of fixing. I intend to try to prevent fapping by being in a public place when using the computer, since I'm a college student that includes work, library, study quarters.
Any advice would be appreciated, I hope to be held accountable by you guys. "

* **Description**: Greetings, Crafter. We would like to introduce a server fresh off the press. Yes, indeed. It is none other than InvisionCraft, a genuine Survival Multiplayer/Role Playing Game Server! InvisionCraft has actually been around for some time now. Almost a year to be precise. As a community, we have been through thick and thin. Our time here spanned out over three generations, which is why we're currently referred to as Generation X. But you are not the least interested in our history right? You want to know what makes our server worthy of your expectations. Haha, very well. We are a Survival/Role-Playing Game server that has recently become ""premium"". Our ""generation"" is approximately a week old, meaning there is much potential for anybody who decides to start today. We feature dozens of plugins (listed below) and several venues that may pique your interest. Such venues include The Mall, The Event Plaza, The Gallery, NPC Villages, etc. In addition, we try our very best to host events daily regardless of how many players are online. Some of our events include Unscramble, Trivia, Zombie Apocalypse, Hunger Games, PvP Tournament, Building Contest, Pig Race, End of the Line, and the King of Ladders. We strive to provide the best service possible. Our staff is always ready to assist players on the go. In short, we assure you of our best attention. Our grand desire is for all players to have a memorable experience here at InvisionCraft. With everything said, it is up to you to walk into the door. Are you in?

115nf0,0,2012-10-08,How much do you pad your resume?,nroberts666,cpp,https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/115nf0/how_much_do_you_pad_your_resume/,"Just got offered a job that a friend of mine had been offered earlier.  He was offered a good 10k more than I was.  I'm the one he comes to for C++ advice and even design advice.  Very rarely has it gone the other way around and those times have been about particular APIs.

It came down to years of experience.  He had apparently counted a bunch of his intern time as C++ experience while I was only counting my fist real C++ job as that starting point.  So he comes off looking like he's got over 10 years and I look like 7.  Truth be told though I was probably using the language long before he was.

So, obviously I'm selling myself way short here.  I'm still happy with the offer though disappointed that I was offered less than he was...I really am the better coder and even the better C++ specific coder.

What are some ways to leverage more of my pre-official time like that without being a liar?  Do I count the little chat program I made in C++ 12 years ago for $300 as ""professional experience""?  How do you stick stuff like that on a resume?  I've not really counted stuff like that.

Seems like I probably should have gotten this figured out earlier in my career but this is the first time I've really noticed I'm being *harmed* by being too straight forward and not stretching the truth.  Now of course it's a bit too late...very easy to sell the tech guys on my abilities but then the offer was short-changed by numbers.  Would like to improve my offer next go around though."

There's so many games mentioned here that I've never played (WoW, Minecraft, even ones as coveted as Zelda), that I'm beginning to feel like a Gaymer-in training. I'm trying to figure out which games I need to check out, but kind of wanted to get a general idea on where to start first. 

So what's a must-play game that you would strongly recommend to your gaymer intern? 

EDIT: I probably should've mentioned I have a PS3, a computer that I don't think could handle games but I'm willing to try, and an XBox 360."
114zgu,12,2012-10-08,"Followup to my post four months ago: ""Clueless Single Guy with Questions""",Throwaway91216,AskWomen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/114zgu/followup_to_my_post_four_months_ago_clueless/,"[Link to my first post for context.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/tzjua/clueless_single_guy_with_questions/)

I'm 21 now and my summer internship is over. I have received several job offers from the company I was working for this summer. I've actually lost count of exactly how many job offers (very large company, many different departments). Even after I accepted a job offer they just sent me more job offers. The offer I accepted is not 1600 miles away from home like my internship, but rather fairly close in my home state. Basically I am starting my senior year of college (midterms are this week, not really ""starting"" anymore) and I already have a well paying job lined up for graduation.

So as usual that part of my life is going splendid (no sarcasm, I'm happy).

Not long after my last post (before I left on my internship) I received a message on okcupid. She was saying that the quiver functionality of okcupid finally did something right and that I seemed like an interesting guy. Over the next month we exchanged upwards of 115 messages (long, thought out messages, not ""lol how r u 2day?""). She was also an intern but another major at another company in a place very far away from where I was (and from the area we lived in), but she still went to a local college around where I lived. After that point she deleted her okcupid account and I was left confused. I figured she just wanted a break or something but she never returned. I actually managed to find her on facebook (on which she was evidently an active user) but she ignored any attempts at communication. I decided not to pester her and move on.

So whatever, I'm over that. We talked a lot online obviously never got to meet up in person. Which leads me to my next adventure. Around that same time another girl on okcupid had sent me a message. Her profile listed her as ""seeing someone"" and ""looking for friends."" I have nothing against friends, so I talked to her for the remainder of the summer. Towards the end of the summer there was a period when no messages were sent for a few weeks. Eventually she made contact again asking me how my job was going. I replied saying it was going well, but more importantly I noticed that her profile now said ""single"" and ""looking for friends, long term relationship."" Fast forward a few more weeks I'm home and we're talking on AIM. She starts mentioning this fair that comes to our area once a year so I asked her if she would be interested in going. She said yes so I bought some tickets online and made plans to pick her up from her school (which happened to be my first college). She asked me if I wanted her to pay me back for her ticket. I told her not to worry about it.

So we go to the fair, have a good time and all that. During the whole fair I noticed that she is extremely shy. Not a big deal, that's only natural. I drive her home and ask her if she would like to get dinner with me some time. She said, ""sure."" We became Facebook friends and made plans for dinner. As a side note her Facebook status confirmed her as single. She also deleted her okcupid account (which was sort of a red flag to me just because the last person who met me from okcupid who deleted her account wanted nothing to do with me anymore). Fast forward to just over two weeks after the fair I picked her up and we went to dinner. I'm noticing that she's still extremely shy and I figured it was just her personality. After dinner we decided to go catch a movie. I wanted to hold her hand or something but she always kept her hands close to her body. Same thing for after the movie -- we were walking to my car and I wanted to hold her hand but they were inside her sleeves and she was slightly huddling over (arms crossed). She said she had a good time. So I'm driving her home at this point. It's important to note that I was planning to at least try and kiss her. We got to her place. Ask the car was coming to a stop she already had her seatbelt undone and when the car came to a complete stop she had her hand on the handle. But she didn't open the door. She just sat there for a bit, huddled close to the door as if she was contemplating leaving but wasn't sure. This position made it so there was no chance in hell I could kiss her in a way that was comfortable for everybody. I was buckled up and she just seemed so far away. We sat there awkwardly for I don't know how long. I eventually asked her if she would like to go out again some time and again, she said, ""sure."" Now I'm driving home and it looks like she forgot her leftovers from dinner. Whatever, I'll keep them in my freezer. I sent her a message saying that I have her leftovers and I'm keeping them in my freezer. She said she realized she forgot them as I was driving off. She then, ten minutes later or so, sent me another message saying, ""Sorry if I was like, weird. I've been feeling kind of weird all day."" I told her not to worry about it.

Fast forward to now. It's her birthday and there was a game on Steam I knew she wanted, so I went ahead and bought it for her. It was a cheap game, no big deal. But now I head over to her Facebook page to wish her a happy birthday and I see, ""In a relationship with [EX BOYFRIEND]."" ""Oh no,"" I thought. Judging by the wall posts between them they are indeed back together. The latest message I received from her was thanking me for the game, saying she's going to be playing it all the time now.

Now I feel lost. I'm asking friends for help on what to do. One friend said he's ""not qualified to talk me through a breakup or whatever."" Another friend says I should confront her. She says that I ""deserve an explanation and an apology.""

I'm a very non-confrontational kind of person. I honestly thought that this might have been going somewhere... she was the first girl I've met who was interested in seeing me again after a first date. I felt good about it. Now I feel shittier than ever about my romantic status. Not that it matters, but I'm out about $200 now on something that turned out to be nothing at all. I had bought her another birthday gift (a physical item) which is normally about $20 but thanks to the magic of rewards points only cost me 55 cents. I was going to invite her over to my place for dinner and Dexter (she hadn't seen Dexter before, but she said she was interested in seeing it). Now I don't think that's going to be happening.

What do I do? I just don't know."
114myu,3,2012-10-08,I'm looking to take some time off (1-3 years) between my undergraduate and applying/going to law school. I have a bunch of questions about priorities and several other issues!,EnterpriseE1701E,LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/114myu/im_looking_to_take_some_time_off_13_years_between/,"Hi-- thanks for taking the time to read/respond.  Additionally, I'm sorry if this is in the wrong subreddit, but I didn't know where else to put it.

As the title says, I'm looking to take time off between finishing my undergraduate, which will be done in the Spring of 2013. I'll be graduating with a degree in Philosophy and English, and genuinely want to go into law (probably something criminal justice related). 

I've talked to many sources, some law advisors, others ADAs, others jaded corporate lawyers, but they have all told me that taking time off between the two can be really good, since once I graduate, I will genuinely need to work because debt/other factors will be very strong reasons to really use my degree.  

But they've all varied differently in relation to what they think I should be doing with all of this time off. The corporate lawyer in particular thinks that taking a few years off, getting some semi-mindless job, or going for an MA, while making sure to get drunk a bunch is a good use of my time.

The law adviser has pointed out that there are a lot of law-esque positions, not all of which take place in an office (advocacy/positions helping victims of violent crimes, etc), and that even being a paralegal for a few years could be a good boost on my resume, and help to make sure I want to do law as a career.

A few other notes-- I'm currently taking an internship as a legal assistant and am genuinely loving the experience. I work in a legal services office for students on campus.  Additionally (not sure if it is relevant), I've put off taking the LSATs, as I've been self-testing at ~167, but would like it higher, especially for the scholarships/wider opportunities that come along with the higher scores.

To the actual question, maybe you could see me working up to it-- I've decided I want to take some time off, but genuinely am baffled to figure out my priorities (what I want done with this time), what I want to do, where, if I should be helping my resume, or picking a job I'll love, or what!  I'm incredibly nervous about the entire experience, even just on the level of thinking about what I want to do in this time!

Any feedback, or any thoughts are super appreciated! Thanks."
11815e,1,2012-10-09,How do I get my friend to come forward about her rape?,[deleted],rapecounseling,https://www.reddit.com/r/rapecounseling/comments/11815e/how_do_i_get_my_friend_to_come_forward_about_her/,"About two months ago, I met this really great girl at the office where I work (I work at a local political office as an IT manager, and she's an intern from a local college.) She's smart, funny, pretty, and really shy. She was really hesitant to get to know me, and later said it was because she doesn't have a lot of friends, and none of them guys.

Anyway, we connected instantly. We would spend all day talking to each other, but I started to notice that she was very negative about herself, from her body to her intelligence, etc. Last week, we were talking outside work and out of the blue she told me that she had been raped.

I didn't really know how to respond. I just listened as she told me how it happened, how she felt worthless and shitty afterwords, and how she was feeling really down lately and just had to dump it on someone.

I asked her why she hadn't gone to the police, and she told me that she didn't want to cause anyone any pain. (What?) The problem is, it happened a while ago, and there's basically no evidence.

We see each other at work every day, and we share coffee and talk like nothing happened. I'm one of only two people on the planet who knows besides her and her rapist.

How do I get her to come forward about this? Should I? Would she even be able to put a case together with only her testimony if I did?

I haven't been to this community before, but you seem like good people and I hope you can give me some advice for how to help her."
117lp2,0,2012-10-09,Just a Little Venting...and an Update.,[deleted],Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/117lp2/just_a_little_ventingand_an_update/,"So, I posted about a week ago about my lack of luck with recruiting, being that I managed to get 0 interviews, and still had GT and EY left.

Today I got my GT notification: Declined for that as well. 

So I went ahead and just cancelled my EY requests for interviews. I barely talked to them, and here's why I don't think I'll get one:

I spent damn near a year talking to 5-6 people at PwC, including even having worked for a client of theirs, getting to know a Manager, being on pretty solid terms with the recruiter, and I have two relevant internships (including that client) that cover both internal AND external auditing and controls. 

I didn't get that interview. Got rejected for them, GrantThornton, and McGladrey. So I said fuck it. 

Some of you may know I work for a smaller/mid-size firm. I do, and I'm happy with them. I love it. I won't receive or get to discuss an offer until next summer however, and this is why I went ahead and recruited anyways. I wanted to have the options and not be left hanging. 

So I just want to say thanks for all the advice. This OCR has been depressing, and I'm out."
117k18,1,2012-10-09,The most important period of my life is slipping away from me. Has anyone else been here before? ,this_guyyy,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/117k18/the_most_important_period_of_my_life_is_slipping/,"First off, I'm new here, just found it the other day. and thank god! 

I know there must be many of you who must be dealing with the struggles of university, balancing a social life, missing an ex and trying to fight their addiction fapping. 

Here's my story
* Final year of university, trying to attain an A- average for my so I can get into a good grad school.
 
* I play on two sports teams (used to workout)  
* I'm on student council 

* I have a great internship that gives me a big time opportunity in my field (if I can get the work done). 

* I am a seemingly happy, handsome and sociable guy. I get girls, but not ones that live up to my standards of the past (see below)

The bad: 
* I have a crippling addiction to fapping and porn 

* I procrastinate and procrasti-bate so much that my future is slipping away from me
 
* a year ago I broke up with the most beautiful, loving girl I've ever met (who did more than internet porn could do for me). She was the perfect and incredible in bed. I was immature however and did no appreciate her and for some reason couldnt see a future with her. I broke up with her believing that she was the one who was holding me back from attaining the success and happiness I was searching for in life. I WAS DEAD WRONG. She wasn't holding me back, something else was..

* I've been masterbating daily since I was about 14. I am now 21. Since my breakup I increased my fapping to about 3-4 daily and I've noticed the changes: 

* I'm far more anxious
* I'm tired 
* Far less concentration in general 
* I get into bi-polar moods
* I'm not my funny, witty self anymore
* I can't concentrate on homework 
* I think far too much about my ex (including fapping) 
* She's also very happy with another guynmow (the guy I could have been)
* I've begun to loose my hair (stress and masterbation induced I suspect {increased DHT levels}) 
* I can't talk to other girls like I used to (subconsciously I want it sex) 
* I am have no self confidence, despite having the tools to do the job (I don't want to sound like a cocky guy, I know some people probably wish they had it as good as I do)

I went without fapping for about 3 weeks this summer while I was travelling Europe (2 months total) but thats cuz I had virtually no time alone. But now I'm back home and I have infinite wi-fi at my hands and lots of alone time.. 
I stopped 6 days ago but relapsed yesterday. And because I have no willpower anymore I said fuck it and fapped 3 times today :( . I've already missed the deadline for 2 assignments now. (hello late penalties) 

At the moment I have all this work due this week and I can't sit down at the damn computer fucking touching my self. I hate it. I hate myself. 

The love of my life fell for my potential. I have lots of it, and I'm half the man I should be.

I just found this subreddit and I sure am glad. I knew it wasn't right all these years. I knew there was something wrong with me. 

I just need to know that someone else has been here before. This is the 4th quarter, this is the shotclock running down. I NEED TO GET MY LIFE ON TRACK IN THE NEXT 6 MONTHS OR I'VE WASTED EVERYTHING. This is crunch time for me. I need serious motivation, techniques, tricks, things to block porn, anything! I just want to do my work... 

I will not stand by and watch the demise of men. Help me and I promise to be a regular contributor the conversation.


**Update** 
**Today I was able to do the most beneficial thing for my recovery thus far**. I told my roommate/one of my best friends about my struggles. It came about after he bombed an interview for his dream job. He wanted to go for a walk and I knew it was time to tell someone. Honestly, it was extremely difficult to get it out of me but once it happend we talked for hours. Bottom line: SEEK OUT YOUR FRIENDS WHO ARE EXPERIENCING HARDSHIP AS WELL, THEY WILL FIGHT ALONG SIDE YOU. The future is bright! Thanks guys**

Plan to graduate in May 2013 with a BS in Math, Minor in stats and business. GPA around 3.0 with a math GPA of about 3.3. I have an internship lined up for next semester, and I am an officer for my Uni actuarial science club. I have also passed exam 1/P and am taking exam 2/FM on Saturday (woooooo).

My long term plan is to try and get a job as soon as graduation with hopefully 3 exams under my belt and an internship. Then I would like to work for a year or so while completing my ASA designation. 

This is where I would like some opinions. I would really like to go back to school to get a masters in quantitative finance. I understand that it may not be necessary, but I believe it will open many more doors for me in the investment side of risk management. I'd still try to pass exams during this time. 

What are your thoughts on this game plan? I've always loved dealing with risk, managing risk, messing with the stock market, money exchanges, and all that kind of financial stuff. 

I know this is kind of vague, but any advice is appreciated."

I""ll be moving to Albuquerque in December, thanks to my dad's job being moved, and am very heavily leaning towards a CS degree. I'm a senior in high school (yes, my senior year will be split between two schools). 

I did an internship with a local software development company here in Lincoln, Nebraska, primarily in C#, but also included WPF. 

I am still considering the University of Washington in Seattle, we flew up there to visit and were blown away by how good the program is, but for cheaper tuition for me, it'd mean gaining residency in Washington State. It's not impossible, but the school makes it sound impossible. The requirements are to live there a year, and established a bonifide domocile (close all legal ties with other states, and file your tax returns in WA). 

So, in curiosity, what's UNM's Computer Science program like? Hopefully its leaps and bounds above UNL's program here. I know Intel is in Albuquerque, as well as Sandia and Los Alamos.

She lives in Florida, I live in the Netherlands (-6hrs). 
We had seen each other on the cams in the chat room, but never talked with each other.

Anyway she pmed me out of the blue. We started talking, I was a bit stiff as I always am but I immediately thought she had something. Something I never experienced before. 

One thing lead to another, we continued on Skype for a more personal talk and this way we could hear each other as well as see. Before we knew it, we where talking for hours on end. Within 2 days I was in love. She was amazing, perfect, the girl I dreamed about (like literally dreamed). The most beautiful smile, the occasional frustration that I find damn sexy in her. 

So we became a couple within just 4 days of talking. Falling a sleep on Skype, texting and sexting (something I had zero experience with. And apparently I can sext. I can write novels like im Dan Brown searching for a new clue). I soon realised this girl, I want her and never let her go. She has that same feeling. We even talk about marriage, kids, living together. It all feels so natural. 

Fast forward one week. I told her that I wanted to look for an internship close to her so that we could be together at least for that period (6 months). And before we knew it, I had a list of companies I wanted to contact. Since my field is very rare and specific she helped me out. She started calling the companies for a direct contact, she drove up to some businesses. Nearly getting tasered upon entering a building (badass chick!). 

She is making this so much easier for me and hopefully we can find something in time before my signup date is due and I need to look other avenues. But she is so supportive and wants to help me and without her i would be clueless and this would take at least another month. And 2 days ago see even managed to get a direct contact from someone, so this way I will skip at least a 100 loopholes and jumps. Thank you so much, sweetie! I really mean that. 

However if it doesnt work out, the internship thing, I will fly to her in February no matter. Right before I start my graduating internship here in the Netherlands. And spent a week with her in sunny Florida. 

After being single for almost 8 years, being a dark and sad place for years, she is the best thing that could happen at this point in my life. After I graduate all my effort will go into moving to the US, be with her and get on one knee! 

And this all in a 1 month period. Love can do amazing things in a short amount of time! (today marks our 1 month) 


Thought I share my story. And hopefully update as time goes along. "

Mostly Analytics Focused, but we are also doing some Data Warehouse stuff and have more things on the horizon.  MySQL/Postgress, Apache, Hadoop, those are some things that will be desirable for this position as well. 

Pay is going to depend on experience, and I have not been unhappy there regarding compensation.
Need someone to really hit the ground running, and it's full time, so not really an Intern position, although that might be on the horizon.   We've got more work than we can shake a stick at so who knows, send your resume along and a cover letter.

118svj,2,2012-10-10,I [M22] am stuck between a serious rock and hard place by my GF[19],JTFocus,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/118svj/i_m22_am_stuck_between_a_serious_rock_and_hard/,"Note: This is my first topic post on Reddit, and seeing as I'm fairly new, I apologize in advance for any formatting errors. I'm a n00b.

Let me just put this out there, I've wanted to talk to someone about this for a long time and it's a long story, and I can't seem to find the right person to talk to. The internet is always good, so here it goes.

My current girlfriend and I have dated for the last 14 months. I love her more than I have ever loved another woman, but don't know what to do anymore. I started talking to her while I was in Florida on a Disney Internship last May, and we hit it off quite well. We were friends in high school and I was good friends with her brother, so she and I talked every once in a while but nothing serious. I came home from my internship that August and we spent lots of time together, as I was moving in with her brother and our mutual best friend. We started dating a week later and spent nearly every day together after I was off work and she was out of school. 

After she graduated, we continued to spend every day together, outside of me working, as if we were living together, except we weren't. Our relationship had grown rocky; we would argue about stupid things, she would get angry with me for no reason, and it had an overall different feel than it did in the beginning, but I was still in love with her and wanted things to work. In June, I was offered a job with Disney World, with fairly good pay, and the girlfriend was all for leaving and moving down there together. I didn't have proper living arrangements, and had been saving money for a car, which I didn't have at the time, and passed on the offer because I didn't have sufficient funds and things needed to be able to make it happen. Fast forward to August, girlfriend signs to play softball with a local college in our city in GA, and I'm offered the Disney job again, and this time have family who live in Florida willing to help me out. She's extremely unhappy with my decision to even interview and consider it, but it was an opportunity for her to do a year of school while I work to provide for a hopeful/hypothetical future for us. I'm sure you know where this is going.

I get the job, and started in early September. Since then, our relationship has been long distance, and not nearly the same. She's always miserable, seems to not make an effort to try to be happy, and cites the reason as, ""I'm the only thing that made her happy and now that I've left, she has nothing to make her happy"", even though we're still a couple. We argue constantly, and I just want to make it work, but she doesn't try and makes me feel as if my efforts are useless. I went home to GA last week for 3 days to specifically see her and spend time with her. Things went great, it was like I never left, our sex was great, we didn't argue, and it was an overall wonderful 3 days. Since I've returned to Florida and work, it's been back to the same arguing and her not knowing what to do. Today she told me that she didn't feel the same about me as she did before I left for Florida. It was literally like she just pulled my heart straight out of my chest, like some Mortal Kombat fatality. All I've wanted is for this relationship to work, because I have some sort of blind faith that we can do it. And for her to say that has just diminished any sort of hope I have, as if she's already given up on me. 

So, Reddit, what do I do? Do I cut my losses and try to move on with my life, continuing to work here at Disney and just accept it? Or do I continue the battle, when it seemingly ends up being the same thing over and over? I love this girl more than I know how to express, but I just wasn't happy at home, and she was the only thing keeping me there. I don't want to end things, because I feel as if I'd be giving up, but I honestly don't know what to do anymore. 

**TL;DR**: Dated girlfriend for a year, took a great job in Disney World in September while she committed to school for softball back home in GA. Relationship has been on a total downward spiral, tells me she doesn't feel the same as she did before I left, feel heartbroken, need help deciding what's best for me in the long run.

A large and sincere thank you to any of you guys who read this and can help."

Prior to that I worked in a retail setting for nearly 3 years (gained lots of selling experience and some management). Before that as a Customer Service Tech for a broadband internet company.

I've mainly been searching for roles in Market Research which is a long shot since I know most of these roles prefer to have people with a Masters degree. To my own surprise I managed to get two phone interviews. I've since expanded my search to general marketing roles.

**Here comes the question:**

Is there a huge disadvantage not living where the job is being offered? I'm mainly applying for positions in Chicago and Seattle but I'm currently living and volunteering in North Dakota (I really have no choice to live in work here for the next several months).

There is a chance I'm just not that great of candidate (I'll happily post my resume for anyone who wants to take a look).

11ad5p,9,2012-10-10,"My gf [21f] left me [23m] after 3 years, mostly LDR. Need help figuring it out",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/11ad5p/my_gf_21f_left_me_23m_after_3_years_mostly_ldr/,"We started dating in 2009 while I was in her town working a summer internship. We started the long-distance relationship with some uncertainty. By the end of that year we both seemed confident we might have something and I visited her. We're over 3k miles away from each other so visiting has always been a hassle. We would normally go several months between visits, but would Skype almost daily and text constantly. We were very dependent on each other for support.

We planned for a while to try to end up in the same city together and be together. There was a brief break-up a month before I graduated in spring 2011 (she just graduated this past spring), and before I had any kind of job lined up. During that brief break-up period I accepted a job even further away from her, not knowing what else to do in a sparse job market. We drifted back together and our relationship was stronger than ever before.

I started my job, and we continued the LD, visiting at first a little bit more often because I had freedom and money. In 2012 for reasons primarily relating to her strict focus on schoolwork I didn't actually visit her until May for her graduation. She then visited me for a while right after, staying with me until early June. She accepted a spot in a grad school program in her home town which started in September. I was excited for her, but scared about her future. I probably wasn't as supportive of her as she was expecting and hoping -- primarily due to my fear of what may come next and the challenges we now faced.

I should note that around March of 2012 I started talking to a company that was started by a friend which was based in her hometown. For many weeks they made it sound like they would be able to add me to the staff ""soon"" and that is what I told her. Eventually my focus on thinking about that job led to me neglecting our relationship and focusing solely on that. Even though it was entirely out of my control. Things started to slip a little and I was blind to it because of my focus on that job. After she left from our visit in June, for the first time we didn't have a plan to see each other next, which is vital in a LDR. It was around this time that I kept hassling her to come visit me -- I don't have much vacation time at all and she was on a summer break. I asked a handful of times, the last couple were asked jokingly but not received as jokes...

Then a few weeks after our 3rd anniversary, she ended things. I was stunned and am still in shock. I am still thinking about her at least once an hour, which is down from once a minute a few weeks ago.

We talked -- or rather I hounded her with texts -- for the next few days. Then things settled a tiny bit and seemed to move towards us talking about what went wrong and if it was possible to make things work. 

Then I had a freak-out and did something stupid. Started drinking bourbon from a bottle and before you know it I had bought a plane ticket and told her I was coming to town soon. It was after this event that we exchanged some heated e-mails and settled on not talking for a while. We ended up talking about once a week for the next three before I decided I couldn't handle talking to her anymore and needed to truly cut contact for a while.

When I told her my plan to cut contact, she supported the idea, which I expected. The thing of it was her tone. She seemed disinterested in even talking to me. I am probably reading too much into that, but now we're a few days into this and it is just so foreign to me to not be able to speak with her.

The company I spoke of earlier has since told me that they can't hire until February. I do not like my current job, but I'm not going to go find a new one and quit that after six months. I am making good money and learning a lot, but I do not like the culture here (in fact I believe adamantly that some of the aspects of my personality that she cited as leading to the break-up were slowly enhanced and encouraged by working here).

The things she told me were problems, I took it upon myself to work on those aspects of my personality -- they are the least favorite parts of my personality, and I found myself agreeing with her during a lot of our break-up talks. The thing of it is, I don't know if I want to do this for me or if I want to try to get her back. Either way I'm going to do it and emerge a much better man for it, so I guess I have THAT going for me...

If the option of ending up with her in the future exists, I need to completely cure myself of the NEED to talk to her constantly and prove that I can function on my own and make the improvements that I want to make in my life. I also need to give her the space she needs to focus on her studies. I know this will take time, which is why Feb '13 is a great target for me to end up in that town. Be it to try again or to finally get closure face-to-face. The thing of it is that  I KNOW that I need to just give it time and give it space right now, but I have so much anxiety about it that have an urge to DO SOMETHING to fix it now. I need help getting over that.

What does Reddit think?? I can talk about more detail if folks ask.

Worth noting: this was the first serious relationship for either of us, and my first of any kind.

TL;DR - Another failed LDR. Seems we changed when I wasn't paying attention. Shocked by breakup. What do I do next? Need some encouragement. Need help learning how to move on."

I barely went to high school. I spent anytime out of my bed being carted around to various incompetent specialists. I somehow still graduated, and got into a good college. I went to college, still sick. Still barely going to class, still absolutely miserable. After 3 semesters, I finally dropped out after having literally not left my room for a month. Spent a few more months seeing doctors. Finally saw an infectious disease specialist who found that I had a potentially fatal lung disease all these years. Great, all I needed now was a spinal tap to see if it had spread to my brain or not. 

That was botched. Horribly. It was literal torture. No anesthetics, and an incapable, unsupervised intern. I was stabbed in the spine 18 times because she couldn't find the fluid. It was the most pain I have ever experienced in my life. I was sobbing and begging her to stop as she held me down, refusing to get help because she didn't want to admit she didn't know what she was doing. Eventually she wrote me a referral to another hospital to get the procedure done properly. I left, barely being able to walk, completely traumatized. I had the procedure done properly a few days later, and started treatment.

The lung disease was cured. The spinal tap left me permanently disabled with severe nerve damage. Every day is hell on earth. I experience that same pain going down my leg constantly as I felt when there was a needle in my spine hitting my nerves. I tried to sue. That fucking bitch lied on the medical report. I had pictures of my back that showed 18 holes bleeding profusely. I had other doctors tell me that she was doing it in the wrong spot and that after 3 attempts she was obligated to stop, but wouldn't put pen to paper on that. The medical malpractice laws in my state protect doctors like crazy. 

I also developed PTSD and fibromyalgia and chronic migraines after that experience. I have a migraine almost every day of my existence. I have constant knots in every single one of my muscles. I feel excruciating pain in every point of my body. I can't control my body temperature. I have horrifically violent nightmares and wake up saturated in a cold sweat every night. Anytime someone gets near my back I have a complete breakdown. 

The only thing keeping me alive is a high dose of sleeping pills and constant use of narcotics. I hate my life. 

I'm 23 now. My condition will never get better. This is what I've been told by neurologists, pain managements specialists, physical therapists, rheumatologists, all supposedly the best in their fields. I've been classified as severely disabled, and require a disabled parking permit. 

I can't do anything. I can't sit in a chair without being in agonizing pain. I can't do any light housework, it destroys my muscles. I feel like I just cannot live in this world. 

But the thing is, I keep forcing it. I went back to school, I graduated on time. I enrolled in grad school. That's where I am now, and I fucking hate it. I hate having to drive to school, it hurts so much. I hate walking the 10 minutes from the student disabled spots to my academic building. I hate sitting on those fucking horrible plastic chairs with broken backs. I hate those fluorescent lights bearing down on me while I have a migraine. I hate listening to people complain about their trivial problems. I hate shifting around in my seat during class in complete agony, holding back tears, and thinking ""I'm putting myself through this to listen to some guy talk about functional continuity with respect to metric spaces?"" I don't fucking care about any of it. I keep doing it, because if I don't I might as well kill myself.  "

We hardly ever had any fights until recently. She just got her BS in civil engineering and started grad school and got a good internship. I havent been able to focus on school as much because ive had to helped with my mother who has had cancer for the past 6 years. I have still been going to school but like her. She broke up with me right before a business trip saying we didnt have the same goals and that i wasnt moving fast enough. I dont want to loose her and want to do everything to keep her. Its been almost a week and she asked for some time to think but i have been bad and been trying to talk to her and i think i might have gotten her pissed at me. I see my short comings and im willing to step it up not only for her but for my self. I dont want to loose her and cant stand the pain of not being with out her. I had not eaten for 4 days until today when i passed out. I dont feel like i can continue with out her. I know shes the one for me i just hope im the one for her. I need advice or comfort on getting through this.
11cmgy,1,2012-10-12,Do any of you find yourself getting more depressed after a job interview?,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11cmgy/do_any_of_you_find_yourself_getting_more/,"Whenever I interview for a job, I go in feeling totally confident that I'm going to get the job.  I interview well, but after every interview I've ever had, I get really depressed after.  I always feel like I didn't give it my best, and that I could have done better, and that there's no way they're going to hire me.

For example, yesterday I had a interview at my school with Cisco for an internship in the spring.  There were about 13 of us in the information session, and I think around 5 or 6 of us got interviews.  I was called 15 minutes after the session got out for an interview the next day.  I was totally nervous about the interview, but went in strong, answered all the interviewer's questions correctly.  I told her I'm working my ass off for their certification and she really liked that.  She told me I had an awesome resume and that I'd be a good candidate, but they look for people with 3.0 GPAs, and I have a 2.99, and that it could make or break the deal.

After she said that I instantly was in the mindset that there's no way I'm going to get the job, and someone better is going to come along.  I get in this state of mind where I'm really depressed, and I just don't know what to do.  This happens every time I interview.  

Does this happen to anyone else?"
11clzd,6,2012-10-12,Thinking about switching churches.,TheDonQuixote,Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/11clzd/thinking_about_switching_churches/,"I am thinking about the possibility of changing churches. I am doing this because of a couple of issues.

The members inability to respect my political stances and constantly trying to change my views. What they say about the political party is just untrue and disrespectful, and is a huge turnoff. 

The Youth Pastor will not hire me to help him with the group, even though I am there all the time, and most of the people around me say that they agree with me. He says it is because of budget issues, even though he was able to hire the Childrens Pastor daughter to intern for him. I told him I do not have to be paid a lot, but I do need to get paid. I am a college student, and the extra money would help my parents. 

The third is a selfish issue. Most of my college friends who go there. Are gone. They have gone of to college, and the ones I care most about I see out of church when they come home anyway. 

I do not know what to do. This is the church I became a Christian 5 years ago. Everyone I know now are people from this church, and my favorite mission trips are from this church, the ones that I go to multiple times a year! Would I still be able to go on these if I left? Would they still help me financially with those trips if I left? I do not know where I would be today without these peoples help. The few that are spoiling it for me, are doing a very good job at it. This is not a decision I take lightly, and I need prayers, and better yet advice.

11cbma,4,2012-10-11,"He gave me a pat on the butt, kissed me, then left. Now..nothing. WHY?",bluewhy,AskMen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/11cbma/he_gave_me_a_pat_on_the_butt_kissed_me_then_left/,"Hey AskMen! 21 y/o female here trying to understand a certain guy's behavior:

Met him(24M) a little less than a month ago at a party. Really hit it off. Started hanging out (watching TV, studying together).  I made it very obvious that I was into him-telling him that I found him very attractive and at what point straight out saying ""I like you"". Being this forward is very unlike me, but he's a somewhat reserved guy and I just felt like I should put myself out there. He responded positively  but without actually reciprocating my sentiments. 

We kissed for the first time about 2 weeks ago and since then we've spent a ton of time together. We're both students so we're pretty busy during the day, but in the evening he'll invite me over to his apartment and I'll sleep over (no sex yet) after staying up all night talking, giggling, and being stupid together.  He took me ice skating last week. 

All in all, it's been a wonderful experience.  I've fallen really hard for him and really hope that we could potentially progress from friends to an actual relationship. 

So here's the problem: Last Sunday, he slept over with me here at my dorm. We had a fun little evening and then went to bed. On Monday morning, we cuddled in bed for a little and then he got dressed for his internship. On his way out the door, he pulled me close, gave me a hug, kissed my forehead and gave me a 'lil pat on my butt. *sigh*. cutest thing ever.

So that was Monday morning- the last time I saw him (very weird- we've never gone more than 2 days w/o seeing each other since we met esp. since we live 5 mins away from each other).  We've texted back and forth a few times with me initiating 75% of the time- also very weird. He usually texts me all day about what's going on. Things just seem...different.  

He hasn't said anything directly that would indicate there's a problem, but something just seems off and it's killing me.  I'm scared to ask him if there's anything wrong because I don't want to come off as paranoid or overly attached or ""too into things"" and then scare him off for good.

So AskMen- help! 
-Why would a guy just shut down like this for what seems like no reason? I'm super confused!
-What is my next step? I've been fretting about this and feel like an idiot sitting here waiting around for him to start ""acting normal"" with me again, but don't want to seem clingy and push him further away if there is something wrong. What do I do?  

Thanks, guys. "
11fcgf,1,2012-10-13,I need some advice. SO doesn't want to seriously discuss the future with me...it's been over 3 years,Throwaway121991,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/11fcgf/i_need_some_advice_so_doesnt_want_to_seriously/,"Long post, sorry...

Background information: I'm 21/F, he's 26/M. We've been together for over 3 years now, long distance. I'm in Canada and he's in the US, and we both live near the border so we're not too far apart. Both of us live with our families still.

When we first decided that we wanted an LDR we didn't have a strict end date in mind, but we agreed that we wanted to begin making preparations for him to begin to move here with me when I was finishing university. Barring that, we had a goal of being able to see each other at least every 2-3 months or so, saving our money to move out together. I was fine with not having a strict end date, as long as we had clear goals to work towards.

At the time, he was finishing up a community college diploma that he'd started just after finishing high school, but never got around to completing. He was working at a retail job at the time (still has the same job). I started to worry a bit seeing how he would just skip class/assignments, fail, and then pay to retake more classes, but he assured me that it was ok and he would take it more seriously. He promised me he'd get the diploma out of the way so that he could get a better job, and improve his chances to immigrate here.

Fast forward to now...nothing has really changed. I think he's still enrolled in school and still has his job. He often talks about marriage and having a nice home together, but in very vague terms. He also talks about things like getting a teaching degree or opening his own business. But he doesn't care to think about the logistics of achieving these goals, and they just get pushed further and further back. And since the job he has pays jack shit, he has no savings either. He’s gotten better about spending his money on junk (over 170 games on steam) and saving instead, but I’m not exactly rolling in money either so it’s not like I can help here.

Whenever I ask him about planning for the future, he gets upset and says I’m trying to pressure him or that he’s scared I’ll dump him and move on. Or he’ll get depressed and say that I think he’s a bum and a loser. But I’m not asking for definite plans, just goals that we can expect to accomplish within the next few years. I have a pretty good idea of what I want to be doing in 1-2 years’ time, and how to get there. I think that’s pretty normal…

I'm starting to feel really worried...it's like even though we treat this like a serious relationship, he doesn't seem to make smart decisions or try to plan, instead leaving it all up to me. A few days ago I was telling him that I felt burnt out from school and his response was that I should drop out and permanently go to my summer job (I had a summer internship that paid a few bucks above minimum)...I'm set to graduate with my bachelor's in June 2013. What kind of logic is that? It just made me realize how bad he is at making life/financial decisions. 

I really love him a lot and I can easily picture us settling down together. These problems didn't really hit me until now, since I'm preparing to graduate and look for a job. I'm considering just going to professional school/college or something since there’s no way we’ll be even remotely ready by the time I graduate, or even within 2013. I hate this feeling of uncertainty…how long is this going to last? We’ve only been able to see each other 3 times over the past year and a half. I think I could deal with it better if we had an end in sight…but right now it doesn’t look like there is.

What do I do? I don’t know how to articulate that he needs to start thinking seriously about the future if he wants this relationship to pan out and be something more than daily skyping and occasional visits. I just get stonewalled whenever I bring it up. Am I being unfair or do you think this is reasonable for me to want?

11eo7i,5,2012-10-13,Have I Ruined Myself?,ryosuke727,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/11eo7i/have_i_ruined_myself/,"I am a 22 year old senior in a Cal State school, graduating in December. I feel as though I am a decent student, with a 3.6 cumulative and major GPA.  I know it's not the greatest, but compared with some of my peers, its good. During my junior year and senior year, I tried to get an internship. No go. I'm a member of our Accounting Club, but I didn't grab a position of leadership, which I regret. I went to the job fairs and Meet the Firms and tried to network, but I never had any luck. So with graduation coming and an empty resume, I've started to become depressed. I've almost given up completely on public accounting simply because I cannot fathom them hiring someone with essentially a blank resume. I never had aspirations of Big Four, but simply a regional or small firm would have been nice. So then I looked at industry a few months ago on craigslist, monster, indeed, and such, and decided to apply to everything I could find. It hurt to see such low pay, but I figured at least get a foot in the door. No replies for an interview or anything.

I'm starting to become really depressive about this and wondering if I wasted my life away. I know I could have done more and have many regrets, but I can't take them back now. I have 40K in loans that I'll have to start paying off soon, and that's whats really creeping behind my back. I want to study and take the CPA exams at some point, but I need to get paid to support myself, pay for the study materials, and pay for the exam fees. Is there someone, anyone that can help me get through this or share a story or prevalence? I feel lost, and seeing those around me finding security has thrown me into a rut I'm having a hard time crawling out of. I just want a chance.

11em8n,2,2012-10-13,Amazon fails to support its sellers when USPS fails even more,melawesomee,amazon,https://www.reddit.com/r/amazon/comments/11em8n/amazon_fails_to_support_its_sellers_when_usps/,"Time for a little Amazon.com rant...... So I'm in the realm of ""F-bomb"" pissed at Amazon... I have my own ""store"" on Amazon that I sell my used textbooks and a few other random things at and this week I am SUPER pissed.... So here's what happened: A guy purchased a book from me and wanted it shipped to Hawaii. No problem.... Well except for I was running a little behind in shipping (about 4 days.... yes, I know) Anyways, I let the guy know that I was shipping his item. Well I sent it USPS with a delivery conformation, as Amazon suggests. Well it seems this guy still has not gotten the book, which I would be upset too. Well instead of contacting me and saying ""hey where's my book"" (even though I sent him the tracking number), He writes a scathing review on my page and then files a complaint with Amazon. Amazon sends me an email asking for shipping details and whatnot.... Now keep in mind, I have NEVER had an issue like this before. So when you look up the tracking number https://tools.usps.com/go/TrackConfirmAction_input?qtc_tLabels1=03113260000118356680&amp;qtc_senddate1&amp;qtc_zipcode1 
it shows the package getting to California on about the 17th of September and leaving the following day...... That's it.... nothing else, now this item was on its way to Hawaii, but seems to be missing now. Well not only does Amazon say I am ""libel"" but that they are going to refund this dudes money and charge me for it and that I can contact him and ""ask him to send back the book should he get it, but that he is not required to do anything"" WHAT? Oh and Amazon considers this matter now CLOSED.... Well I DON'T..... I realize I would be tons of pissed too if I hadn't gotten something I ordered, but my first complaint would have been to the POST OFFICE. and since I have absolutely zero history with something like this happening before, ZERO....... ZERO, why is AMAZON holding me responsible? They also told me that ""while it's not required, in the future I should add a delivery signature to it"" Well guess what amazon, it didn't f........ing get there, a f....ing signature conformation wouldn't matter for shi... OH and how would that help me with having to give them a refund AND potentially be out the product? If a signature slip is REQUIRED to not be charged if a package goes missing, then you damm well need to require it and say so on your page. I want answers AMAZON. 
Now the customer paid about $45 for the book and shipping, and so I am now out that money PLUS the cost of the book, so in my world that's $90. Maybe $90 isn't a big deal to ""RUPA, from Amazon"", but to me, a college student who makes LESS than $70 a week and is doing an UNPAID civics teaching internship Monday-Friday, then working Saturday and Sunday at a bookstore in the mall-It Damm well is. I am so livid over this whole thing especially when I have sent SO MUCH business Amazon's way, and have recommended customers look to them when I can't find a book at work and I have also recommended my fellow college students open their own retail store with them. Maybe to RUPA and the rest of you at AMAZON, $45 or even $90 is your Friday night bar tab at Santana Row, but for me, that is almost one-third of my MONTHLY RENT, yes ONE-THIRD........ I am seriously considering closing my seller and buyers account once this whole issue is settled, and I will stop recommending you to them and start recomending Barnes &amp; Noble for them to sell their used books with.... they might not be a better choice, but they haven't charged me $45 for a book that I have no way to get back. I have usually gotten great customer service from AMAZON when I have purchased items, but even as a ""seller"" I am still a customer. I don't know why I am being treated differently in this capacity.... (package finally arrived on Oct 10th, I emailed customer asking them to return the item by putting ""return to sender"" on it so they don't have to worry about shipping... haven't gotten a response..... totally NOT surprised) I have tracked you down on Facebook though!!!!"

I have so much regret and so many questions. Why did I always come second? I don't just mean the internship-- that last ten weeks of hell...I mean everything. I loved you....no, I love you.

You would talk about how great it would be to be my wife one day and yet the next tell me how you felt that you don't know if you could ever be married. There were nights when we'd go out that I could tell that maintaining harmless flirting with other guys was sometimes so important that if it wasn't received, I had to pick up the pieces. Was there anything I could do to make you less insecure about the other people in my life? Did I try enough? Did I try too much? Every time you insulted your appearance I tried to pick you up and I was so exhausted....So exhausted, and something happened today and brought it all into perspective.

11h3sv,6,2012-10-14,"Close to beating my record, resolve strengthened by recent experiences.",dlefnemulb_rima,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/11h3sv/close_to_beating_my_record_resolve_strengthened/,"So on Wednesday I will have achieved something I previously could not do. I will have gone two weeks without PMO, despite having spent the majority of my time at home in my room (when I wasn't out job-hunting). I've also got a job interview for an internship abroad, so woo!

Previous attempts would have me fail in the middle of the second week - so I know I have to be extra vigilant these next few days.

I went to a house party this weekend. Met a cute girl and engaged my normal drunken life of the party self which usually gets the interest of at least one pretty girl for some time at least... Well I kissed her, and she took me up to her room to 'roll another joint'. 

I knew the implication of this (so did the rest of the room) but once up there I never made a move. I blamed this (in my mind) on being 'out of state' from having already had a couple of joints on top of the booze. But the reality is that I have no sexual confidence from my previous embarrassing experiences with ED caused from excessive masturbation. The thought of sex with a woman terrifies me because although I have had good experiences too, the ones dominating my mind at the moment are the negative ones, and I didn't want to risk the feeling of ED - I couldn't trust my body to perform.

I realise this is pretty fucked up, as I am basically self-sabotaging on something that I have been down about not getting for a while. But it forces me to acknowledge that I am not getting laid as a direct result of the lasting effects PMO has had on me. That I have to eradicate that habit from my life, or continue to suffer, with only myself to blame. I actually edged the day after thinking about how that night could have gone better. Pretty stupid, but I managed to reel myself back in, which I've never managed before. My previous attempts have failed so quickly as I've never really been committed to them or taken them as seriously as I should, but I really feel confident

On a slightly lighter note, fuck wet dreams. I don't even remember the dreams any more, just get woken by that sticky sensation, often in the middle of the night. Can't wait for those to subside a bit.

Stay Vigilant, Fapstronauts."

I used to watch a lot of anime growing up. Now-a-days I watch a show every once in a while.

I ride a KLR650 everywhere and don't own a car. If anyone can manage to make that not look so cool it's me. I ride all gear all the time.

1) I am 23 and do not have a credit card. Enterprise and Avis both require credit cards. My father who is in a different state cannot pay for it, as he has to be present.

2) My father issued me a credit card, but I will not get it for another week, and I need a car now. I have all the card information, but I need a physical card to rent a car from Enterprise or Avis

3) In order to use a debit card, I need to show proof of residency in California, this is for Enterprise and Avis. Hertz doesn't mention anything like this, maybe I don't need to be a CA resident to use a debit car at Hertz?

I basically need to be able to rent a car with a debit card, despite being from a different state.

**tl;dr at bottom**


Almost everything that I read always mentioned that family kicked them out, or at least weren't too pleased with them being trans. Because of this, I put it back on my mind and tried to live a normal male life. It ended up not working, and I had to do something and move forward with accepting myself as trans, and eventually transitioning.

Anyway, cut to the good part: yes, there were some troubles with myself regarding transition, but overall everything has been just fine. I got my letter okay-ing HRT, and found a doctor (who didn't even need the letter) to prescribe me hormones...all while in a smaller, more conservative city.

About a month or so after I started HRT, I sent a letter to my mom coming out and explaining everything. She was fine with it. It took her ""about a week to have it settle, but then was fine,"" and the rest of my family were told the next couple months. 

I started laser removal on my face, not mentioning to my technician (privately operating place) I was trans. She actually knew at the beginning since she saw the meds I was on, aka hormones. She was very nice about it and legitimately wanted to help me out. I was a bit wary since I saw crosses, and she seemed religious, and again: smaller conservative city.

My mom even found a lawyer to change my name and gender ID, and only after about 3 weeks of knowing. I got that done in literally a month, and it even happened to be the day after my real birthday. Awesome!

I came out to my work (University on campus job, so a bit more open), since I was starting full time much sooner than originally planned, and needed to find out if I had to find a new place or not. Everyone was fine with it. My name still slips, but that's expected.

Starting the new semester as my true self made me really nervous and anxious, but no one really batted an eye at me. People in classes don't say/point me out or anything. Anyone I pass walking through campus hasn't made any rude remarks.

I've been told I pass well (I just never see it), but my voice still doesn't really. Even when I do talk to new, random people...I get nothing negative. Sometimes I get a little confused or curious look, but nothing harmful.

All my family now knows, and most took it way better than I thought they would. A couple of them mentioned that they wouldn't really think twice about having the *girl name* in the family in a few years. (We don't see each other often) They just want me to be happy, along with my parents.

All the friends I have come out to over the years have no problem with it. Even ones I knew long ago, and a couple that I didn't talk to very much. They all just said it's up to me, that I shouldn't feel ashamed about anything, and wish me to be happy. Some of them even knew something was up with me and knew that something wasn't quite right about the guy me. Once I told them they said it made a whole lot more sense to them.

Most recently, I went to the Career Fair for my college, and was quite nervous about showing myself and speaking to them. I got two interviews for an internship, one of which the recruiter said was ""highly competitive."" None of the interviewers I talked to seemed to look at me any different than any other person. 


Well that's my shortened (lol) story. Of course, I still know that there will be someone who doesn't agree with me, and will treat me like shit....but that's why I am careful and have a stun gun on me just in case. I might take this down if I start feeling nervous or if it doesn't do it's purpose.

**tl;dr - I've had basically no problems going through transition or coming out. Everything has been really good overall :D**

Does any one else have something similar? I wanted to show people that there really are people out there who just want the best for you."

I have a healthy lunch and do school work, go to my internship, or go to work. I get home from work and ...

* My feet hurt too much from standing all day and I don't feel like standing up; might as well order delivery.
* My neighbor comes over and she's brought fast food with her and damn that looks good ...

Are these all stupidly weak excuses? Yes. Do I know that when I ignore my brain and sabotage myself? Yes. I'll log all my food all day up to that point in MyFitnessPal, get so excited at being under my calories and doing well ... and then go eat a burger and totally ruin all the day's hard work.

Any tips on how to fix this? How did you overcome it? I'm sick and tired of self-sabotage but I just feel too weak these days.

11ib21,7,2012-10-15,"The road from Fine Art  to Graphics Design, some careers input would be great!",shiko098,graphic_design,https://www.reddit.com/r/graphic_design/comments/11ib21/the_road_from_fine_art_to_graphics_design_some/,"Greetings /r/graphics_design!

First of all id like to say thank you all for some of your posts on here, i have been following graphics_design for quite some time now and i have picked up so many handy tips, and discovered some nice new resources because of you guys and girls.

First of all i would like to give you all some background as to how i have arrived where i am, 19 years of age i went back to college and started to study for a National Diploma in Art and Design. During the 2 year duration on this college course i remember first sparking my interest in Graphics Design, and i remember learnings the ins and outs, and the basics of graphics design, we started very traditionally using pen and paper techniques, learning basic typography, compositional, and colour do's and donts etc (very basic stuff) as well as being introduced to Adobe Design Suite. I remember at the time i fell sick, and i was sat in a doctors surgery and littered around the room were a couple of large notice boards swamped with posters, and leaflets (im sure all you designers out there know where this is going) but yes, i sat there and i remember wanting to gouge my own eyeballs out, id never seen such a large array of terribly designed posters, and literature, with hideous font choices, and gradients that made you feel like you just had acid thrown into your eyes. This is when i decided to ponder a journey into the world of graphics design, the Art and Design course i was doing however, was very diverse, it wasn't just design based areas, but looking into traditional art skills such as painting, ceramics, photography, printmaking, 3d design, and pretty much every area in between. At the age of 19 and being as enthusiastic about all the subjects i was doing, when it came to deciding what i wanted to do at university was a really tricky decision for me. I went through college adoring every aspect of the course to the case i pushed every subject and left with a straight set of 'Distinctions' which for everyone outside the UK, is the highest attainable grade for the course.

So back then at the end of that course i was 20, utterly engrossed in every subject i was doing at college, and of course when moving to university i wanted to choose something a little bit diverse, something that would allow me to try just about anything i wanted to do because at the time i had little focus on a set career path. This lead me to choosing 'Fine Art', i made this decision due to the nature of the course being very explorative, it was a three year degree that allowed me to create my own work, using whatever mediums i desired, whether it was painting, sculpture, video, installation, printmaking, the lot. Whilst some people found being kicked into a studio and told to just work without any kind of brief scary, i found that concept so exciting in my earlier years cause it allowed me to expand into areas i hadn't tried before. But to cut a long story short, during the duration of my degree, i tried pretty much everything, but fairly early on in the course i soon began to realise my roots and my calling. It seemed like my work had naturally progressed into the digital illustration side of things, and to finish my degree, my exhibition consisted of a huge poster display of very silly and pun ridden work, often taken inspiration from advertising, internet culture, world news, in essence it was a cocktail of bright colours, silly cartoons, and a bit of fun. The reception of the display was very warm, i had a lot of people enjoy the display, laughing at the puns, and i even went on to sell quite a large deal of the posters to viewers. 

So i finished my degree with a 2.1, which while is not a first class, i was happy enough with considering the demographic of tutors at my art school, who favoured the more over pretentious style (yes i saw a lot of lone bricks on plinths) I am now sat here looking back at my path, and treasuring everything i learnt, but i cannot help but be a little frustrated that i did not specialise and choose a degree a little more focused. But none the less, my learning has taught me this one fact - Graphics Design, and Illustration have been my two greatest allies along the way, i am now 24, and it is time for me to get serious and put my skills into action. 

At the moment i am currently seeking for internships, and junior roles that might be suitable for someone with my skill sets, in order for me to learn the ropes of the trade correctly. However jumping onto that first step is something i could do with a little advice on, positions for these types of posts are horrendously difficult to attain in my area at the moment, with even the really junior, and internship roles requiring previous experience and extensive knowledge.

This has lead me to believe unpaid work experience could be the best and only way for me to progress, since going back to university is just not an option due to the expense the question is, what do you suggest would be the best way to go about approaching an employer for a bit of work experience?

I assume a good portfolio would also be a very good idea before approaching these job roles, what kind of content, and how much would you like to see in a portfolio for someone looking for a trainee role? 

I would love any kind of advice or input on the matter, because so far i have had a lot of sleepless nights trying to figure out where to start with things to get me on the road.

Thanks for your time folks, i really appreciate it!"

I'm applying to transfer to some UC's, but I'm sure I'll get rejected from all of them. I'm willing to bet most CSU's won't even take me, despite that being my most realistic destination. I don't know what will happen if I get rejected everywhere. I'll be heartbroken and utterly depressed. I don't want to think about failure though, I can't imagine what will happen or what I will do.

My friends and family constantly tell me how smart and hard working I am, but I don't believe it. I acknowledge my work ethic, but I feel like a big fat phony idiot who's just waiting to be discovered, waiting for people to realize I'm not actually that smart. On the outside I appear like I have my shit together, but people don't realize how much I struggle with my life.

So I'm looking at a few internships. I have the qualifications, but I'm afraid of applying. I'm afraid of failing, having my ego destroyed even further. I'm afraid of my parents being disappointing in me. I'm afraid of my friends giving me shit for being an underachiever.

I guess the biggest problem is that I'm afraid of failing. I've been through a lot of hardships, but I've always surpassed those obstacles. But in the process my self-esteem took a massive hit to the point where I'm not sure if I can continue pushing in my current direction. The safety of mediocrity feels good for now. I WANT to succeed in life, I truly do, I'm just afraid I might not follow through with what needs to be done."

where i live now, i can take community college classes and/or get an A.S. in accounting. there's a university which offers the bachelor's and a certificate (with online and on campus options.) i have not yet contacted them but a second bachelor's may be very doable. then there are master's programs; there are not any in my area that meet in person. new england college has what appears to be an amazing online master's program with a new specialization in forensic accounting, but i'm concerned that an online degree won't afford me the internship and networking opportunities that seem really important. on the other hand, online accounting programs are not rare so students are managing somehow. 

i could also apply to other master's programs in the country for non-accounting graduates and shell out a ton of money to move and live there, but the school debt (which i have plenty of already) would likely be outrageous. it sounds like some people do okay if they just take the necessary accounting courses and get their CPA. but having no accounting degree seems a bit risky to me (correct me if i'm wrong - i just worry how this would look on my resume.) i also don't have any work experience which is needed for the CPA anyway.

11le3x,5,2012-10-16,I (M/23) am heavily considering breaking up with my SO (F/23) of 4 years. Currently in an LDR with no real end in sight. How and when do I do this?,Mofaux11,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/11le3x/i_m23_am_heavily_considering_breaking_up_with_my/,"So this wound up kinda being a rambling wall of text! Feel free to just read the tl;dr at the bottom, but any advice would be great.

Background: we met our freshman year in college, talked a lot and became good friends. Come fall of our sophomore year, we started dating. I found out she had never dated anyone before, never kissed anyone before, nothing. She always seemed a little timid and shy but I made it my goal to bring her out of her shell as much as possible, make her stronger, and build up her confidence. Our relationship throughout college was amazing. Our relationship grew from an extremely strong emotional connection and friendship, and I have become closer with her than I have with anyone else in my life. We always took the physical aspect of our relationship slow. This was ok with me for a little, but when I was ready for sex (about 6 months into the relationship), she wasn’t. We waited 3 years to have sex. When we finally decided to (this past March), it was because I constantly brought it up with her and how hard it was for me to have an emotional, but not fully physical relationship (we still got intimate but nothing past 3rd base). She did it for me, but if it were up to her I’m sure she would have wanted to wait even longer. Since graduating in May of 2011, we’ve been in a long distance relationship. She went abroad to Europe our junior year, and I was able to handle the 4 month long LDR pretty maturely. This made me think I would be able to handle it post-graduation.

Since then, however, it has become harder and harder for me to be an emotionally supportive boyfriend with the distance. When we first started off the LDR, there were always little milestones I could shoot for: I knew when I was going to see her again. Last fall, I took an internship in the Florida Keys and didn’t get to see her for 3 months. That was really hard, but I knew I was gonna see her after the new year. I got to see her about once a month after that, as I was unemployed and free to travel to see her. Now, I’m working a new job that is very aligned with my long-term career goals, and I’m signed up for at least a year. I’m loving it immensely, and I have the option to stay an additional year if I want. I’m heavily considering this. 

When I first got this new job, I encouraged her to look for work in the area. One of her best friends also just moved very close to where I am. She is currently living at home, working a receptionist/desk job 9-5. I told her, since her current employment situation wasn’t career-oriented, to think about looking at similar jobs around me, so we could be together, and she could be closer to her friend. She kind of refused. She wants to move out to the west coast at the end of next year, and she told me it wasn’t practical in her mind to pack up and move to find a new job if she would only be quitting and moving west at the end of next year. 

I’m starting to realize that I don’t necessarily see our futures lining up. With the nature of my current job and career path, it would be difficult to pick and choose exactly where I end up next. I kinda have to be available to different opportunities and relocations. Plus, I’m considering grad school, and with the programs I’d be interested in, I can’t exactly select whatever school is closest to her. 

With this distance, and the nature of what I want to end up doing, seeing her and being with her is going to be very inconsistent. It pretty much means I’d have to continue maintaining this long distance relationship. She kinda expects me to follow her out to the west coast come next year, but I’m hesitant to do so, and part of that is because she refused to relocate when I got this job. 

On top of this, there are a few other things that I wish I could change, but I don’t believe will. Like I said earlier, she is pretty shy and timid. I’m a bit more socially outgoing and adventurous, and I’ve tried to get her to be more willing to open up and converse with people, but that’s hard. There have been times when we’ve gone out together, and the entire time she doesn’t really talk to anyone else besides myself. When she’s upset or sad, she oftentimes goes inside herself and shuts off. Getting her to talk about it is very hard, and I have to pretty much just guess what’s wrong or how she’s feeling. She’ll open up, but it sometimes takes a lot of emotional effort on my end. When she comes over to my house and visits my family, she rarely engages in conversation with them. They will try and talk to her, and she’ll make small-talk for a while, but then that will be it. It’s hard for me to watch her be quietly awkward as a conversation someone tried to make with her dies. 

Also, our libidos aren’t really synched up. I’m the kind of person who wants to have lots of sex, and I’m sure she would be content doing it much less frequently. Whenever we have sex (or even just make out), I feel like I’m always the one who’s initiating it. I’d love for her to just once grab ahold of me and fuck the shit out of me, but I don’t really see that happening. The only time she really initiates this is when we’re drunk, and that doesn’t exactly sit well with me. I also always want to try new and exciting things in the bedroom, and she’d rather stick to what she knows (which isn’t very much). 

Long story short, I’m seriously considering ending our relationship. It’s been amazing and fulfilling, but it’s not really where I thought it would be at this stage. The thing is, she has no idea I’ve been having these thoughts/doubts (because of the distance). Breaking up with her would totally destroy her. She has told me repeatedly that I’m the one good thing left in her life, and that when she’s sad I’m what cheers her up. 

She’s coming to visit me in a little over a week, and we’re going to celebrate our 4 year anniversary together. I really want it to be an amazing, romantic weekend, and I’m hoping that it rekindles our relationship and reignites our fire. But I honestly don’t really see that happening. Should I end it with her, face to face, when she flies down here? Or wait, feel it out, and ease her into it step by step? I’ve never had to break up with anyone before and I’m not sure how to do it. I still want to be close friends with her. The last 4 years of our lives have been amazing in so many ways, and we’ve shared so much that has really enriched my appreciation of life. I don’t want her to forget that and have her hate me, but I’m not sure how.

Sorry for all of this rambling, I hope this makes sense and I hope you guys can give me some good advice.

Tl;dr in an LDR with gf of 4 years. Seeing her in a week, but not sure when after that. No tangible end in sight to distance. Because of distance, along with other smaller issues that I don’t think can be fixed, considering ending relationship. How should I do it?

I'm a 24 male. I don't know if anyone can help, and while this is mainly about my girlfriend, it's because my girlfriend has pretty much been my life. This isn't a relationship post, as I need the help from what I can tell.

I have also been diagnosed with OCD in the past.

My relationship with my girlfriend is in the shitter right now, and I'm almost 6000 miles away from her.

Prior to June, my relationship with my girlfriend was AMAZING. We started dating around the beginning of October 2011, and everything was great, we went on trips together, loved each other, we became best friends. Sigh I'm already crying. So, a month into it, she abruptly broke up with me, I was heartbroken. While I know it sounds stupid to get heartbroken over a one month relationship, I was. She called me, crying, and told me that she just wasn't ready for this relationship to get that serious and was sorry. She was balling over the phone. This made sense as she had just gotten out of an engagement four months prior. I told her calmly that while it didn't make sense to me, I respected her decision, and bid her adieu. We talked a bit afterwards and she said she would sleep on the decision. Well the next day she texted me, and said she wanted to to talk. Ok, so we met at the docks, and she told me some fucked up shit. I'll get to what this fucked up stuff was later, but I told her I didn't care and I was going to be there for her no matter what. We ended up kissing and watching the water on that cold November night. cuddled together for warmth on a metal bench, and to be honest, as someone who felt completely alone for so many years, it felt like heaven to me.

Fast forward a couple months and I develop a hatred for her best friend (I use the term lightly) because he has a) wanted to fuck her since the beginning of time and b) didn't respect her at all. He had made her cry on countless occasions by simply calling her a cunt or stuff like that because she was too busy to hang out. She had also went to a birthday get together at a cigar bar for an ex boyfriend that made me feel extremely uncomfortable because he specifically didn't want me there. I felt hurt that she wouldn't, but she went for maybe an hour, if that, just so she could get to my place. Our relationship wasn't really damaged. She also did trivial stuff, like she did her makeup a way I liked for the first time, but it was for when she went to hang out with her friend (he was morbidly obese and calling her a cunt in the past for not putting out so I know she wasn't cheating on me) I also caught her talking to her ex fiance who also physically abused her, and that made me mad too because she told me when we first started dating that they weren't facebook friends and she didn't talk to him, yet here she was talking to him openly on facebook once I learned his last name. I almost cut it off because of this, but I didn't. 

Well fast forward a couple more months and she is staying with me every night at my place. Enough that my roommates are charging me utilities for her. I'm happy. She also cuts off relationships with her dick friend because I told her friends don't make friends cry. Oh the irony in this now.

Well, in April we make the decision to move in together because I will be leaving in the late summer for an internship in Europe, and want to make sure she has a stable roof over her head. We move in, and everything is good, but only for the first month. I start getting controlling and telling her she can't even look at the reddit pages of her ex friend or ex fiance, even though she has blocked them on facebook to appease me. I catch her looking at an ex through a other friends facebook account and I freak. I know I'm not right. But she kept doing it, and kept denying it until I provided evidence. This continued for a while, damaging my trust in her, until I found out a bombshell.

Well, the secret she told me was that she was a stripper. She abruptly left her parents place and her boyfriend (he wasn't physically abusive at the time) pretty much told her she had two weeks to get a job. Mind you, this was winter of 2010 in the midwest, so I can believe her when she said this was difficult. She had a part time job, but it only gave her the equivalent of 50-70 bucks every 2 weeks. She supposedly applied everywhere, and finally gave up and joked about a craigslist ad for stripping to her boyfriend, who pretty much said ""do what you gotta do."" So she tried out, and was hired. From the moment on she was humiliated, obliging to a command to ""show us some titties"" during the try out. She continued as a part time stripper to help cover the bills, with some paper deliveries thrown in to balance everything out. She did this for three months, and even did a private gig.... a huge classy swingers party. Ugh. She used me as an outlet, someone who she could share the horrors with without getting thrown out into the cold like her previous boyfriend had.

I had no problem with this for a while, she would tell me everything, about how she was finger raped twice, to how the scar on her stomach was from where a guy ripped her bellybutton out, all the way to how a guy started jerking off in a vip room. She said she wasn't fully nude, and was low contact to her best abilities without getting fired (as in she couldn't just take ones off the floor without giving the guy a cleavage hug) and stuff like that.

After being cool with this for so long, I simply snapped in June. I remember it, we were driving to get ice cream and she was talking about how some guy just gave her money because he felt too guilty asking for a dance from her because she was so non stripper like, and how the bouncer told her she wasn't the kind of person that should be doing that.... and I just snapped. I stopped the car, told her to just shut the fuck up and stop fucking talking about it, and to fucking drop it. I turned the car around, drove home, dropped her off, and just drove on the highway for 2 hours. I don't know what happened, I just fucking lost it.

So, I come back, and I was just different. I had a HUGE problem with this all of a sudden. I mean out of nowhere, I'm flipping out about this. I've gone from talking about marriage (I know how early it was) to talking about breaking up, over something I already knew, in less than 24 hours! 

I end up telling my parents, who after talking to her, told me that shes a good girl inside and was just in a bad place at a bad time. And I wanted to believe it, but I just..... couldn't. I dunno what happened, but I hated this new change.

Then the bombshell..... She left her phone at the apartment by accident one day, and some random guy (who called her 2 days prior and she answered and hung up saying it was the wrong number) texted her about coming on a boat. I was in a stage of just hating everything and everyone, and had lost all trust I had in anyone, so I was determined to figure out who it was. Long story short, she had stripped a SECOND time in May of 2011, at a different club (after she told me she only stripped once and quit once she got her job.) This guy was someone who she gave her number to while she was stripping (this was at the almost end of her engagement with the dick bf) and supposidly ignored once he became explicit in the texts. She said she only went back one day, because she needed money for new tires because she was on spares and scared they would blow. She said she hit the floor twice, and just sat at the bar in between, hence when she started talking to this guy. She said it was because he seemed nice, and someone to hang out with. But I know it was because she wanted attention that her (now cheating) boyfriend wasn't giving her. Nonetheless, nothing came from it, and I know so because when I texted him from her phone, it was clear he only knew her as a ""stripper"" from a year and a half before and didn't know her name or anything else like that.

I, again, freak. My OCD has came back into full swing, and I become an emotionless monster. I mean, I hate what I have become. I make her cry, I berate her, I call her names like a ""whore"" for what she did, I tell her she was a slut.... I'm a monster. I'm a monster to the person I once KNEW I wanted to spend my life with. I made her cry almost weekly, and didn't back down. I was purely emotionless, I would keep going, even when she was on the floor crying, just beating her down with more words. She finally just snapped (she was depressed and had anxiety issues) and started beating me. I deserved it. I'll never say this to her, but I was a monster. But in my mind, I was speaking the truth and I had no reason to feel emotion. I was making my own girlfriend burst into tears, and I cared less for her crying than I would a stranger. Now, I'm 6000 miles away, and I'm STILL doing it. I'm alone. There's nobody here. Nobody has sent me a post card. I eat lunch alone. I stay in my empty apartment when I'm not at work. And I stay in my office when I am.

I cry, alot. And when things don't go right and finally push me off the edge, I take it out on her. Today we were supposed to skype when I got off, but she got called into work. I proceeded to slut shame her over stripping and accused her of being a prostitute. This all after I told her I wanted to spend my life with her yesterday.

What's wrong with me? Why don't I feel emotion? Why am I so cold?
Mainly, how did I change like this towards her in a second. She won't break up with me because she loves me and thinks that the old Idontknow8888 is still inside, and is just trapped by the new me. I miss my old me too. I'm simply.... not happy any more. I'm sad. Lethargic. I live in seclusion now and it has gotten worse. One moment I'm supposidley happy, and then the next I see something that reminds me of the stripping (a mask or something that she used at the party for the theme) and I just go from a 7 to a 2. I just feel miserable.

I can't take it. I want my old self back. I miss him =(

Can I get him back? Or am I doomed to be this emotionless asshole for the rest of my miserable life? God, this girl invested in me, and this is how I'm repaying her. She's so amazing other than the stripping. She loves art, has the voice of an angel (has done opera and musicals in the past), and is an AMAZING cook. She itches my back when I lay next to her, and holds me when I'm cold. Shes the best damn thing to ever happen to me, and I'm not only letting her slip away, but pushing her to that line.

I need help, but I don't even know with what. ='(

Tl;Dr: I need help and have become a monster over something, while terrible, I had no problem with for over 6 months.

11kp65,3,2012-10-16,"wow, so what the fuck was the point of that?",[deleted],BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/11kp65/wow_so_what_the_fuck_was_the_point_of_that/,"Backstory: M(22) broke up with me, F(20) about a month ago. When I first started dating him it was the summer, he seemed very driven, he had this fancy internship at this huge company. I was the first girlfriend of his to: graduate high school, not go to jail, and not cheat on him/fuck him over in some way. I was the first girlfriend his mom even tolerated, and she loved me. We seemed like the ""perfect"" couple. We both were smart, attractive kids who were pretty well liked and had similar values. He broke up with me once school started up again because he didn't have the ""drive"" to make it work with me any longer. It was around the time he seems to have lost the drive for a lot of things. He drinks a lot now for stress relief even though both of his parents are alcoholic. He quit smoking when we were together but now he is again. He's still friends with an ex-girlfriend who he dated for 2 years, she cheated on him twice, and she's fucked him over plenty of times as his ""friend"". He's friends with a lot of people who are drug dealers or just drop outs in general. He lost his job at the internship. 

Anyway, the night we broke up I was pretty fucking upset. I was blindsided by the whole thing. The night before we went to a party and he was telling all of his friends about how I was the best thing that had ever happened to him and I made him happier than anyone ever had, blah blah blah. So he has 2 paperback books of mine and a sweater. I told him if I ended up wanting my stuff back I'd contact him, otherwise he could keep them (he has PLENTY of shit from his exes). I've been doing the no-contact rule and trying to ignore him.

Rewind to last thursday night. It's 11pm and I get a text. ""Hey, do you want your things back? I have 2 books and a sweater."" I wrote back ""Yeah, sure. If it's urgent you can just stick them in my mailbox and I'll get them in the morning. No biggie.""

Him: ""Well I'm carless at the moment but I'll drop them off tomorrow day if that's okay. I just expected to hear from you by now.""

Me: ""That's fine. I won't be home from noon to around 3 though. I didn't expect to hear about this at 11 on a thursday night.""

Almost 2 hours later I get a response:
Him: ""Well it's been on my to-do list. This semester's been absolutely crazy. Also: 11 is the best time. I know you're still up anyway :P""

And then here's the kicker: THE FUCKER NEVER GAVE BACK MY SHIT.

What was the point of him contacting me?

So any other managers finding in this time of when there are supposed to be lots of good people out of work that its hard to find anyone good?

Edit: Why do some people assume that because I want some senior people that we dont hire interns, we have a great intern program here and one of them is in my team and is a star, has been promoted last year and will be again this year. Do you people realise you cant have a team full of juniors and interns or does this somehow escape you?
Secondly, my background is QA, I have been doing Agile for 5+ years now.
I need seniors with experience of things like TDD and basically other good quality development practices because one of the teams Im taking over as a team that barely does any unit testing and needs that from within the team and have the mindset changed, plus someone who already works in that way, that works a lot better than trying to train them up from scratch, also looking at contractors as current project is in a bit of a rut.
I also have another great team, great with TDD, great with thinking about testing etc and really happy with them.
So before making wild assumptions how about you think a little bit :)

EDIT 2:
We have also had people apply with 20 years experience but thats in purely waterfall, doesnt know about unit tests etc, so thats experience but the wrong kind so also didnt pass.

Experience doesnt alsways equal work space, surely if you are really into coding you have been doing it for years and have some past projects? side work etc?"

So me and this girl have been dating for about a month now. We met eachother in a bar... Started out as a one night-stand. From then on it's been really great. We go out for drinks every weekend, we go on small hikes, we meet eachother's friends, I've met her dad and she's met my parents. We only see eachother during weekends because she is on an internship in my hometown, but we study at the same university.

Right now we are pretty exclusive, but after some thought I'd like to be in a relationship with this girl. People think we are together when we're in public, but I can't quite grasp what she really wants. I feel like our relationship is based solely on sex, it's pretty much all we do unless we're out with friends.

The subject of relationship has been brought up, but we decided not to discuss it too much so we don't ruin what we have right now. She did say that she could see herself with me. Thing is my ex-girlfriend broke up with me 3 months ago, and it seems like she thinks it's too recent. However I've come to the conclusion that I'm over her, and that she was treating me terribly. I havn't spoeken to her in over 2 months.

We're going camping just me and her in some cabin near her parent's cottage next Friday, and I want to bring up the relationship topic again, but at the same time I don't want to seem too desprate and clingy.

I can't really explain why I want us to be official.. Just seems right to me, even if it won't make that much of a difference from what we have now.

Is it too early to start a relationship after about a month and a half of dating exclusively? "

So I've been reading this sub for some time, and for the most part it's full of great advice:  do well on exams, be social, pickup internships, master excel, etc.  All this seems great, but doesn't seem to be helping in my situation.

I have a BA and MA in mathematics, and just recently left a PhD program at the end of my second year.  I just didn't like it.  Research math is not for me.  I've considered becoming an actuary for some time, but my education was all paid for via NSF grants and TAships, so I couldn't turn down the opportunity to get a PhD.

Now I'm in a situation where I'm over-educated and under-experienced.  I've maintained a 3.69 GPA (I should really start rounding), passed the P/1 Exam on the first go last month, will be sitting for the FM/2 in December, and will be taking the MFE or MLC (whichever is offered soonest) directly after that.  I also have several years of teaching experience (so I can communicate clearly, as well as be social), programming experience, and have reasonable knowledge of excel (pivot table, lookups, index/match).

So the question becomes:  how do I, as a current degree holder, get hired as soon as possible?  I can't get internships, since most of them require the intern to be in school at the time of hire (how firms only have extra work over summer is beyond me as well...). 

I've considered the cold emailing approach...should I wait until I have that second exam passed?  Do I find a menial job (I can't imagine the average menial job will help my resume much), or focus on exams?

I'm pretty discouraged lately, so any help is appreciated."
11jwvn,0,2012-10-15,"Ok, I need to rant a little bit about the last episode. I really don't like where the new season is going.",[deleted],Dexter,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dexter/comments/11jwvn/ok_i_need_to_rant_a_little_bit_about_the_last/,"These are the reasons from the last episode that caused by reaction. *Spoilers*

1. The way they killed the intern guy, Louis. I actually thought he was an interesting character with deviant properties (like ruining people's lives and frequenting prostitutes) and also money, that they could have easily used to their advantage in the season. He had so much going for him and then they just kill him because he was being an annoyance to the main character and so that they could use him as a set-up for something in the future. 
And yea, that set-up was so idiotic. OH HERE, LET ME PAN TO THIS POOLING OF BLOOD SO THAT THERE'S NO WAY IN HELL YOU MISS IT BECAUSE I'M GOING TO USE IT IN THE FUTURE TO IMPLICATE DEXTER IN HIS MURDER. This is such a stupid gimmick. And then on top of that they use the lazy and incompetent gangster because you know he's not going to clean it up.

2. The villain for this season is a sociopathic British-educated Ukranian gangster. Seriously? Also, he has no feelings other than his love of Opera. I can't believe they actually added that to his traits. 

3. This is the main one. Let's assume that Debra's initial and secondary reaction to finding out about Dexter were plausible. But within three episodes, they have made her 'understand' her brother. This is what they did:
i) First episode: Initial reaction of confusion and revulsion.

ii) Second episode: Feelings of denial which led her to try to 'cure' Dexter.

iii) Third episode: She goes through a near-death experience and all of a sudden 'understands' him and her punishment for him is probably going to be expulsion from her life. That makes sense.

First of all, they made her go through through the [stages of grief](http://psychcentral.com/lib/2006/the-5-stages-of-loss-and-grief/
), which is stupid enough because they have been proven to be untrue. Secondly, they have been setting up this event for seven whole seasons but instead of taking advantage of it and going deeper into to it, they're just giving viewers a superficial glance using only three episodes. And now all we're going to get is anger and hostility? 

Is this good writing on their part?"

Need advice!,[deleted],psychotherapy,https://www.reddit.com/r/psychotherapy/comments/11jhkw/having_major_problems_in_my_internship_need_advice/,"I'm doing the internship portion of a MS in Counseling.  I started in August, and it has been one problem after another.  I only have 3 clients because my supervisor does not believe individual counseling is beneficial with substance abusers.  I can only see these clients at very specific times because there is no room for individual counseling until people leave the office for the day.  My supervisor also expects me to see each client for only 15-20 minutes once a week.

Another big issue is that I recently found out that my supervisor is not licensed and has never been licensed.  I'm afraid this may affect my ability to be licensed later.  My university supervisor assures me that it is okay, because ""the university meets most CACREP standards and can choose to not meet some standards"".  Does that sound right?  

Also, my supervisor has decided to take the rest of the year off.  He said that site supervision was unnecessary and that I do not get a replacement supervisor.

What should I do?

**Edit**: I called the licensing boards of the states I may move to after graduation.  Every representative I talked to said it was not okay.  There are some steps I can take to see if it gets approved (such as hiring an independent supervisor), but it won't work as is.  Time to make some calls to the university.

However, I'm from a tropical country, it's hot and humid here 8 months of the year and it's raining the other 4 months. I have no clue how to dress for Germany. 

This is what I think I need to buy:
- 1 long overcoat
- 1 or 2 jackets 
- a few cardigans and sweater tops
- 1 hoodie
- thermal underwear (?)
- lots of thick socks
- one casual bag
- one fancy bag
- scarves (?) 

Fancy bag is the only item I currently have, I would have to buy everything else, it's a lot of stuff - so I want to start by buying a few items per week.

11mci0,2,2012-10-17,Should I stay in London or go back to the States? ,heepofsheep,Filmmakers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Filmmakers/comments/11mci0/should_i_stay_in_london_or_go_back_to_the_states/,"I'm finishing up my last semester here in London while doing an internship at a production/post house. I'm thinking about staying here after the semester ends and trying to find some corporate work that'll extend my visa. At least in the mean time I'd like to start doing some freelance work off of mandy to help pad out my cv. 

Anyway do you guys think its worth the effort to try and stay here? From what I've gathered from others in the industry, the English film/tv job market isn't very hot right now. Even so in the last couple months I've gotten the opportunity to do a lot of amazing things here. I feel like I could make it work, but my visa is a bit of an issue. 

Anyway my other option is to move back to Philly and attempt to find a job there. If that fails after 6 months then I'll head to NYC to find work, and if that doesn't work out then out to LA I suppose. 

So basically what I am saying is my odds of finding camera assist/running/pa/ type work much, much higher in NYC than it is in London?

11mceo,1,2012-10-17,fuck smoking,throwaway1568,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/11mceo/fuck_smoking/,"I see you smoke those damned cigarettes every fucking time I come home. I know you try and hide it, but smoking in your car that I had completely clean for two months was the dead giveaway. 

Do you not remember how you spent half of the summer in ICU with a pneumonia that should have killed you? It was a miracle that you survived, and the doctors (all 8 of them that were in charge of you) commented to me and dad just how lucky we were to have you come out of that alive, especially being a smoker of 30+ years. There is no doubt in my mind that your pneumonia wouldn't have been as bad if you had quit smoking one of the hundreds of times you said you would. You spent 28 days straight in a coma, went through a month of rehab, and had your mother, sister, son, and husband by you every step of the way. I remember helping you recover from the brain damage that was caused by your severe oxygen deprivation, helping you remember who I was, who dad was, and where you were and what you did for a living. I taught you how to drive again, how to eat, how to do household tasks, everything. Everything about your life had to be relearned. You stopped smoking through necessity for that entire time, but as soon as you came back around, you went back to your old habits.

I don't want to go through that shit again. I've shed way too many tears over you.

The way I see it now, you ruined my whole summer. A summer where I was supposed to get that amazing internship that I had to turn down because you were sick. A summer where I was supposed to start off in the real world for the first time. A summer where I was supposed to finally catch up with my credits and get back on track to graduate in the next 2 years. All of that is gone, and it's because you wouldn't stop smoking. I'd have traded all of my opportunities and obligations for the summer if it meant you came out of the summer not smoking, but you let me down.

Dad told me last weekend when I was home that if you kept buying cigarettes, he wouldn't be able to afford your health insurance anymore. When he told me that, for the first time in my life, I saw dad show fear.

If you want to see me for Thanksgiving, Christmas, and the like, you will stop smoking. If you keep smoking through next year, I'll stop responding to your calls, emails, and texts. It's going to hurt you, but not anymore than how much you're hurting me and your fragile body right now."

",[deleted],BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/11lmr7/i_cheated_on_my_boyfriend_and_its_time_to_pay_the/,"I cheated on my boyfriend within the first two months of us dating. It was a longtime friend, and someone who I used to have a fooling around relationship with. We kissed, kind of drunkenly, and sent really explicit messages to each other over a period of two days. None of it is justifiable, I know. Believe me. I was sick to my stomach of what I did, but made the poor decision of not telling my boyfriend. 

Flash forward a year, he looks through my facebook messages, and finds the bad ones. And we're over. He's deleted me off facebook, told everyone what I did. I totally deserve it. I hurt him so bad, and now I wish I could just curl up in a ball and disappear. 

I have no friends, no family members who care about me. We currently live together (he is overseas for an internship, but will come back in December), and own a cat. He told me to get out before he comes home, because he never wants to see me again.

I hate myself. I feel like I should be the one being put through this, not him. But now I'm completely broke, and have nowhere to go. I told my parents what happened, and they hung up the phone before telling me ""there's nowhere for you to stay here"". I have no other family members in town that would help. My credit is so bad, I can't afford to get approved for an apartment. Not to mention that I have NO furniture, pots and pans, nothing. 

I know that I'm the one in the wrong, but can someone please give advice? I don't plan on instigating anything on us getting back together, I know better than that. Just please, I need advice, I'm seriously blacking out because I've been crying so hard, and I have no one else to turn to. :("

11pssq,22,2012-10-18,Heartbroken [30m] 7 months after breaking up with the love of my life [27f],[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/11pssq/heartbroken_30m_7_months_after_breaking_up_with/,"Last year I was a graduate student at a good school. Toward the end of the spring semester I met two really wonderful women, both 26 at the time. I dated them both very briefly before deciding on the one that I felt serious feelings for. She was the most incredible woman I have ever met: brilliant, beautiful, multilingual, foreign (just a bonus), and the best part was that I she loved me.

At the time I met her, she had a boyfriend. When we began seeing each other, she told me it was already over. I would not have started a relationship with her had she said it wasn't. Because I would never want that to happen to me. It turned out that after a month of dating she had finally told him it was over. Go figure.

A few weeks later, she went out of the country for an internship. We kept in contact through Skype, barring power outages where she was. We spoke daily, and by the end of summer had mutually declared our love for one another and decided to move in together when she returned home. As a surprise, I planned an incredible vacation and met her for 10 days where she was before coming back.

This was the first sign of trouble. When we returned, her ex had decided to wait for her at the airport. I was on a separate flight, so he had no idea I even existed. They talked for several hours until she sent him back home and we spent the night together. He showed up the next day knocking on the door as we pretended not to be there. A few weeks later we moved in together.

Things were incredible for the first month or so. Then she felt the need to call her ex on his birthday against my advice that it would only cause trouble. It caused trouble. It started three months of insecurity, anxiety, anger, and frustration for me while she worked out her issues talking to him on a daily basis. My relationship all but disappeared. The affection was gone, the conversation was gone, the sex was gone. Everything disappeared while she would fight with him at all hours of the day and night. She would tell me it was acceptable to do and that ""the right thing to do is to give him a second chance,"" or ""feelings don't go away overnight."" This was after six months without him and with me.

Naturally, as I thought my relationship was over I reached out to someone to express my frustrations and anger and insecurity. It happened to be the other woman that I had briefly dated and who had become a good platonic friend. She was there for me while my girlfriend was spending the night ""arguing"" with her ex in a hotel room (it happened twice, I still can't prove anything occurred), and through the interspersed physical altercations where she would hit me and throw things at me. I developed a bond with this woman and told her at one point I thought I had made a mistake and had feelings for her. She told me I was just confused and hurting, eventually I agreed with her.

My girlfriend found out what I had said and commenced months of browbeating (physical and mental). I'm not a small man, but I would never hit a woman. So I took it, because calling the police would have ended with her losing her student visa. Something I wouldn't take away from her no matter what she does.

For months she passive-aggressively attacked me for what I had said, taking little or no responsibility for her actions or how they made me feel. All while I apologized profusely and did anything I could think of to make it right. Even when we went on vacation she said ""it's a good thing you're here, something might have happened with so-and-so if you weren't."" I was completely astonished that she could even imagine that, but I was too in love to see the warning signs.

In mid-March of this year I sent her to spend a week with her best friend as a gift. It gave us some time apart to relax and stop fighting. Yet she called me and picked a fight about forgetting to DVR a tv show and that was the end for me. I called it off. After just under a year with a woman I had lived with and almost married, I ended it, and I regretted it immediately.

Within a week of coming back there was already someone else (this is apparently a pattern that has a 10 year history). At this point I was ready to move on, and I did. I went out with friends and began dating after about a month and a half. I was happy and excited to be on my own and feel alive and attractive to someone else.

Then my ex got a hint that someone else was interested and laid a perfectly fashioned guilt trip on me that ended with her ""coming back"" for the months of May and June (and once in July) while she was already in a new relationship that I was unaware of. She kept me under her thumb for six months, up until late September when I finally stopped responding to her emails.

I recently found out from a friend that he had gone through something remarkably similar years ago and told me that the woman he was with had been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder. I have no doubt the same exists here. I've done the research and every metric for diagnosis fits my ex perfectly. You would think a guy would learn his lesson and run far far away, right? Me too.

As it is, her issues are difficult enough to handle. Insecurity, self-loathing, obsession with physical beauty (I swear on my mother, this girl was a 9 only because no one is perfect), jealousy, low self-esteem, neurosis, and an extreme inability to trust people close to her. It all made sense in the context of this disorder.

My problem is this: It has now been seven months since I ended things. She's in a serious relationship (or as serious as she can get with someone she has an affair with and later cheats on with me) and I feel like I've hit a wall. She did everything she could post-breakup to pull me back in and keep me from going forward until she was able to. It worked. Despite everything that she did (and I'm not perfect either, but I never cheated on her and never laid a hand on her. I yelled a lot because she never gave me time to speak), I still love her. 

I can't seem to get past this. When I met her I fell head-over-heels instantly. I've had serious relationships before that headed toward marriage, but never one that felt like this. How have those of you in serious relationship overcome the heartbreak that comes with losing someone who has changed your life? I've tried everything and I'm out of ideas.


TL;DR: Fell in love with a girl. She was great then treated me terribly. I ended it, I regret it. I'm failing to move on when I know I need to after 7 months without her and a month without speaking to her. Don't know what to do anymore because I feel like I hit a wall."

11p2er,6,2012-10-18,DAFUQ,gftoofhere,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/11p2er/dafuq/,"So my ex decided it was over and I'm all alone is the simple version. It would have been four years come next month. It started out the same way all good relationships do.. she semi stalked me and I ignored her. Then on a whim I invited her to get dinner. I enjoyed it so much that I asked her to be my girlfriend. We had a wonderful time. Any chance I had to do something for her I would. Also, tons of sex. She was in a sorority and I went to a different school in the area. She would go to frat parties without me and I would worry and get jealous... I would wonder why she wouldn't blow them off and hang with me. She never cheated on me.. I never even had a girlfriend cheat on me, but still I had doubts. All the stories I hear just get to me. Anyways, I would get upset, but do nothing. When we were together I could care less what we were doing. I enjoyed being together. Fast forward a few years. She decides to go to Australia for a semester abroad. I think aw damn if she's going then I wanna go to... but Australia isn't within my budget. Instead I find a program for Panama. My sister had gone to Costa Rica a few years before and loved it, so I figured they are similar and that I should expect the same results. Unfortunately I did not. After a month of being home sick and going mad, I had decided to leave. Everyone had begun taking drugs like cocain, ritalin, etc. I had missed home, I couldnt and still can't speak spanish, and to top it off I felt like I was the only one who couldnt have a good time no matter what. One night I got so angry at this realization that I 1. would have killed myself had a car been driving down the road as I was walking home. and 2. out of a fit of rage I punched my (or rather my [ex]girlfriends) laptop. I shattered the screen and lost all contact with the only people that made me happy. That was when I decided I NEEDED to be on the next plane out. I got back 5 days after my girlfriend had boarded her plane to Australia. During the next 5 months I was out of school alone. The job I left did not take me back like I had been promised. So without work or school I was bored and still depressed from what was left of Panama. I had spend over $10,000 for a month of depression when my family has a lot of debt. This thought kept running through my mind. As I log onto facebook I find that I rarely see a message for me from my girlfriend and she is having the most amazing time. I become angry and jealous. Eventually I end up doing something I am not proud of. I begin to manipulate everything I say to bring her down to my level... So of course we end up fighting. We almost end it there, but I fight for our relationship. I tell her it wont happen again. Unfortunately, my depression decided to block that from my memory and a few weeks later I do it again. This time I admit my faults and try to get past them. She finally comes back. Doesn't seem that grateful to see me. Her father... having payed for her to go out and enjoy herself to the fullest.. hates me for bringing her down. He is not one to let a grudge go. For a good while after that he and I have a palpable tension when together. He would say almost nothing to me. Enough time passes and finally things are back to the way they were. Then one day I go to a dance with her for her sorority. Unfortunately once I get there I start to feel bad. I then say I don't want to go lets just go to the room I don't feel well. (a few times before I would avoid going to the parties once on campus with her because they were full of drunk asses who I couldnt connect with because they had money and were in a much better school and would always look down on me) This time.. on the other hand, I had actually contracted a stomach flu from a recent visitor. I had no idea and neither did she. She began yelling at me saying that I always did ""this"" and that I hate her friends and she wanted to have fun, but I wouldnt let her. I admitted that was partially true, but that this time I had actually wanted to enjoy myself and have fun and that this wasn't ""In my head."" After lying in bed for an hour after this argument I saw my pizza from dinner again... All over my new shoes. Having concrete evidence as to not feeling well she began to apologize for giving me a hard time. She ""didn't mean it."" I am an understanding guy so I said, ""Look its not your fault you didn't know and you had reasons to doubt me."" Still after all that was said and done, I felt that what she said was right and it hurt. The next weeks were tense. I had given it a lot of thought and brought up how upset I was that she had assumed I didn't want to have fun or be with her friends. blah blah blah all the shit she said that hurt me from the conversation. After acknowledging this she and I had wondered if this was where we would end. But again I said no! I will not lose my best friend and love over misunderstanding and petty arguments. A short while after this her father was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer. I began to do anything I could to get her mind off it and support her when she was thinking about it. At some point for some reason I cant remember right now, I had wanted to end it. It could have been because I was trying so hard and was getting nothing in return (which I later realized was actually happening through all of this relationship). In any case I wasn't happy. Instead I swallowed my emotions and stuck it through for her so she could have something solid to hold her up at the time. Eventually I had forgotten why I wanted to end it and we were both happy again.. kind of. How happy can one be when one's dad is given a death certificate. Well as time goes on she goes out with her friends and gets drunk past her limits whenever I am with her (fyi every time we get drinks she has gone past her limits and her mothers side is full of alcoholics) So I worry. Then to top it off her anxiety has her taking zquill to knock herself out for sleep. This causes me to be completely turned off and so the sex comes to a halt and at her birthday she gets too drunk kisses another girl in front of me literally inches away from me.. I'm like DAFUQ I'm right here kiss me! I end up taking care of her that night and all I can think is I go out with her to enjoy myself and every time theres alcohol its this... After a few weeks with no sex drive and a lack of conversation because all I want to do is ""bring her down"" by saying im scared for her and hate what she is doing to herself. She decides to end it. She got into premed and this is how the whole break up worked out:

""We need to talk. (fuck).. I dont feel like we talk anymore. (now I let her proceed because I dont want to flat out tell her I don't like your alcoholic behavior and your drug dependency fucking sounds harsh) You just sit there next to me and when we get in bed you just turn away. You havent kissed me lately. (Which is complete BULL SHIT but when I did kiss her it was met with soft lips no pressure no feel)""

So then I get ready my rebuttal, but before I start she adds in.

""Besides this was going to end come January."" (premed starts)

FUCKING KNIFE IN MY EARS!

this resonates infinitely to this day.
All I can think is WHY? I love this girl and she gets into a program that she brought up has an 80% relationship failure rate.
She knew if she got in it was over! She was accepting defeat before we had a chance to challenge the statistic.

At that point I decided to give up the fight and let her go.

I begin to run the playback reel. Where did I go wrong? Every time I come to the conclusion that it was her. In the end it was her. I wanted to bring her up when she was down I wanted to throw my life away to keep her happy. I lost almost all my friends and did almost nothing during those 4ish years for myself. Yet I still feel like I was an ass.. Like I should have done more or fought for her. I cry from time to time. It was a few weeks ago. And I know it will take more time than a few weeks, but in the mean time I just need some verification that I am not going insane. I need to know how I can move on, find new people, get my life back. I began to look for internships abroad and I am trying to get motivated, but to lose my best friend and the one person I would talk to after everything I did. End class, work, anything and I would call her. Now I have nobody and still get the feeling to call her and share my day, joke, be happy again. What should I do? What more can I do"
11ox6n,17,2012-10-18,I saw my baby! / First Doc Appointment,sallydreams,BabyBumps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/11ox6n/i_saw_my_baby_first_doc_appointment/,"My appointment was at 8:15am. I whined all week about how early it was but was grateful to be able to to be seen and have insurance cover it. I wake up at 6:30am (I was so nervous it was hard to sleep anyway) and magically made it to the appointment EARLY! I have been having nightmares that the ultrasound tech would say I'm just getting fat, tell me to eat less and send me home.

I peed in a cup before the doctor would even see me after filling out some paperwork. I get shuffled down to ultrasound and they have a huge tv set up on the wall so I could see. I laid down and she warned me the goo would be warm. I was glad it wasn't icy cold like I always hear about. Well, she put the wand on my stomach at first and for a few seconds I didn't see anything so I started to get nervous that my dreams were true and then she pushed a bit more and there was a little skeleton burping up bubbles. ""Ah, there is the little baby."" She said. 

My jaw dropped. I mean, I *knew* I was pregnant but since my morning sickness had pretty much gone away and I don't feel like death at the start of each day I thought that maybe I was making it up? That maybe I wasn't pregnant? ""Did you not know you were pregnant?"" she asked. I told her I had been having those dreams about being fat and she let out a belly laugh and her two interns laughed too. They all chimed in talking about the cute little skeleton bobbing around in my belly.

The ultrasound tech applied a lot of pressure poking and prodding the infant to turn towards us or atleast loosen up. Poor little thing was in a tight fetal position as soon as it realized we were peeping in on 'em. So no gender yet. :( But it's okay, my Hubby doesn't want to know and I really do... so I said the baby must have heard that the dad doesn't want to know. They're already plotting against me! That doesn't seem fair. hah. Well, the ultrasound tech just let me stare at the very busy body inside of me (when this baby gains some weight I'm going to be in misery. Kicking, doing flips, shadow boxing and having fun while doing so.) I was amazed I couldn't feel ANY of it. The tech said that the jabbing pelvic pains are most likely the baby stretching out because of how low s/he is. She said that everything is looking good, week 16 (my guesstamation was correct) and my due date is April 1st.

I then saw the doctor and she did a pap smear and I TOTALLY forgot all the questions that I had for her. Ladies-- all of those books and blogs and websites say make a list of questions and DO IT! I wish I had. I ended up asking my mom after the visit and she lectured me on making a list for the next visit. After the pap smear the doctor said that I would experience some ""light bleeding"" and not to worry about it and that bleeding after sex is common because I have a soft cervix. Well, after the doctor left I stood up to get dressed and blood ran down my leg. 

I was so embarrassed and I was by myself. I cleaned myself up and ran to the bathroom between the ultrasound tech pushing on my lower pelvic area and the doctor propping me open I had to pee so bad. Then they took I swear a pint of blood for lab work. 

O yeah! Everyone I saw asked me if I had some spotting my first trimester. Apparently it's very, very common. I was freaked out and I told the Doctor that I googled it to death and basically bleeding is normal or a miscarriage. She agreed with that. She said, ""Bleeding in the first trimester is very common. Sadly, if it's the start of a miscarrage running to me won't make it stop. There isn't much we can do."" So ladies-- light spotting during the first trimester is common. Light as in **not** like a period and **not** lasting for days at a time. That was my major worry when I didn't go to the doctor. This is my first pregnancy. This is completely new to me. I just wanted to pass that along. But again, I'm not a doctor and she did say bleeding is either completely fine or absolutely not but only time will tell. So honestly, I say no need to stress about it because however it's going to end up will be but I know I was worried until I just decided I was only hurting myself with the guilt. Stay strong ladies! We're all in this battle together!!

I am a senior in college concentrating in accounting and minoring in finance.

I graduate in the spring and I will have my 150 hours required to sit for the CPA exam. 

My culmulative gpa is 2.6 (switched from engineering, really messed me up), my major gpa is 3.2 (this is the gpa I put on my resume labeled 'major gpa').

I have nothing else of particular interest on my resume other than a little bit of work I did myself for people related to computers, etc.. 

i.e. I have no professional internship experience.

Recently went to the career fair aimed at accounting and finance students a couple of weeks ago, I talked it up with everyone, I thought I did pretty well there. I also talked to them weeks leading up to the career fair at the accounting club meetings we have. I knew I would have to get my name out there as much as I could considering my piss poor resume.

All to no avail I suppose, I got no replies back, probably my low GPA keeping me out coupled with my lack of experience. This is also a school where all the big guys along with small heavily recruit at, so things are looking pretty grim if I can't even get a bite..

So now I'm asking you guys, what are my other options? I'm constantly applying for every posting I see related to the accounting field, specifically audit when I can but general accounting/finance positions as well. I'm looking at all companies big, small, accounting firms, corporate positions. 

I just want to get my foot in the door. I'm willing to work for free as long as it may lead up to a full time position by fall. Should I e-mail companies offering to work for free to gain experience in the field, attached with my resume? If so, how should I go about it? "

Every thought about my gender identity is swirling around my brain and I'm just trying to make since of it all.  For one thing, I feel like I'm lying to myself because the thought of me being trans never came up until I was 18, two and a half years ago. I was working on an internship and became jealous of some of the women working there. I didn't want to have sex with them, I wanted to be them. There was probably enough shit going on in my life for me to not care. But I've always felt like I fit a more feminine role in society and am a bit over-emotional for a normal guy.

Besides, if I really am trans and I want to be a woman, am I willing to lose the little support I do have?

11qpi4,5,2012-10-19,Just clearing my head,[deleted],freeposting,https://www.reddit.com/r/freeposting/comments/11qpi4/just_clearing_my_head/,"I have wanted to voice this for so long but had no avenue.

I always wanted to do something to make the world a better place and in my last three years of high school, found friends that were the same.  We didn't want to just accumulate wealth, but to use what we had to help others.


Out of our group of 8, one teaches troubled youth to rock climb/kayak/abseil/etc, one is completing midwifery studies and is set to go to developing countries and help in this way, another is an occupational therapist in mental health.  Most of us have done something.  I went into youth work.  One of us went to study architecture, but also volunteered with some other charities.

The architect ended up putting his studies on hold to intern with the same organisation I was with, but in a different city.
We talked briefly about this, but both of us got too busy and didn't talk for a couple of years.

While this went on, I got to know the head of our branch a little better, and it became evident that the stuff he was doing was no longer about the kids, and had became about making a name for himself.  It was clouding his judgement and I was distraught.  Money we didn't really have was being spent on running big events &amp; the kids we were meant to be looking after were coming second to doing cool shit.  

I left the organisation because it all got too much.  I won't go into detail because this story is not about that.

I wondered what things were like for the architect.  I kept saying ""next time I see him, we'll talk to him about this.""  
I said it for two years and never saw him.
I never got to see him, ever again.

At the start of this year, he died.  He died young in an absolutely horrific accident.  

I flew down to the funeral and they all talked about the great things he had been doing within the organisation.  All the hours he put in.  I had always said he was one of the most passionate, caring people I had ever met.  That was just him.  But they painted him as though it had started for him with all these jobs he was doing and all these events he was running.  

I didn't say anything bad of it, because my experiences are not necessarily his.  But in the back of my mind, I can't help but wonder how he was doing before he died.  I want to ask him if he was ever as worn down as I got.  I want to ask him if he could come back if he would choose to do it again.  I want to ask him if he thinks I was wrong to turn my back on it.  I want to tell him I'm sorry for not staying in touch and for not getting him a birthday present that year he got me one.  I want to tell him that I think about him every single day because of all of us, he was the strongest in every way, and the least selfish.  It's been a while, but it still doesn't seem real.


But he's gone, so I can't.
And I can't talk to anyone about this,  because so many of the things I struggle with about all this are the same things that are his legacy.  They're the same things that make him a hero in the eyes of his family, our friends and the hundreds of people in that funeral, and I can't take that away from them.  It's the only hope they have. 

I don't really know how this reads to the outside world, and it doesn't really matter.  I just don't think I can hold it inside any longer.

11qo1m,1,2012-10-19,Do I really love her? Or am I hanging on? [24/M],3rdcultureboyfriend,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/11qo1m/do_i_really_love_her_or_am_i_hanging_on_24m/,"This is a throwaway, for obvious reasons. Also, she goes on r/aww once in a while.

So I'm not sure if I love my gf or hanging on.

The deeper context:
I'm a third culture kid. My ethnicity doesn't really matter, but if it helps I'm Asian. I've lived in Korea, Japan, Amsterdam, Beijing, LA, Honolulu, Ohio, and Madrid (dad is a missionary). Translation: I don't click with most people. Sure, I have interesting stories, but in literally every culture I've been to girls neglect me as a foreigner.

I came to UC Berkeley in San Francisco, and here I met the perfect girlfriend. In fact, I just celebrated our 1000th day of dating (yeah, that's an Asian thing)– it was great! She's also a third-culture kid: lived in Russia, Korea, and other parts of the USSR. Her parents now live in Europe. She understands the sort of cultural neglect us TCK's go through sometime, and we've struggled together in the process of college, finding an internship, and now a full-time job (I'm working, she's a senior).

But recently we've had moments where I've thought that the relationship isn't going the way I thought I would. There's moments when she gets angry for small things. A common scenario is when I play the devil's advocate to try and help her understand a situation (e.g. when she's pissed at someone after a bad day at work), but that backfires and she doesn't say a single word to me even after I've said a sincere sorry. I've gotten *this* close to yelling at her once, as she told me meeting new people tires her (she's also introverted, like me- she's in accounting, go figure), and wants to do this thanksgiving just by ourselves without inviting anybody. And not in a romantic ""just us two"" way, but literally in a ""it would be more convenient and more frugal"" way. I sure as hell won't go clubbing (it's loud, got boring after college), but I think it's right to spend thanksgiving with a couple of really close friends.

I really love her, she's cute and intellectual, but I've begun seeing her faults and sometimes I can't stand it: extremely messy room, her short temper, her neglect of her skin health, her ""bottling up"" in her silent anger, her loathing of exercise which I'm scared about, since I want her to be healthy (I'm thinking long-term: really serious about this relationship.) I love sports and exercise but I'm willing to make that sacrifice. I also cook and clean for her because she has some intense studies going on, but I have a feeling she uses the excuse that she can't cook for sh*t (a joke between us) a little too often, leading me to cook at least 9 out of 10 meals. It's fine now with her studies, but I have a feeling it'll continue even after she starts working. She also has severe mood swings– I know it's not PMS because it gets even worse during those periods.

Also a confession: I am afraid I won't find anyone who understands me like her. I've heard it's an innate fear in all TCK's, but I don't intend to make that an excuse. I hope I'm not that pathetic.

The best part: my gf's parents once officially told me it was over, 1 year ago. That's right: we're dating in secret. Her, and thus her parents, being Korean, they see me as a threat to the integrity of her family. They apply Korean standards to our relationship, and her slightly overanxious mom labelled me as a negative influence to my gf for detracting her from her studies. I also felt that she strongly disliked my poor Korean. In reality, my gf and her parents have fought countless times because they want her to come back to Korea and work in a Korean firm, until becoming a proper Korean wife– which she has no intention of doing (she's got a great career at JP morgan). After ""breaking up,"" my gf told me her mom had called me a coward for just leaving her (which I really didn't, as far as she knows). We intend to break it to them some day when I can see them in person with their daughter, and explain that she is self-sufficient. But even though I try to hold my faith steady, I have nightmares of my meeting them at least once a week. That's when I realize I don't really have a plan of what I'll do once I meet them. I don't know if I can keep this up.

Sorry it got long. If you've stuck with me this long, you now realize how complicated this relationship is. It's like a Korean drama for fucking sake. What I need now is real advice– ""make me feel betters"" would do that but that's not what I need right now.

**What should I do? What am I feeling? Is there anyone out there who can throw me a compass? I don't need a definitive answer, even– help me walk steadier... I don't know what I'll do.**

**TL;DR** 3rd culture kid meets 3rd culture girl, happy relationship complicated by gf's degenerating habits/lifestyle and me being a bit slow + freaked out parents. Not sure what I should do to maintain relationship, or not. Not sure what it is I'm feeling– except lost.

EDIT: Yes, we do have a sex life. In fact, it may be the only thing I'm getting right. We both end feeling good after, but soon goes back to her mood swings."
11qko3,5,2012-10-19,Computer Science majors - do you work in groups to create interesting projects outside of class? A few questions from a transfer student.,[deleted],UCSC,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSC/comments/11qko3/computer_science_majors_do_you_work_in_groups_to/,"Hello everybody. I'm finishing my last year at a Bay Area community college and I'm HOPING to transfer here next Fall. I submitted a TAG application, so hopefully everything works out. 

Anyway. The Computer Science crowd at my school sucks. People go to lecture, then go home and do the labs themselves. No one wants to collaborate or help each other out, which I think is terrible because we all have a lot to learn from each other. I personally love working with other people especially on programming assignments, because it helps get the work done much faster. If I'm lucky to find a partner, we can bounce off ideas and gain tremendous amounts of insight on various topics.

Even the guys in our CompSci club don't do shit. People talk about tech related news, but no one does any actually coding. Here, I am entirely on my own.

So here are a  few questions. How willing are you guys to work with other people on class assignments? Are you like me, or are you a rockstar loner cowboy coder who does things in your own?

If you found out I was a transfer student, would you be less willing to work with me? We get a bad rep for being stupid, and I hear people in other UC's try to distance themselves from transfer students. (I promise not all of us are slackers)

Finally, would you be down to code shit outside of class? I'm extremely serious about improving my programming skills. I wanna land some awesome internships while in college and get a killer job after graduating. I'd like to work with motivated students and produce some quality projects during my stay here.

I'd just like to get an idea of what to expect from my fellow CS students in the future.Thanks for your time.

About the only things I can complain about are a little school stress and some financial woes, IE, massive student loans. I do kind of obsess about being single/lonely though. I'm working on that. The main issue I'm facing right now are these overwhelming feelings of sadness, loneliness, and despair. They're growing worse and worse in my mind, and now I can feel them in a literal sense by way of kind of a sickening tingling, mostly in my wrists. I can't, at all, seek non-anonymous professional help or become medicated. I say this because I am planning on applying for some rather sensitive government jobs and internships, and any such medical history would ruin my chances. I want to make these thoughts get more under control. Any ideas, guys?

I completed a 6 month internship in Software Development during my course. I have practiced recording and producing music using Reaper over the past 3 years and produced 2 EPs for bands that I am in. My final year project will use NAudio and FMOD to create a music composer for Kinect.

Annnnnyway, I found programming Softphones during my internship to be a bit tedious and repetitive. I really enjoy programming but the work felt uninspiring and restrictive. I hoping that programming audio, and especially in games, will provide a career I will really love. But I'm not sure if my degree will stand in the hiring process for games companies and I will probably have to look abroad since there are not many games companies in Ireland.

So, what do you think? Do you have any advice from your experiences or any idea of what qualifications Audio Programmers have?? Do you think I would stand a chance in the Hiring process given that the company would never know the college I graduated from or feel my degree isn't audio related?? Halp, pls! Thanks :)"

Long story short I was on the path for computer networking about 10 years ago when I got out of high school, but got distracted by being a musical theatre electrician instead. Now I'm looking to go back. Thing is I'm too old (i.e I'm an adult with bills to pay) to intern anywhere, so if I get my CCNA do I have a shot at an entry level job with no previous networking work experience and no college degree? Looking to make at least $35k/year, more would, of course, be fantastic, but I have no illusions of making the big bucks right off the bat and know I'll need to work my way up.  

My dream plan is to get my CCNA, which I can do in a relatively short amount of time, get my foot in the door somewhere working entry level so I can quit my two current jobs for the one job in computer networking. Which frees up time to go back and finish college. In a year or two I'd have a degree, work experience, and still have my CCNA, and I know I could then use all of that to get into a better position. But it all hinges on getting that entry level job to begin with, so the question is, do I have a shot? Is there a better certification to get first? What sort of jobs should I look for? 

All opinions/advice/thoughts are welcome, even if it's just to tell me I don't have a shot in hell. I know it's somewhat area specific, I live in the Twin Cities (MN) if that helps. Thanks for your time! "

I'm currently finishing my internship as a gardeners assistant at a ""big company"", where a lot of plants get thrown out for various reasons, but my ""boss"" has been giving me some of them, to try and start growing them by myself.

Now, I'm looking for advice on starting these cuttings.

As of now, I have a Rubber Tree (Ficus Elasticus) and a two ""Trazema/Traxema"" (not certain on the name, I'll post pics if we can't figure it out), but my concern is this;

What Advice on starting cuttings do you have?

I've just put them in glass bottles, filled with water.

The bottles are dark glass, as was recommended to me, as far as I know, this is so algae doesn't form/rotting doesn't occur, but maybe I'm totally wrong.

I'm guessing that different plants need different growing mediums/strategies, but what are some general tips you can provide for starting cuttings this way?

Alternatively you could just tell me what you definitely would NOT do when trying to induce rooting.

Thanks!"

I get to go on ride-a-longs and respond to calls with the officers.  A call came in, in which we went to pick up a few guys who would be taken to the town jail for questioning.  We arrive, and I follow my officer over to where the other officers are standing and looking at the four guys who will be taken into custody.

Then one of the guys who is arrested looks over at me and says, ""Who's that fat bitch?""  ""Seriously, what's the fat bitch looking at?""  ""She hungry.""  ""Are ya hungry?""  ""What are you staring at ya fat bitch?""  ""Look at you, you should call Jenny.""  ""I have Jenny's number, want it?""  ""Why don't you loose some weight, you wouldn't look so bad then.""  ""Look at your fat, hangin over your pants.""  (which it wasn't, mind you, I always look nice) ""Man she so fat, she should go on my diet plan.""  ""Ya ever been on a diet?  Cause you sure need one.""  ""Ya ugly fat bitch.""

This went on for five minutes.  The entire time I stood there, stoned face while everyone just stared at me.  No one even told him to shut up.  He just kept going on.  I am so embarrassed.  I've been working with these officers for a couple months now trying to make a good impression and now it's just tainted by one guy to say those horrible things to me.  The entire time I was thinking to myself, don't cry don't cry don't cry.  I felt like I couldn't say anything back to him because none off the officers did.

As one of the officers took him away past me, this guy blew me kisses then wagged his tongue as if to show that he wanted to eat me out.  Ya know, that face.  He kept calling me a fat bitch and the other things written above and I turned around and just stared at him.  I didn't want to give him the satisfaction of being able to make fun of me behind my back, I wanted to face him.  And I did.  

Fuck that was hard.  I know I'm overweight, but have never had an aggressive, hateful experience like this in my life.  And I can't believe not one person stood up for me and tell him to keep quiet.  Can't they see how hurtful that was?  Maybe they didn't know what to do, but still.

Now I've been crying about this for an hour now.  I'm not even going to tell any of my friends because they probably wouldn't have anything helpful to say.

The last few days of my life have been eye opening.  I am a long time lurker and have noticed a few things about myself and my fellow fapstronauhts.   Whether it is obvious to you or not, fapping can indirectly affect the people around you.  In the last week I have had both confidence and happiness.  The happiness has helped my whole family to be more happy and friendly towards each other.  I was constantly crabby living on a porn infused high which affected the people I loved.  My confidence has also been great, the last time I was at twenty-five days I made a speech at my sisters wedding.  Now most of you can relate to me.. I hate speeches!  I took a class on it and had a hard time speaking infront of 20 people.  But during this speech and my nofap all time record, I proceeded to both charm and humor the crowd of one hundred plus people.

The moral of the story is, whether your problem is big (like mine) or small, to work at it not only for yourself but for the people around you.  I have seen many posts on here saying that nofap didn't work or didn't give you the results you wanted.  But I think getting rid of this disgusting part of your life is freeing and contributes to you people in individual ways.  Some resolutions are more obvious than others, but keep at it and you will see differences for the better.

I just want to say a quick thanks to this community because if I had not stumbled upon it I would not be experiencing the success, gratitude, and happiness I am experiencing today.  

Oh, and I got an internship.. and I'm browsing for girl friends.

TL;DR  It's totally worth it."

- I would like to know what you, professional in BI, do on a regular day? (Can you be specific in terminology please so I can google). Or the frequent BI tasks, I know some time is lost on meetings, helping interns or what not. For example as a web dev: translate psd to html/css/js, db modeling, writing queries, programming back-end funcionalities etc.

- Is there an advantage or skills set overlap if I came from .NET development? I recently graduated, have done some .NET (school)projects with SQL Server/dashboards/C# and I liked it. But I want to try something else. Recently there are some openings for traineeships in BI at some big companies and I would like to know my chances.

For a little over a month now the transmission has started to slip from first to second gear. The car does still shift, but very roughly. It got slightly better (I believe this is due to the colder weather we are having) but regardless, I do not want to keep chewing up the transmission, and I'm curious to see if there might be any simple fixes available. I have heard that this may be caused by the transmission's governor gear, and this looks easy enough to replace. If the problem is much more involved or costly, I will probably just drive this car until the transmission is no longer usable, as I would lose less money scrapping it than trying to fix the transmission.

11wiku,1,2012-10-22,"Wow, this place is dead! Here's MY successful game-plan throughout freshman year so far. (long, but descriptive)",[deleted],UniSeddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/UniSeddit/comments/11wiku/wow_this_place_is_dead_heres_my_successful/,"**Key parts:** 1) Mindset, 2) Posture/Voice, 3) Contact, 4) Charisma/Confidence

**My mindset is fairly simple when I go out at night.**  Whatever happens, happens; as long as you're happy, enjoy yourself.  If I get slapped in the face by a girl I try to put a move on (never happened yet), then so be it.  If I end up bringing a girl back to my room for the night, then so be it.  If I wake up with texts from some girl I met calling me an asshole for ditching her, then so be it.  You need to realize that the only thing that is important, is what's important to you. And what's important to you should be your happiness.  If hooking up with multiple girls per night/weekend makes you happy, do it.  If being exclusive with one girl makes you happy, do that.  Don't conform your ideals of happiness to what your friends or society believe in, because you can't bullshit your own happiness.  Seriously.  Once you know what makes you happy, you can work towards that goal and once you achieve it, you'll feel on top of the world.

**Posture and voice are ridiculously important.**  What girl wants to talk to a guy holding a cup slouched over against a wall at a party? You don't look interesting.  You look like a bored, boring person, who doesn't have fun.  Also, when talking to a girl, talk with a purpose.  Don't mumble, it's not enjoyable to try to figure out what someones saying.  Don't yell, you'll just come off as a drunk shithead (even if you're not).  Talk calm, confidently, and about interesting shit (after you've gotten her name, where's shes from, where she's living, major, blah blah blah). 

**Not just physical contact, but eye contact is essential.**  I learned the hard way (via a subtweet on twitter, haha) that a girl I took on a date lost interest in me because apparently I wasn't making enough eye contact.  Looking back, almost every time we talked during a conversation, my eyes switched from hers, to the table we were sitting at, to my phone, back to the table, back to her eyes.  It was just too much, and it probably made her feel uncomfortable that I couldn't look her in the eye for more than a few seconds.  Just keep good eye contact, that's all I'm saying (not just on dates, but at parties, or when talking to ANYONE).  In addition to eye contact, physical contact could either make/break your chances.  Next time you're getting close with a girl at a party (by party, I mean anywhere where there's close seating/standing with others, with music, and alcohol being served) try lightly touching her when you respond to something she says.  She says, ""Yeah, I'm from Boston.""  Lightly put your hand on her upper arm/near her shoulder and say, ""What? So am I!"" (only if you are though..that's just an example).  If you're both standing and talking and you're picking up good vibes (trust me, you'll know when you are) try grabbing the lower side of her back and pull her in to talk.  If it's loud (which post parties are) then actually move your head in to whisper while you pull her in.  Girls fucking LOVE this shit.  Sitting down with a girl on the couch? You're an idiot if your arms not around her.  Even if she acts confused or she doesn't ""go with it"" when you put your arm around her, just say you're trying to make the rest of the guys here jealous, and laugh about it.  When you and her are sitting on the couch (presumably with your arm around her) don't just be a dead fish.  When you say something funny, or exciting, do something with your hand on her side like a little squeeze or something.  You really just need to go with the flow at that point.

**Your confidence/charisma are what WILL seal the deal.**  Once again, what type of girl would want to spend her time with someone who doesn't like himself? Answer: NO GIRL!  Be interesting, and be interested!  Don't go on an extended story about some lame ass prank you pulled in high school; don't talk about your ex girlfriend for more than 10 seconds (it almost always gets brought up, it's just a matter of how you react to this part of a conversation. if she asks what happened, just say it was bad timing for a relationship, conversation over).  Are you smart?  Subtly imply it.  You have your own business (even if it's still in the works)?  No harm in mentioning it! I can't tell you how many times I've joked with girls and said they could work as our intern, and when they ask what they'd do, I just tell them they'd get to chill with me and our team, smoke weed, and respond to emails and they always crack up, and I don't think I've NOT gotten a number after saying that to a girl.  Charisma, charisma, charisma.  Not everyone has it naturally, but you can still have it by putting in work.  Be **THAT** guy at the party that people love.  **THAT** guy who nobody can say anything bad about, but can be regarded as a good guy.  Surround yourself with a good group of friends, not the jackasses who try to hit on every single girl at a party until they find one drunk enough to fuck in the bathroom.  Wear nice clothes when you go out, you'll feel better and more confident.  Wear cologne, GOOD cologne.  Personally, I use [Givechny Play Sport](http://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Givenchy/Play-Sport-14596.html) and I've gotten too many compliments to recall.  I legitimately use my cologne as an opener when having parties in my dorm (which is often).  If I smell my shirt and can no longer get a whiff of my scent, I'll go to a girl nearby and ask if she can smell my cologne.  If she can't (she won't), I bring her over to my toiletries and spritz my shirt, and have her smell.  Instant compliments = Instant confidence.  Work with that, use it to generate a good conversation.  *Don't be an asshole to people, because people remember.*  *Don't be a little bitch, because people remember that as well.*  Be charismatic!  Be someone that you'd want to be friends with!  Be someone that you would see at a party and just silently respect.  And just a side note: nobody silently respects that belligerently drunk guy.  They may laugh at him and find him funny, but he's not the guy that anyone will go to for questions, or for help, or advice.  

**TL;DR:** 1) This subreddit is fucking dead, can we please get it going again?   2) Don't be a prick; don't be a boner; don't be a creep; don't be a pussy.  Be THE man.  Trust me, it's so very doable, especially in college, a place where you can basically start out new and become whoever you want to be.  

I'd love to start contributing more (and reading more) in this subreddit, but I can't be the only one to post here within the past month. "

We dated for a year, and were best friends prior. Things have been getting pretty rocky the past few months, and I find myself becoming more and more resentful about what's going on (won't get into details, as that's for r/relationships).

Basically, I'm preparing myself for being alone. I was single throughout high school (besides casually dating), and dated someone before my current boyfriend, but we weren't very serious. Because of these past 2 years, I've lost the sense of being alone.

My boyfriend and I have many mutual friends. He and I were best friends before we dated. Our friend group (of about 10 or so people) used to do everything together. This has died out over the past few months, and things just aren't the same, but perhaps that'll change. Breaking up with him will not only mean losing my best friend, but all of my friends. I know they won't contact me as often (they stopped contacting me as often when we began dating, as they began seeing me as the ""girlfriend"" and would make plans with him for us). I know I shouldn't want these friends if they won't contact me post-breakup, but it's REALLY hard for me to let go of all of our memories. I spent the best few years with them, and *I wish* I wasn't so judgmental about making new friends, but it's hard.

I have many superficial friends, but it's very hard to find ones that I enjoy being around. I know I have to accept change and move on, though. I go to a state school where everyone (besides a select few) is obsessed with getting blackout drunk, going clubbing, or doing drugs. I work for a radio station, and have found a few quirky individuals, but they partake in the same behavior. This is one of the main reasons why I'll miss my friends. I do make friends, and enjoy their presence. It's just not the same. I miss having a best friend, and I do have a few close girlfriends, but it's not the same.

School is stressing me out. I work 2 jobs, and go to school full time. I'm lonely most of the time, because I can't really interact with people during my classes, and by the end of the day, I either go home and study, or I seek out some human interaction, and my grades end up slipping. I need to start applying for grad schools, but the program I'm applying to (clinical psych) is the most competitive in the country statistically. I am putting all of my efforts into working towards applying (doing internships, research work, developing relationships with professors, keeping my grades up etc) but I still have the odds stacked against me.

And I would love to pursue music. I am too much of a worrier to solely pursue this, which is why I'm pursuing my education as well. Some days, I just want to up and move, pursue my music, and never look back. And if I fail, I fail. I'm just very unmotivated. I live in a small state with little music scene, and no friends to come to my shows (now that I'm losing all of them). I don't want to become  ultra famous (Lady Gaga status) or anything, but I do believe that what I do is heartfelt and people enjoy it. 

The weight of everything is crushing me. I know that if we do break up completely, that it will be my time to have a blank slate and start over, but this all scares me. Any advice?

My problem is that I have no idea what to answer when they ask the inevitable question on what I expect to make. I really don't know what kind of compensation I should be looking for. I understand that this is a relatively new profession, but there just isn't enough information on the internet on salaries for data scientists.

(Please excuse me if my English isn't perfect, it's my second language...)


Last night, I was talking to some of my friends, one male, three female.
Usually, they are all really open-minded people, so we do talk about most things that come to mind no matter what.

I should probably add that we're all med-students in our 3rd year, here in Germany. So, these people are going to be doctors. Keep that in mind.

We were talking about "" crazy aesthetic surgeries"" we had heard about, eg anal bleaching...
I started telling a story I had recently heard about the upcoming trend of (inner) labia corrections , eg when they are ""too big"" or ""not well formed"".
Utter nonsense to me, having someone else, let alone a surgeon decide, whether my vulva is considered ""normal"" or ""needing improvement"".

After finishing this story I looked around with a ""ain't that funny"" look on my face and was greeted by deeply dusgusted faces. 

- The one male friend plus another female friend had bever even HEARD of the fact, that vulvas CAN look different, inner labia being bigger than outer, coming in different shapes or colours etcetc... and they thought it was GROSS, to say the least ""why would anyone have that? this is abnormal,right? oh,that sounds so gross, that poor woman sueely never had sex""

All of us had to do several internships jn the nursing sector up to this point, so we've all gotten to washing and cleaning up lots of patients and they obviously had not come across anything ""unusual"".

- My other two friends, who are currently working as nurses, besides med-school, said they have seen a variety of patients and their...well...nether regions.
One of them said, she always ""pitied"" the poor women with bigger labia and tried ""not showing them how grossed out she is,as she would be so terribly ashamed, if she looked like that and had someone wash her"" .


The general opinion was, that ,of course, if someone was so unfortunate as to have such a malformed vulva ( they imagined the percentage to be somewhat around 1 or 2 in 100 women), they would advise them to have surgery,because:

- they can't imagine how a man would want to sleep with them, he would be to grossed out
- it must be extremely painful and the labia will get completely ""numb"" with time due to the constant exposure, much like ""circumcised penises get numb at the tip"" (circumcision is not very common in Germany, obviously...)


They were a 100% sure, that larger labia is something that only old women ""suffer from"",because the connective tissue gets weaker ( now, I know, that the connective tissue growing weaker CAN cause some change in the appearance of the vulva, but, still, really, friends?).
In short, they couldn't imagine that someone could have larger labia, from a very early age, just because the vulva and with it the labia develope and start growing during puberty, just like anything else. quote "" I mean, it's not as if you'd ever see a 14 yo with something kike THAT, haha."" 

I tried to reason with them, explaining, that 
-this really is quite common,
 -a large percentage of women have bigger inner labia, 
- not 2 vulvas are alike,
- they are all fine just the way they are,
- it doesn't affect the ability to enjoy sex,
- corrective surgery might cause a loss of sensitivity in some areas
- YES you should tell a guy, who doesn-t want to have sex with you, because you're gross, to get the hell out
- and yes,"" those women"" are usually fine with it.

And if they're not, it's mostly because society or friends or family have made them insecure with comments like those.

They wouldn't believe me. 

I'm dumbfounded,angry and can't quite believe what I heard. These people are my friends.
They consider themselves to be tolerant, left-wing people, who would never judge anyone. 
PLUS they are all going to be doctors, kne of them a gynaecologist, and now I shudder when I think of her looking at a patient's vulva with pity in her eyes,asking her, if she's considered, getting ""something done about that""

Mind you, I'm NOT judging ladies who decide to actually have something done, may it be because it can be uncomfortable at times or just for themselves!
I just find it awful, that women should feel ashamed of the way their vaginas look.


Well, and if you hadn't guessed until now, I'm also one of ""these women"" with larger labia, not huge, but definitely not porn-star lookalike. 
I happen to be completely happy with them, was never ashamed of them up to this point, never had a guy complain.

I just hate the feeling that my friends can be so judgemental and would possibly even judge me.

I consider sending them the great wall of vagina  ( http://www.greatwallofvagina.co.uk/images )
just as a lesson.
 
what do you ladies ( and guys,of course) think?


so sorry if my spelling is bad I just really needed to vent...

EDIT: Yesterday I sent them all on a journey along the Great Wall. Only one response so far and I have talked to her personally. her reaction was something along the lines of 
"" wow, I didn't know there were so many different...no, I really didn't. "" She also told me she'd never say anything biased about it to a patient. 

I guess that's a start.


I'm currently putting together a little to-see list for them.
 ( Special thanks to There-Wolf, sunny_bell and K_T )

There's not really much more I can do about it, but since I've always considered them to be quite an intelligent lot, this will probably at least make them re-think what they said.

**Thank you all for your input and honest opinions!!!**

**Background**

I have been in a relationship with my girlfriend for over a year now and I Love her. We get along wonderfully, have a lot in common, have enough differences to constantly challenge one other and force the other to grow as a person (more in a bit). We have met each others' families and there is no significant tension there. I am nineteen, she is as well: we are sophomores in college. My passion is Pottery; her's is writing (more on that later).

**Confessions**

* I am so afraid that we won't go the distance. (General anxiety, that- not much reason behind it)
* Her writing is beautiful (we are both avid pleasure readers) but I feel it may never be recognized for the gem it is (she has written two books in a trilogy and has begun the long, laborious of editing the first [began writing when she was younger] simply because there are so many inspiring writers out there: I am terrified that her dreams will never sparkle in the heavens, never be enjoyed by the masses.
* 
I am studying pre-med and am very interested in the human body as well as being naturally gifted in Science, but can't imagine going to school for another six years (with two waiting for me as an intern) before even beginning to pay off the already-substantial school loans.
* I am terrified of trying too hard. I grew up learning not to fight with my adversaries, but to escape as well as out-smart them. But, now that I am older, I have no school-yard bully, I have no eternal teaser. Rather, the main antagonist in my life is within me: I constantly hold myself back (actually waking up in four hours to go to class after taking a full day to write a three-page paper). I am ashamed of myself- my parents always pushed me and I feel as if I have failed them.
* I have never had a ""real"" job but have worked hard with my father (manual labor) to earn descent, under-the-table money when I needed it. This has suited me well as I have never really found the need to spend unnecessarily and have preferred cheap entertainment (books, woodworking [with tools already provided], pleasurable conversation, etc.) over frivolous spending. But, my girlfriend has held a job, steadily, since she was fifteen (in food-service, no less!) and has worked hard for everything she has ever had (as well as being raised by parents who were... less than giving (loving, however- do not mistake me). So, lately, I have felt as if she looks down on me for not having had to work as hard as her for what I have (which is less, financially).
* Today, we had an argument that addressed the previous two bullets among other issues. While I view arguments as very healthy parts of a relationship, this one took a turn for the ugly side. I grabbed her while we were in her car and attempted to force her to listen to me. I was so frustrated that she couldn't see my side of the argument that I just wanted to lay it out very simply in the hopes that she would understand and, if not agree, at least know what I truly thought on the matter. After the emotions faded and I was alone... I was ashamed more wickedly than I am able to remember and not-terribly briefly considered... punishing myself as I once did (scoring my skin with a blade). I considered breaking up with her because I swore to myself that I would never be that kind of man, never be that person who abused their Love or tried to control it: I don't know why I did not do so. I considered simply leaving: just walking in a single direction until I found something that I was able to do to redeem myself.
* I feel as if I am wasting all that I have been given- the second chances, the support, the love and care as well as guidance. But, if I do my best... where will that end? Where do I draw the line between ""enough"" effort and ""damaging obsession"". I am not saying that I am currently operating at the extreme of that- not trying in school/life at all, but rather that I am able to see that there is SO MUCH more I could be doing. So many more activities and passions I could be devoting myself to.
* I feel terrified to grow up.
* I feel as if I should have never lived to this age- as if I should have died by eighteen or, rather, that I out-lived my expiration date.
* My principle motivation in life is now to achieve a healthy and happy life with my girlfriend and I am terrified to rely on someone so very completely. What I mean by this is that, if she was not in my life, I know that I would have killed myself from a lack of hope for the future. How is it fair to someone to bear that responsibility? What right do I have to force her to be my anchor? I believe a relationship should be balanced with each party supporting each other evenly for the good of the two... but I feel as if I am blatantly heaping responsibility upon her for my well-being. She doesn't know a good bit of this bullet-point, by-the-by, and I could never stand for her to know- never could I ever allow someone to be so responsible for me- not fair to anyone, especially someone who I claim to Love.
* I want to spend the rest of my life with her- but I don't see myself being good enough- why couldn't she take the free-ride to wealth and assured fame for her book when she was offered it? I feel as if I will hold her back and have seriously begun contemplating breaking up with her and just walking away from my life (literally just walk to the east coast and try to live however I can, cutting all contact off) so that she may thrive.
* I have never cared about someone so very deeply as I care for her- I would sacrifice literally anything in my power if it assured her well-being.

Why can't I be a Man? Why do I fear being outside of my comfort zone?"

*It was an image, an illusion of myself.*

I rode the train and bus home now, unable to keep the past and the present from blending together. The roads could become quite the callous place when you didn't know which cars are really there, and which cars were there in some moment before.

*Another me. Three mes. A dozen. Fifty. A hundred, even. All in one space, all going about their day; a different day in different times, in different hours.*

It wouldn't happen if I didn't know the route. You can't remember something that never happened. The only way to live safely was to keep every day new, fresh. To not be trapped in a place where my memories ran rampant in my mind. To start forming new memories instead of trying to live comfortably.

*There I was chatting up a girl who had moved to a different firm. In another instance, I was talking to a former boss who had passed away; the intern who was brutally murdered; the manager who was fired for his inadequacy. All in the same space, speaking in a tangled mess of voices and gestures. My reactions varied as well, it was a horrible sight.*

I would wake up, and see myself wake up. Once, twice, three times, four. Ten. Each time, I wondered if I was still dreaming, never sure when I had actually gotten out of bed. I found that doing something new always helped me snap back into reality: a cup of water this morning, juice another-fuck, I got so desperate I even drank alcohol one morning because the memories were starting to converge again. Anything to get myself out of the loop.

*He wants you to rally the people.*

Rallying...not the kind of rallying a team gets before a sport. The type of rallying a squad gets before a war. It was perfect, so they had assured me. Each person in this city: all their secrets and hopes and dreams were all available in some shape or another. Interviews. Diaries. Vlogs. All these people, normal and regular: unremarkable and naive. I would approach all of them as a friend, and they would have no manner of doubting me as I knew so much about them. About this event and that milestone: the breakup, the promotion, the divorce, the death in the family. I worked in a law firm, but the boss-man had made arrangements for me. No one was to see or open the documents I was to ""work on"", and in return, people got more hours for their vacations. It seems silly, but it worked.

For two years, I read accounts of peoples lives for hours on end. The new home, the college-bound princess, the homeless-bound man. All their grief, all their sorrow, their joy, their happiness; this man had somehow managed to acquire it all and compose it in a journal-like book for me to read and dissect. What were their fears? Their aspirations? Their struggles and challenges in their lives? I was to be a savior, a messiah amongst the masses-ready to save them from the terrors of everyday life and the meaninglessness their lives had acquired in the recent years.

I took a taxi home this time. It was one of the few options remaining. His name was Parsa: a 32 year old Indian man from Mombasa, who had moved to the states so he could start saving up to bring his wife and kids away from his tyrannical family back at home. His wife, Nimrita, was 29 and of a different *jati*-some kind of caste subsystem if I interpreted right. They had two children: a baby girl named Jagdeep and an older boy named Divya. We drove to my home in perfect silence, all this had been from the file.

I didn't realize how much I had actually remembered from the accounts. I didn't know I paid so much attention to detail in general. Once I knew the man's name, I felt like he was a true friend. Like we had been this close for years. I wondered why this never happened with any of the others when I asked or figured out their names. ""Maybe because..."" I preferred not to say it. I could tell the man was depressed: clearly, this was not working out well, he must be making a small sum, not nearly enough to fetch his family from back home. ""It isn't going to become any easier friend"", I told him as I left the car and walked inside. He stayed parked in my driveway for a few minutes before he left.

11xnie,1,2012-10-23,college junior [20f] and beginning to wonder if i really am... forever alone,[deleted],self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/11xnie/college_junior_20f_and_beginning_to_wonder_if_i/,"to make a long story short... i am a college junior. i've lived a whole and happy life, albeit the occasional bump in the road that has thrown me off track. i am rush chair of my sorority, moderately wealthy, surrounded by friends. i am professionally successful both in school and my internships and jobs i have had the blessing to work and participate in.

that's all great. but i can't shake this indelible feeling as if there is something wrong with me.

i went to all girls middle and high school from 11 to 18. i dated one guy during that time, a college sophomore when i was a senior -- it didn't work out. i entered the relationship under pressure, feeling as though it was one more milestone i should get out of the way, truly feeling little to no attraction to him in any way. every romantic or sexual milestone of my life has been that way. first relationship, kiss, sex, everything - just something i needed to ""get out of the way"".

now i'm 20, halfway to 21. i have never been in love, nor have i felt the love people talk about. i'm rarely, if ever, attracted to men beyond physical characteristics. 7 years of girls school has stunted part of this lack of relationships -- but i'm beginning to wonder if i'm just not one of those people who will experience the love and relationships people have. 

i know some people reading this are going to roll their eyes and say i have so much more life to live. but here i am. everyone is living around me. and i just feel like i'm going through the motions of my life, continuing to 'get things out of the way' and right on time. 

just needed to get this off my chest. hopefully it will be buried as another 2 am musing from a self-conscious college girl."
11wzh4,3,2012-10-22,I was given two scenarios to respond to and discuss for a class. Looking for advice from experienced winemakers.,quackmaster,winemaking,https://www.reddit.com/r/winemaking/comments/11wzh4/i_was_given_two_scenarios_to_respond_to_and/,"If you respond, please note your experience as a winemaker.

1. Cusick and Mantheakis Cellars own 16 acres of premium Zinfandel. They enjoy inexplicably high scores from the renowned “Sinton’s Picks” wine blog. They sell quite a bit of wine via that blog site so want to maintain the attractiveness of their wine to Sinton. Their vineyard is a gentle sloping hillside and about 40% is flat. They like ripe flavors in their Zin, but deplore the trend toward high ethanol and the inevitable imbalance with acidity. They therefore like to harvest within a narrow Brix range, between 26 and 27 Brix. They are also frugal and do not like to waste fruit so they prefer berry sampling over all other methods. Their instructions to samplers, who are typically interns, are simple.  They have learned that if the instructions are complicated they are ignored. The interns are told to start on one row, but not an end row, walk in ten vines and then pick the first berry they see and to keep walking randomly through the vineyard picking one berry every ten vines until they have covered the entire vineyard, except the end rows. The samplers are further instructed to combine the berries into 200 berry lots for processing in the winery, and have no more than six lots of 200, or 1200 berries, for the entire vineyard. They also tell the samplers to not pick fruit from vines that have too many clusters on them as they will tell harvesters to drop the under-ripe clusters from these vines and not include them in the bins. The 200 berry samples are placed in a baggie, placed in an ice chest and taken to the winery for processing. They use a rolling pin to crush the grapes then measure Brix of each sample with a refractometer. They take the average of the six samples to represent the Brix reading of the vineyard.  They like the average of the six lots to be near the median of the six samples because then they know the sampling was statistically valid. 

In spite of this process they find that they usually over estimate Brix during sampling. Thus when the average first hits 26 Brix, they schedule harvest, which is usually 10 to 14 days later. The fruit then comes in between 26 and 27 Brix just where they want it.  This past year they had a problem and Brix levels at harvest were too high, over 28 Brix even though two weeks earlier the average reading of the samples was 26.5 Brix.  They suspect the interns did not follow the proper protocol and that is why the Brix reading was closer to the true value.  This is a serious problem for them as the ethanol will be too high negatively impacting their marketing strategy tag line “All the flavor without all the alcohol”. They have hired you to help them figure out what went wrong this year. Critique their sampling protocol. What are the possible reasons the Brix at harvest was higher this past year than in previous years? What additional information do you need from them? What advice would you give them for next year?
 
2. The much acclaimed, inventive and pioneering Irish-Eshel Winery is considering ending their long-standing contract with Han-Antignano Vineyards. They love the flavors of the HA Sauvignon Blanc wines but they are plagued by a dull pinkish grey brownish tinge that is sometimes greenish that they always get in the juice and that persists into the wine made from this vineyard. They do not get this color in any of the other wines that they make so they know it is coming from the vineyard. To stop this off color from forming, they add 50 ppm of SO2 to the press as the press is filling. The juice pH is typically 3.7 to 3.9, so they expect this level of SO2 to inhibit juice oxidases. Their press has a 2,500 gallon capacity and they expect 40% of the material in the press to be juice. Their smallest tank is 5,000 gallons and their largest is 10,000 gallons thus it requires two to four press loads to fill the tanks.  Therefore they add 250 mL of an 8% potassium metabisulfite solution to the juice in the press. However when they measure free SO2 levels 24 hours later, there is no free SO2 and the total SO2  is below 5 ppm, their limit of detection. They think there is something odd in the Sauvignon Blanc that is binding the SO2 so tightly that they cannot measure it in a total SO2 assay. 

Han-Antignano do not want their fruit to become known as problematic especially since they are convinced the winemakers are incompetent, so knowing your expertise in all things wine they have hired you to help them troubleshoot the off-color problem.  Why do you think they are getting off-colors so early in processing? Why is the total SO2 so low? Do you agree with their assessment of the problem of low total SO2? What advice would you give them to prevent the problem in the future? What other information do you need from them?

11wvds,84,2012-10-22,There was a fire at my beautiful church :(,tensegritydan,Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/11wvds/there_was_a_fire_at_my_beautiful_church/,"A local news article: http://www.berkeleyside.com/2012/10/21/fire-damages-good-shepherd-episcopal-church-on-9th-st/

The most important thing is that no one was hurt. We have three diocesan interns living in the house next door, separated by only a few feet from the church. Their house was singed and the fence between the buildings was burned to ash. The fire started late Saturday night, a neighbor called 911, and the fire department showed up very quickly and were able to put out the fire within an hour, saving most of the main church building and the bell tower (which interestingly served as the original fire bell for the area). We were actually in the middle of having the tower repainted, thus the scaffolding in one of the pictures.

The sacristy (shown in the picture in the article) was where the fire started and it is totally gutted. The fire department is pretty sure the cause was electrical. We lost almost all the vestments, linens, supplies, beautiful icons and artwork, and tons of registers, books, and historical papers. The Fire Department was so brave and thoughtful--they went to the effort of covering our organ with a big tarp when they sprayed the fire foam. They also retrieved our large Bible that sits at the pulpit. I don't know if it can be restored or not, but we held our regular service the next morning in our parish hall and we used that Bible, wet and sooty as it was.

All of these things can be replaced but the damage to the building is a real tragedy. Our church has been in continuous use by our congregation since it was built in 1878. The building is a city landmark and on the National Register of Historic Places. The most terrible loss to me was that our beautiful stained glass window depicting Jesus as the Good Shepherd was completely destroyed. You can see it in the background in [these pictures](http://www.goodshepherdberkeley.net/liturgy/services/). In one of those pictures, our music director is holding the processional cross that I would carry in the procession. I can't believe I won't ever hold it again.

We barely scrape by financially as it is, but we are very well insured by our diocese, and we will certainly rebuild and recover. Still, it is a real shock to our tiny community (our usual services are about 15-25 people including the clergy). I had not heard the news until I rode my bike up on Sunday morning to get prepare the service (I am in the altar guild). It was like a slap in the face, seeing our beloved church in such a state. But we have been surrounded by love and support from our diocese, other churches, and our neighbors. The Bishop cancelled his plans to come and lead our Sunday service and many people came with tons of coffee and food to share for our usual after service hospitality.

I took a bunch of pictures from the inside of the church, but I don't feel good posting them yet. The insurance people still have to do their stuff, but really the images of the inside of the church are just too raw and heartbreaking. It just looked totally destroyed. I could see that underneath the soot and water damage, much of it could be restored. Material objects can be replaced.

Sorry for rambling, I am still in a bit of shock and processing all of it.

Please keep our church and community in your thoughts and prayers.
Peace,
Dan

EDIT--Thank you to everyone for your good wishes and prayers. This is a wonderful community. We will surely recover and rebuild--it's just a question of time and energy. We've been here for 134 years and we plan to be here in 134 more.

And thank you even to the wise asses. I wouldn't expend the energy to be hurt by your words, just amused at most. I invite you to show your comments to your mother or grandmother--perhaps they will be even more entertained."

I feel like the way wifi is handled was set up by a freshman intern. Say I'm walking around listening to music, wifi's on but there's nothing to connect to so it uses cellular data. I go into a building where I have wifi, but I didn't need anything from my phone till later, eventually noticing that I feel like I have a lit cigarette in my pocket and pull out my scorching phone. Turn the screen on, THEN it connects to the wifi network, after killing my battery trying to connect to a distantly receptive cell network beyond the building walls.

My question: If it can try so hard to stay connected to a cellular network, is it so hard to scan for known wifi networks to connect to periodically? Why do I have to turn on the screen for it to connect to wifi? I'm sure Tasker or something can handle this, but it's such a silly issue to have to deal with. Am I missing something?"

123ayn,14,2012-10-25,"37 years old, surprise pregnancy, a little (a lot) freaked out. (x-post from r/mommit)",MrsAnthropy,BabyBumps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/123ayn/37_years_old_surprise_pregnancy_a_little_a_lot/,"Hi, ladies. Bear with me here. My mind is all over the place.

So I've spent the past few years under the (apparently mistaken) impression that I would not be able to get pregnant again. I have a variety of issues with my ladyparts which, at this point don't really matter because I am now 5 weeks pregnant. I have an appointment with an OB November 9th. My husband has already offered to have a vasectomy. He and my daughter want another baby. I was on the fence (pregnancy was difficult for me), but since I didn't think it was possible, I had pretty much accepted that and was ready to move on with my career and focus on our family of three being happy, healthy, and probably traveling a lot.

There are multiple other situations complicating my feelings about this pregnancy. One is that I have miscarried at least a couple of times since having my daughter over three years ago, so of course I worry about that. But I did not miss a period by much in the past. A pregnancy that I lost in January was confirmed through a biopsy I had a few months ago. I kind of ""felt"" that I was pregnant, but had not gotten a positive pregnancy test.

Second is that I'm currently finishing graduate school. I would graduate in the beginning of June, and my due date would be June 30th. My plan was to adjunct at a couple of colleges while I worked my way into a full-time faculty position. With those benefits, my husband could go back to school and get his master's degree. I don't know what the possibility of that is now, because someone will need to be with the baby once it's born (assuming all goes well), and at this point, we can't afford for either of us to stay home. 

Our three-year-old daughter is in preschool right now while I complete teaching internships and we can't afford it. We're broke, broke, broke. Robbing Peter to pay Paul and all that jazz. We don't qualify for assistance because my internship and level of education are not considering ""necessary."" 
We live in a big, expensive city with progressive people. Our family lives in a small, affordable city with conservative values. I like raising my daughter in a place with so many opportunities and such great public transportation. If we moved back ""home"" for help from family (and for our dollars to stretch farther), I would feel like we're giving up quite a bit on culture and opportunities for everyone. But we know no one here. All my schoolmates are ten years younger than me, single, no kids. 

So, another thing I worry about is applying for ""real"" jobs (in either city) when I'm obviously pregnant and then getting turned down as a result. I'm also concerned about the upcoming holidays. I am very, very short and, as with my last pregnancy, am beginning to show already. There's no way I'll be able to hide it when I'm trying to apply for jobs, and I'm not sure I will be able to keep it under wraps before the first trimester is over. 

I keep saying ""if all goes well,"" because, you know, I'm 37 years old, so to add another layer to my quiet panic is the potential that something could come up in tests. 

God. I am kind of a mess right now. Sorry about all of this. I guess I'm just asking for general advice, suggestions, good vibes, whatever anyone wants to share. I'm scared and worried. Thanks, ladies. 

**ETA**: Initially, I wondered if I should post here or /r/mommit and went there initially since I hadn't subscribed to /r/babybumps until today. So here I am!"
1237mr,6,2012-10-25,I got no one to talk to so I decided to post my story here,cambf,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1237mr/i_got_no_one_to_talk_to_so_i_decided_to_post_my/,"It makes me sad to post here but I have nobody to talk to and I need to express myself.

I'm currently 22 and I grew up in a country that suffers from racism issues. Because of these I have developped some sort of social phobia because people like to pick on me for what I look like with mean jokes. I also got hit on and robbed many times because they clearly said that people of my kind are not accepted here.
However, I live with that and I got only one friend that knows what's up because we grew up together in the same conditions.

My family doesn't care about how I feel. My parents have never asked how I feel since my birth. And the whole family got severly torn apart since the death of my father a few years ago. Things got worse and worse and now we only communicate in a conflictual way. But nobody is here to admit it. We all know it but we do as if everything was fine.

A few years ago. I made a huge loan to pay my studies that I have to refund in 2013. However I also financed some personnal projects that have all failed by now.

By the end of 2011, I was a student with only one friend I signed up in a new school and everything looked promising for the future but it got a lot worse.

Like a lot of people on internet, I enjoy pornography however I took it to the next level some years ago. I started going on live sex networks and paying performers just to get my dose of pornography. Everything was fine until I stumbled onto that specific woman.

I don't know how but I saw something special in her. Obviously I paid her and I really enjoyed her shows. But quickly I developped some sort of addiction to her. I was just falling in love.

At the same time I started classes in my new school but right away they start to mess up (our very first class got cancelled). But this is how it was supposed to go: I go to classes etc. and after half a year I have to work as an intern in a company. But the days were very intense, I was spending literally 12 hours per day at school.
During winter I wasn't even seeing the sunlight, it was night in the morning while I go to school and when I get out it was night again.

When I get back home I was trying to talk to that woman I was falling in love with. Everything was fine even though school made it difficult. Right after new year's eve she decided to quit her job. And this is where I realized that I was in love. I asked her to tell me what she thinks about me and if she wants to take our relationship further. She replied she would love it and she added me on her MSN/Skype friendlists.

During two weeks everything was good. I was talking to a new woman that had nothing to do with pornography and I really loved it. My best friend was telling me that 2012 is the year where all the bullshit will stop and things will start improving for both of us. I was believing him.

But then she decided to go back there in a new studio (she doesn't work at home) and things started to get complicated. I was seeing her saying the same things she tells me to other men. I was seeing my girlfriend being called a bitch and both of us had to be okay with it because this is her job. Even though it was complicated I was okay with that because I know at the end of the day it was all fake.

However, in March, she completely disappeared and I was worried, I didn't have anything besides her MSN/Skype and she wouldn't show up. I realized that I completely changed. I was so in love with ther that I no longer live for my own freedom but I live for her. Everything I wanted to do in the past has become an optional interest she is my only priority. Anyway, I waited for almost two weeks and she showed up announcing me that she got her laptop robbed. At this point things started to be hellish for me.

We had to maintain our relationship while she worked at her job through private messaging. But at the same time classes ended and I had to find an internship and at the same time. Old customers (that she befriended with) started to be overwhelming (they can't stop calling her beautiful etc. knowing that she was dating me) however I let her do whatever she wants I think she can handle men she has to deal with that everyday. I find it really disrespectful especially when the guy knows she's dating me but I just don't want to annoy her with that. I tried to take it as best as I could.

I was planning to buy her a computer with my internship revenue. However, I've never found the internship. It was the most important thing because I planned to save all of it and go to her country (there is an ocean between us and only plane can make us physically meet each other) and meet her but I've failed. Maybe I could have found it, I had so many reasons to find it, my studies, my relationship ... but I've failed. My studies can't continue because I was running out of funds from my loan and I had to refund it the next year anyway.

In May, she disappeared again and end in another studio however she hid it to me. She told me she was working as an assistant. I asked her to give me her phone because I don't want to be worried about her disappearing anymore and she did so. However calling her gave away what she was actually doing (I heard the sounds). And I started to stalk the live sex websites once again and I found her. She said she was sorry and she didn't want me to see her as a slut. I forgave her and asked her not to lie anymore.

At this point I was just trying to find a temp job anywhere that could allow me to work for a short time and then do everything I planned to do with her. But guess what ... I couldn't.

In July, she had financial problems because she wanted to go back to school however she needed a bit of cash that she couldn't find. I naturally helped her with the last digits of my account balance. I was glad that she was getting back to school. It made me feel that I accomplished something good in my life that I may have contributed to the happiness of that person and obviously it's always a pleasure to help out the woman I love.

In August, she changed studio once again but this time she didn't lie to me. And here starts the next level of pain. At this point it has been 7 months that we're dating and I watch her getting naked for other men but this time she worked in another website and it made things a lot more difficult. We had many conversations about her job. I tried to take it as best as I could but sometimes it's too much for me to handle. She keeps telling me that she only does it for money and that I don't have to worry. She even told me that she's sorry that I have to go through that. (FYI she lives in a poor country and apparently she can only afford doing that job)

In September, we got in many problems, she started giving her body away. Setting cheap prices for shows or even free showing. Then she started watching other men fapping for free and I was watching her enjoying it. She tried to make me feel better about it but I can't live with that it's starts to be to much for me. I talked to her about a new plan.

I told her that I will stop searching a temp job (I gave up anyway) and I will look for a bigger job and split my salary with her in order to buy her freedom. She was okay with it.

But by the end of the month she started bringing a colleague. Who happens to be a man and they started to work together and they do some sort of foreplaying in front of everyone. I immediately called her saying that I won't accept it but she refuses to listen to me and she kept doing it.

I literally harassed her on the phone but she refused to talk because of the language barrier. She prefers to talk by typing. However it's nearly impossible to do so besides her work. Obviously I got really mad and I said I don't want her anymore.

However, when things got cooler in my mind I realized that I love her way too much to quit her. I tried to get back to her but she literally changed.

She admitted what she did was bad (apparently she thought it was okay during the moment because the guy was gay) but well ... she doesn't want me anymore. I tried to tell her that I forgive her if she doesn't do it again. She said she won't do it again but we're no longer in a relationship. After every efforts I made for her, I couldn't let that happen. I know it's very dumb but I think I'm an idiot and love is stupid.

In the same moment my best friend got a crush he met while playing Guild Wars 2 and he constantly talks to me of how things are getting better with his crush while actually things are getting worse in my relationship. I tried to avoid talking to him because it's very irritating. Even though I told him that it's absolutely not the topic to talk about he replied with life ain't cool and I have to deal with it. That's an ass move in my opinion but I try to talk to him because he happens to be the only person I can talk to.

I talked many times with my ""girlfriend"" but I seem to annoy her. She answer with simple things like yes hmmm yes hmmm while she is enjoying other men. For the few times she actually said things to me she said that our relationship is way too difficult. She refuses to tell me if she loves me or not but she stated that I'm the man of her dreams. I'm really confused but I thought that the fights were just too fresh to I gave her some time alone.

In the meantime I decided to ask the bank if I can get more funds in order to buy a flight to her country and make our relationship ""easier"" (obviously I lied to them and told them it was for my studies) but they asked for proofs so it's basically impossible to do get the funds. Since then I've been regretting going to my new school just to fail because it happens that the money I gave them would have been enough to do many trips to see her.

Recently we talked again and she said the same things. I'm important to her but it's too hard and she doesn't want us to suffer. I tried to explain her that I love her and that I will suffer more if she refuses me. But she tries to change topic. I don't know what to believe but my heart wants to believe that there's still a chance.

I called my best friend to book him a day to go with me to a convention. But he refused because it's holidays and his crush might be available. He told me that it's hard to see her (they live ~30min away) to me who dreamed about seeing my girlfriend in real for almost a year now. I told him that and he said that I have to forget her etc. I find it really stupid from him.

Today my ""girlfriend"" said that she likes her job sometimes (a job that she hated in the past) and she decided to make her room private but I'm not in the party. And who knows what's happening right now.

I don't understand how in a span of a few days she literally changed. She was a lovely woman and now she acts like a regular cam whore. I don't know if everything was fake or anything. I want to find out but in the meantime I suffer so much.

I know that I look like a dumb fuck for dating her but she's the sweetest thing I've ever met in my life she doesn't do only bad things and I believe she is a great woman outside of her job or at least she used to. You can tell me there are better women and I will believe you but I don't see them. My heart loves that specific woman I believed it was one of the few good things in my life and I tried everything to stick to it. I'm really ashamed to talk about this story but here I did it.

I don't wanna talk to my best friend or to anyone because it happens that everybody I counted on is now just gone doing theirs respective businesses. I'm literally lonely and I don't like to say it but I cried. When my tears stopped dropping I wrote this. Just to make me feel better.

I didn't think all of this would happen in the beginning of this year but now I'm convinced that things will always get worse and worse in my life. I don't want to live with such expectations but I have a little hope deep inside that everything is going to be fine for me.

So here I am I don't know what to do. I have to find a job to pay my loan but why would I do that anyway she's my only reason to live. All I've ever wanted is to be happy and it's too much apparently. It's been months that I say that but my only remaining pleasure in my life is video games and eating junk food and I guess this is what I'm gonna do right now. If you read it all, I would like to thank you. And it makes me feel a lot better to know that someone, somewhere knows what I've been through this year."

122eto,34,2012-10-25,"37 years old, surprise pregnancy, a little (a lot) freaked out. ",MrsAnthropy,Mommit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/122eto/37_years_old_surprise_pregnancy_a_little_a_lot/,"Hi, ladies. Bear with me here. My mind is all over the place.

So I've spent the past few years under the (apparently mistaken) impression that I would not be able to get pregnant again. I have a variety of issues with my ladyparts which, at this point don't really matter because I am now 5 weeks pregnant. I have an appointment with an OB November 9th. My husband has already offered to have a vasectomy. He and my daughter want another baby. I was on the fence (pregnancy was difficult for me), but since I didn't think it was possible, I had pretty much accepted that and was ready to move on with my career and focus on our family of three being happy, healthy, and probably traveling a lot.

There are multiple other situations complicating my feelings about this pregnancy. One is that I have miscarried at least a couple of times since having my daughter over three years ago, so of course I worry about that. But I did not miss a period by much in the past. A pregnancy that I lost in January was confirmed through a biopsy I had a few months ago. I kind of ""felt"" that I was pregnant, but had not gotten a positive pregnancy test.

Second is that I'm currently finishing graduate school. I would graduate in the beginning of June, and my due date would be June 30th. My plan was to adjunct at a couple of colleges while I worked my way into a full-time faculty position. With those benefits, my husband could go back to school and get his master's degree. I don't know what the possibility of that is now, because someone will need to be with the baby once it's born (assuming all goes well), and at this point, we can't afford for either of us to stay home. 

Our three-year-old daughter is in preschool right now while I complete teaching internships and we can't afford it. We're broke, broke, broke. Robbing Peter to pay Paul and all that jazz. We don't qualify for assistance because my internship and level of education are not considering ""necessary."" 
We live in a big, expensive city with progressive people. Our family lives in a small, affordable city with conservative values. I like raising my daughter in a place with so many opportunities and such great public transportation. If we moved back ""home"" for help from family (and for our dollars to stretch farther), I would feel like we're giving up quite a bit on culture and opportunities for everyone. But we know no one here. All my schoolmates are ten years younger than me, single, no kids. 

So, another thing I worry about is applying for ""real"" jobs (in either city) when I'm obviously pregnant and then getting turned down as a result. I'm also concerned about the upcoming holidays. I am very, very short and, as with my last pregnancy, am beginning to show already. There's no way I'll be able to hide it when I'm trying to apply for jobs, and I'm not sure I will be able to keep it under wraps before the first trimester is over. 

I keep saying ""if all goes well,"" because, you know, I'm 37 years old, so to add another layer to my quiet panic is the potential that something could come up in tests. 

God. I am kind of a mess right now. Sorry about all of this. I guess I'm just asking for general advice, suggestions, good vibes, whatever anyone wants to share. I'm scared and worried. Thanks, ladies. 

**Edit** Thanks to everyone for your kind words and suggestions. I've been busy at work, but it's been nice to occasionally check reddit and see a pleasant message from someone throughout the day. I will crosspost to /r/babybumps!"

I'm a 26/F Canadian and my boyfriend is 22/M American.

To start of let me tell you about  our background. We're both gamers. We met at an MMO-RPG game back in 2009. We've been friends since, we helped each other through issues in life like school, weight, work and so on. I think we have a pretty good relationship.

He came to visit me and I got him a part time job while he's visiting me to keep him occupied while I'm doing my internship. I used to work at this workplace too and I still go around there to help once in a while. 

Around the end of September, he started getting sneaky with his phone, he usually just lets me play apps on it and doesn't hide himself. I got suspicious, then he comes home late one night and tells me he was out with a 17/F from work. This happens again a week later. I was miffed and uncomfortable already as he used to tell me everything then just nothing now. He gets annoyed easily too.

One night we're out downtown with a friend, 17/F joins us late at friend's place. I know she knows that he and I are together, people know at work and my friend told her too. When she comes over, she only pays attention to him, flirts with him and is touchy. Granted Ive also had a bit of alcohol that night, I was upset. I got mad at him and her and walked out. 

I saw texts between them too that are flirty, provocative and teasing. I got mad at him for doing it. I was crying at this point and asked him to be honest with me, as his bestfriend, I wouldn't stand in the way of something he wants. But he stayed.. He's still flirting with her.. She's still flirting back even after she told me they were just friends and nothing would happen.

What should I do? Do I just leave him? He lies all the time, I can spot the lies, i think. But what about the girl?  I'm at the end of my patience and wits. 

TLDR: 22/m flirts despite of 26/f hurt feelings."
121e2b,261,2012-10-24,One Year Report,ArdentDrive,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/121e2b/one_year_report/,"It’s been a year since I masturbated.

Reflecting on the past year has put much into perspective. Thanks to occasional journal entries and posts to this forum, I can see both my growth and my shortcomings, my aspirations and my letdowns. Most importantly, this type of perspective gives me intuition into what type of goals I should set for the future and how to conduct myself to achieve them.

I’m writing here today to share with you what I've gotten out of it so far, what I have not gotten out of it, and what my experience-adjusted goals for the future are. 

**One Year Ago**

To give you an idea of my progress, I’ll summarize where I started.

I cut out masturbation a year ago at age 22. I was a college dropout living at my parents’ house, I was getting paid poorly for some part-time remote web consulting jobs, I was in a draining relationship with a needy girl, and I felt a general sense of boredom and lacking. I’d get off to Internet porn 4 to 7 times a week, and have sex about half as often. In bed, I’d sometimes go limp during and have to stop. I didn't really think it was an issue because it didn't happen all the time.

I joined NoFap not because I thought my porn habits were a problem, but because I felt directionless, stagnant, and as if I were becoming complacent with my mediocre situation. I knew NoFap wouldn't be a magic bullet when I started, but it felt like a “first step.” I just needed some direction to move in, to see where I could go from there. Anything was better than wasting my early twenties in my parents’ house with an unstable job and an unstable girl.

**What I've Done**

Briefly and chronologically:

* I left the consulting gigs and got a real internship.
* I moved out of my parents’ to the city.
* I dumped the needy girl and started playing the field.
* I re-applied to college and was accepted.
* I met a smart hottie and started dating her.
* My internship offered me a full-time job.
* I turned down the job offer to go back to college, where I am now to finish my undergrad.

I don't attribute these events to abstaining from masturbation. NoFap helped catalyze them though -- especially the women-related ones. Here’s a deeper look.


**General Physiological Changes**

The best way I can describe what I've given myself by not fapping is a mild discomfort in my stomach and chest (like “butterflies”). It grows when I’m not accomplishing things, expressing myself, exerting my body and mind, being social, or leading. Sorry if this sounds a little eastern.

I’d previously get this feeling only rarely, and usually when I felt threatened or embarrassed. I thought it was a bad feeling. I’d suppress it, thinking I was taking the “high road.” I'm convinced that my numbness from a year ago was largely due to my automatic suppression of this feeling. 

Not jacking it made that feeling so strong I couldn't possibly suppress it all with my mind. So I followed advice I read on this subreddit: I (clumsily) ran, did push-ups, and focused on hobbies. I started making music again, writing, and throwing myself out there at parties more.

Somewhere along the line I realized all that is the point. Suppressing that light stomach-chest feeling feels like fear. Channeling that feeling into whatever I choose is exciting, empowering, and gives me focus.

**Vocal Changes**

There are a lot of excitable guys in this subreddit claiming miracles. But the change in voice is real.

Not only is my voice a little deeper, I wield it with more articulation and precision. Listening to and practicing some of the material in Roger Love's Vocal Power helped. I have less stress and tension in my body, so my vocal chords are more relaxed and able to speak with ease.

I've been putting my voice to use recently. I was asked to announce a large annual regatta, with 3000+ attendees. I did, and it led to plenty of compliments and an offer to announce an even larger one. I'd like to develop my voice and public speaking more. I'm thinking about joining my local chapter of Toastmasters International to do so. This is something I probably wouldn't be pursuing if NoFap hadn't let me see this skill I have.

**Creativity and Spontaneity**

I picked my music back up, and have been working on an album due out whenever I feel like it. I started writing a blog about my university that’s gaining popularity (and authors) on campus.

I second-guess myself less. I've found my first thought is usually right. And when it's wrong, I can correct myself with grace. One trick I've been actively practicing is just saying a thought out loud as soon as I have it. No thinking about saying it, deciding if I’m going to say it, or waiting for the moment to say it. This might be contrary to the popular advice “think before you speak”, but when I do it, I often find people agreeing with me. Maybe that advice is just for those prone to poor wording.

**Sex**

In my [Six Month Report](http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/t3pbi/6_month_report), I mentioned that my problem of occasionally going to half-mast had decreased from once a week to once a month or so. Now, I can say that I never have this problem.

I have sex only with my girlfriend, and it’s still exciting. I've pushed her for a threesome, which she’s tentatively agreed to. She understandably has reservations, which I hope to assuage. I probably never would have even asked if I were still watching porn.

And just to cover all the bases, what I mentioned 6 months ago holds true: my stamina, passion, ability, and virility in bed have increased tenfold since starting this journey.

**Women**

My buddy and I were drinking some beers and cooking some t-bones. At a silence, I told him “I'm jealous of you, man.”

“Why's that?” he asked.

“Because you're single. You can have sex with any girl you can charm and seduce. We're at college, and all the benefits of bachelorhood are yours.”

“Yeah, but I’m jealous of you” he responded. “You have a smoking hot girl with an amazing personality who you can bang any time you want, without working for it.”

After a moment's contemplation, we clinked our bottles and moved on to something else.

That conversation has probably played out millions of times, but it's a perfect anecdote for my dilemma. Sure, my girlfriend has an amazing personality. She’s in love with me. She’s got my back and is always there when I’m down (or otherwise). Plus, my buddy wasn't lying about her looks. I got her with energy and drive that NoFap helped provide me.

Maybe it’s a grass-is-always-greener situation. But I miss the titillation of meeting new girls and seducing them that I was having closer to the beginning of NoFap. So much that I flirt with other girls as much as I can without hurting my girlfriend or making her jealous. It’s still not the same though. Believe it or not, I actually miss the surge of having no sexual release for four or more days.

I feel like I'll have to make a decision before too long: I'll either end things with this amazing girl because I’m young and desperately want to feel the intensity of being a completely free man; Or I'll make a bigger commitment to her, have a stable loving grounding in my life, and always wonder if I settled.

NoFap has helped keep my relationship vibrant, but it has also kept me looking at other options.

**Men**

I've noticed for the first time other guys looking up to me and watching what I do for guidance. It’s led me to a leadership role on my sports team at college. It’s extra pressure, but instigating camaraderie in others in worth it. I’m more outwardly focused, which projects confidence. I find it easier to relate to other guys and build friendships. It’s just a matter of willingness to do so, which I have more of now.

**The Future**

NoFap is here to stay. Porn and masturbation are out. I like who I am now a lot better than who I was a year ago. I want to continue to improve myself in all aspect of my life.

I didn't meet all the goals I laid out for myself after starting NoFap.

I didn't “become a force” in my company during my internship, but I left a good impression and accomplished several large projects.

I didn't “make the most of city living,” but I moved to the city, explored some nightlife, and made some friends.

I didn't build the huge entourage I had envisioned, but I expanded my social circle and made connections.

I didn't achieve a zen-like clear mind, but I'm generally more purposeful and decisive.

In another year, I hope look back on my personal growth and again see obvious improvements. NoFap is clearly part of a balanced and accomplished life.

I may not have become the impregnable force I had hoped for, but I've improved myself gradually and distinctly in so many ways.

Here’s to always doing.

*It was an image, an illusion of myself.*

I rode the train and bus home now, unable to keep the past and the present from blending together. The roads could become quite the callous place when you didn't know which cars are really there, and which cars were there in some moment before.

*Another me. Three mes. A dozen. Fifty. A hundred, even. All in one space, all going about their day; a different day in different times, in different hours.*

It wouldn't happen if I didn't know the route. You can't remember something that never happened. The only way to live safely was to keep every day new, fresh. To not be trapped in a place where my memories ran rampant in my mind. To start forming new memories instead of trying to live comfortably.

*There I was chatting up a girl who had moved to a different firm. In another instance, I was talking to a former boss who had passed away; the intern who was brutally murdered; the manager who was fired for his inadequacy. All in the same space, speaking in a tangled mess of voices and gestures. My reactions varied as well, it was a horrible sight.*

I would wake up, and see myself wake up. Once, twice, three times, four. Ten. Each time, I wondered if I was still dreaming, never sure when I had actually gotten out of bed. I found that doing something new always helped me snap back into reality: a cup of water this morning, juice another-fuck, I got so desperate I even drank alcohol one morning because the memories were starting to converge again. Anything to get myself out of the loop.

*He wants you to rally the people.*

Rallying...not the kind of rallying a team gets before a sport. The type of rallying a squad gets before a war. It was perfect, so they had assured me. Each person in this city: all their secrets and hopes and dreams were all available in some shape or another. Interviews. Diaries. Vlogs. All these people, normal and regular: unremarkable and naive. I would approach all of them as a friend, and they would have no manner of doubting me as I knew so much about them. About this event and that milestone: the breakup, the promotion, the divorce, the death in the family. I worked in a law firm, but the boss-man had made arrangements for me. No one was to see or open the documents I was to ""work on"", and in return, people got more hours for their vacations. It seems silly, but it worked.

For two years, I read accounts of peoples lives for hours on end. The new home, the college-bound princess, the homeless-bound man. All their grief, all their sorrow, their joy, their happiness; this man had somehow managed to acquire it all and compose it in a journal-like book for me to read and dissect. What were their fears? Their aspirations? Their struggles and challenges in their lives? I was to be a savior, a messiah amongst the masses-ready to save them from the terrors of everyday life and the meaninglessness their lives had acquired in the recent years.

I took a taxi home this time. It was one of the few options remaining. His name was Parsa: a 32 year old Indian man from Mombasa, who had moved to the states so he could start saving up to bring his wife and kids away from his tyrannical family back at home. His wife, Nimrita, was 29 and of a different *jati*-some kind of caste subsystem if I interpreted right. They had two children: a baby girl named Jagdeep and an older boy named Divya. We drove to my home in perfect silence, all this had been from the file.

I didn't realize how much I had actually remembered from the accounts. I didn't know I paid so much attention to detail in general. Once I knew the man's name, I felt like he was a true friend. Like we had been this close for years. I wondered why this never happened with any of the others when I asked or figured out their names. ""Maybe because..."" I preferred not to say it. I could tell the man was depressed: clearly, this was not working out well, he must be making a small sum, not nearly enough to fetch his family from back home. ""It isn't going to become any easier friend"", I told him as I left the car and walked inside. He stayed parked in my driveway for a few minutes before he left."
1253ip,0,2012-10-26,[m] My story of going down the spiral into experimentation....and losing it all ,[deleted],gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/1253ip/m_my_story_of_going_down_the_spiral_into/,"While I love a good sex story, I felt the need to tell my own. The sidebar said stories can be sexy, funny, or whatever. I'm afraid this fits the ""whatever"" category.....not a throwaway account because-everyone important to me knows anyway.

My story began by just sneaking to look at Dad’s “books.” I remember him saying he read them for the articles (one time citing the hostage situation as to why he was reading them; I didn’t realize Penthouse or Playboy had first hand journalism in the Hostage situation and even as a kid-I didn't buy that). At times, I would catch a glimpse, but more often than not, he would berate me if I wanted to see them. I began to view this as “privileged” access. Why could Dad do this, and I couldn’t? What was he hiding? Why was he hiding it? Why would he do it right in front of me (view this material) and not share it with me? I recall him putting a pictorial type of page record that came as a bonus from his magazine once and put it on the record player and put me to bed for a nap. I don’t know what was on it, but Mom wasn’t home, I do know that much. And he wanted me out of the picture to listen to whatever was on it. I don’t recall where my sister was during this time, perhaps with my mother. I found one of his books under the couch mattress and left it there to revisit in the middle of the night. I remember a few nights sneaking out there to visit this particular magazine. Curiosity was clearly what drove me to it. I had to be 6 or so. I do not recall getting aroused, but I do recall it driving my curiosity further and further into wondering what was going on in this pictures.

My Father was into Racing, Rock and Roll, and Fishing. So, I was too. I recall a couple fishing trips and a couple trips to a local racetrack and I remember him giving me my first Hot Rod magazine. As you may or may not know, these were not “dirty” magazines per say, but these were filled with scantily or seductively clad women positioned on or near the cars. I don’t recall actually “thinking” these exact words but I somehow viewed this as my first “magazine”—Dad let me have one of my own now. One particular picture was not even of a scantily clad woman. She had a black dress on with a slit up the leg and she had high black boots. She was positioned next to a Coupe of some kind. Her legs and the boots somehow turned me on—it was enticing to see her teasing nature and just a bit of bare skin on her thigh to show the adventure side (and I was 7 or 8). I was laying on my stomach on my bed looking at this particular picture and noticed as I moved I was enjoying the sensation it brought. I proceeded to do this until I had an orgasm (not yet producing any kind of fluid). This new experience was euphoric, and not knowing the nature of how bodies worked, I tried it immediately again. I thought “this will be my new secret world of pleasure-where I will go when I want.” I told myself I would do this every night all night long it felt so good. But I noticed after doing it, I wouldn’t want to right away again. The body had to recover and I was young of course. I formulated a fantasy around this time in my head of a woman who looked somewhat similar to this Hot Rod girl. I would call her “The Sexar” in my mind, not knowing what exactly that meant or anything. I pictured her in a room that seemed almost lab/dungeon like wearing the boots and seductive dress—after that the fantasy got foggy—Im not even sure I pictured any particular act of any kind—just pleasure coming from this person to me. Very metaphorical at this point because I didn’t actually know what sex was.

As the years would progress, masturbation had become a daily occurrence at bedtime. I would use it to prepare for sleep. Usually only during this time. I had sucked my thumb since birth and was still doing so at this age. Braces/orthodontics at age 12 would eliminate that. I hadn't viewed porn much but would whenever I had the chance. I just didn't have many chances. My folks divorced around this time and my practices evolved a bit from here.

I still masturbated frequently, but with new material as I got into my teen years. My mother was gone a lot (was a night waitress) and if I wasn't at my grandparents house I was being quite nosy looking for things in her room, wondering what I would find. Well, I struck gold.  I found some dildos and a black video tape. This video tape would reveal a dubbed porn movie. I would watch this with much intrigue and curiosity. This was the first time I had encountered homosexual sex between women.  Often I would masturbate, rewind it to the same place, and then hide it where I found it. As far as I know, she didn't know about this. Getting in to my teen years, masturbation to this new avenue (her video) would become the default if I could get it. If not, I would look at lingerie ads or think of what I had seen at bedtime and do it mentally.

I had very little contact with my Father during my teen years, and I let this absence fuel a lot of my anger, loneliness, and depression. When I did see him, I would be plagued with mixed emotions, not knowing exactly what to feel. I do remember a few times  I would try to steal from his porn or view it if possible and feel “entitled to do so” under the precedent that he was a shitty father. The least I could get was a decent porn magazine or video. I recall keeping a lot of bikini clad girls on my walls at this time—and being more bold about it. I had started trading porn pictures with a guy on my school bus and got caught looking at them by some girls on the bus. I was then brought in to the principals office and chastised with gentle but firm reminders. Id stopped caring how my mother thought (and she didn't voice much concern at all). She had walked in on me masturbating once I think and chastised me (my memory is foggy here) but it didn't stop me from continuing. I recall for a short time keeping pages and pictures inside a jar next to my bed, and some under my mattress. For some reason, I thought this was the magic place that parents never look. Now that I’m a parent, I know differently. I look back now and am almost certain Mom knew this stuff was there but never talked to me about it.

College kept a silent pattern of masturbating although not much use of pornography—only a few times did I sneak to rent certain “top shelf” movies from a local video store. Each time, like when I was younger, I would swear to never do it again and make an emotional vow to God to never do this again.

I experimented some with making out and “grinding” sessions with certain girlfriends (always having a girlfriend or girl I was hanging with) and even with oral a few times, but I did not like it and felt very uncomfortable doing it as I vowed to not have sex until I got with my wife. Most of my girlfriends didn't last long and usually it would end with me” trading up” to the next girl. Only a few times did they break up with me and if they did, I was happy about it to move on to the next fling. I recall turning at least 4 girls down when they asked me to penetrate them. I had not been to any bookstores, parlors or anything of the like except a strip club before college only a few times (2 or 3) and this was with some friends from high school.

The summer before my junior year of college, I lived in an apartment with a guy. During this time, I would be private about my masturbating but would use the phone for phone sex using my phone card. I ran up hundreds of dollars while masturbating and laying alone in my room, quickly hanging up after I had an orgasm, then feeling guilty about doing so. I recall one night burning with passion in my room wanting a woman so bad, I, even being a Christian man, spoke the words of asking the devil to provide a girl to me for my sexual needs at that moment then he could have my soul. I said “make a woman to please me right here and you can have me-I want to get laid so bad.” But no woman came, only vacant masturbatory fantasy and absence in my heart. I am a spiritual man, and often wonder what this actual conversation did to open the doors of evil in years to come.

One night at work, things changed. A woman came on to me at work. I was not attracted to this woman at all, but I knew she craved me like a piece of meat and for some reason, this tempted me. She would make flippant comments and make gestures of sexual nature in my eyesight. One night, she invited me to her house to get drunk. So I went. And I acted physically with her outside of intercourse but in sexual ways (fondling, making out etc). I felt guilty and shameful leaving her home telling her I would never be back. But I did go back, more than once. I can recall 3 or 4 more times of hooking up, these times for sex and quick exits happened each time (once with her giving me money). I thought to myself how I could make money in this way, but never pursued it after this). I felt shameful and disgusted by my actions.

I left on an internship, came back to finish college and got married. After my marriage, I was in a job that kept me in a private office for many many hours a day with no supervision. This new world of the internet opened doors I had never intended to open. Viewing and placing personal ads to see what would become of it. Viewing profiles, chatting with various women to get a deep emotional connection, all while my wife was trusting her husband was working hard to change the world. Within a year on the job, I had arranged a hook-up with one woman. I was told by her that she and her husband were swingers and that an open marriage was ok for them. She and I met in her hometown and she had a kid in the car seat in her car—I followed her back to her home and she put the kid down for a nap. We proceeded to her bedroom (pictures of her husband on the wall) and had sex. I did not have an orgasm but she did and I felt very guilty and dirty when I left.

This Monday I'll be interviewing for an internship position at a small mobile software development company. Right now I'm taking CSE214, I've taken 114 and 215. This is about the extent of the programming background that I have. I explained this to the employer and they still showed an interest in me.


I'm hoping that I can get this gig and gain programming experience on the job. To those students who have been in a similar position, can you offer any tips for a successful interview?

I'd be grateful."

I know the week is not yet over, but it has just completely gotten me down this morning and I figured this was the place to come and seek advice. 

The day I decided I was going to lose I weighed 222. Granted, I had been weighing in anywhere from 222-226. I am a female and I am so grossed out telling ya'll this. It's shameful.  

I have been working out 3-4 times per week. It's my senior year in college and I'm maxed out at 16 hours of class, I work two jobs, one during the day, and one at night, doing an internship, and volunteering at an assisted living facility. It is extremely difficult to work out more than that. 

My typical workout includes 30-40 minutes on the Arc-trainer(depending on when/if I have to work that night), usually level 4 but in the past week I bumped it up to 5, which burns 400-500 calories; 10 minutes doing hill intervals on the bike; and 10 minutes walking/running on the treadmill. 45-50 minutes of cardio per day, no weight-lifting.  

I eat anywhere between 1,000 - 1,600 calories per day. Diet, diet, diet, everything low-cal, absolutely no sugar or sweets. I zig-zag to keep the weight loss going. My current weight is 206. I am 5'10. I started dieting/exercising August 22. I know losing 16 pounds is not a small amount by any means, but I am so god damn frustrated that I am ready to scream. I cried this morning to my boyfriend who has lost 25 pounds and I am not feeling any better.

I know a lot of it is water, and I have been drinking more to try and pee more often. How the hell do I get this fucking water out of my body without dehydrating myself?

If you have been in a situation like this, can you please offer me some advice to get over this plateau? I'll post a pic in a few of some befores and afters."

Inspiring Others to Inspire Others: Young male who wants to become a teacher and inspire young people but needs help to make it happen.,mgilder,Assistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/124dmo/transforming_one_person_at_time_inspiring_others/,"Hi Reddit World,

This is the first time I've posted anything on reddit. So I'm giving this a new shot. I'm Milton and I live in Durham, North Carolina. I graduated in 2009 from Duke University. After graduating, I worked in a variety non-profits and small businesses. Yet one thing I noticed in those three years, there was this endure excitement for young people and drawn to young people. I'm that alumnus who just won't leave college. Teaching was something that I've imagined myself doing. But it was a thought that was tucked away in the back of mind as a potential option. One evening in July I was thinking about becoming a teaching and thinking about ways to do it. I knew that Duke had a program and scholarship for Duke Alumni who are interested in teaching to join the teaching licensure program. I wasn't completely sure about doing the program but I took the plunge. I had nothing to lose. Within one week, I applied to the program, submitted a scholarship application, submitted transcripts, got a teacher recommendation, had an interview and got accepted to the program with scholarship. {Breaths hard - woosh} Case closed? I'm going to become a teaching? Nope. 

While my scholarship paid for most of my tuition expense, I still was required to pay a portion of my fees...no bigee...I can get a pell-grant - so I thought. I could get a pell-grant from the government for my teacher preparation program. Yet as I investigated more getting this money wasn't simple as submitting a FAFSA and receiving a check in the mail. Once I finally got in contact with the financial aid office at Duke they said that they would have to see if my program qualify for the funds since there are strict requirements to receive funds for a post-secondary teaching pell-grant. (NB: Most pell grants go to undergraduate students. A small portion goes to teacher who are seeking licensure/credential).

Weeks go by while Duke Financial Aid it communicating the US Department of Education. I'm chugging away at my education program (in which I'm doing really well @ about an A-minus/A average).

The news comes my program doesn't qualify for the pell-grant. Okay I'm sure I can look into other option to get the necessary funds. But now I'm left with a dilemma as I don't have personal funds - I've only made less than $25,00 since graduating - non-profits and starts biz don't pay much. So I attempt to apply for a SallieMae loan of course I didn't qualify as I don't have income or establish credit. And my parents don't make much. My mother is a single parent who makes half of what she made 10 years ago in CA. Okay that's not an option I think. Maybe I could get a job? Umm...I think about that...how are you going to get a job when between your classes, class work, required tutoring and internship - probably 60 hours a week or work - you don't have much time to rest? Yeah...that would be difficult. What I'm supposed to do when my program requires that I work full-time in the school without pay? Not sure about that. Plus I'm unable to receive additional fund from Duke since I'm not a degree seeking student (the scholarship I have is actually an agreement between the Education Department and Continuing Studies Office for a significant fee reduction) Given this situation, I'm unsure how will I support my personal basic living expenses. Do you see the dilemma/quandary?

Nonetheless, it is my desire to see that I complete this program no matter what and start teaching next school year. It is my desire to work with high school student to inspire them to reach their full potential. Eventually, I want to focus on economic development in developing countries. Specifically, working with young people (and marginalized people groups) doing leadership development and aid them to become entrepreneurs who contribute to their communities. I genuinely want to see the world around me transformed. Transformation begins with one person at time...first me. then my fellow human. the fellow human can impact others lives. and others can impact others. Let’s start a movement of seeing change and transformation in our world.

So I'm looking to raise $12000 for the cost of tuition, misc education cost, housing, food, gas, health, and misc. expenses for unexpected events. 

You can help two ways to begin seeing transformation in the world and in schools: (1) LIKE this post, (2) send me a message to learn more how you can donate. All donations are tax deductible since you would be sending the money directly to Duke University. If need be I can verify my acceptance to the program and my expenses...I also appreciate any comments of encouragement.

Thanks for taking the time to read this post.

Long time browser of reddit here. First time poster, though.

I wanted to reach out to you guys, because reddit has always been very helpful in providing me with advice, and pointing me in the right direction.

Here's my situation:

I'm returning to the USA in a couple weeks (US Citizen). I've been in India for the past two months helping my mother recover from a surgery. Before I left, I quit my marketing internship of 6 months, since I didn't know how long my mom would need my help (she's good now - she broke her clavicle and needed something minor done, but due to her age the doctor's were uncertain on how long her recovery would take).

Now that I'm coming back, I really want to live in LA. It's been my dream to live and work in LA since I was a kid. Additionally, I am extremely passionate about marketing and public relations, and am fortunate that LA is a hub for these fields. 

I've been desperately scouring online job boards for marketing opportunities, but I'm not having much luck.

If you guys have any advice on how I can get started in LA, I would greatly appreciate it!

A couple stats:

[UCSD Grad (2011) - Psychology - 3.7 Major GPA]
[Marketing Internship  - 6 Months - Lead generation, research, basic seo, basic html]
[Autism Lab Assistant - 6 Months - Subject prep, data collection, mass data compilation]

Fraternity leader all four years (President, VP, Chairman) - [&amp; Freshman, Sophomore, Junior, &amp; Senior of the Year awards]

I'm looking for something for the 2013 summer, but assume I should start looking immediately.

I've been recently learning and editing in Avid, and am also comfortable in FCP 7. Other than editing my personal short films and freelance concert videos, most of my experience is in live multi-camera production. Currently I'm working on live streaming productions for the Big Ten Network (as camera operator, audio, graphics, as well as utility work), and as playback operator for live sport board shows. I'm also currently training as a shader and technical director. Finally rounding out my 'official' experience is a production internship with a local news channel, where I am responsible for many of the same duties as with the BTN.

With all of this live production experience, my dream has always been to become an editor. Unfortunately, I'm having trouble finding a place to start. Could anyone point me in the direction of where I could look for a post production internship or any kind of assisting editing work? Does my current résumé put me in any kind of position to be considered for such work? What should I be doing?!?!

I just went threw a very traumatic point in my life. I've relied on friends and /r/breakups to get over this. I've never posted, I've just read and I've read a lot of ""we dated for six months and my life is ruined."" I understand your pain, guilt, sadness, anger, everything. I've been there. I know the feeling. It sucks. You go back to the dating websites that are dead ends, you hang around the bars and hope for some kind of strange to walk in so you can lift them off their feet for the night or you just sit and sulk about what could have been and why it's not. I see these issues as 1000, some kind of undergrad class that everyone HAS to take just because. It sucks, you do it, you forget it. It doesn't impact your life unless you want to impress someone because you can explain Boolean and Aristotle and that might get you laid. What I'm talking about is graduate level break ups. Ya know when you have a lease together, planning a life together, actually LIVE together not just ""oh we live together"" but ""WE live together."" We as in one. What's yours is mine and whats mine is yours kind of shit. Now that I think I've explained my shit theory, I'll go on with my story. I'll even to do a tl;dr because I'm drunk.

Here is my story: I met Girl Unit A through Friend Unit J. Girl Unit A and Friend Unit J are brother and sister. Myself and Girl Unit A hit it off immediately and start to form a solid friendship (this happened in 2010). Myself and Girl Unit A start dating. We become exclusive, friends and family recognize us as a couple, everything is golden. She stays in my apartment in Manhattan or I stay at her apartment in Brooklyn. Either way, we have things at each other places; it starts with a toothbrush, then an article of clothing and from then on it just blossoms. Fast forward two years. Relationship is still solid, together we have an apartment in East Village, we adopt dogs that we call our ""kids"" even after two years that honeymoon feeling is still there. After months of thinking and self doubting yourself you save up three months salary from your well paying internship and buy that ring. Ya know, THAT one. The holy grail of rings. You practice your lines over and over again; riding the subway, in a cab, the mirror, in the shower. You write them down and fix every little detail. Then the night comes, both of you are ACTUALLY free from work and school. You plan that special dinner at the Brazilian place on 9th avenue that you had your first date at. The bartender remembers you and makes you and her special drinks to celebrate a happy and healthy relationship. You eat, laugh, drink and you love. On the Q train home you hold hands and whisper how much you love each other and how life couldn't be the same without one another. Not much is said and that's fine, you just lock eyes and smile. Happiness. You clench onto the ring box in your jacket pocket, that hand has been in your pocket for 15 minutes now and it's dripping with sweat. You know a subway car is not the most romantic place, but the timing is right. You feel each other, you feel her life from your scalp to your toes. She feels you. Together you are one. Together we can take on the Red Army. At this point you're trying to beat the clock because you know something, somewhere can change that feeling. You inhale and exhale slowly. You casually get down on one knee and you pull out the ring. All of the lines you practiced come out perfect, the timing is perfect, everything for that 45 seconds is perfect. Your heart is racing, you're dripping in sweat, people on the the Q are watching and you wait. You see the look in her eyes, you're predicting the ""YES!"" followed by the kiss but you get ""No."" A dead serious ""No."" The moment is gone. You put the ring back in your pocket and ride the train back home in silence. Nothing is said the entire time. Both of you walk apart from each other, arms crossed at a face, speed walking pace. Nothing is said in your apartment that you have painted and designed together. You sleep in separate rooms for the first time since that one party. You replay every moment in your head over and over again. Eventually you pass out and when you wake up the next day all of her things are gone. The toothbrush, the clothes, the everything. The only note she leaves you is terms for a sublet. Friends and family have no idea where she is, you call her office and she's in a meeting and not able to take calls. You slowly start to realize this person is not in your life anymore and it's the most depressing feeling ever. After days of sulking and worrying she finally comes back to the apartment, not much is said you ask questions and she gives short answers. All you want is her touch, to embrace her but the only feeling you get is when she hands you the apartment key and your fingers lightly touch one another. That's when you know its over.

If you're wondering, I have the dogs. They're doing good. I know there is more missing but I'm drunk and I really want to watch horror movies right now.

**tl;dr** I proposed and I got rejected. 

**UPDATE** Still haven't heard from her and I haven't made any attempt to talk to her. The dogs are still doing well.

123mpp,5,2012-10-25,Girlfriend (20f) and I (21m) just broke up very suddenly.  Can someone help me understand what has just happened?,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/123mpp/girlfriend_20f_and_i_21m_just_broke_up_very/,"Ok. So let me first say that this was my first adult relationship.  I knew this girl before but we started dating ten months ago.

We both fell madly in love.  Always near each other.  This summer she had a summer internship in another state and I even managed to fly up and see here every two weeks.  Things we going beautifully!  This fall started rolling just perfectly.  I was still happy and so was she. Then the trouble.

Two weeks ago I decided to go back home from college to spend the weekend with my family and my Aunt visiting from out of state.  Upon returning, there was something of about her.  I kept asking what it was, but I could not get a straight answer.  Just ""I'm in a slump"".  I asked if it was me. ""No, its just school"".

Well that ""Its just school"" turned into ""I never see you anymore, you are too busy"".  To be fair, I am very busy.  I have an internship a job and tutoring amounting to around 35 hours a week plus five upper level college classes. So yes I am busy.  I thought I had made every opportunity to see her.  Apparently that wasn't enough.

Tuesday she was very upset with me for not spending enough time with her.  She also explained that she was in a slump because of me not spending enough time with her and because I no longer made her happy.  I was confused and very upset.  I asked if she wanted to be without me and expressed my want and need for her and that I love her.  After calming me down, we had a nice two days. Until this afternoon.

I was getting screwed over with car problems and frustrated.  After telling me she would come pick me up, she said that she could, but she was studying.  I took it as she was too busy studying to pick me up.  I got mad and called her selfish.  This is wrong of me.  And I apologized.  But it was not enough.

After pleading with her and begging with her to give me another chance, she told me that she could no longer be with me.  I explained that people in love give each other seconds chances and are understanding.  She explained to me that she had already been doing that and enough was enough.  I asked her to give me the weekend without me before she officially broke it off. She agreed.

Can someone explain what just happened to me and why she would act this way? Am I the bad guy? Is she a bad girlfriend? Should I just move on? I love this girl to piece and I feel like we are perfect together, but this sudden turn of events has been a dagger in the heart.  

Any questions I'll be happy to answer.

tl;dr: Girlfriend of perfection suddenly breaks it off. What happened?"

Any careers you wish you considered more instead, whether you would have paced exams slower or faster, companies you wish you left or wish you stayed with, would you have picked the same specialty track (if you're that far), and any other considerations.

I guess I feel like we get a lot of the same story on this page (college senior, x exams, x.xx gpa, internship or no internship, looking for personal advice on jobs), and it made me curious about the more experienced members of this subreddit.

Right now I'm taking a full course load with *difficult* classes, leading a very active campus club, and working an internship on a big political campaign. I have no time for anything. I'm sleep deprived, over-worked, and over-stressed. I've consumed so much red bull this semester that my heart palpitates constantly. And surprise- I'm not doing a good job at anything I'm trying to do.

This past week I bombed, and I mean **bombed**, every major assignment I had. I've spent many nights staying up until 4 or 5 just to study for one particularly difficult neuroscience class. It's a class I care about deeply. I've put more genuine effort to succeed in that class than any other aspect of my life. But, I'm at the bottom of the class and probably failing. I was hoping to make it into a top-ten cognitive science graduate school, but now I'm realizing I'm just not going to make it. I can't even complete everything I need to do, much less do a stellar job. I can only hope to pass.

I'm doing the best I can do, failing miserably, and hating the notion that it should be okay. It's not okay. I'm not the least bit happy with myself right now. Surely I'm not alone here... I've got to find a way to turn this around.

**tl;dr current graduate student at University of Texas considers going to Creative Circus instead**


I’m currently a graduate student at the University of Texas (AdGrad). 

…And I’m considering finishing out this first semester and transferring to the Creative Circus in Atlanta. 

It’s not that I’m having a hard time with grades. I’ve always made really good grades and I’m making A’s and B’s here so far. 

I was really worried about getting accepted into the portfolio program here, but even now, I don’t feel the same anxiety…maybe it is because I think there is a possibility that I may not even be here when portfolio courses start.

It was a culmination of things that stirred me into seeking more information about Creative Circus. 

* Required core classes are courses I’ve taken already because I majored in advertising, like media management and research 

* Taking these classes costs me three times more than when I took them in undergrad (out-of-state)

* Very stunted elective options

* Electives I did find weren’t even available this semester. I asked my coordinator what to do and she told me the “entire catalogue was open” and “maybe I could look into a filler course in marketing or something in the business college.” For the price and my career aspirations, filler courses in seem like a colossal waste of time and money.

* Staff/Professors/Administration don’t seem to care…From permitting obvious cheating, to not planning for class size (like opening only one meeting time for a course all 70+ of us graduate students need), to giving athletes special treatment (“I don’t think you realize how little I care,” a football player calmly said to me when I was trying to get his input on a group project.)…you get the picture.

* My peers. Not all of them! There are some **incredible** people I’ve already met in the four months I’ve been here. Unfortunately, there are also some people that make me wonder why they even applied for graduate school. From aforementioned student athletes, to people always unavailable to come to meetings or contribute to projects, to people who just seem to want to rehash undergrad and picked a degree they thought would be easy…it's the lack of passion and drive that just kicks me in right in the guts. I wanted to be around like-minded people… passionate and driven.


What set the wheels in motion...

So, a couple months into the program I’m pulling an all-nighter, formatting a research paper for media that only three out of seven group members have contributed to, and I see this picture on Facebook from my friend currently at the Creative Circus. The picture was of her apartment, covered wall to floor in these Sharpied (new word!) black and white pieces of paper in these insane designs.

Circus is scheduled in quarters and she had just started. In her first week, she was already balls deep into intense art direction projects…Maybe not working on her book yet, but definitely working on stuff that was relevant to her desire to be an art director.

We were both pulling all-nighters. One of us was working on being an art director. And one of us was formatting a research paper in InDesign. 

And it just hit me: even IF, I get into the portfolio program here, it is only one class per semester for the next three semesters. I’ll have three classes to work on my book. The rest are required core classes or random electives that I have to hope are going to be beneficial to me as a fledging CW. And if I don’t get in, or if I get kicked out of a class and have to re-apply, it’s adding more and more time I’m at least partially wasting and more money I’m paying.

So, I requested info and I’ve had long conversations with a recruiter from Creative Circus. I was pleased by how much she grilled me on what my aspirations are, what I like doing, in what kind of environments do I work best, why did I pick advertising…all the meaty, juicy stuff. She told me to apply and said she wouldn’t recommend I do unless she thought I was a good candidate for their program, but she also steered me toward VCU or Miami if I really wanted an MA. She couldn’t give me any advice on Texas because she wasn’t really familiar with it. 

I looked over their curriculum. It looks incredible…very focused on copywriting and building your portfolio. There are even interactive classes I can take so I have that competitive edge when I enter the job market. Smaller classes are also a plus, but not such a huge positive that I think it would sway me in either direction.

I’m working on my application right now. 

But I wanted to ask --- should I give it more time? Am I being too harsh? Am I not seeing something right in front of my face? 

Anybody have any opinions on Creative Circus or the program at Texas? I have talked extensively with friends and family but I usually get the safe, “Do what you think will benefit you the most.”

I’d hate to think that I made the wrong choice…in either staying here or going there.

The only person I want to ask I’m afraid to ask. I consider him my mentor and he championed my going to Texas…he even helped me polish up my essay and wrote one of my recommendations.
I know he’s very proud of my acceptance here. He’s asked me to Skype with his class about my experience here at UT so far. He’s even sent out some emails to people in agencies here trying to help me get an internship. I guess I feel like he’s invested in my success because he’s put effort into helping me. 

I don’t want to disappoint him or have him think his efforts were wasted or that I am ungrateful. He does not look at portfolio schools positively…he thinks they don’t teach conceptual thinking, they only teach beautiful executions. 

But looking at the work I’ve seen coming from Circus…I don’t think that is true. 



(Maybe no one is thinking this, but just in case, no – I was in no way romantically involved at all with my mentor. He actually does not prefer my gender. He is just someone I respect a lot and would hate to disappoint.)




So, for an aspiring copywriter that is excited at the prospect of being thrown into intense portfolio work for the next years…good idea to make the move to Creative Circus?

 Or stay and get an MA and try get into the portfolio program at UT?

Would this be a turn-off?",neverenough22,askagirl,https://www.reddit.com/r/askagirl/comments/126k8p/ladies_questions_about_masculinity_and_machoness/,"I'm probably not what you'd consider to be the ""average"" straight Midwestern, American male and I'm wondering if it's ruining my chances with women. I live in the Midwest-- and it really seems like I'm nothing close to what women are looking for around here.

I try to dress well, I'm very clean, I love to cook and bake, enjoy art and culture, love creative writing and, recently, I've looked into going back to school for Interior Design. I have quite a few female friends, hate most sports and don't fit into the beer guzzling Neanderthal stereotype of most guys my age. 

On the flip side, I love to work on cars, go to junkyards, build things, longboard, go to punk shows, go to the gym, shoot at the gun range and operate my two car-related side businesses. On the weekends I'm usually in the garage getting dirty, followed up by cooking dinner. 

From what I've learned about myself, I'm a really compassionate, kind and generally gentle person who's probably a little too sensitive at times. At the same time, I'm protective of friends and family, stubborn and fairly intense and competitive.

It's a very unique mix, I know, because I have a lot of traits and interests of both genders. It works for me and I like who I am. I won't change who I am, but I'm concerned this is causing girls to distance themselves from me or show no interest. Or, worse yet, see me as ""one of the girls"" and throw me in the Friend Zone (of which I used to be king of). 

A few weeks ago I went out to dinner with a female friend (just friends) and someone asked if I was her boyfriend. I later found out they said they knew I couldn't be because I'm not ""rugged"" enough. Similarly at work yesterday I was sitting with a table full of female co-workers (most of my male co-workers can't hold a conversation outside of fantasy football... fuck that) and one commented that I'm ""chic"" based on something I said. (Also, fuck that.) The conversation turned into the fact that I'm not ""rugged"" and, honestly, I became a little offended because I felt like it was being used more as a euphemism for ""straight"" or ""masculine"" in the conversation. 

I've been single since June and, other than a poorly-thought out fling with an old ex, I've yet to go on a date-- and I've tried. I have a good job at a prestigious ad agency, a degree, I'm in shape, own two cars, live on my own and, in general, can have a quality conversation with any girl I meet and treat women like absolute princesses. (I have references!)

I lived in New York for a summer for an internship and really felt like the girls there thought of me differently. I felt appreciated for who I am and what I offer and again last weekend hanging out with some girls from Nashville while I went on vacation. Around here, men are ultra-masculine (in general) and I feel like that's what women expect and it's not me.

So, do I need to move away to find an area where women appreciate guys like me? Would you be turned off by a guy who could fix your car and then take you inside and talk about your day over a lemon-pepper and dill stuffed trout with asparagus spears, fresh from my kitchen?

I genuinely don't get it.


TL;DR: Guy from Midwest likes to work on cars and bake brownies. Guy from Midwest likes to shoot guns and then pick out curtains. Guy from Midwest gets zero interest from females and wonders if women are turned off by his unconventionally dynamic interests.

UPDATE: Thanks for all the input everyone. I'll post back once in a while with updates, but for now I'm headed out to San Francisco for work over the next two months (kids, go into advertising-- it's fun!). Kind of glad I don't have a girlfriend to ""run this past""! If I'm not working 80 hours a week I'll have to see if girls in SF are like girls in NYC. 

UPDATE #2:
Whoever suggested online dating, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I met an incredibly wonderful girl at a Match.com mixer. We had our second date last night and there's definitely something here. I could not be happier. She's from the deep South and seems to like or at least appreciate my quirks.

Reddit, get out there and meet someone. This is the best feeling imaginable."

**The guy friend who treats me like I'm an idiot:**

I was talking to B, a close male cousin of mine on Facebook. Eventually we start talking about juggling university life, work, and internships (we're both uni students, he in his second year and me in my third. I'm 21 and he's 19, but I took a gap year after graduating high school). I start talking about paid vs. unpaid internships, and here's his response verbatim:

B: Paid ofc didnt study math econ for shit

B: u art students are almost free all week""

*(He refers to me as an art student because I've been making films since  2005, and am going to university to learn and connect with fellow filmmakers)*

B: yeah arts is shit easy na

B: maths/econ is hardd

B: maths = theorems

B: and proof

B: i make proof

B: i make theorems

B: ure argument irrelevent

B: = u noob

B: = me pro and math econ gg""

Me: your problem is that you think intelligence/skill can be defined by just one factor, when it's multi-faceted

B: my ""problem"" is that i cant stop talkin to bitches who think arts is hard

Me: I'm not even gonna bother xD a debate is wasted on you

B: Thank God. Women just REFUSE to see logic

B: Come on man

B: u know maths is the language of logic

B: and women just plain suck at it

B: we MEN

B: u stupid tiny girlies

We have this conversation almost every single time we speak. And he constantly brings up his SAT score, which was near perfect (2200 – 2300 I think. I got 1700, is that really horrendous?) Every time I try to have a conversation about intelligence or competence, he just brings up his score and daunts me with my “noob SAT score”. 

What drives me nuts is I know I'm a smart kid – I'm well-read, I interact with people from all walks of life and disciplines and talents, not just “arts” (I'm studying Film &amp; TV at an arts university, but his idea of the arts is literally just painting). I have a multitude of hobbies and interests outside of just filmmaking, but it makes me crazy that despite all this, their self-righteous attitude still gets to me. I feel like for some stupid reason I still have to try to validate myself to these jerks.

I was raised in California, and he has spent his entire life in Pakistan, so I understand the mentality is different, but constantly taking this from him is just exhausting and ridiculous.

EDIT: I've known B my whole life, since diaper-times. I know I'm one of the only girls he talks to like this (I imagine he playfully insults his older sister). When is comes to more feminine girls, he's suddenly much meeker and sensitive. It's kind of annoying, especially since I do act more tomboy-ish around people I'm very close to, but that doesn't mean I should be treated any worse.

**The guy friend who thinks I owe him sex because he's nice to me:**

There's a guy in my class (let's call him C.) C has a crush on me, and he mentions it to me every single chance he gets. He's admitted he only attracted to me because I don't return the feeling. (Ugh.) I've told him many times that I'm flattered, but I simply don't want to 'date' him or even try to. He always says we should “run away some place together” or that I should come over and he'll cook dinner “which will seduce me” etc. I've told him I'm uncomfortable with his compliments and come-ons, and that I don't like being talked to that way.

Then of course he gets frustrated and asks me to explain in great detail WHY I'm not attracted to him. The thing is, I cannot CONTROL who I feel attracted to. I don't have a check-list of traits and features I look for in a guy, and if the guy and I get along well, it doesn’t mean I'll instantly want to date him or have sex with him. I've fallen for a rude hairy fat man, and for a skinny sweet white guy. I can't control it. I told him all this, and then he gets mad at me for not being able to articulate it better.

He apologizes the next day every time this happens (usually we have this conversation when he's high or drunk) and he keeps asking me “why don’t you like me? Tell me what is wrong with me” and I keep trying to explain that just because I don't want to sleep with someone doesn't mean there's something wrong with them.

Despite all this, and even after I telling him constantly that I will never be interested in him in that way, he continues to come-on to me and give me sexual compliments and generally make me feel uncomfortable (I'm pretty sure he just doesn’t' realize it, because he is a nice person otherwise).

 I feel that maybe I'm too polite when I try to tell him to stop, but I don't want to be rude or make him feel like he's disgusting or anything.

I told C a few weeks ago that I'm interested in another guy named D (we chatted online, and since have been texting regularly, but haven't met in person yet) and he constantly asks me about “the boy”. “Where are you taking the boy/the cherry-picker for Halloween?” “You should take him to A.C. (a sex club)” “You should take him to that sushi place on ETC. street, and then go for a walk on ETC. boulevard”. Basically C keeps giving me advice on dating D, advice that I didn't ask for. And he refers to this guy as the 'cherry-picker' because I'm a virgin and he's convinced that D is the guy I’m going to 'finally lose it to'. (I haven't even *met* D yet!)

It feels good to get all of that out. I'm not even going to bother talking about the third guy (who I live with) because that's going to take too much out me. Another time for sure! I'm just really glad that there's a space on reddit for girls to rant :) "

I'm an intern for Icelandair and last summer a plane popped in that I didn't expect. It was a DC3, it was there for a minor checkup.

We were a few interns along with fully qualified technicians that got to work on it. 
Once the week long checkup was done the pilots came in and we started chatting. Turns out they were going to a small airplane festival that was literally across the street from a music festival we were going to. We jokingly asked if we could hitch a ride. Which they agreed to surprisingly.

The plane got pushed out and all of a sudden we heard a LOUD bang. But couldn't find out what it was. Everything checked out and they decided to fly over to the capital which is only ~hours driving distance away from our hangar. That's where we would meet up with them and go to the festival.

When we got there they told us they had bad news. The bang was the lock for the rear landing gear. and the pin had been in while the tug driver tried to turn it. Shearing the pin.

We did NOT want it to end there and started looking at the damage. They told us they had an extra pin laying around somewhere. So we sent them out to find it while we spent the next 45minutes working the pin out.
We called our bosses and told them what was wrong, they told us that we didn't have a chance fixing it.

Well, the entire repair took us an hour with limited tools. 
We got moving and our 80+yo pilot just became young again behind the wheel. The take off in this plane felt really different from any other take off I've had, it was so much fun.  We were flying low just enjoying the view and the feeling of this plane. All of a sudden the pilot asked: ""Aren't you boys going to a festival?""
""uuuh yeah"". ""Then start drinking those beers you've got there in the back""

We got to the festival, the pilot did a few low passes, landed and let us exit in everyone's view. We felt like such badasses. 

After the festival we got a ride home too. But the last pic shows the state of the party area, it was incredible how little people cared about what they were doing, or left behind.

I've worked on that plane again since then. I definitely hope I get to ride along again sometime.

Hope you enjoyed it."

I was done. If I smoked then I was tempted to overeat and play games, If i play game I was tempted to fap or smoke, if I fapped I got lazy and would fall back into gaming and smoking. All the addiction fed off each other so I needed to quit them all.

My mind was fucked up from the cycle. I was out of touch of reality. I no longer had any hope or faith in anything in my life. All I wanted was pleasure. I was lonely. Isolated. Angry. Sad. Only time I was happy was when I was caving in, overstimulated with what ever came up on my monitor.

At first it wasn't too bad. I hit the gym every other day, followed a very good diet, stayed busy. I noticed as I smoke less my desire to escape into virtual pc game world lessened too. The porn was hard to get off from at first, but I wanted to use it as a practice hoping the discipline would translate to other areas of my life. Also wanted more mental clarity, and less bitch-ass-ness that comes from low testosterone and low sex drive.

I didn't focus on meditating or reading books and shit like I did before. I didn't go to marijuana anonymous meetings because all they talk about is how great the meetings are but never really get into any real juicy issues. Wanted to just spend the first 2 or 3 weeks detoxing before getting into rebuilding my mind.

Things were getting better. Covered shifts at work. Got an internship. Started dropping fat from diet and exercise. Then I met a girl. We had a lot of wild sex. Too much. She was a negative girl and it rubbed off on me. My mind was vulnerable without its usual fillers and was sensitive to any new incoming information.


I noticed even after we had sex, my mind was still trying to find a way to keep the high going. I started craving weed. I smoked once to bond with the girls friends, but I told myself no more for at least 2 months because I had immediately desired more the next day. 

When I went home my mind was still looking for a chaser, and it found one: Anger. Things got really violent with me and my Mom and I got kicked out of my house. I don't have any family besides her so I stayed at this chicks house, but she didn't know me to understand what I was going through, so I bounced and now I've been sleeping in my car the last 2 nights.

Halloween weekend, 24 years old, young, handsome, smart, passionate, yet somehow I managed to spend every holiday alone this year. It really got me down. I was skating down venice beach just wishing someone would bump into me so I could beat the shit out of them. I tried meditating but just ended up cursing at God and knocking down signs and trashcans. 

Grew up an only child with no family, so I have a habit on sitting alone feeling sorry for myself that's hard to break. Depression is my baseline emotion. I'm very up and down, Some say I'm bipolar, others say I'm an asshole, but it's hard for me to be in between. PEople love going to parties with me but never stick around on regular days when I just want a friend to hang out with. 

I know the weed made it worse. It was clouding my dreams, giving me suicidal thoughts, childhood flashback, inferiority complexes. Started having more and more violent fantasies.


Sober on my 18th day ( I smoke once but fuck it ill say 17th, I'm not gonna start over just because of 2 puffs) under a full los angeles moon I feel horrible. I pulled up some porn to get a quick good feeling in, but I commited to my effort and closed the porn and put my dick away.  I also broke my cell phone in rage, so for the last 4 nights I've been without a home or any kind of communication with people besides email.

Suicidal thoughts are reigning my mind tonight. If things don't get better in a year from now I'm killing myself. Whatever it is that people need in order to live happily, well, I'll be convinced I don't have it. I hate that the holidays are coming up, I'd rather be out causing mayhem than spending another thanksgiving or new years crying in my room.

Until then I guess it's time to get into some recovery. Get a sponsor for my weed problem. Try to understand what my mind is going through without having porn or gaming to escape into. Try to accept the lost years of my life, lost opportunities, and dreams I threw in the gutter. My whole life was built around these addictions, and without them, I don't know what to do with my life. I'm scared, and I'm lazy.

I really just want to feel good. Just close my eyes a disappear from the world. I don't have much hope for anything. Maybe my bipolar has me swinging really low again. I'm tired of the mood extremes.  Going to yoga tomorrow morning, hopefully I get an epiphany or that the universe flows love into my life, it's the only thing that slows down my anger---&gt; my rage addictions being the final frontier. I learned this last few weeks I have no business trying to date any chicks, nothing more than hookups if I can even get that. 

Just going through a really hard time with all this right now, on top of not having a place to stay, finding out I got kicked out of my college and cant reapply til fall 2013, and seeing the white girl who only worked at my job 3 months get promoted where I've been working 1.5+ years. My mind is looking for victims, an outlet, I don't know. I hate everything and everyone right now. I just hope all of this is worth it, and that I find a better way to live, and have love and success in my life."

Grew up an only child with no family, so I have a habit on sitting alone feeling sorry for myself that's hard to break. Depression is my baseline emotion. I'm very up and down, Some say I'm bipolar, others say I'm an asshole, but it's hard for me to be in between. PEople love going to parties with me but never stick around on regular days when I just want a friend to hang out with. 

I know the weed made it worse. It was clouding my dreams, giving me suicidal thoughts, childhood flashback, inferiority complexes. Started having more and more violent fantasies.


Sober on my 18th day ( I smoke once but fuck it ill say 17th, I'm not gonna start over just because of 2 puffs) under a full los angeles moon I feel horrible. I pulled up some porn to get a quick good feeling in, but I commited to my effort and closed the porn and put my dick away.  I also broke my cell phone in rage, so for the last 4 nights I've been without a home or any kind of communication with people besides email.

Suicidal thoughts are reigning my mind tonight. If things don't get better in a year from now I'm killing myself. Whatever it is that people need in order to live happily, well, I'll be convinced I don't have it. I hate that the holidays are coming up, I'd rather be out causing mayhem than spending another thanksgiving or new years crying in my room.

Until then I guess it's time to get into some recovery. Get a sponsor for my weed problem. Try to understand what my mind is going through without having porn or gaming to escape into. Try to accept the lost years of my life, lost opportunities, and dreams I threw in the gutter. My whole life was built around these addictions, and without them, I don't know what to do with my life. I'm scared, and I'm lazy.

I really just want to feel good. Just close my eyes a disappear from the world. I don't have much hope for anything. Maybe my bipolar has me swinging really low again. I'm tired of the mood extremes.  Going to yoga tomorrow morning, hopefully I get an epiphany or that the universe flows love into my life, it's the only thing that slows down my anger---&gt; my rage addictions being the final frontier. I learned this last few weeks I have no business trying to date any chicks, nothing more than hookups if I can even get that. 

Just going through a really hard time with all this right now, on top of not having a place to stay, finding out I got kicked out of my college and cant reapply til fall 2013, and seeing the white girl who only worked at my job 3 months get promoted where I've been working 1.5+ years. My mind is looking for victims, an outlet, I don't know. I hate everything and everyone right now. I just hope all of this is worth it, and that I find a better way to live, and have love and success in my life."

I am leaving in January to Florida for an internship for 6 1/2 months and he is aware of this. My first relationship ended in long distance, and if this becomes one (for the amount of time, I will be moving back in August) I want to do anything possible to make it work. He's more experienced than I in the relationship department. The only thing I want to be is on the same page before I leave. If it turns into a serious relationship I want him to know that he will be on my mind, and not a burden (he's mentioned this as a worry) while experiencing this new internship/job. I also don't want to be jealous or worried that he's talking to other girls and such. This is only the second guy I've dated seriously so far, and I really would like it to work out. I know I'm coming back, I just want him to know I'm interested in making it work and being faithful, hoping he'd do the same. 

tl dr: I like this guy, and I'm putting a bit of a strain early on letting him know that I am going to be out of state for 6 months. How do I make it work? Any tidbit of hope/info/honest advice is welcome. Thank you."

I just graduated from college this past May. During my last year of school, I was involved in a very abusive relationship, both physically and emotionally. This guy had once been one of my best friends but things slowly got worse and worse as his alcohol addiction increased. Aside from the physical part, he often told me all the things that were wrong with me. I ate too much, talked too much. I was annoying. I wasn't very pretty and he had a list of girls he wished I looked like. Eventually, I realized that I had no friends left because of this relationship. It was hard to leave him, because I didn't want to be alone. He was horrible and I hated him, but at least he was there. I finally managed to leave him right after graduation. One former friend stuck around long enough after that to tell me that 1) everything was mainly my fault because I never stood up for myself and 2) there were tons of times that my bf had tried to cheat on me that I didn't know about. I begged this friend to stay with me anyways, because I didn't want to be alone, but he left. I never heard back from him.

I moved back home with my family to look for a job and my own place. I didn't really know what I wanted to do or where I wanted to be. I just wanted to get far away and fast. My family was in the process of moving to another state, so I thought I might as well go with them. There were still several months to go before the official move.

I had been home maybe a few weeks when I was contacted by an old friend. We had known each other pretty much our whole lives, and dated twice before. We started spending time together, and I was really happy, in love even. He asked me to stay here, so that we could be together. At the last minute, I changed plans. I arranged to stay with a friend here until I could find work and a place to live. I knew that once work started for me we wouldn't get to see much of each other. He was still in school, working, and doing an internship. 

Fast forward to now. I'm working at a job I absolutely hate, which technically is supposed to be done by three people. I'm stressed all the time, and free time is all but non existent. I found an apartment, but both my apartment and work are in a city about an hour away from where my bf lives and works. My family has moved. The last time I spoke to the bf was a month ago. I finally cracked and told him about my last relationship and he came over to talk. I haven't heard from him since. I told myself that he's just really busy. But when I got on facebook the other day, I saw pictures of him going out with friends. He's apparently been to the city I live in, and never said anything to me about it.

I'm really struggling. I try to make friends but I almost never have time, and when I do, I find it's hard for me to talk to people now. I feel so hurt, mad, confused, alone. There's no one here I can talk to. My job sucks. Some days, I get home and have a massive panic attack at the thought of going back the next day. We found out recently that we'll be open the days before and after Christmas, so I won't get to go see my family for the holidays. 

I'm most hurt my my bf's apparent abandonment. I texted him a week or so ago, and I mailed him a letter. Nothing. I'm mad at hI'm and myself. He's broken my heart twice before. I brought this on myself. Yesterday, I typed out a letter to him, letting him know that I was hurt, he's an asshole, a bad friend, and I regretted staying. I don't know if I should send it. It's polite, but sort of long. I don't want to come off as whiny. I don't want him to think I'm begging for his attention. I'm not. If he wants to talk to me, he would, and I've come to terms with that. And I'm still having trouble standing up for myself. Part of me wants to send it. Part of me thinks I should wait until he finally contacts me and then let him have it.  There's no one here I can ask for advice.

I'm tired of feeling like shit because of a relationship, and I'm just tired. I don't know where to go from here."
129obr,5,2012-10-29,The Worst Situation I Have Ever Put Myself In,apackaday,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/129obr/the_worst_situation_i_have_ever_put_myself_in/,"Throwaway account. Omitted/changed a lot of information for anonymity, hopefully the context still makes sense. 

I've had nobody to really talk to or vent to about all the shit going on over the past year. I’m usually the one people call when they have bullshit in their life, but I feel like I have made nothing but stupid decisions lately. In the summer I moved 1500 miles from home to attend Uni. I feel as if it has been the singlemost stupid, ill-prepared decision I have ever made in my life, and I wish I had known this in retrospect to keep me from living 300 miles from the nearest city with no money, gas, job opportunities, and barely any food. 

I came here with $100 to my name after gas and with whatever I could fit in my car. I found extremely cheap rent and I needed to get away from my chaotic life, so I moved early and started at a jr. college about half an hour away because I needed 1 class to finish transfer. I registered for 12+ units to become full time and was expecting to get Financial Aid as I had at my previous jr. college, but lo and behold because of the new policies, I have been denied FA and all subsequent appeals -- and this school offers no private loans. After weeks of fighting with them, I’m over it and gave up. My family, not well off either, have been sending me what they can, when they can. I haven't told them yet that I stopped going to classes because I can't afford the gas to go there anymore. They think the money is helping me pay rent, which I haven't paid in 3 months. I don’t want them to know how ashamed I am right now or how desperately I need money. My car insurance is gone. I’m waiting for when my phone gets shut off. One room mate of mine I've known for 4 years, so he has been supportive. But I feel that I’m standing on the edge of the abyss here, and that his friendly optimism will eventually grow tired.

I've been desperately looking for jobs, but being a small college town, I feel that I'm extremely outmatched and outnumbered. I was lucky enough to land a job in my profession right out of high school, so I have no experience in retail or restaurants. I started to joke with my family that you need a degree to be a dishwasher, but that's what it feels like. And now, because I followed my passion I feel it has bitten me in the ass. I can't find any source of income, and 99% of the scholarships I find aren’t helpful. When I'm in good spirits, I look for 8 hours a day, and get discouraged when I do nothing but apply for jobs I know I have no chance of getting. When I do find something I might be qualified for, I never hear back. I've been editing, modifying, and doing everything short of straight up lying on my resume to find a job. I've been living off of PB&amp;J, nicotine, and water for 2 months, and my hope and patience are dwindling.

Out of high school I started working for a small start-up NPO paid internship that did field work and I had been admitted to a jr. college program that I loved. My parents divorced while I was there, and a bunch of horrible shit came out about our family. So my classmates and the internship I had been at for 4 years became my new family until my real one could heal. I couldn’t balance school time and the NPO anymore, so I had to quit my job, even though my boss wanted me to stay, she was very understanding. Then we graduated, and the NPO couldn’t afford to hire me back on. 

Everything up until this point have been miracles. I felt like the luckiest person alive to get into my field early and have so many opportunities. My career is everything to me. My first job I landed I was uncomfortable with from almost the beginning, but the income was exactly what I needed to survive and pay off some backdebt for being unemployed. I started to question my career choice because this environment was not positive at all. I didn't get along with anybody in my department, even though I just kept my head down and mouth shut most of the time. I started to lose the plot and ended up quitting before I was fired, because I couldn't handle the stress anymore of my boss and his ridiculous expectations, constant flip-flopping on policies and then yelling at me for “not knowing them”, and other bullshit. 

Examples I think I can share: a few of us were scheduled to work on holidays, which is expected in my field. I was scheduled to work every single holiday. Fine, whatever, I'm the lowest man on the totem. But everybody else scheduled with me all called out on every single holiday, and I ended up working every single holiday by myself, so I ended up being there for 8 hours when the idea was to only be there 3 hours max and go home. When I talked to the boss about it, he basically said just take your holiday pay and shut up. I ended up being sexually harassed by my boss as well, which only gave real concrete reason to why I needed to leave (and I’m a guy, so it wasn’t something I didn’t feel like I could report because I doubted anyone would care anyway). 

I was a light smoker trying to quit, maybe 3-5 cigs a day, until I started working here. By the end, I started to not give a fuck, and let my anger and frustration take over. I took smoke breaks constantly. I was smoking over a pack a day, the most I ever have. I became basically the worst employee there, and I knew it, some people I knew from other departments sympathized (other smokers, which is why I was out there often). In the end, this job was a waste of time. Even the people I thought that liked me don't return any of my attempts to contact them after I left. My only reference is HR, because as far as I know they think the only reason I left was to pursue school. 

So seeing how horrible this place was right after starting my employment, I decided I should return to school and pursue undergrad work so I could do something beyond being a lowly grunt. I feel like a BS in my field is actually very useful and can open up all kinds of job opportunities for me at 3x the pay. In reality I just wanted to leave that job as soon as possible, but still have something going for me. I put in my applications and was conditionally accepted to all my school choices (because of that 1 class I was missing), and went to my #1 choice. Because I was working up until I left on my 1500 mile road trip, I didn't have time or the extra money to even go check out the area, campus, or anything. I decided to just wing it and hope for the best. I had second thoughts every day until I finally got into my car and started driving. 

Almost immediately when I got here, I found a job from a lady who was looking for someone in my profession. But because they had an unlicensed business, they paid me under the table. I knew it was shady, but it was income. Or so I thought. They told me first they would pay me $xxx a week, and then a week later said it would be $xx an hour. It was like they hadn't decided. That scared me slightly, but I went for it, knowing this might be the only opportunity I had to find relevant work here. Over the course of 2-3 weeks, I was being called in rather impulsively to work. I just did odd tasks that they needed an extra hand with, they kept saying ""we should have time to train you next week"" and being told about how I’ll be getting more hours and other too-good-to-be-true bullshit. After 3 weeks and giving them about 30 hours of work, I finally got paid. $50. I was irate, but they didn’t know, since I never look at my checks until I get into my car. They said they would pay me ""as we could"", but they haven't called me since I left the day I was paid.

I don't know where to go from here. I was hoping dropping my classes would help me too, I lost out on the one and only other job opportunity I had since being here (at a pet store). I made it to a second interview but I’m guessing because they possibly didn’t like my school schedule I wasn’t hired (based on the hiring manager’s reaction when she saw my schedule, anyway), despite claiming they would work around that. There's places hundreds of miles away I can find more work in my field, but I don't even have enough gas to leave this town, let alone get a down payment. I suppose this post is just my one last burst of hope, one last attempt at feeling validated to help mask my overwhelming sense complete failure. I feel like I’m being punished, or that I’m not selling myself efficiently, but I don’t know exactly what I’m doing wrong anymore, or how I can make it right.

I'm stuck, I can’t sleep, but I want this to work out, but the stars are simply not aligning for me. All I need is an income to bridge me from now until next fall, the next earliest possible time I can start at my uni and from there I can get FA due to their different standards from jr. colleges, internships, and all kinds of employment potential that I can’t even touch right now for not being a student. Honestly, the most horrifying thing to me right now is my roommate no longer tolerating me being here after all this. He was part of my pseudo family when my real one was falling apart. He’s one of my closest and only friends around here, and I want more than anything else to not have to walk away from this situation. I don’t want my cigarettes to be my only friend.

I just need somebody to give me a chance.

129bjq,9,2012-10-29,"Trying to adopt a healthier, non-religious view of sex ",lemonblossoms,sex,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/129bjq/trying_to_adopt_a_healthier_nonreligious_view_of/,"So as the title suggests, I **[22/f]** have been going through changes (oh that felt corny to write) of how I feel about sex over the past year and a half. To make a long story short-ish, my first relationship when I was 16 lasted until I was 21 (early last year) and was with a boy who was very very Catholic. At the time we started dating, I was not religious, but I was very insecure, so I was perfectly fine with agreeing to no sex before marriage. And that's how it went. Any time we would slip up and go ""too far"" (I'm talking making out and him grinding on me until he came in his pants here people), he would have incredible guilt and just absolutely withdraw into depression for some time. Once we got to college together, he imposed even stricter rules-making out was no longer allowed, because to him it resembled intercourse. We once stayed in a hotel room together when he came to visit me while I was on an internship, and we ""slipped up"" and grinded, fully clothed. I orgasmed, and he cried from the guilt. Anyway, I eventually converted to Catholicism, not necessarily ""for"" him but because of him. Like I said, this all lasted until early 2011, when I was 21. 

We broke up because he was considering the priesthood. I didn't take it well and had some flings and did some things that, looking back now, would not shame me at all. But at the time, my Catholic guilt absolutely tore me up. It also tore up my ex as well, as we were trying to uphold our friendship. At the end of my fling summer, he broke down and told me how much he worried, how much it hurt him to see me in such sin. I agreed with him, and threw myself into so much guilt, for so long over that summer.

Now I'm in a serious relationship with someone who has never been religious, and things are changing. I'm finally admitting to myself that Catholicism isn't something that is natural to me, and that it was something I did to please the man I thought I was going to marry.

 My new boyfriend and I lost our virginity to each other, and have an enjoyable and safe sex life. As we start looking into new things to explore (things we like, birth control methods, etc) however, I start feeling that old twinge of guilt, like I'm doing something terrible. At times, I feel like my body is gross and shameful, that there's no way my boyfriend could find it sexy. I feel like my libido is too high, like I'm some insatiable whore. Even that taking birth control is going to, I don't know, set my body on fire or something :P I feel like I never had a chance to develop a healthy view on sex- I always just shut it out my mind completely, by eliminating the media, music, friends, everything that the devil would supposedly use to ""tempt"" me. 

Almost all of my friends are still very devoted Catholics who would truly pity me if they found out I was ""giving in to sin"" having sex. And if they knew I was using condoms.... they would truly consider that to be like having an abortion. I know because I once considered it like that. I feel that, aside from my boyfriend and a few distant friends, I'm pretty alone on this. Sexxit/research/education outside of the church is really helping me, but I really feel like I'm starting anew on something that should be natural. How do I do this?"

It was one of the suckiest things I've ever had to do, but breaking down in my therapist's office was my final straw. I don't want anyone else to have to go through what I'm going through at the hands of this jerk. My friends have been very supportive. Thanks for the support, y'all.

I was raped twice in my lifetime before this, neither of which I reported, but this time is different.

I thought I was just drunk, but I had eaten before I drank and I hadn't drank very much. Normally I drink hard liquor for hours at a time, and don't get drunk or lose control of myself. I should've known something was up when my first beer made me feel funny.

I don't remember how I got into bed. I had slept next to him before--I know this guy, my friends know this guy, I thought it was safe. I kept my clothes on. In the morning I felt too sick to move, and I hadn't even drank enough to get a hangover. Then he pulled off my clothes and did what he did.

I felt sick the rest of the day, like no hangover I had ever had before. My blood was humming in my ears all day. My heart was racing, but my blood pressure felt really low. I took my anxiety medication and it did nothing for my racing heart. I did my deep-breathing exercises. I drank water. Nothing helped how sick I felt. I just drifted in and out of sleeping and crying. I called my mother because I was so scared and sick. That feeling lasted off and on into the next evening. 

The next day at my internship, someone brought up the name of the place where the guy works, and I almost started crying. I broke down and told her about it so she'd at least understand why I was so upset at the mention of this place.

For the next couple of weeks I kept having flashbacks. I couldn't even touch myself without feeling the onset of a panic attack. I told my doctor, who gave me more medication, and I started feeling a little better, even if therapy was only getting more difficult to go through. 

Friends keep encouraging me to report to the police. I'm so scared that if I report him, he'll come after me. And if he doesn't come after me, I'll face social consequences. 

I ran into him last night when I was with my friends and my date, and he sent me a nasty text message about ignoring him. I want him to leave me alone, for good. I feel like I have to do this so he doesn't do this to anyone else, but I am just so scared of what will happen to me.

12c9uc,11,2012-10-30,My[30] husband [34] is talking about extremely personal stuff with a new colleague[30s]. ,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/12c9uc/my30_husband_34_is_talking_about_extremely/,"I've been with him for 9 years, and we've known each other since we were in HS. I know him well enough for this to raise a red flag or two. Maybe a yellow flag, I don't know. I'd like some outside input before I decide to say anything. 

My husband used to intern for Company X. He interviewed for a job there, got passed over, and he didn't renew his internship because of other obligations. Recently, he got an email from one of the people he worked side by side with on one project. It was very casual, saying how she missed himnand he should apply again because she got turned down 3x before getting the job, etc. He honestly doesn't know her from the next person there and wasn't sure who exactly she was when she wrote him. He is starting a new internship (keep in mind this is paid, while he also works 2 other jobs) this afternoon. I am excited for him. 

Building up to this, they have been texting each other a lot. This is alright with me, as I'm close with my male coworkers though they are also friends with my husband. If I'm having a text conversation while we are hanging out, I let him in on it since I feel like it's rude to be having a secondary convo with someone else while you are actively spending time with someone. He doesn't see it this way. I feel like I'm prying when I'm like ""Who ya textin? What about?"" though I don't feel like it's right to let me sit there hanging while he sends a 3 page text. 

I picked up his phone and looked through it. Yeah, it's snooping, but he was sitting right there and he does it to me all the damn time. What I saw was really really weird to me. While he sat next to me, he was texting this person that he supposedly doesn't remember about personal issues like his depression, and details regarding friend-drama that just popped up recently. He was texting this person about things that I didn't even know he was feeling and we are very open about that kind of thing. When she asked what time he needed to leave, he said ""6:30, I have to pick someone up from work."" Yeah, that ""someone"" is me. His wife. 

I simply said ""You guys are getting close pretty quickly there, huh? Are you sure it's a good idea to discuss personal issues with your superior?"" He didn't think it was a bad idea, at all. I think it makes him look vulnerable, but in a bad way. I mean, to tell someone that you are battling anxiety and depression and you don't even remember what their face looks like? In this industry, it's a bad idea to talk about that kind of thing with coworkers, let alone supervisors. 

What I didn't say, which I should have, was that it made *me* feel weird. He neglects to tell this person he is married (we weren't married when he met her in the first place), and spills his guts to her. If this was a dude that he was getting all personal with, I'd still feel very weird about it. I am okay with him sharing personal information with his friends, but I believe he is jumping into this work relationship too fast. 

He also has a tendency to lead women on. In our 9 year relationship, there have been 4 separate instances of him making ""friends"" and them freaking out when he turns them down romantically or when the find out he is seeing someone. He thinks a girl asking for his number at the karaoke bar means she just needs a new singing buddy... Yeah right! He's not a bad looking dude but doesn't know it at all so if floored whenever I tell him someone is flirting with him. He's also very open with me and will say things like ""Uh, so and so is asking me to come over. It's 2am... WTF?"" and be SO SHOCKED when I tell him that texting someone into the night complete with "";)"" faces is considered flirting. It's the 21st century, man. 

I absolutely trust him when it comes to not cheating, but I don't trust him to make those lines clear from the beginning. This woman is spilling her guts to him as well and using language that is much too casual for just a business partnership. I mean, saying things like ""I miss you"" and ""Can't wait to see you"" is a bit much, no? So, no, he wouldn't cheat (and if he does, well fuck him then), but there are other problems that can arise from becoming too close with someone in this way. He is a straight male and she is a straight female, and she has mentioned that she is single *twice*. 

Reddit, tell me I'm nuts and that he's not totally self sabotaging by talking to this woman about his personal business. Or tell me that it's his problem to figure out. I don't even know what to do here. I do know that I'm done looking at his phone because all it does is blow my mind at how naive he is.

**tl;dr My husband is prone to leading women on and being shocked when they want to be more than friends, which ends up disrupting *my* life, and I believe he is doing this again with a superior at work and is ruining his chances at his dream career. Can I do anything or do I let him figure it out on his own?** "

I honestly was thinking of going the hostel route but I'm kind of lost because I've never stayed in one, rather travel to a country that I'll be completely alone in. I found hostelbookers.com, and there seem to be some good prices.

So, if anyone has any tips or suggestions on how to make the best of it and where to stay or go, that would be great. If you have any suggestions on if either London or Prague would be better for me, that would be great too, because I haven't traveled to neither of them before.

Thanks :)"

I'm making this request for a friend of mine. I'm temporarily living in Philadelphia for an internship and I have made a very good friend who introduced me to a world of beer that I had never known before. Being from Texas, I had no grasp on beer culture and didn't know anything more exotic than Dogfish Head. He has opened his cellar to me many times, introducing me to just about every style and brewery. And now I think it's time that I repay him. We were hanging out one night talking about beer, as usual, when he mentioned to me that the Cantillon Blaber is probably the only beer that he really wants to try, that has eluded him thus far. Sadly, I'm leaving Philadelphia in the next few months and I thought there would be no better way of saying thank you to him than by finding a bottle of this beer. I'll do whatever it takes to repay this friend of mine. Just let me know what you would want for it and I will try my damnedest to get it. Or even if any of you just have some tips for me on where I could possibly find it, it would sincerely be much appreciated. And, in addition to whatever you would like in exchange, I will throw in a bottle of Tired Hands Brewing Co.'s first bottled beer Handfarm, a funky saison, as soon as it's released. They are an up and coming brewpub in the Philadelphia area and I think you'd really enjoy this first of it's kind beer."

",freakshowbrain,melbourne,https://www.reddit.com/r/melbourne/comments/12brql/hey_im_an_it_newb_youve_got_a_job_opening_in_your/,"I'm in my late 20s now, and I'm looking for my first full-time Australian job. I finished my Masters of IT a few years ago (taking post-grad degrees without experience should be illegal) and I've been jobless ever since. I've tried to tailor every single application to every relevant job on seek.com as perfectly a fit as I can without lying or embellishing (much), and I've gotten zero interviews, one polite negative reply, and one negative reply *three months after the job application*. That's the extent of how close I have been to getting a job.

It really beats down on your ego when you can't get hired for graduate positions because of shitty results, or because you're too old for internships, or lack the experience needed in entry-level help desk roles. My headspace is a bit of a mess right now. It's fucking depressing and messes with your entire idea of self-worth and esteem, man. I'm down to my last $40, and I've not slept in room of my own for like 2 years. I think my friends are sick of putting me up, and my family has enough financial problems of their own so I've applied for Newstart after fighting the idea for years (maybe due to pride). The idea was to hopefully get a job through them and get off the claims ASAP.

Does anyone want a Masters IT graduate for cheap? I really just need some IT-related experience and enough to eat. I can do some programming (C, Java, VB .Net), SQL, troubleshooting, basic website stuff, antivirus / firewall / ip packet filter setup, a bit of forensic software like FTK / Wireshark, I've worked with Linux a little (Ubuntu and shell scripting from a long time ago). I'm more than willing to learn whatever systems you use for your company or business on my own time. I'll also do any non-IT related stuff you need done at the same time. I'm a permanent resident too, so you don't have to worry about visas.

Oct 31 Edit - You guys are champions - I really appreciate the advice and help you guys have given, and I feel much better now and, more importantly, hopeful about the future. Thanks again. "
12bhg6,27,2012-10-29,A first post and an admitted vent: abortion and an encounter with Planned Parenthood.,[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/12bhg6/a_first_post_and_an_admitted_vent_abortion_and_an/,"Well, I'll start off by saying that I'm posting here because it's filled with some of the most thoughtful comments on these issues that I've seen on the Internet.  

I'm 28 years-old and I'm senior at a business school in the US.  I'm a returning student that started out in community college and transferred.  Not long after I transferred I met a man, my now-fiance.  In February of this year I had to have my gallbladder removed.  Since that time my digestion has been troublesome and I have stomach issues frequently.  

Honestly, it was at this point that I should have changed my birth-control method.  Feeling nauseous all the time and other...well, digestive...issues probably wasn't asking for success from a sensitive daily pill.  And now, after just a hair over a decade of being sexually active I'm disappointed in myself to have an unwanted pregnancy.

It was clear to me immediately that this wasn't something I was prepared to deal with.  My fiance has entered grad school.  I'm in a competitive business school finishing my last year with a hectic fall job recruitment period and an internship in winter.  I live in my father's daylight basement.  I do want children, as does my fiance, but eventually.  We wanted to be in a better financial situation, a better living situation.  And, honestly, I wouldn't trust companies not to have a bias against me as I go forward interviewing.  Right at graduation and the birth of this baby I wouldn't have the luxury to take time off.  I'd need a job.  

Maybe it goes without saying it's been a stressful time.  This was compounded by my first visit to Planned Parenthood.  I'll emphasize right now that it wasn't their fault this particular visit was stressful.  Since my gallbladder removal my period has been all over the map.  When I went in and told them the first day of my last period they estimated I was at 12 weeks.  I was crushed by this.  It felt far to me.  While I hold no judgement for anyone else for that time and beyond,  *I* felt emotional.  I was still going through with the abortion but it left me feeling very hollow.

I made my appointment with the support of my fiance and my Mom (who I have an outstanding relationship with).  I was armed with copies of my insurance card and paperwork from my plan indicating their service numbers and coverage level.  I felt assured and prepared.

Then...I arrived for the appointment.  It was at a different Planned Parenthood location four days later.  This past Saturday morning at 8:00 AM.  I arrived with my fiance.  I was told my insurance information hadn't been processed by their financial office.  The person who had begun to process it had left a note ""no insurance on file"" even as the woman at registration could see it in the notes on her screen.  I would need to pay $650 to them at that point.  I'd come with 20% of that, the portion I'd been told to expect to have to pay.  I explained my situation and that I was frustrated to hear this.  I once again gave my insurance card.  The woman at registration decided to check me in and said she would contact her manager while they did their initial pre-procedure work.

A bit of good news came then.  I had an ultrasound.  I was only at an estimated 7 weeks.  This took a large weight off my chest.  It was at this point the woman from registration came in and said the manager had said the same thing.  Pay the $650 and I'd be refunded later.  I just didn't have it in my account.  My fiance didn't have it.  

This is why I'm venting.  I'm upset about how this was handled.  If I had been called even the day before and told no one had processed my insurance I could have wrangled something to make it work.  I could have gotten the cash from my Mom, heck, I would have gone so far as to pay a penalty to get it out of a CD.  But instead, in a very vulnerable and stressed state, I had to deal with their error and their inflexibility.  No one called.  This still surprises me. This person typed in ""no insurance on file"" and never lifted the phone.  It just seemed so cavalier.  

I was told that people would bring in fraudulent insurance cards which was almost humorous because in the same breath they said the ""good news"" was that they wouldn't charge my for the ultrasound but would instead bill my insurance. I was told that I wasn't at a critical point, I was early enough along that waiting a week would be fine.  Really?  I feel like the ""critical point"" is pretty subjective to the patient.  

And now, I wish I was joking as I type this... The big announcement.  My engagement party is next Sunday.  My parents organized it and about 45 people are coming.  And the day before I'll have had an abortion.  Some might even say I'm adding this for a level of drama.  I'm scanning the invite and the Planned Parenthood appointment reminder in prep.  The other option was to have it Wednesday, the day of a mid-term in a class.  It's safe to say that right now I feel cursed.

I'll acknowledge I put myself in this position by not thinking about my birth control at all the angles I should have.  But at the same time, the lack of flexibility demonstrated by Planned Parenthood, the lack of customer service really, honestly demonstrates to me that no one - not even the clinics performing this service - see abortions the way other medical services are seen.  It was their error and the potential of a fraudulent or card or no, in my opinion, they should have moved forward.  

Today they called me to inform me that my insurance was now properly processed.  I'm sitting here even more stressed and emotional.  I can't help but feel like this sensitive issue was handled incredibly poorly.  

I stand by Planned Parenthood.  I always have.  I've always been pro-choice and when I was starting out after high school I went there for physicals and birth control.  I don't value that any less.  But right now I'm definitely disappointed.  I am just one person but I'm still stunned and hurt.  It's a stunned and hurt that I have to add to this already difficult time.

Planned Parenthood, I have no doubt of the importance of the work you do and your stance on these issues.  Hell, without you and your advocacy who knows if I could even be having this procedure right now.  But, as a patron, I'm profoundly saddened by what happened on Saturday.  I'm disappointed in this manager.  I don't feel I received compassion.

I just had to put it somewhere.  

Update:  I appreciate the comments!  The support has really made me feel better.  There's not many people in my immediate circle I just want to up and share this with so it's nice to have the additional kind words.  As an update, I contacted the health center at my university and they actually were incredibly supportive and referred me to another clinic.  I contacted them.  They've already verified my insurance and I have an appointment for Thursday!  So, I should feel better for the party.  Still a rough decision but I already feel much more relieved."

(Seriously long, I just need to get all of this off of my chest.)",br0srsly,SRSWomen,https://www.reddit.com/r/SRSWomen/comments/12femr/oh_my_dag_i_am_so_fed_up_with_my_boyfriend_i_need/,"Hello all, 
I'm so irritated with my boyfriend. We have been together for a little over a year and I am SO.TIRED.OF.HIS.SHIT.

Here is a list of some things I am super super incredibly sick of:

- He smokes weed all day every day.

- We're in college and he makes no effort with school which really really bothers me. We took a couple GE's together and I ALWAYS did his work for him. He has an internship at the school radio station and he has done literally NOTHING for it the entire semester. He doesn't put effort into anything!

- He wants to be a stand-up comedian BUT HE ISN'T FUNNY AND I AM SO SICK OF ""LAUGHING"" AT HIS TERRIBLE JOKES.

- He has some seriously family disfunction. His mom and dad got a divorce right before he went to college. His whole dad's side relies on guilt and manipulation to keep them together as a family. Once, his grandma told me I should ""read a book"" instead of watching trashy TV and he didn't even say anything. I can do both! 

- He is a big baby whiner and I have to mom him.

- He's super irresponsible with money. Like, so irresponsible with it that he ran out of money so he just decided not to get me a birthday present.

- He had a bad roommate situation happening earlier this year. I started to let him stay at my place and then everything just started to snowball. He literally moved in. He never looked for a new apartment. He just spent all his time bumming around my house, EVEN WHEN I WASN'T THERE. It took me getting like a serious talk from my roommates for him to realize that he miiiiight have overstepped some boundaries. In the three weeks since the talk he's, found a new apartment and moved there. WHY COULDN'T HE HAVE DONE THAT WAY EARLIER????

- For about a month, he refused to drive his car. He would only drive mine. I wouldn't let him drive if he was high so he would lie to me. I just found this out. HE FUCKING DROVE MY CAR WHILE HIGH AND LIED ABOUT IT. WHAT THE FUCK.

- Whenever I ask him for space or say, I would really like some br0srsly time right now he like, loses his ability to be rational. He will cry and whine and beg and get upset and list reasons why I should just let him stay at my house 24/7. We have been having the same argument about this for weeks. I JUST LIKE TO BE ALONE! I'M TIRED OF HAVING TO ARGUE UNTIL I JUST GET WORN DOWN!

- He is incredibly pushy, if he doesn't get his way he acts butthurt all day. 

- He bitches about my roommates more than I do! I know that they're loud and somewhat passive agressive and of course they get on my nerves sometimes but I can't handle all the negativity from him about it! He comes in my room and is just like ""What the fuck, when I walked in your house your roommate Woman1 gave me the dirtiest look."" ""Oh my god, I went to the kitchen to get water and Woman2 walked out of the room. What a bitch!"" He's like, personally upset with my roommates because they asked me to tell him not to be here as often and everything they do he perceives as an insult to him. SOMETIMES PEOPLE ARE JUST DONE BEING IN THE KITCHEN AND SO THEY LEAVE OMGWTF.

- He also gets upset with me when I don't like stand up to my roommates. I have no reason to do so! Seriously, one of my roommates used all my hair spray and didn't tell me. When I asked about it they realized what happened and gave me a new bottle. He was upset that I didn't say anything. Who gives a shit?!?!?! She replaced the hairspray immediately! 

- I have a male roommate. I will admit that he is a little weird sometimes and I feel like he is sort of flirting with me, but I have no interest and never respond. My boyfriend is still incredibly jealous of my male roommate. I cannot handle it. When he is not busy talking shit about my two female roommates he's talking shit about my male roommate ""Male roommate is so fucking creepy!"" ""Make sure you lock your door at night because I'm worried about what will happen!"" ""Even if you lock your door it's pretty easy to pick those locks!"" I think he uses that argument as a way to kind of freak me out and convince me that I should just let him stay over so that he can ""protect"" me.

- He doesn't give a shit about himself. He has gained massve amounts of weight this year because he just doesn't give a fuck. I sometimes have to REMIND HIM TO SHOWER. He's a fucking adult. He should know when to shower.

- He eats like, all of my groceries and then I depend on him for food when he buys groceries and it's this big tangled mess. 

- He's incredibly jealous of my female friends. Whenever I leave to go spend time with him he pouts and whines and it's SO ANNOYING.

- I am his only friend. He makes no effort to have other friends. I tell him that being someone's everything is too much. Then he reminds me that last year, when I was suffering from an extreme depressive episode (I'm Bipolar II), and when I had no friends (because he drove them away by being really intrusive and kind of a dick), it was hard for him to be my everything too. That's not chillbrochad! Sorry for having a MENTAL ILLNESS. 

- When he gets drunk, he gets really fucking drunk. It's quite scary. 

- His parents are in serious denial. They KNOW he has a lot of problems and literally pawn them off on me. Like, they really expected me to allow him to just stay at my house forever because they just couldn't really face reality. They know he has like, substance abuse problems (he will openly admit that he is an addict) but they still give him limitless cash (which he spends on nothing but weed.)

So basically- he is a lazy, douchey, controlling, jealous guy and I am sooooo done with his shit. Here's the kicker though. I tried to break up with him on thursday evening and he WOULDN'T ACCEPT IT! He showed up at my house in the morning with flowers and coffee and 1000 apologies and he kept talking about like ""throwing away a beautiful, year-long relationship."" There was so much guilt trippage that I felt like I had no choice but to take him back. Now he keeps buying me things and asking if ""we're okay,"" and I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO!! His birthday is this weekend, I feel like it's cruel to break up with him AGAIN on his birthday weekend. My mom suggested I wait and break up with him right before thanksgiving break so that he can't come bother me (we live on opposite sides of the state) but that's not until mid-November and every day that I have to put up with this shit I feel more and more drained, I'm not happy and I really don't love him anymore. I'm sorry that this is so long. I have no one else to talk to. I feel like I can't even tell my mom most of this because she would be so upset with him that I truly believe she would fly across the state and confront him (my mom is the greatest, seriously.) and it would also make me feel stupid for staying with him for so long. Most of my friends really just don't like him and then the few that do like him always just say that we're so perfect that we should never ever break up. I'm not worried about being alone, I'm just scared about hurting him or what the aftermath will be. SRS, WAT DO?!?!?!!?! 

**tl;dr: Need help with douchey terrible boyfriend and I have nobody else to talk to.**

Edit: I accidentally commented on everything with my real account and had to delete all my comments! Thank you for your words of encouragement. I broke up with him for real about an hour ago. I feel sad right now but I know it was the right choice. If I had stayed any longer I might have spontaneously combusted out of frustration. Thank you thank you thank you SRSWomen. You are seriously the best group of people on the internet!!!

[M,23],[F,24]",phase16,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/12fap4/is_my_4_year_relationship_going_to_end_in_a_month/,"so i recently posted under the throwaway ""phase15', but i've forgotten the password due to being 'all over the place' recently.  here is what i wrote last:   

[previous post](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/123inc/how_to_save_a_crumbling_4_year_relationship_m23f24/)  

i need a third party opinion here. so my girlfriend and i have been having problems recently as you can read in my previous post.  she has been more distant and has also been more open to me about the crisis she has been having.  this has been going on for 2.5 months. we havent had sex in 4.5 months since i was in my home country visiting family for the 2 months prior to coming back. since i've been back things have not been going very well in certain ways.

So I decided to open her computer.  i didn't know what was really up. so i snooped around and i looked in her emails to see that she had accepted an internship ( i dont know how long, but i know at maximum 4 months) starting in december in another country. she hasnt told me about this yet. the email is 4 days old. maybe she is waiting for a good time or maybe she has another reason. I know it is not good to look at her emails but I know she looks at mine too.  I also found out that she had a doctors appointment to get an IUD. Which is a bit surprising seeing as we havent had sex in awhile after she stopped taking birth control. i really dont know what to think about that.  

I know at this point you might be thinking: ""why don't you just ask her what's going on?"". I am really tempted but i don't really want to say i went on her computer just yet. instead i want to wait for her to tell me these things.  


anyway, given that we have been having a rough time in our relationship this is worrying.
however I'm still not exactly sure whats going to happen. this is because we still get along really well. in spite of all that has been happening in our couple, we generally have enjoyed each other's company. we still do the normal couple things like go out to dinner or make a dinner together, go out with friends and family, cuddle and watch a movie etc. etc. Moreover recently she has been befriending my friends and getting on really well with all of them. after four years of being with her, I'm close with her family and they really like me and always invite  me  to family events. also last night when we went to bed she spooned with me and wanted to be close to me.  (which i mention since it has been a rare thing these days). basically everything has been going well, except for what hasn't if that makes sense.   

so what im trying to say is i'm getting very mixed signals here. i know there is something wrong in our relationship but i dont know if its enough to end it like this.
 The thing is, it could very well be that she wants to do this three month internship and still maintain our relationship long distance even though we have been having problems. I think i might have a paranoid bias in all this which is why i asked for other opinions in the first place. anyway a long distance relationship between us is definitely plausible seeing as in the past we have had to have a long-distance relationship for up to 5 months.   

Or she could want to end things. Or taking a more 'middle' view of things: maybe a short break is what she needs to get over her problems? my honest opinion on this is that we can stick it out together. it may be rough but we have stuck it out in the past over rough things.

also im in the first year of grad school here and i would like to think she cares enough not to emotionally fuck me over so that i fail out. compounding all of this, is the fact that she and I live in an apartment owned by her parents. so basically i have been living and studying rent-free for the past 1.5 years. (in a foreign country). so i would really like your opinions.

TL;DR: I think my girlfriend will be leaving for another country in a month for a short term internship. I dont know if our relationship will remain in place or not.  Need your thoughts."
12f5ux,10,2012-10-31,Soon-to-be CNC student looking to prepare myself,csobod,CNC,https://www.reddit.com/r/CNC/comments/12f5ux/soontobe_cnc_student_looking_to_prepare_myself/,"After waffling between dozens of aptitudes for the past several years, I decided on a career path that I can stick with. I'm going to be attending school for a certificate in CNC Machining and using the credits to simultaneously finish my Associate Degree in Applied Sciences.

I've got the little things covered for school and shop work: prescription safety glasses, steel toed boots, shop apron, etc. But that's not nearly what I'm looking for more information on.

What supplementary texts would be of use to me? Any real essentials? What textbooks did you have in school that you really valued?

I've desperately been trying to find a low position (even an unpaid internship) at a shop, but no such luck. There isn't a lot to choose from in my immediate area, and it'd be real tough to afford gas for a two hour commute if I'm not even getting paid. What would be my best strategy for finding some shop work?

I'm planning on simultaneously attending i3, a local makerspace, while I go to school. I figure that would be a pretty good leg up (although someone had mentioned to me that it would poison career options because local shops prefer to mold their acquisitions from a blank slate, lest they hire on a ""know-it-all""). Is this something that would help me or would it hurt my chances of finding work?

Lastly, a two-part question: what advice would you give to a budding CNC machinist that you wish someone gave to you, and do you believe the industry's hiring options in America are dying?"
12eq2k,1,2012-10-31,The invention side of entrepreneurship or: how I learned to stop worrying and love the job,ortegasb,Entrepreneurship,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneurship/comments/12eq2k/the_invention_side_of_entrepreneurship_or_how_i/,"In 2008, I partnered with an inventor. I was a Junior in college and had just joined the Small Business Entrepreneurship Center as an intern. The program connected me to an older guy that had some napkin sketches who had just entered a competition and needed a quick business plan and slide deck. Eager to please, I jumped right in despite having no experience to speak of. 

After meeting with the inventor and hearing the idea, I had a funny feeling creep over me. Like that first moment you met your significant other, I knew I wanted this idea in my life. I had no idea what inventing, or more, starting a business entailed but I knew I'd be doing it. 

So I signed on--hook line and sinker. He would take care of the product development and I the business side of things. I wrote the business plan, built the slide deck and we finished as finalists in the competition. That only emboldened my resolve and I dropped my major (Philosophy, what a shame) to begin taking strictly entrepreneurship classes which my university was fortunate enough to have through the engineering department. 

I entered the school's start-up competition, and started putting 40 hour weeks into developing the idea. I built teams from each class to write feasibility studies, marketing plans, ip strategies, etc. Eventually, we won the competition and the inventor was able to scratch together enough money to build a prototype. 

At this point, I was living off student loans so it wasn't much of a big deal to commit myself entirely to the project. However, once I finished up my senior year I had a decision to make: continue on an academic course I didn't much care for, or drop out and see what I could do with this still fledgling idea. 

I dropped out and moved to a small downtown apartment with my girlfriend. Money was extremely tight (the inventor was covering an hourly wage) but I had equity in something that could be huge. On and on we struggled, perfecting the design, getting validation from the market, laying out a strategy and cleaning up the documentation to make us investable. 

After 3 years, things were looking pretty ugly. I was a month behind on my share of the rent, my girlfriend had terrible pneumonia which required hospital visits, and I got the car impounded for driving without a license I had lost because I couldn't pay my registration tickets. 

And then I closed our first investor. It wasn't a huge investment but it was the first true fiscal validation we'd received from an outside party. We were able to get ourselves out of the financial hole we'd dug ourselves into, build some marketing units and hit the road to present our product to the market. 

To the uninitiated, spending is a funny thing. After creating a back-log of all the things you need to do over the past three years, being given the sudden ability to do so can be a dangerous thing. We went to a few too many trade shows, stayed on the road a bit too long, and make some purchases that could have waited. 

But the feedback! It was like a drug to hear all these people praising our product after hiding in a garage for so long. People truly seemed to love the invention but whether it was the economy, buying cycle, infancy of the company, whatever, nobody made the commitment to buy. 

So, because we were still novices, we pushed harder and faster, instead of smarter and more precisely. Of course, the money ran out. The stress started building, I became a very depressive type, not much fun to be around. I ended a really good relationship, moved out of my apartment and moved in with the inventor because I had nowhere else to go. 

In my misery, I gained fortitude. I rekindled the passion I had for the project and started turning over every rock I could find to help progress the project. Not long after I started looking, I found a casting call for a new show on the History Channel and got an interview. We were able to wow them and I went down to film the show. It came out a few months later and I was able to use it to raise some small investments to keep the lights on and momentum going. 

I built a sales team of commissioned reps and started giving them the support they needed. Now, I have our first letter of intent for a major order and things are looking up. 

The simple fact of the matter is that entrepreneurship entails failure. In the beginning, the failures are minor and easily surmountable. As you put more and more of yourself into your business, those failures hit closer to home and you will constantly want to quit. You might lose some really good things in your life but if you really care about what you're trying to do, you'll push on anyways. No set-back is too devastating, no obstacle too large.

In these times where the people, whether it be in mainstream media, in the Middl East, or social media, are gaining a voice and standing up for what they believe in, the fans of O&amp;A must stand together and rise up against this injustice that is an uninteresting, entitled, unmotivated former-intern that is wrecking havoc on what is one of the only joys in our lives.

________________________________________________

It is quite obvious that the show, whether talent or staff, or fan, are fed up with this fag-cunt and the entire organization needs a push in the right direction.

WHY keep this man on staff? So we can POSSIBLY relate to the younger crowd, the one's with the skinny jeans and the dildos up their asses into the O&amp;A crowd, who will bastardize the program in whatever way they can?

I'd much rather hear intern Rob host the show of lies for 88 months straight than hear Sal say, ""uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh..........uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh"", on the air again, unprofessional terd.

For all of you with your ignored tweets, unresponded facebook messages, and complaints that were received by deaf ears,

this is our time, we stand up today and say NO MORE, GET THIS FUCK OUT OF OUR EARS, OUT OF OF O&amp;A, AND OUT OF OUR LIVES!

12dkjm,4,2012-10-30,"Cleaning out my closet and discussing general stuff : porn, love, society, ED, seduction...",[deleted],NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/12dkjm/cleaning_out_my_closet_and_discussing_general/,"Hello guys,

Fist things first, this is my first post on Reddit. I had been lurking for a while, and I would have never subscribed if it hadn't been for this subreddit. I find it awesome to have all those stories in the same place, all those testimonies, and all this information, that just need to be read, analyzed and used... Keep it up !

I needed to formulate things. I needed to clean my closet. It took me 5 days to write the following 6 pages (mind you, I had other things to do). If you care to read it, I hope it will be food for your thoughts as much as your stories have been for me. I have one flaw, though, which is that I talk too much, so I might seem off-topic from times to times... However, I think there will be a great amount of information to pick up here. And I have my own problems. Any suggestion, any help is welcome.

I would like to say that I have started NoFap for a rather unusual reason. I've stopped masturbating because I just didn't have the motivation anymore. I have a strong case of ED and I'm tired of trying to even pretend that I can do it.

I'll add an arrow besides topics where I try to talk about general things, and I won't besides topics where I talk about myself, in case you would not be interested. 

Also, if you think this is too general to be posted here, just tell me.

**BACKGROUND** 

I'm 23 years old, I've been diagnosed with depression 3 years ago, I've seen a psychatrist and been under medication since then. Doing a therapy has been one of the most inspiring things I've done, I strongly suggest it to anyone that would be currently hesitating about it.

I come from a rather strict family, with strong moral values and with a bit of religious values. My mother died when I was 11. As a widower, my father taught his children that there was the true and sacred love, and that sex outside this true love was dirty and disgusting. Also, I went to a moderate catholic school, which I have nothing to complain about, except for having taught me that masturbating was wrong.

**FAPPING &amp; PORN**

I hit puberty very lately compared to my schoolmates, due to the trauma caused by the death of my mom (I basically stopped growing up for three years). I tried to fap for the first time at 13ish, when I was still prepubescent, out of curiosity, because I was hearing my friends talking about it. 

I've always felt guilty about it, for the reasons I've mentionned above (sex is disgusting, masturbating is wrong). Also, I've understood a few years ago, that I did not allow myself to have pleasure without feeling guilt. Fapping is too much of a relief when you're supposed to mourn the loss of someone. And yet, it's a relief you can't deprive yourself of. 

In the meantime, I was scared of girls, and I still had this strong disgust thinking about sex. I started watching pornography at the age of 19, thinking that it was not normal to be as disgusted at the sight of a vagina as I was. 

It worked quite alright, because it really helped me tearing down some of my moral presuppositions about sex and relationships. I got a bit more confident and less scared of girls. But I could not have sex. Even though I was not disgusted by the organs, I was still scared of the real intercourse.

**WHAT FAPPING PROVIDES** ← 

Do you guys think that sex and fapping are the same feeling ? Some say yes. I for one would say it is totally different.

When having sex, have you ever felt as if your body did not contain your soul anymore ? It's like that for me. When I climax, I literally can't think straight for something like 15 minutes afterwards, I'm just smiling with my eyes wide open. My previous girlfriends have always found it quite funny.

I'm French (hence my scholar English). The French have an idiom for the orgasm : *la petite mort*. The little death. It refers to the spiritual release you get when you have an orgasm. That's a heavy form of pleasure which has a scary side. Losing control, dying. Who wants to lose control ? Who wants to die anyway ? 

Fapping provides a way of relieving the pressure without losing control. You know what to expect and you know how to do it. You just need 5 minutes. You do your thing, clean up, throw your napkin away and move on with your life. It's a very safe and rewarding feeling you get out of something that should be an adventure. It's like watching TV when it's sunny outside. Well, at first, fapping is a way to discover yourself, your body and your access to pleasure. At first, fapping is an adventure. We should not make an habit out of it though. That's the mistake I've done.

That's something about which I disagree with a lot of you fapstronauts. You tend to say that NoFap is about getting back the control of your life, I personaly think it's dealing with the fact that you don't control everything. To begin with, you don't totally control yourself.

**LOVE** ← 

Since I was diagnosed  with depression, I've been trying to change. I've tried to question everything, to understand everything. It has not actually been about changing to become who I wanted to be, but it's been about discovering who I really was, what I really needed, and becoming able to leave according to myself.

I've discovered how love and feelings were important. Not only do they make sex better, but they also can be vital to a sexual intercourse. It all depends on the way you relate to sex. My psychatrist told me a few months ago that there is a huge difference in the way women and men deal with sexuality. They don't have the same access to pleasure. Men need to have an orgasm during an intercourse, else they only get frustrated. Women don't get an orgasm as easily, and they often won't. So they know have to rely on other stuff. On foreplay, of course, but also on other aspects of the relationship : feelings, love, activities...

The thing is, all every man and every woman are not as described above. Some men have a rather feminine sexuality, some women have a rather masculine sexuality. 

**SOCIETAL PORNOGRAPHY** ← 

The problem is that that's not what we are told. We are told to fit in the models that will make us consume... 

We frequently hear that porn is not real sex ; but when was actually the last time you saw something real on TV, in the news, in books, or on the Internet ? I believe that the mass media, along with trends such as advertising, feminism, egalitarianism... , have resulted in standards to emerge, and those standards also corrupt the way we see things. We see beautiful, sexy and flawless people everywhere. If you feel insecure, you'll start thinking you can't succeed in this society.

Everybody is lying about that. You just need to listen to your friends talking about sex, about their stamina, the size of their dick and how they make women come, then type « erectile dysfunction » on the Internet, where everyone is anonymous an can speak shamelessly about their problems, to see how biased we are.

All I'm saying is that NoFap should be a first step towards being a real freethinker, not only a porn-conscious person.

**SEX DRIVE, PLEASURE, ERECTIONS...  AND DEPRESSION**

Now, depression is known to kill your sex drive and your pleasure, and antidepressants are known to kill your erections. Which is what leads me to the crucial part...

**ED** (where any advice is welcome)

So... Where to begin... 

Like I was saying, I've always felt insecure about sex. My first time, 2 years ago, was chaotic (or should I say « my first times ») ?  I was with a girlfriend I really liked, and I had strong feelings for her. We had been together for 2 months. I was 21, she was 20 and it was her fist time as well. Couldn't have been worse. We managed to have a normal sexual life for a few weeks after that. I just needed to understand that having sex was not about pounding her in a porno-like way (it made me come in a few seconds anyway).

The shit hit the fan after a few months, when we started over-capitalizing the sexual part of our relationship. We were both rather insecure about it, and yet we were thinking it was the most important thing to do. I wish I could go back in time, because I really screwed up. We ended up having sex with minimal foreplay, when we did not want to, when we could not, we started taking no more pleasure about it, and we started feeling guilty about not making it work. 

Somehow, we managed to get back to a rather normal sexuality, by rediscovering foreplay. But the deed was done, I think. I could not get it hard anymore. We broke up after a 6-month relationship, and sex must have been the major issue in my decision. I had managed to become even more insecure about sex. I also had to increase the dose of antidepressants.

Consciously or unconsciously, I destroyed every relationship I had in the year and a half following, and it was always about my erectile dysfunction and the fears it induced in me. I would meet a girl, start dating her, eventually end up in bed with her – despite trying my best to postpone it, then I would not get it hard, feel like shit about it, start stressing and dump her over something else a few days after.

My psychatrist has diagnosed me with a fear of castration. I won't detail this, unless you want me to, but it makes great sense. 

**HOW I STARTED NOFAP**

I was still PMO at least once a day, even though my sex-drive was going downhill. I started not being able to get it hard on my own, I started having premature ejaculations alone (basically, I would come with half a boner, which sucks big time, I swear). 

And I discovered NoFap a few months ago. Yet, I kept on masturbating as a way to pretend to have some kind of sex-drive whatsoever. I was thinking that if you don't try, you don't get anything, right ?

Then I met this girl. The type of girl that makes you want to make it work. I usually don't masturbate when I'm in a relationship, and I decided it was the right time to do it. On the 31st of July, I stopped fapping. It did not do much, I must say. Picture yourself getting a blow job by a girl you genuinely love, being unable to have an erection, and the girl is just like ""what the fuck ? am I doing it wrong ?""... And yet, she was really patient and careful, and we ended up having sex. It was the first time in one year, and I hadn't masturbated for 30 days. After a very, very heavy foreplay, it was my best love-making ever (even though it did not last too long). 

I wish I could say that my ED was all about the first time anxiety, but I can't lie. This awesome sex session was a one time thing. We tried twice on the following days, and it was lame. The first time, I did not come, the second time, I had a premature ejaculation (after hours of not being able to pop a boner). What happens is that, when things get sexy, boner-killing images and thoughts pop in my brain, like work, family. Once again, picture yourself getting a blow job, and starting to think about your father or your boss. Damn.

I started stressing beyond all reason. It became the only thing I could focus on in the relationship, and I was genuinely terrified. I talked about it to my psychatrist and to my doctor. I even tried to get a second opinion by my step-mother, who is a doctor as well, and I swear I was on the verge of cracking in tears. She told me it sounded like a phobia.

I managed to focus back on the things which made me love her. But very soon, she left the town. I wanted a long-distance relationship, she did not. I can't help but think that if I had been making love to her properly, she would have thought about it twice. I can't help but hate myself about that.

On the 8th of September (the day when she told me she wanted to break-up), just before going to her place, I knew there had been too much stress and distance, I knew something bad was to come. I masturbated. Then she broke my heart. I haven't masturbated since then. I haven't even felt like it, to be honest.

**DAY 53**

On the 28th of September, I left my home town for an internship. I found myself alone in a city I don't know, where I have a few acquaintances but nobody really close, suffering from oneitis. On top of that, just before leaving, I asked my psychatrist to lower the doses, because, well, there was nothing left to lose. I've been feeling castrated,  emotionally crippled, I've met quite a few nice and good-looking girls that seemed interested by me, but I've basically behaved like the jaded guy I am. But I'm doing better now. And I'm proud to hold tight. Step by step, I'm getting my confidence back.

As far as no fap is concerned, I have something like one wet dream every 3-4 nights. I've always had lots of wet dreams, which are entertaining and relaxing, but which are always about premature ejaculation, shame and awkwardness. I fear that it somehow prevents my sex-drive from increasing, but I guess my brain is doing his work on his own. I sometimes wake up with morning wood, but I don't have random boners. I would do anything to though. When I touch it, my dick still feels insensitive, as if it was dead.

**THINGS TO COME** 

Anyway, I'll keep on counting my days without fapping, because even though it's quite easy at the moment, it's an achievement in itself. What is the worst that can happen anyway ? I know that some day will come when I feel the urge to fap and when NoFap really becomes a challenge.

In the meantime, I'm done focusing on it. I'm exhausted of being ashamed and frightened about it. I'm worth more than my temporarily dead dick. 

I swear it guys, I'll get my dick back. But before that, I'll get my Mojo, I'll find another girlfriend (for now, I still would just like to get back with the previous one, you know...), even though I'm planning on not having sex until I'm able to face it. I'll assume that, and I'll make them love me for that.

**SEDUCTION** ← 

And this leads me to the last issue I wanted to discuss.

Like I was saying, I've read some stuff about social engineering, self-improvement, and especially PUA. I must say that PUA, along with NoFap, have something that can't work with me. They both, in their own way, use sex-drive as a leverage to achieve things. And yet, there are great things to learn about them.

Through my 3 years of depression and 2 years of ED, I've met quite a lot of girls (although I haven't had sex with a lot of them...). They've all been careful, patient and lovely. I've managed to seduce them without the least sex-drive, and I've been rewarded. I didn't have to give them great sex to keep them satisfied, they really liked me for who I was. I've understood a few days ago that if it hadn't worked out, it was because I was the one hating myself. For all those who suffer from ED, don't ever think that you won't be able to make someone happy. You are awesome, just be patient and honest with them as well as with yourself. "
