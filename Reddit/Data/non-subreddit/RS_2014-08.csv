2cahff,2,2014-07-31,My [F/24] break up with my boyfriend [M/30] due to work and long distance - calling all Redditors with LDR perspective,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2cahff/my_f24_break_up_with_my_boyfriend_m30_due_to_work/,"Reddit,


I've just gone through a bad break up and want some perspective. My ex and I have been dating for over 11 months. We were friends for over a year before we started dating and things progressed quite naturally to dating. We're in graduate school together and both very ambitious people. We spent a lot of time in the library but also went on cute dates, etc.


Our relationship was very happy. We were supportive of each other, joked around a lot, made thoughtful gestures, created time for each other, felt secure, low drama, and very attracted to each other. Just seeing him could make me smile and he said he was the happiest he'd ever been. We both had been going through some personal issues and found each other to be instrumental in overcoming them. It took a terribly stressful situation and made it enjoyable whenever he was around. Every day was better because he was in it and I believe him when he told me he felt the same.


When the summer break began, we both went back to our homes. We talked nearly every day (though the conversations tended to be short because of his work schedule), texted generally 6-10 times from the start of work to the end, and generally did our best to make time for each other.  We skyped once a week and sent pictures to each other every morning. I went out to visit him for a couple days and things were perfect (in both of our words). The last two weeks of our relationship, we talked a little less. He said it was because his internship was ending and he was trying to finish up some major projects because he was trying to make a good impression in order to get a job. I wasn't happy about the smaller amount of contact, but we planned to be back together in 3 weeks and so I viewed it as a temporary problem. 


When I told him I felt under-prioritized, he broke up with me. I was floored. This hadn't been on the table at all before. He told me he agreed that he'd been under-prioritizing me, hadn't been giving me his best, and he couldn't see how that would be different after graduation. He told me he loved me (it was the first time either of us had said it to each other) but that he wanted to break up now because it would hurt less than breaking up in a year. He said it wasn't something that he had planned at all but that he's felt an increasing sense of fear and guilt. He brought up that the odds were stacked against us (our homes are 18 hours away, meaning one of us would have to move for the other). However, previously we'd talked about it and both agreed if it was a good relationship then, we'd both consider moving because the relationship was good enough to be fought for.


I gave him 5 days to cool off with no contact and then asked to talk again. He immediately agreed and was amicable for the first half of the conversation. I said pretty much everything I needed to. I started with an apology if my original tone upset him and told him I wanted a conversation, not to accuse him of anything. I care about him a lot and was clear that I missed him and was sorry if I had been too harsh; the distance was hard and I could have handled it better. I also said: long distance is hard and no one really chooses it, our relationship would look different having dated 2 years rather than 1, we both love each other and this is a happy relationship, we both said the school year and summer were better because we treasured our interactions with each other, it didn't make sense to throw away the best part of your life because you're afraid of losing it later, etc. He told me he wouldn't have any doubts if we'd be in the same city but that he didn't think he was worth moving for (as I am very attached to my home) and that he wouldn't be able to get a job here (the job market is a little scary for our field).


The conversation ended with him saying he didn't have answers to my questions and he knew that was frustrating. I asked him if he was happy with this outcome and he said no. I asked if he could see him changing his mind and he said no. I asked him to tell me if he had just fallen out of love with me and he said no, and that he didn't like that I wasn't trusting the answers he was giving me.


The biggest underlying issue that came up in the conversation was that his company expects a LOT out of new employees. Basically, everyone there works from 9 am - 9 pm or later. They come in on the weekends and are expected to be nearly constantly available. It's an all-consuming life style that is compensated well but is very draining. Most people stay for under 5 years. I asked him if he had just decided to prioritize his career and this was the lifestyle he wanted. He told me he hates the city, the type of work, and the demands of the job. He thinks he's going to be miserable. However, he's being very fatalistic about not having other offers yet (even though this is a year away) and refuses to consider other avenues than this one. He said he couldn't date someone who lived in the same building as him, let alone 18 hours away. He really didn't want to talk about the topic.


I guess, here are my questions. Please answer any ones you're interested in:


 * Has anyone ever done a pre-emptive break up due to an impending long distance relationship for someone that they truly loved and would have stayed with if it hadn't been for the distance? We've been together 10 months, and still had another year in the same city, so it's not like we're some fledgling couple.


 * Are there some people that just truly aren't able to handle long distance?


 * It sounds like he's in a ""career crisis"" but won't let me help him. Is that just me trying to rationalize all this?


 * I KNOW he didn't cheat (for personal reasons) and he values honesty and truthfulness a lot. Do you think his explanations could be bullshit anyway? He seems honest and I am inclined to believe him but some of this stuff just doesn't seem to add up.


 * He's 30 and I'm the first serious relationship he's had in almost 6 years. Do you think that the lack of experience, coupled with fear of getting hurt, just made him freeze up?


 * In my head, I know I'll be okay but my emotions haven't caught up yet. Any advice on how to deal with a fairly amicable split, with him still saying that he loves me and could see me as a wife?


 * I want to carry a torch and hope he'll come back but this probably is a bad approach... right?


 * Any other thoughts, insights, or stories would be greatly appreciated. I know I'll be okay but for the moment I feel pretty broken up over this. I'm dreading seeing him in 2 weeks.


---   
**tl;dr**: Relationship of nearly one year ended after a short term long distance (with a longer period looming in the future). Ex said he loved me for the first time and could see a future with me but feels like it's hopeless to try with the job he thinks he'll have. He hates the job but refuses to look elsewhere. No idea what to do now."
2callp,1,2014-07-31,Started getting migraines. Followed up by social anxiety. Outlook is suffering.,Norgrim,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/2callp/started_getting_migraines_followed_up_by_social/,"Hey guys, 

So it's been a crazy three weeks. Just some history info, I was depressed for a couple years which I took Wellbutrin extended release for. Wellbutrin worked really well for me, I stopped taking it 18 months ago. 

Three weeks ago I was sitting at my desk and felt a huge rush of numbness go up my neck, temples started throbbing, lost my depth perception, went into a full blown panic attack because I thought I was having an aneurysm or something. The panic attack was a first for me, the paramedics came and talked me down and I went home. 

Days passed and the tension was still in my temples, jaw, and neck. I had a few more panic attacks due to my vision blurring and loosing my depth perception. After a couple ER visits and primary care visits I finally got around to see a neurologist who explained that I had started getting migraines from tension and anxiety. The migraines make sense because both of my parents get them and I guess I'm at the appropriate age to start getting them (23). 

What's the most confusing thing ever is the anxiety that I'm experiencing. I've been pretty good at dealing with stress these last few years and I've found a lot of academic success and financial success. This whole issue came out of nowhere and it's been tormenting me every day. I have trouble being around groups of friends, coworkers, can't use the restroom in public, fucking loose it when multiple people are laughing about something. And if the tension from the anxiety gets bad then a migraine starts up.  

The anxiety and the migraines started at the same time so the cause and effect game has been difficult to figure out. 

I was using marijuana legally about five times a week for joint pain, usage had gone up a lot when I started working a 9-5 paid internship. And then the weekend prior (4th of July) I had a half of a double strength Bhang Bar just for some extra relaxation. I'm mentioning this because I read somewhere that 4% of marijuana users can develop social anxiety disorder. Other than weed, I have a couple cups of coffee a week and work out a lot. 

I tried taking Elavil but that back fired and made me really depressed. I'm seeing my psychiatrist tomorrow and I'm hoping to get some answers. I've had to leave my internship early because I need to figure this out before my last semester of school in 3 weeks. 

Has anyone else had a similar experience? What has helped?"
2caqs4,4,2014-07-31,How do I become an employable mobile developer?,[deleted],androiddev,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/2caqs4/how_do_i_become_an_employable_mobile_developer/,"I have a degree in Computer Science, I have released one (unmarketed, unmonetized) app in the Play Store. I would like to stop working minimum wage labor jobs and start my career in development. I had to put myself through school so I couldn't take on any summer internships and, as I'm a recent grad, my relevant work history is basically non-existant.

Where do I go from here? Try to monetize and market my app? I've sent close to thirty or so applications to full or part-time/contract positions. Tried freelance but no biters there either. It seems people only want developers with two or three years of Android experience, so how am I supposed to make a living while getting that experience?

Maybe I'm just not that good and should release more apps, but it's hard to program while trying to make a living working minimum wage.

How did you guys get into the field?

Ninja Edit: Here's my app and the java source on github, any critiques or advice on how to improve is also appreciated! :)

2cb2ei,7,2014-08-01,Seeking career advice: Just got offered a full time position in Big 4 Audit. Should I choose the financial services team?,mynameismud12,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/2cb2ei/seeking_career_advice_just_got_offered_a_full/,"Okay so I'm currently interning at a Big 4 firm. I have already been extended a full time offer which I plan on accepting. Now, my office divides its audit practice into two groups: financial services (banking and insurance) and the ""other"" group (manufacturing, real estate, universities, and anything else you can think of that isn't banking or insurance).

I now have a pretty tough choice to make as to which team I want to join. There are a couple factors that are in effect here.

1.) The hours/travel - This seems kind of silly given it's big 4, but I would like to choose the team that travels less and works less hours. During my internship I talked with an associate who told me that the FS team works less than the ""other"" team. He said FS clients usually always have 12/31 year ends, while non-FS clients have year ends scattered throughout the year, leading to more of a year-round busy season type of deal.

2.) Exit opportunities - I would like to learn more about finance during my big 4 experience. Investments, the stock market, asset management, and so forth. I'm only looking to stay in Big4 for 2-4 years, and after that I would like a job that leans more towards finance.

Choosing Financial Services sounds like a no-brainer here, but I've heard that auditing FS clients can be a nightmare (this was from the internet, not specific to my office). Contrary to what my co-worker told me, I've heard that auditors on FS clients work way more hours than non-FS clients. I've also heard that you won't really learn anything about finance on FS, and that the work is very monotonous and tedious. I only read this on the internet however, so I have no idea if its true or not. 

I would appreciate any insight you guys can offer, specifically from auditors who work in financial services. "
2cb46d,2,2014-08-01,[CC] Starpath,LeThrownAway,WritingPrompts,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/2cb46d/cc_starpath/,"&gt; So... I haven't responded to a writing prompt before. In advance, this I feel my writing is rather cliche, but I would appreciate pointers on particular places. Especially in the story line. A few notes of what was intentional: I was intentionally vague about several details throughout the story, names, professions, locations. There is supposed to be some symbolism, and I regret any overzealous ""tear-jerky"" elements. Regardless, I'm open to all criticism. 

Here is the prompt it's based on:
&gt;WP: ""The stars never came out last night."" 

The night has been pretty consistent throughout my life. I live in a region where the wind and the mountains normally drive the clouds away. I was once told to take the bright dots above me as a constant reminder of all of the paths I could take. I cannot remember an overcast night in my entire childhood. My friends tell me that it's because of a tendency towards confirmation bias I have. Perhaps that is the case. I wouldn't know.  
 
I remember that as I grew up the sky was never quite like it had been in those vibrant years. I remember climbing the mountains with my friends and running through the cracks and crevices. I laughed at them when they were worrywarts. There was a cliff face to a plateau that they were always too scared to climb. I remember those nights where I would just lie down up there, staring at the galaxy. I was tiny, barely in grade school. There were nights when it began to rain, but I cannot recall a storm then that lasted a full night.  
 
The first person to ever climb it with me was my first girlfriend, a summer back in my school years. She was scared, but I told her about the view. I proposed to lie there and look up at the galaxy, where the lights of the town and nearby city wouldn't interfere. I held her hand and pulled her up along with me. I knew the climb like the back of my hand. I wasn't too worried. That night was one of the first I remember being distinctly different. The stars were there, or most of them at least, but the galaxy behind them seemed to have faded and they all seemed somehow dimmer. 
 
We had a beautiful time together regardless. I told her we'd go back there again and I'd show her on a better day, and the following week we did. It was another night, but it was still so beautiful, looking back upon it. But I was disappointed. So I told her we'd go back again and again we did to similar results. I told her we'd go back again and she told me we would. So we told one another, but a week passed and then another as we were both busy and schoolwork began to pile up. We grew tired and busy and distant. We quarreled and eventually we agreed it would be best to separate for a bit. That did not end, but we soon moved on, and I met others, although in the future I left my plateau to myself. I remember for a day the sky seemed to me to be a bit brighter again, but thinking of it, it might have just been me.  
 
As I went on to university, I moved away. I decided to study in the middle of nowhere, I didn't want to live around with the city life. That's not really me, I guess. That's not to say it was a bad university, certainly not, one of the best in the country. But it was relaxing and beautiful and on some nights I would leave to go to the forest a short drive away and go hiking in the dark. It would remind me of home, the dark vibrant hue of the trees in the night left me with many fond memories, yet I continued to look up to the sky. It wasn't quite as pretty as it had been at home, and there was no lack of nights with occasional clouds. Ultimately, it made me of life as it used to be.  
 
I was still in my first year, undecided just like her. It may seem a bit cliché, but I immediately saw we had something. We would talk for hours, explore with each other. We were both interested in the same ideas and areas. We quarreled and we dealt with it. We were busy and we learned to accept it. We became close and by the end of the summer, I knew I wanted to make a good future for myself, and that was what mattered. She told me years later that I was the reason she decided to pursue her interests. She was the reason I chose to pursue a stable and profitable job.  
 
I won't complain about my choice. To be entirely honest, I can't quite imagine what my life would have been like without it, and I guess that is a somewhat scary thought as I sit here looking up. I don't know where my life may have gone, perhaps I would have never lasted with her or perhaps I would have been able to spend a bit more time with her. I do not hold any regrets over my decision however. It is my philosophy in life that we must stick accept the choices we have made and focus on the present. I remember looking once more to the sky on the day I made the decision finally. I chose it specifically to look at the meteor shower I had found out about earlier that week. 
 
College was exhausting. I remember the hours of work I began to put in. I stayed in school longer than she did, but she rented a place nearby and found a job temporarily. I didn't quite know where I meant to go with life, but in my eyes I had a goal and an opportunity. I stayed in my room studying often long into the night. I worked through it though, as many years as it may have been. As my internship ended I received a job offer willing to pay a far greater than I had ever expected from across the country. I chose to move to the city to do it; it still in many senses reminded me of my home and the freedom of it. Besides, I always had to beach to look out at the sky from.  
 
She loved her job, but I told her about what an incredible opportunity it was for us. She wasn't easily convinced but I could tell she knew it was best for both of us. She smiled and took my hand. She never did find another job like that one, but she did find a stable one alongside me in the city, where we worked every day. It was a few years after that that she was to have a child. We agreed to stop at one, so we could still pursue our dreams. The night he was born made me overwhelmed, with joy. We gave him my own father's name. We were happy. I remember our first day outside together, a bit afterwards, quite fondly. It was with the city lights all around us from a balcony overlooking the cars below us. I whispered to him, much like my father once told me, that the lights of the city tonight were as bright as his future, to take every lamp and headlight at a path he could take. 
 
The next year I flew back home with her. The town was bigger, the roads were different, at least in material, and the houses were perhaps a little bigger, but it would always be the town I grew up in to me. She had never seen it, yet I had told her so much about it. I brought her to the cliff I had climbed many years before. I set out to climb it again, this time with her. I was confident that I would be able to, and reminiscently I told her about the view. The rocks were smaller than I had remembered them years ago. I would set it off to the next day, but I will say how utterly committed I was. With her the next day I climbed, and to her the view of the overlook I showed. You could see the meadows and the town as a little bright dot far below us. We climbed together, although the night was foggy then, it was nonetheless beautiful.  
 
A week later we flew back. My position technically offered a fair bit of vacation time, but I felt somewhat morally obligated to go back, and hers was a little more restrictive. Not to mention we had left our son with her grandparents. I was so tired on the flight back. I remember I slept all the way through it, as the sun shined in my eyes that evening we took off before I closed my window. I opened my eyes as we were descending while she didn't know. I noticed her face looking down at the city and opened my window as we passed through the clouds in the dark. She always did tell me about how the city lights, which below us shined in the distance, wouldn't let her sleep, which I thought at the look of her forced smile at me as the runways going in every direction created a grid in front of us.  
 
That night I comforted her. My little boy asked me what was wrong. He always seemed to be worried about us, even as a tiny boy. Of course I told him nothing. Really, that's how I felt. He believed me.  
 
I no longer looked to the stars much. I knew where I was going, what path I was taking, and I did not need a guide. When I did look up it seemed I could only see a few of the once bright stars shining through the city lights. I watched as my son grew up. I did everything I could to support him, and I think I gave him the best life I might have offered.  
 
The day he left for college was one of the happiest days of my life for him. For the first year he didn't call much, perhaps every month. We didn't mind, we understood the freedom. He decided the next year to call us every week. He followed in my footsteps, my profession, and he studied for quite a few years. He was great and I was so proud. The day he finished was the one I retired. I told my wife we'd explore the world together. We moved to a city in another country we'd always liked. She joked that she could never understand how I liked it, where a clean sky was almost famously rare. She loved it. Together we visited dozens of countries across the world. He called us still, almost every week, although the calls gradually fell off. 
 
We didn't hear much from him anymore by the time it happened. I wish I had been there for him, so stressed all the time, so tired. I told him to relax occasionally. There wasn't really anyone there for him when he did it. She didn't say much that I can remember, just cried. I didn't say anything either. I remember going outside that day and staying the entire night, looking up to only one star there, shining brightly.  
 
We didn't move around much after that. As the years passed, everything went back to normal again, or at least as normal as it could be. I hated my frailness, my weakness and every night I would look up to the one star for guidance. The day I could no longer walk alone is to this my most painful memory. Soon, I knew. I asked her to come back to my home with me. She smiled then, one of the most genuine smiles I could remember in a while. We flew back to my once hometown, now perhaps something different, I guess a small city. One night I asked her to come with me. We went out, with her helping me make the steps I had shown her those many years before. We waited with one another on the bottom of the cliff face.  
 
I looked into her face. It was beautiful in the darkness, however worn by the years. Together I held her hand as I looked up. The were no clouds, no light that I could see. My vision had dwindled over these years, but I still saw her and that was what mattered to me. I lied there one more time until the darkness of the night just barely faded. I close my eyes now and think to myself of only that beautiful darkness. For the first time I can remember in my life, the stars never came out last night. "
2cb6t3,1,2014-08-01,"Me [22 M] mutually split with my [21F] of two years, I feel like I have to compete with her...",dnopser,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2cb6t3/me_22_m_mutually_split_with_my_21f_of_two_years_i/,"Okay so I started dating this girl two years ago and at first it was great. I should start by saying that I'm a very shy maybe insecure guy afraid to make the first move. She is a stone cold fox who could really have any guy she wants based off her looks, however she's even more insecure than I am but not near as shy. 

So things were going great at first until she started controlling everything I did. We had a long distance relationship where I would be at college and she would be at home. It worked until she would call and not want to get off the phone for hours.It would even be tough to even hang out with my friends because she didn't want me to enjoy myself without her being there. Caused a lot of fights.

There was plenty other shit like her getting mad for me getting help for an accounting project from one of my former neighbors (a female) because she thought I was hooking up with her instead. I also caught her looking through my phone a couple of times. She was very jealous and controlling. She also would question the female friends I would have one facebook.

As I digress she had serious anger issues in which I would spend days trying to cheer her up by buying her flowers, long winded apologies and offering taking her out to dinner. I always made the mistakes and it was up to me to fix it. I would also always have to attend her family functions and if I wasn't on time she would get upset. 

Although there were times where she was genuinely a sweet girl and I could tell she really loved me, I was afraid to bust her expectations to a point that I was clinically diagnosed with a social anxiety disorder where I would have anxiety attacks before big events (parties, dinners, going out) in fear of what I would do next to piss her off. I loved her so much and was afraid of making her mad and losing her. 

She started bar tending at a popular bar downtown where she made enough money to live on her own. This summer I happened to get a job with her mother and aunt's company so I would move in with her and her other female roommate. 

This is where it starts to go downhill, we are moving into her new place and she gets upset that I want to refer to the new house as ""our room"" or ""our place"" she got very territorial saying it was all hers. Well if i'm sleeping her, paying rent, bills and shitting her it's my place too which cause a big fight. 

She would also have a habit of losing her phone or keys and blaming me for losing them when I knew she lost them and if I wasn't helping look for whatever she would bitch and get mad. But if I were to lose my shit i'm just irresponsible it's not my fault. (MOST OF OUR FIGHTS WERE BECAUSE OF A LACK OF DOUBLE STANDARD)

Also, the amount of shit I was in charge of taking care of for the house which I did was incredible: Installed the A/C unit, moved her dresser from one house to another by myself, set up cable/internet, and icing on the cake she had summer classes in which I wrote her papers and did her quizzes for. 

Now her family loved me and still to this day I see some of them because I work with them now and there's no awkwardness because we like each other and they know how she can get. They loved me even to the point that they gave me an internship where her aunt and mother worked and her step dad would give me an ""allowance"" every week because he thought I was great and empathized with a broke college kid from his alma mater.

So her parents end up paid for our trip to Vegas for her 21st. Before this Vegas trip I have told her about my anxiety where I would get nauseous, with a shortness of breath and lack of appetite but didn't have the stones to tell her it was because of her because she would probably get upset or get mad that I was afraid to tell for the said fact that she would get upset (destructively pissed). 

So we go to Vegas with her family and I am eaten alive by my anxiety. I can't hold anything down to eat, I can't socialize and embarrassed myself by my mental issues. She did try to be supportive and help me out but anybody who has ever gone through anxiety like this knows you just want to be left alone with your thoughts. She couldn't understand and got impatient. 

My anxiety about her demands and expectations really fucked me up. I am still taking therapy about to this day. I felt I had a responsibility to keep her happy and if I didn't she would leave me or cheat on me. 

So now she's 21 and wants to go out to the bars all the time and I would just rather stay in smoke weed and watch something on netflix (i'm a homebody) but that's ""boring"" and ""anti-social."" So a weekend where I worked a festival for three straight days 7am-11pm for my work she tells me I need to finish one of her papers for her class that Monday. I finish it and email it to her, she comes home and says we need to take a break. 

At this point I am just sick of doing all of this shit along with being stressed doing all of this shit for her. So I said fuck it I'm gonna grab some of my shit and leave for a week. She asks why I am taking so much for one week and I tell her that because the next time I am here I plan on moving out for good and breaking up. That's what ended up happening. 

That was a month and a half ago. I think I have done a real good job not having any contact with her, I only made contact to apologize for her cat dying, but I know she is gorgeous and always had guys trying to hit on her. Even when we were dating there were guys totally interested in her but she was always good to show me who they were, what they said and how she told them off. 

However... she's single now and I'm stuck her living with my dad in this small town an hour from the city where all I know is some guys I used to go to high school with. I want to meet new girls, but there is nothing to do and I know her pretty face bar tending in a busy city is single talking to all those guys she would ignore when she was dating me. 

I feel as if I have to compete with her over who is more happier. I enjoy not having to deal with her neediness and melodrama but I also miss having somebody to wake up with and talk to about my day. I miss the companionship and want somebody new for that who isn't gonna use me as a role in their life but love me for who I am and not demand so much. I don't know how to do it though. I need advice. For anybody who reads this I really appreciate it, I don't really know what type of advice. Maybe just assurance or some type of tip or anything. Please help.

tldr: Use to have a super hot needy girlfriend, developed severe anxiety, moved in with her, did everything for her, we broke up and I am jealous that she is hooking up with all these guys and i don't know how to get girls.

The video was sent back from the future and tested, but only made the wizard angrier, and gave it a link for Windows 8.1 in the windows store. 

I am so sorry."

2cbqa9,0,2014-08-01,Can we stop blaming SAF for the squad he left behind,[deleted],reddevils,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddevils/comments/2cbqa9/can_we_stop_blaming_saf_for_the_squad_he_left/,"This keeps happening and it's really starting to bug me, especially since it's not just pundits and other fans saying it but also United fans mentioning it all the time.

Ok granted, the Sir Alex's position was unprecedented, but no one does this with any other club. When Mourinho left Inter and Benitez took over and didn't perform, no one was harping on Mourinho for leaving him ""a broken squad"". That was entirely up to Mourinho he bought and gathered players he knew could do the job for him, and assembled the team accordingly to win trophies. When Benitez came in and couldn't replicate that, the blame wasn't shifted to Mourinho, it stayed with Benitez.

The same goes with United, a lot of people say this is the same squad that had won the title the previous year but let's be honest, barring Van Persie and De Gea, it's still the same squad that had won the title two seasons previous (with a CL final to boost) and if we're being honest is practically the same squad from 09, we've kept that nucleus together since atleast perhaps '07. And they won titles, and were extremely successful. This was the squad Fergie had assembled cause he knew he could get the best out of them, this was the squad he wanted and the squad he succeeded with.

That was his only job, assemble a squad that could do the job, and he did just that. 

I don't know how to put this, but Moyes is a grown man, not just that but a professional with well over 12 years of management on his C.V., he wasn't a fresh intern that needed guiding into the job, he was an experienced manager who was given a job to do and he couldn't do it; he willingly took on the job. A big part of that job was to assemble a squad he knew he could work with and get the best results out of. Now obviously everything's in hindsight now, but not only did he come out and say that this was the squad that won the title so he didn't feel it needed much change he also went against one of Fergie's recommendations and released the key backroom staff who could've helped him get the best out of those players. And then he didn't sign anyone to supplement the team, granted this might be in part Woodward's fault, but on the whole we spent so long chasing Fabregas and Baines, that we ended up settling for Fellaini, a target he wanted, chose, got and who failed for him.

The blame ends and lies with him, you can blame the squad for not performing wholeheartedly but you cannot blame the previous manager especially since we all know under Fergie 7th wouldn't even be fathomable, he'd have poisoned the squad in November sooner than let them under-perform. "
2cc91z,1,2014-08-01,Quarter Life Crisis.,jcp5,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2cc91z/quarter_life_crisis/,"I am a 24 year old engineering postgrad. I am going through a terrible and crippling phase in my life. The thing is, i went to one of the best engineering undergrad programs, didn't like it much and did badly there. I did an internship during that time which i completely hated. But i still decided to do a masters because there is nothing i am particularly interested in and i thought why not go with engineering. 

When i started my postgrad in a lesser known state school, i already felt like a failure. Once i started, the courses were really easy and quality of students around me was really poor, which made me even more depressed. I slowly went back to my old ways (in a shell, being alone all the time, smoking, ignoring coursework). It is been one year since and i still have a 3.6 GPA. But all i really did during that time was study a day before the exam, cram the material up and do ok. 

But i then had to apply for a summer internship which i felt i was completely unprepared for, since i hadn't really been paying attention in school all throughout my undergrad and masters. So i didn't apply anywhere and am sitting at home right now. Now i feel like i will never be able to have a full time job since i don't really know much and don't have the skills to do the job. Although i still have one year left in my postgrad programme.

I feel like a fraud and completely inable to do anything. Depression, fear, loneliness, have overtaken me and the task ahead seems impossible. I get so anxious when i start to study that i end up having to quit. All of my friends and classmates have started with their careers whereas i am still struggling. I have had no hobbies and interests for the last three years and haven't accomplished much during this time. I have absolutely no life and feel like an outsider everywhere i go. And its not that i have a poor personality or anything, but just that nothing (including people) interests me anymore. The thought of ending up being a failure scares the shit out of me and unfathomable. But i am completely stripped of my confidence and fearful of even the simplest of tasks. I have always been very ambitious, but i don't know what to do now.

I'm a college grad starting a job in about 3 weeks time. I'll be earning 80k per annum.  

I have a couple of student loans: $**18000 @ 5.75%** and $**9000 @ 6.25%** with two different co-signers.  

I recently got a Chase Freedom credit card approved and my credit score was **723**. Credit Karma estimates my score at 713.  

I have managed to save around $10000 from a couple of internships.  

I will definitely be needing a car to commute to work and this will be my **first car**.  

I think these are my two options:  

**1. Get a used car with cash:**  

I've done some research. I'll probably get a used 2009-2010 year econobox for around 9-10k. I can use my saved up money + signing bonus for this.  

**2. Get a car-loan to finance a new car:**  

**This is where I need advice.**  
My credit score as I already mentioned, is around 720 and my credit history is pretty short, say about 1 year long.
I've come to the assumption that car loan interest rates are generally lower or at least lower than the rates on my two student loans.  
I'm not really sure what kind of interest rates I'm eligible for.  
And I definitely don't want to be begging for a co-signer again.  

My initial plan was to get a new car and use my saved up money to pay off one of my student loans (9000 @ 6.25%)  

What would your suggestion be?  
What kind of interest rates do you think I could get on a new car-loan considering my credit score and history?"
2ccyim,2,2014-08-01,Getting filepath vs. upload for intranet web app,Alphabasic,PHPhelp,https://www.reddit.com/r/PHPhelp/comments/2ccyim/getting_filepath_vs_upload_for_intranet_web_app/,"Let me begin this post by describing my situation. I am a recent graduate with a Masters of Management Information Systems. I specifically left CS and programming because of frustration with coding during my freshmen year in University. My masters program focused more on planning, deployment, and management. However, now at my first temp job out of school, I have been brought in to code an intranet web app that serves as a front-end to a drawing database for a group of engineers at a paper mill. I'm basically a beginner programmer and this is my first project.


I've built the site from scratch using HTML/PHP/CSS, with a few snippets of Javascript (validation code, tablesorter), but have gotten to a hangup in the last pieces of functionality.  


The drawing index operates on IIS7 and Microsoft SQL Server 2012 and contains links stored as strings that are pulled by PHP and turned into html links to allow for download. This is complicated by the fact that the drawings themselves are not hosted in the database, nor on the webserver. Rather the drawings are hosted on a mapped network drive, Y:, common to every engineer at the organization. 


The last iteration of this index was developed in ASP and the person who developed it was a summer intern who was coming out of his junior year of undergrad in a CS degree. So, instead of implementing a proper upload to the Y: drive, the way he did it was to use an ASP call to pull the file path off the file the user designated from the ""upload"" field. The file path is then stored in the database and used accordingly. 


My issue is now that I have no way to pull the file path off of files that are being ""uploaded"", and can't figure out how to upload directly to a network drive through PHP. My ideal solution would be to preserve the engineer's work flow, and keep having them upload to the Y: drive and then get the file path some how. This solution would let them keep using their makeshift file directories. Drawings are separated into folders users have created based on whatever criteria the engineer wants.) Barring that I would have it upload to the Y: drive, and just have all new drawings sit in the drawingindex/caddrawings folder. 


Any help regarding possible solutions, or alternate ways to implement this functionality would be appreciated. 


Thanks for whatever help you might give,

2cd507,26,2014-08-01,"I thought I was off today. I realised late last night I wasn't, came in to the WORST day ever.",katierhysmeyers,TalesFromTheFrontDesk,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk/comments/2cd507/i_thought_i_was_off_today_i_realised_late_last/,"Usually Friday and Saturdays are my day off, but I forgot this week my schedule got changed around a bit and had to work 6 days in a row, so all day yesterday I was fantasising about my wonderful day off; I was planning on going on a boat trip to one of our nearby islands and finding a secluded spot to relax - heaven. Also my boyfriend had just broken up with me so I was looking forward to not having to smile and be nice to people because I'm kind of miserable.

Anyway last night I realised my mistake and came into work as usual today. The day started out fine, nothing to report. The first event of the day was a huge ghetto girl fight right outside the door of our hotel. I'm talking punching, kicking throwing shit, taking of shoes to throw at each other, the works. I just stood there not knowing what to do, our town is usually quite peaceful and trouble free. My manager heard and came down and I asked her if I should call the police (not wanting to as it wouldnt be through English and I hate speaking on the phone in French) She said no and went outside to shout at them but they were having none of it.
 Eventually the police came and it took ages to calm these bitches down. The worst part? The worst one who was screaming and even pushing the police officer had a CHILD with her. Disgusting.

Anyway, because this is France, none of them were arrested and eventually it was all resolved and went back to calm.

Fast forward to a little later on in the day and we have 2 guys come to check in. They had stayed with us a few nights before but we werent able to give them the same room as it had been made into a double for an arrival tomorrow. When they got to the room they refused it saying it was too small, and they wanted the other room. My colleague explained the situation and they agreed to take the double bed, but asked them not to touch anything in the room they were in(so we could sell it tonight if needs be).
 I went up to their room to bring them the key to the other room, one guy opened the door and let me in and the other guy WAS LITERALLY SITTING ON THE TOILET TAKING A SHIT WITH THE BATHROOM DOOR OPEN. He just went 'oh, sorry' and closed the door. Luckily I managed to keep a poker face and it wasnt until I was outside I had a wtf moment. 

Anyway, in the meantime the same guy manged to take a shower in the room too despite being told not to, so I had to clean the bathroom after they went to the new room as all our housekeepers were gone home for the day. 

Go forward another few hours, and I'm at the reception alone. I'm only an intern so we're not really meant to be alone but the manager was gone home for the day and my collegue was dealing with a problem somewhere. Anyway, a literal GANG of big scary motorbike men pulled up outside the hotel and came in. The best part was that none of them spoke English or French, only Italian,and didnt understand anything. I was trying to explain the check in process and that I needed all of their identity cards but they just werent getting it. I was so overwhelmed because I've never had to check that many people in at once beforelet alone while by myself. They kept asking me things in Italian and I literally had no idea wht was going on. luckily my collegue came about halfway thorugh and was able to speak to them in Italian. Crisis averted.

Later on, while I was by mysef again when my colleague was on break, I literally had 4 check ins come at once, and I was so overwhelmed. Usually I can call the other person but he just wasnt picking up. One of them was so complicated because she had arrived earlier, requested a twin but her reservation was for a double so we charged her a 20€ upgrade fee but now she was saying she wanted the original room and to buy a second room of the same standard so I had to refund the 20e blah blah, all while there was a queue of other people checking in.
 It might not seem bad to you guys but like I said, I'm only an intern, new at this, and in a foreign country!

Anyway sorry for the long post but I needed to vent! But in positive news the head of reception was realy really impressed with how well I coped with everything considering!I'm now on my way out to do shots and party Cannes style. Have a great evening everyone!

I currently study using Rosetta Stone, but I'm in a busy time right now so I have only picked up the basics. I would love to have a Swedish pen-pal just to chat to now and then to learn about the language and culture. And just to have a new friend, of course. 

A little bit of background on me: I am a student of Computer Science currently going into my last year at university. I have a ton of interests, my main/most current ones being photography and programming (I am currently on an internship so it has taken up most of my time). I love every type of music and have the most varied iPhone playlist most people have seen; I also play guitar and dabble in piano.  I enjoy reading and learning, especially when it comes to learning the story of a person. 

Let me know if you are interested or would like to know more about me. I'm willing to talk about any subject and as much or as little as you want.

2cdbmj,2,2014-08-01,One year being a indie developer,excamedia,IndieGaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndieGaming/comments/2cdbmj/one_year_being_a_indie_developer/,"ONE YEAR INDIE

One year flew by being a indie developer, busy with my first game. It’s one year ago where I decided to make the big plunge and started Excamedia next to my fulltime job as ICT Specialist. The main reason then was that we had an agreed proposal with how we call it “the big 3”. Since I and my audio producer Dwight went to Games Com in august 2013 things got serious. We heard that Sony accepted our game proposal, Nintendo already emailed the same and we were in the ID@Xbox program. On that moment I decided Excamedia need to have a company identity. That’s when I founded Excamedia on 1st august 2013. Yes, today one year ago….. Time to do a recap I feel. Normally my blogs are about gaming or games specifically, but not now. Let me start!

At the time we went to Games Com we already had a small team, found through unity forums or social media but it was a team starting to make a game which was a puzzle game. One team-member came from France, the other from Italy and another one came from Nepal just to name a few. We all have passion for games and have the common dream to make games and so we began. And from a puzzle game it went to a platform game, later to become more action packed then first was planned.

While development was going on the early stage I felt we had to have an office. This because it works better when you work in an office instead of your living room. And so Dwight and I started searching, eventually finding our way to the Dutch Game Garden. This awesome group of dedicated people help startups grow in the game-industry and develop their skills if necessary. And they provided offices. We went to one network lunch, where you can hook up with fellow students, investors, fellow developers and build your network. We talked to JP, now the head honcho of Dutch Game Garden, about the possibilities and to make a long story short, in February 2014 we had our first office. In a building where 40+ other developers (like Vlambeer, Ronimo Games, RageSquid) also had an office. This was the ideal hub to gain knowledge and experience in an industry not so well known to me as developer. We started to hire interns, who did our internship with us and had a lot of fun, ánd learned a lot and so did we. 

Every month we posted a new build on IndieDB or Gamejolt and got also there a lot of good feedback. Youtubers picked the game up and started to do previews, which was great to see and listen to. After a while we showed our dev build at the network lunch and got a lot of valuable feedback from gamers and fellow developers. Which lead us to a new art style and storyline for our game which we felt more comfortable with. This new build we will show at Games Com next month AND at Tokyo Game Show in September. Which is for me another milestone, as I never thought I would ever go there to showcase my game…. You see, for me making videogames is a childhood dream as I started gaming when I was 6 years old. From that moment untill 2 years ago I dreamt to ever make or help make a game. And now, with my awesome team, it’s finally coming true and I am damn happy about that!

So from the first builds untill the new upcoming build a lot happened, team members left and new ones came, our office at Dutch Game Garden, meeting awesome developers, meeting a dutch writer to make a game based on her book,  teaching interns about running a company, the stress of deadlines, the search for a perfect workflow using Scrum method, going to expo’s like Games Com and TGS. Oh yeah, also in October First Look 2014. Oh no, I almost forgot to mention we were nominated for Indie Prize Showcase in San Francisco last month! In between Games Com and TGS I also will go to China to do business there and try to publish our game in China and/or other Asian countries. So far it was a hectic rollercoaster ride this year along with epic tiredness, great moments with the team, stressfull moments during development but I love it although I sometimes hate it hahaha. Devs know what I mean I think…..

I am bound to forget things I had to mention but that doesn’t matter, this is how I feel and what I think about right now. I would like thank my awesome team for working with me, believing in our games like I do, pursuing the goal like I do and the dedication that they deliver every day! I also would like to thank my wife for her everlasting support and patience when I am busy yet again. You are the best!!! Of course I thank my family and friends for their support and understanding my somewhat busy life right now. It won’t take forever I promise  Furthermore I would like to thank JP, Victor, Matt and everyone else at Dutch Game Garden for letting us in Dutch Game Garden but in this way we could enter the (Dutch) videogame industry. We learned a lot from you guys!!!! 

If you like my story please share it, if you are interested in our upcoming game A Clumsy Adventure, download the game via www.excamedia.nl At Games Com we will put our new build online.

2cdppz,3,2014-08-01,"Me [21 M] with my ex GF [20 F] 3 years together since start of college, left me for older guy and moved in within 3 days",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2cdppz/me_21_m_with_my_ex_gf_20_f_3_years_together_since/,"Hi Guys, I'm just looking for some advice and a listening ear...Thanks in advance!!

**Relationship:**

Me and my girlfriend met at the beginning of college. We met during class and dated throughout the semester. During the winter break after we formally got together, I met her parents (met them again this past summer). She has also met my parents on multiple occasions and has basically joined the family. In all, we've been together for almost 3 years. 


Relationship-wise, we had become less romantic after half way through our relationship. We started become each other's emotional and physical support. Our friends even joked that we were like a married couple. We did everything together and basically lived together after the first year. I emphasize the ""married"" part because that is where I felt our problems began.

I felt that our relationship became really routine. We definitely spent at least 90% of our free time together and ate together almost every day. We definitely had our problems and arguments but we were always able to work through them. Nothing seemed insurmountable. Despite the lack of excitement, I felt comfortable. She seemed comfortable at first too. She wanted marriage, although not kids until we've established ourselves. She spoke about the size and type of ring she wanted. We talked about our honeymoon and the location and style of house we wanted. 

This summer she began an internship at a large corporation that exposed her to a lot of new people and new experiences. Company gave out extravagant gifts and setup many opportunities to meet people. She would always tell me stories about them and also about the guys that would ""hit on her"". Since we were both honest with each other, i didn't dig deeper because i didn't want to constrain her social life.


**Breakup:**

One night she approached me and wanted to talk. She calmly told me that she wanted to break up. Her reasoning was that she had wanted to do this for awhile and finally decided to do this because she had met someone. She told me that she had been emotionally cheating on me. This guy was everything she wanted in terms of physical looks. She wanted me to move out of our apartment asap (I thought it was so she could start dating the new guys without feeling guilty). 

I spent 3 days trying to win her back although it was only during the evening after she came back from work. I realized that she had already walled herself off and i was just pushing her away. I then decided to leave the apartment and live elsewhere and initiate no contact to let things settle.

I learn that within 2 days she had already been on dates with the guy. On the third day they decided to get into a relationship, and she also slept over at his house (???). As of now its been more than a week and she has slept over at his house every single day. She even admitted that she felt that they were moving really fast. ***i was told all this info from a mutual friend***


**Information about the guy:**

He is 8 years older than her. He's single but has had serious long term relationships before. He is fairly stable in terms of income and job (he is a senior associate at the company she interns at). He initiated the contact with her first. 


**Information about the future:**

We're both going into our final year in college. She will probably continue seeing him after her internship ends. She may also be offered a position at the company and may start working again in the spring semester. 

---   
**tl;dr**: 
Girlfriend of 3 years leaves me for an older established guy at her internship. Our previous relationship can be characterized as ""marriage-like"" but definitely had a future. She seems to have moved on, but so fast? 

Questions:

1. Did she really move on? I feel like she had been preparing for the breakup. But, could she simply be infatuated with him in all that he can offer that i can't? 

2. Does the fact she's moved in so fast signify anything? She had been in a marriage-like relationship with me so does that mean she is trying to replace me within him? Isn't their relationship set up to self destruct?

3. I want (not need) her back. I think its important for me to move on temporarily to improve myself and become independent again. However, given the situation described, is it still possible to win her back?

4. Since their relationship is still in its infancy, should I remain in the picture or be completely absent and allow the relationship to organically progress? 

5. I'm afraid that he can offer things that I may not be able to. He has money and stability. However, I have a social circle that matches her's better. Should i capitalize on this to win her back?

6. Once classes start and she is no longer working in his office, can she still maintain a lasting relationship with him? They don't have any mutual friends. 

Thanks any advice or insights. I'm really struggling.

2ce329,27,2014-08-01,Award night [erotica for my girlfriend],theotherhead,Erotica,https://www.reddit.com/r/Erotica/comments/2ce329/award_night_erotica_for_my_girlfriend/,"It may have taken a while to get ready, but the effort was very much worth it. I'm sleek and dashing in my formalwear - suit, tie, and crisp white shirt to match the occasion.

You, however, are a vision of elegance. Your hair falls in shining waves to your bare shoulders, and the slender dress you wear emphasizes your milky skin, your effortless grace, your beautiful features, and your charming smile. There's only a little hint of makeup to accentuate your natural beauty, and only a short session with the salon experts to get your hair just so. You're the prettiest woman in attendance this evening.

Not to mention, you're the youngest award recipient, too.

The speeches and the clapping and the roster of award winners is lengthy. It cannot hold our attention for the whole evening. Around us, the others are fixed on the order of the evening, their attention fixed on the spotlit stage ahead. Beside me, in the darkness of our seats, you brush your hand against mine, and I feel the light velvety caress of your glove.

I smile and look to you, and there's a dreamy joy in your eyes as you meet my gaze. Of course, you have every reason to be happy - they're honoring you tonight, along with the others. I'm just thrilled I can be here with you, to share this long-awaited, well-deserved moment with you. I squeeze your hand gently and you squeeze back, a silent gesture of belonging. Of togetherness.

Your arm grows tired in this posture, and you let my hand fall to your lap. The audience is dark, and I feel the soft warmth of your thigh against my wrist. I open my hand gently, and lightly play my fingertips against your leg, stroking your skin through your dress. You keep looking forwards, but I can feel the catch in your breathing. A hint of a smile pulls at the corner of your perfect lips. You want me to keep going, and so I do.

Now my fingers are walking, like a child's imitation of a pedestrian, except I'm bringing up the dress with each stroke. Not all the way, but enough to bring the slit at the side up onto your thigh. And then I'm touching your bare skin, tickling your senses, and knowing you feel it too.

You give a slight cough, like you're clearing your throat, and you shift inconspicuously in your chair. You deftly hike the skirt up higher, so the slit exposes even more of your perfect skin in the darkness. And now I'm sneaking up higher with my finger, up towards your hips and the crease where your thighs meet your body, and the sweet dark warmth of your loins.

Suddenly, the speaker finishes his interminable speech, and they announce your category. It's some international focus of expertise that I can only recognize with the faint confused respect of an academic outsider. You give another squeeze and your hand leaves mine. Time to gather your things and get ready for the stage. As you rise, my hand comes back towards me, but - quite innocently, it might seem - I graze the spot through your dress where I know your body is warming, and quickening, and dampening.

I clap for you as you walk up, with the others. And I'm still clapping as you pose with the award - a slight quirk of your hips is the only hint that under your dress, your appetite has awoken and your body is responding to the phantom caress in knew back in the audience.

When you get back, I've got a cheeky smirk on my face. We're both aroused, and we know it. We've found a new game to play, as they continue with the speeches. My busy fingers find your knee, tickle their way up your thigh, and come to rest against the lace of your panties, enjoying the moisture at your lovely yearning hollow. I stroke your lips, lightly at first, but then you put your hand on mine and press me to you, hungry for more.

""...and we encourage all our learned experts to come together..."" says the speaker, and you nod, a little more enthusiastically than the other viewers perhaps, but now my fingers are at your pussy, spreading and squeezing and stroking your lips through the increasing damp of your panties.

With a shock, I feel your hand on my thigh, grasping for my erect penis, finding it among the belt and buckle and zipper, and rubbing it firmly through my formal trousers. Your hand is confident and sure, with a smile on your face that shows your authority here, as if to say ""This is mine, all mine.""

It's not long before neither of us can wait any longer, and I pull your panties to one side, sticky with your wonderful juices, and I'm probing your slick folds and creases with my fingers. The guy on stage is finishing up his speech with a rousing climax, and as the others applaud in bursts, I'm stroking your pussy on the outside and in, sliding my fingers with increasing vigor. Your hips are pumping back and forth in a hot, horny fucking motion, as my fingers plunge into your creamy depths, hidden among the crinkly curls of your pubic hairs.

Meanwhile, your hand is trying to free my standing cock from my clothes, but the zipper and belt are too much trouble in the dark, and my fingers are providing a lot of distractions. They're stroking your clit, your pussy lips, even thrusting in to rub and tease your inner seat of pleasure.

Another round of applause washes over the audience, and a shudder washes over you, your thighs squeezing together and trapping my hand against your crotch as you come quickly.

Then the speech is over, and the audience begins to mumble and mutter. The lights start to come on, dimly, to allow people to find their way.

We rise with the rest of them, and fidget and adjust and stretch, like everybody else. But there's a cheeky secret we share, in my fingers reeking of cunt, and your pussy throbbing with a fast and sudden finger-fucking, that follows us.

The event is dispersing, but we know the night has just begun.

\* ~ * ~ *

The young intern is in a hurry. The main banquet finished a while ago, but there's still so much tidying up to do. And the supervisor went up to join the VIPs to sip champagne, leaving her alone and bringing all the chairs back to their tables, now that the sweeping-up is finished.

Even so, chairs are heavy and she's only one person. She takes off her blazer jacket and loosens her collar, and rolls up her sleeves.

Suddenly, there's a clatter outside and the sound of voices. She freezes. She can't let the VIPs see her like this - like some laborer! This should be an evening of silver trays and hors d'œuvre, or whatever else the important dignitaries get - not of dusty clothes and tired interns.

Just as we enter the room, she dives beneath the nearest table, hiding among the chair legs and tablecloths.

Meanwhile, we don't notice anything - the room is dark, and the only light comes from the distant windows and the evening party lighting from the balcony. You pull me by my tie to the nearest table, and I lean you back, kissing your knowing lips and smile. This is the same quirkish, devilish, enticing mouth that charmed me years ago, on the steps of Dupont Circle, when you grabbed me and held me back to give you a kiss. Back then you knew what you wanted, and had the confidence to take it for yourself. Tonight will be no different.

I have one hand around your shoulders, and the other at your waist, as I kiss you fiercely. Our tongues meet, and our lips lock together in our embrace. You pull my body to you, and we're united in our kiss, in our hands embracing each other, in our bodies as they come together in all ways.

Well, not quite all ways...

You can feel the urgent hardness of my erection against you, and you reach down and stroke me. I can't help it - I give out a throaty moan deep into your mouth. You break the kiss, smiling, and then turn a chair around and sit on it, as you unfasten my arousal from my clothes.

Belt comes away, button unhasps, and zipper peels down... and now you're reaching through my shirt tails and the band of my underwear, and bringing out my warm, throbbing cock, swollen with my passion for you.

My hands are roving over you now, with unashamed greedy desire. As you take the round purple head of my penis into your mouth, I sigh deeply and shiver deeply - but it's only for a moment as I continue stroking, questing, and searching beneath your dress. I trace the gorgeous curve of your breasts, and feel your tightening nipples in the palms of my hands. I bring my thumbs in to find and squeeze your hard nipples, pinching ever so gently, as you moan into my cock.

Your tongue orbits the head of my penis, and I know I'm going to start losing it. Already my cock is slick with your saliva and my own precum - and I don't want to lose my orgasm just yet. I take a firm handful of your hair and move you back off of my manhood, drawing back and meeting your eyes in the silvery darkness.

I want to possess you, and I can see your hunger for me too. I bring you up to your feet, and lift you just high enough to lay your superb bottom on the table side. I hook my arms under the backs of your knees, and your high heels are splayed behind my shoulders. On either side of my face is your sheer shiny stockings, and ahead of me is the dripping lacy chaos of your panties, and the humid horny heat of your pussy.

I kiss your thigh, with my wet lips and with my tongue, and even once or twice with a gently nibble of my teeth. I work my way up towards the heavenly scent of your pussy. I kiss your cunny lips through your panties, and you arch your back and sigh. Then, I tease you with my tongue, licking your wet notch through your soaking panties. Or going to the side of your underwear and licking the sensitive skin there, between pussy and thigh. 

After the third time, you put your hands on my head and hug me to your crotch, moaning for me to lick your pussy properly. And I'm hungry, too, filled with desire for your salty flavor, and the intimacy of your juices on my mouth, my lips, my nose, my cheeks.

\* ~ * ~ *

The intern can't believe her eyes. The two people came in here and started touching each other and kissing right at her table! There's no escape - she'll be seen if she tries to crawl out. And then she'd be in big trouble. She guesses she'll just have to stay put and pretend she's not here. It's just like back in college, when her stupid roommate brought guys back to the dorm. There'd be giggles and kissing and touching and then slapping and even more giggles, but try as she might, she just couldn't disappear into thin air. The worst was when they looked at her smugly like players of a game she had never been part of.

Outside, beyond the tablecloth, she hears sucking noises and sighs of male pleasure. She can see the woman's shapely calves beside a chair. What could be going on?

She looks out, and in the dim light from the balcony, she gasps. She recognizes the face of the youngest award-winner - only a few years older than her, and already an industry-celebrated published author! It's a face she's seen in academic publications, and in news reports. But this is the first time she's seen the eyes rolled upwards to look at a man, and the mouth filled with a thick erect cock.

The intern freezes, terrified, as the man's thrusts continue and the woman takes it skillfully into her mouth. The man is caressing her breasts through her dress, and the woman even has a hand down in her own crotch, stroking her pussy!

The intern gulps. This is very different from back in the dorm room. And she hates to admit it, but she knows there's a growing wetness between her legs, and her own breathing is coming faster. What if they saw her? She hopes they'll just leave, but... also she doesn't. Part of her is waking up to a desire for something she doesn't know how to name.

The man pulls back and the intern suddenly scrambles silently back under the table. There's a slight thump, and now things have changed their disposition above the table. The woman's over the table now, her legs spread apart, to allow the man to kneel before her and kiss and nuzzle and lick away. There's male and female sighs of pleasure, and sucking and smacking noises of pleasure. And, to the intern's fascination, there's a new, musky scent in the air... the scent of heat and sex and desire.

I am currently late 30's and two Summers ago was forced to move back in with my Ndad because my legs are shot (no insurance and the rest of the whys and why nots would take ages to explain) after I broke up with a GF of six years and forced to return to my home state.

My dad is so much like some of these posts here but here is the reason I am here tonight.

After another relationship ended badly (mostly due to my mental health, in the sense that I make bad choices and to this day am so desperate to please and just be loved that I let people and situations walk over me) I started therapy last year and made some slow progress.

However due to my lack of funds I was on a siding scale with interns and I lost the therapist I trusted (in many ways which he was afraid of this hurt me, mirrored a lot of abandonment stuff -trust me, the full story of my past would make you guys go OMG-).

About two months prior to that I had stopped smoking pot because not only was I addicted but it was a huge buffer to everything in my current and past life. 

So a few days before I went into my last session-end of June- (I am supposed to get a call this month to allow me to go back with a different person) I started again and even though I said it would not I went back into it hard...

So last couple days ran out and cannot get more soon due to bills and of of course my 'shields' were down. 

About two days ago he was his usual self, responding to usual conversations with rudeness (""How's it going dad?"" ""Leave me alone""), only caring when I could do something for him and the usual stuff you guys probably know well.

When I have my buffer I can blow it off but when I came out of it, I snapped and for last two days have taken no crap and last two times have blasted him with everything...no response other then lies, insults and trying to rearrange my memories (I REALLY love that ST: TNG post here..there are four lights!).

I just want him to say sorry..about a month or so ago he threatened me with violence and I called him out on it and still no apology.

Yet somewhere deep down I just still want his love, his praise and understanding. 

I have been so broken by my past and my mom has been dead since I was 18, I have no family and friends and not many of the normal resources or facility others seem to have...

Not sure what else to say, but like I told one person I can talk to (who I feel bad bringing this up to as she is dying) I either want to see him suffer, apologize or love me.

I will not be like him and hurt and I think the other two will never happen...but it kills me...

Any thoughts?

2cegf3,1,2014-08-02,Would it be a bad idea to change majors in my senior year of college?,_mariposa,ask,https://www.reddit.com/r/ask/comments/2cegf3/would_it_be_a_bad_idea_to_change_majors_in_my/,"Hey reddit,
When I started college I wasn't sure what I wanted to major in. Through out high school, my favorite subjects were Spanish, English, and Psychology. However, I knew I could not immediately find a job in my field after I got my BA. So I decided to major in Spanish and International Business. After my first year, I realized that business classes weren't for me. I found them dry and boring, and once again I was at a loss as to what I wanted to do.

However, I had a friend majoring in computer science and I always found programming to be interesting. I decided to switch to majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Spanish. I knew I still loved Spanish, but I had a hard time with conversation and I thought that this hindrance would make it impossible for me to major in and I feared going to grad school. Anyways, after switching to programming I found that it was actually pretty hard, however, I enjoyed it to an extent.

Anyways, I have been interning for a company and I love the culture, however, I find that this isn't what I want with my life. I don't have a true passion for programming, and I struggle with some of the concepts. I am not doing bad in my curriculum (I have a 3.54 GPA), but this isn't something I always find enjoyable or even interesting. I still love Spanish, and in my minor I actually have a 4.0GPA and now I'm realizing that this is where I want to be. Especially after I had an amazing Spanish Culture/History teacher last semester (my minor requires me to take a Spanish culture/history class taught exclusively in Spanish) and I loved it. She was amazing and I loved the material.

The problem is though I'm going to be a senior in college this year (School starts August 18th). However, it is very possible for me to switch to Spanish and graduate on time (since I'm minoring in Spanish and getting a BA in Computer Science I only need 20 hours which is very doable in two semesters). The only way this would work is if I travel abroad in the Spring, however, and I'm scared that it won't work out properly. I have e-mailed my professor and the travel abroad advisor and I believe this is doable.
However, there is a deeper issue to this. My dad passed away from cancer in April, and its been very hard on my family emotionally and financially. My dad was the primary provider of the family, and because of his rigorous treatment my family is deeply in debt to hospitals. I know my mom is extremely stressed about this, and I have also been extremely sensitive/upset for the past few months. Furthermore, I am currently going to school on a scholarship and I know that even if my dad was still here they would never be able to help me pay for graduate school, which is why I always feared getting a major in something I felt I would really enjoy. Also, the company I currently intern for really likes me and its a great job opportunity for me once I graduate and the starting salary is around 57k for the team that I would be working on.
I have told my mom, my boyfriend, and a few of my friends my idea and they all think its crazy. I know its a little crazy, and I know its a huge leap of faith. I have security where I am now, but I'm not truly happy. My mom even told me that I ""need to finish what I started"" and not change majors because its possible that this company will hire me in the future. Also, she feels that I'm ungrateful and insensitive to our financial situation. I also really love the company and the people there, but I just don't think I want to be a programmer. The more I think about it, the more I want to pursue my master's degree and PhD and become a professor like the one who inspired me so much.

I am really at a loss here, and I feel scared and confused and even sick at times. My family and friends tell me its just my emotions from losing my dad and that there are hundreds of programming jobs out there, but I feel if I don't like this one with people I really care about and a great company, why would I like it elsewhere?

Anyways, reddit please give me advice. If I should change my major, how would I go about graduate school? I'm scared I wouldn't be able to get in, and I am even more scared I wouldn't be able to get my doctorate. I'm also scared of disappointing the people around me should I change to majoring in Spanish.
Also, I am scared of the idea that I'm not good enough in Spanish. I do well in Spanish because I can read and write well in Spanish, but actually talking and listening to Spanish is difficult for me. I feel like this means that I may not be good enough or fluent enough to be successful. Also, if my travel abroad doesn't work on in Spring this would all be for nothing because I would lose my four-year scholarships which pay for the majority of my tuition. I do have financial aid, but very little because fasfa believes our income is ""too high"" (this was when my dad was still alive, our income is considerably lower now along with the debt I mentioned before).

TL;DR: Scared college senior second-guessing her major wants to know whether she should chase her dreams and become a professor or if she should just stick to her current field with a possible job prospect."
2cexf8,5,2014-08-02,"Breaking down the wall, in what order should this be done?",Snowballinflight,ketoscience,https://www.reddit.com/r/ketoscience/comments/2cexf8/breaking_down_the_wall_in_what_order_should_this/,"    All in all you're just another brick in the wall

So, I've been thinking about breaking down the wall once I start my internship in hospitals. I'll be giving obligatory short lectures on a frequent basis and I want to use this opportunity to get my facts straight, as well as my supervisors'. 

I've been brainstorming with a friend about the order this should be done in. We figured that number one should always be the true definition of dyslipidemia, it's markers and impact on relative risks. This is followed by the mechanisms at play (*e.g.* carbohydrates increase TG's). This should remove the big blocking obstacle that is using fats as an energy source. So:

1. What is dyslipidemia and what are good markers for dyslipidemia. And what are the associated risks/risk reductions? I.e. LDL-t or LDL-c as it is still mostly used today *vs.* HDL, TG's, ratio's (HDL, TG's, LDL), LDL pattern and ApoA/ApoB. Obviously it must be stated that all these markers are still correlative, not causative.

2. What is the effect of all sorts of carbohydrates, protein and fats on these risk factors. (e.g. saturated fats raise both LDL and HDL, both decreasing and increasing risk. But, as HDL weighs heavier, reducing risk overall). 

Would you do it in a different way? If so, how? Anything missing? Any sources I should definitely use? How would you continue? Anything else to add? 

All input is greatly welcomed!"

I'm 19 years old and a rising sophomore at a US university. I have an on-campus internship that sees me working from my room a lot.

I have felt empty for a long while. My sleep schedule has a mind of its own; in this last week alone I've gone to sleep anywhere from 10 PM to 11 AM, waking up anywhere from 4 AM to 7:30 PM. I have no energy or desire to do anything, so I lay around on my bed a lot of the day. Nothing really makes me happy, but a few things are better at passing time than others. I also spend much of the day alone, as being around people has started making me uncomfortable. I honestly think about death and dying, but I know that I'm not going to kill myself. I don't really understand it. 

This depression isn't really new, though, as I've been dealing with it for over a year. For whatever reason, it seems to spike during the summer months.

The real kicker is I feel that I can't tell anyone. Six months ago my girlfriend of fourteen months broke up with me, and I know it was partially because she was sick of my depression (she also had a thing with my friend, bad memories). I'm just afraid of telling people and becoming an imposition again. I really don't want my friends to stop talking to me, but I also want to talk about my lack of feeling. 

Anyway, sorry for the rant. I just thought I'd share it with you guys. Thanks for reading"

Also using a burner account because he may read this subreddit. 

First off, I have absolutely no problem with my boyfriend looking at porn, and in fact I look at it too. But I never look at specifically one porn star or google one star's name because I enjoy porn not particularly how she/he looks but because what they are doing is extremely hot. Anyways, I was opening safari on my boyfriend's phone to look up something and saw his private browser with ""porn star's first name last name cum shot on face"" something like that.

 I was shocked because this girl, who is strawberry blond with beautiful porcelain skin, looks nothing like me, and even though I let him cum on my face, he's never actually cummed *that* much on my face because he probably thinks i can't take it or something. Before this, I liked to think I was giving him everything he ever wanted, and he shows/feels this way too. Since I am pretty open to sexually explore, I thought he wouldn't feel the need to use other girls to fill spots that I couldn't fulfill. I'm extremely sexual and have never really rejected him to sex. 

Here is where I need a little more backstory. I am chinese. Tan skinned. I have a meaty, flat nose that kind of ruins my image, in my opinion and makes me very self conscious on days my image is relevant. I am an aspiring investigative journalist and currently intern at one of the top two TV stations in Chicago. I want to break into the tv broadcasting industry but am feeling a lot of backlash because my image is not that of a leggy blonde/brunette with a perfectly turned up nose, etc. Not that people adamantly demand to see news reporters like that, but they DO prefer a specific image, and they can't help it. I understand this. So I have been battling with not fitting a specific image at work, never would I thought I would get this from my boyfriend, whom I love dearly and have no problems besides this. 

So last night, when I made the discovery on his phone, I said out loud, ""oh, i didn't know you googled her specifically....?"" and he didn't say anything, just that it was very embarassing. And I understand that. But I also expected him to hug me and comfort me and say it's not a big deal, I love you just as you are, my porn preference is out of my control, etc, but he didn't say any of that. Just seemed to brood over it and was very quiet. The weight of this whole fitting the image thing really got to me and I broke down crying, very very visibly upset. I HATE being insecure. Though I just described my nose as ugly, I don't think about it on a daily basis. I am prefectly content with how I look in fact, just don't like feeling like it's inadequate. And my insecurities are seeping into my relationship.  Am I over reacting? 

I love my boyfriend more than anything in the world and I know he would do anything for me (has proven that in the past). It breaks my heart to even think I'm not his wildest fantasies or his ""perfect"" woman. And I obviously can't change my race, skin color or my nose (don't want plastic surgery) to make him happy. 

Scratch that. I KNOW I am over reacting and at this point i'm not even angry/mad at him. I am just feeling extremely sad and confused and left wondering how I can stop being so insecure.

2cfgnr,31,2014-08-02,Reported wife to police for DWI. I think it was right. Was it?,kmac503,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2cfgnr/reported_wife_to_police_for_dwi_i_think_it_was/,"Married since 2009. Few nights ago I [m/40] reported my wife [f/32] to police after she drove off after I busted her in a lie.  She was sitting in her car talking on her phone (which she rarely does).  When I asked she said she was on the phone with her sister.  At one point when I was helping my son look for something in the car I thought I heard a mans voice.  I went in the house and called her sister.  Four rings and I hung up. Then sent sister txt telling her to tell wife to hang up.  Went down to put kids to bed and came back up to find replies with sister saying, ""sorry missed call was in shower"".  wife was lying.  I went to car and said ""hey let me say hi to your sister"" she hung up.  I swiped phone from her and ran. It was a dude.  There is major back story to this where I could write a book.  Deal is wife has drinking problem and refuses to get therapy or treatment.  She had been drinking all day after working over night and going to school.  When she drove off I called 911 she got busted.  It was the only intervention at that point I could think of.  Thoughts?  I can explain more if need be. 



Important back story:  The Friday before wife had meeting with place where she will have internship.  About the time she would have come home (around 5:30 pm) I received txt from her saying ""I'm at bar having drinks with co-workers"".  I was a little annoyed because I had been waiting for her to return and could have made plans otherwise.  A little bit later I txt her asking when she would be home.  Her reply ""soon"".  Few hours later she's still not home.  I'm upset at this point.  At 12:30 am we talk on phone and she says she is on her way home be there soon.  She was within the city we live so it really should hve been a matter of minutes.  I doze off and wake a little over an hour later.  She still isn't home!  I go in panic mode and try calling and txting but no response.  We have iphones on same plan and so I use ""Find My Phone"".  I see that she is not at the bar but it indicates she is at a trailer park within town. WTF.  I have my mom come over because we have a two year old I cant leave behind and I go to find her.  I see her car and I knock on the door of the house where it's parked.  Dude answers door but says she isn't there.  He does have roommate I say ""let's ask him"".  He invites me in.  Wife is passed out in dude roommates bed (clothed at that point).  This is the same dude (co-worker) who was on phone night I reported her.  I tracked her down also because I had to work that next morning and had to leave 5:30 am.

**tl;dr** wife has made some bad choices and has drinking problem. I confronted her on a lie about who she was on phone with. She drove off (drunk). I called police. She was busted.

**Edit:** I haven't been perfect. I sobered up mainly because the courts ordered it. About a year ago I was charged with domestic abuse. It was pled down to a disorderly conduct. This particular incident was set off a few days prior when I uncovered some txts between wife and a neighbor. It was over the line and inappropriate. I handled it by not addressing how I really felt about it and keeping it in. Then one night we were drinking and after some trigger I was set off. Long story, short, I ended up kicking the bedroom door and she was behind it. It hit her and she flew back. The police were called and I spent the night in jail. 

We have had volatile fights in the past and some physical. They all involved alcohol on both our parts. In any of these there was never a fist raised. It always involved a push. She would like to get in my face or step in my line of travel and I would react. I most definitely not trying to justify what my part was. I was wrong to do what I did. I have never been physically violent with anybody drinking or not. My wife does have an uncanny ability to aggravate a situation. Her mom and sister agree and have shown support for me. Not like picking my side but acknowledging that there was another party that certainly pushes the right buttons.

It's a mess. Without drinking we do well together. With it we are toxic. I acknowledge my misdeeds. I have been getting the help I need. I just hope she does the same."
2cfp4c,1,2014-08-02,How long should I stay at my first job out of school?,longcommute70,Employment,https://www.reddit.com/r/Employment/comments/2cfp4c/how_long_should_i_stay_at_my_first_job_out_of/,"I graduated from college with a bachelors a little over a year ago and am going on my 8th month at my first ""real"" job out of school. The job is at a public relations agency. I majored in journalism and had a couple PR internships while still in school. After the internships, I realized that this was not what I wanted to do, but at that point it was too late to change my major (school I went to was strict about that).

However, I accepted a job at an agency anyway because I wasn't having much luck getting another type of job due to being fresh out of school with limited experience outside PR internships and no ""hard"" skills.

In addition, my commute to work is a good 70-80 minutes in the morning, and 60-75 minutes in the afternoon. I take the train, but it's during rush hour to and from a major city, so it is extremely crowded and not the most pleasant. I also have to ensure that I leave early enough in the morning in order to get parking at the train station. While the job itself is bearable, the commute is starting to wear me out.

I knew it was a long commute going into it, but being new to the area and the working world, I had no idea what it would really be like. I used to be able to occasionally work from home (1-2 times a month), and leave work slightly earlier (like at 5 instead of 6) if I got into the office early, but the agency I'm at is expanding and becoming stricter about everyone being in the office at the same times, so there is not as much flexibility as there was when I first started.

I was originally planning to try to stick this out for a year, but due to these recent changes, I'm tempted to start applying for new jobs in different fields now, especially since I've had the chance to develop some general admin skills that can be applicable to a variety of different positions.

In addition, I will likely be moving within the next six months, and that will make my commute 20+ minutes longer. Moving closer to my current job is not an option due to rent prices increasing exponentially the closer you get to the city. I also wouldn't really care to live in the city even if I could afford it, definitely prefer the suburbs, which is where I plan to look for a new job.

So my question is: How long should one ideally stay at a first job out of college? And is the commute an acceptable reason to start looking for a new job?"

This is mostly going to be an chronological experience/what to expect thing 

Also mine got pulled and I'll go over that experience.

**Ordering:**

I ordered two IDs (to be safe) during their $80 special on June 6th. After submitting their order through their [site](https://www.eliteids.com), I was given a wallet address to send my bitcoin to (I paid a total of $175 with shipping). I paid about 10 minutes after submitting my order because I had already bought bitcoin through coinbase. 
[how to get bitcoin](https://www.reddit.com/r/fakeid/comments/26heai/bitcoin_btc_complete_walkthrough_guide_coinbase/)


**Personal Problems:**

The status on the website was ""Payment Received"" for about a week. On June 16th, Elite emailed me directly (without PGP so I went with it) informing me that I had fucked up and put the link for my signature in the proper box as well as the box for my photo. I emailed him/her with the [photo attached](http://i.imgur.com/hj1oahM.jpg) to the email as well as an imgur link. He/she then said it would be shipped the next day (the 17th)



**Shipping:**

I received a package on June 23rd. Stealth was fine I guess, I live with roommates so whatever

More personal problems:

I only received one ID in that package. I emailed elite with photos of the package as well as screenshots of my original order and my order/shipping information and he/she immediately (literally 5 minutes) emailed me back saying he/she will ship another one. Got it about a week later, same type of package.

**Actual ID**

My ids look like everyone else's that order from Elite. [Recent Mod review](http://www.reddit.com/r/fakeid/comments/2ce63w/mod_review_eliteids_il/) and [comparison bw Elite, Mr Rep, and Real](http://www.reddit.com/r/fakeid/comments/2ajv3p/extensive_review_mrrep_vs_elite_id_vs_real_il_id/)

ALSO, fyi, [this is what comes up when you scan with the PDF 417 app for iPhone](http://i.imgur.com/SwE60sN.png) 

On other apps, all that came up was my name, gender, and birthday, if I'm remembering right.

**Experiences:**

I have used my id at Albertsons, Ralphs, Walmart, and Target. All of the above have just looked at the birthdate, don't think anyone's even scanned it yet. the (50ish male) cashier at Ralphs DID comment on the glossiness. Albertsons asked why I was there and I said I go to school at UCI so that's easy enough. Other possible stories: parents moved out of state last year and i'm their dependent, there on vacation, there for an job interview, in the area for an internship for summer.

Bars: I used it at Baha Sharkeez (on a monday night) and the guy just looked at the front, back, and again with a flashlight? or blacklight? (small, thin, and black light) for 1 minute and let me in. 

Went to downtown fullerton two nights ago and stood in line at a popular bar. Got to the front, was first in my group. The dude (btw I think all the bouncers there are from the same company, all yellow polos with a ""security"" patch on the chest) looked at it with a flashlight for 3 minutes, constantly flipping it over and slightly bending it.

He then called Dave (a supervisor I guess, plainclothes) who looked at it for exactly 30 seconds and said, ""dude, its fake."" and gave it to the original guy and walked back into the bar. So obviously I left. 

*Something I noticed they both did*: flicked the corners. What's up with that? Thats what ""Dave"" did before making his determination.

Yes, I could have been nervous and showing it but I doubt it. I am generally very confident/don't show it anyway (did MUN for 7 years) plus the supervisor didn't even look at me. Plus I'm 20 and a girl, just have a late birthday this year

**Overall**

Got unlucky with a good bouncer I guess and being in California but for buying alcohol it works just fine. I don't know if i'll chance it at a bar again, especially a crowded one on a popular night, but definitely good for buying alcohol and for weekday nights.

Personally, I am just going to find someone that looks like me because at this point, that'll be safer because [white people can't tell asian/brown people apart](http://www.theguardian.com/science/neurophilosophy/2011/aug/15/people-other-races-look-alike).

...and I wanted to come to this subreddit and discuss how managers should train their employees. 

My entire focus is on training on the principle of the tool you're teaching instead of the specific mechanics of the tool you're teaching. The tools we use in business change, and we can develop employees who are more adaptable if we take the time to explain the foundation behind whatever tool we're teaching.

My University teaches incoming business students in the exact opposite way, they make us use software which teaches every individual click inside a specific software program, but they never teach us to think analytically about what we're doing.

I've done one development plan so far at my internship and it worked incredibly well, and I wasn't teaching the mechanics of a specific tool but rather the principle behind spreadsheets. I believe that this can be applied across the board, whether it be with lean principles or specific software or management techniques.

Sorry, kind of long.",_Wharfedale_,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/2cgzka/stressing_out_about_new_job_sorry_kind_of_long/,"I've suffered from anxiety since my last year of middle school. Becoming sick during a school trip, due to Chronic Gastritis, caused a downward spiral that ended with me spending most of High School being afraid to drive anywhere outside of my town. During college I gained more confidence in driving longer distances, but overall I would avoid it if possible. I actually ended up with an internship where I road along with the local PD on occasion and did okay. Part of this anxiety is the idea that I'm away from my own bathroom, or ones in which I feel comfortable. 


Well after graduating college I got a job in a call center of sorts dealing with disaster clean up. During the first day I was told to sit at my desk and just study a list of names for my entire 10 hour shift. The other new employee had already been doing the same thing for a week. I had a bit of a panic attack, realized I already hated the job, and decided to quit on day 2. 


Well after months of unemployment I just accepted a new job position. This is an IT job that involves some networking. I'm replacing the bosses assistant who started out knowing very little about the job but was trained by the boss. I believe the boss sees the same situation for me. I'm terrified of starting on Monday. It's an hour commute to work which really puts me off, especially considering my IBS made me uncomfortable just driving to the interview. And it seems like this job is going to be so difficult and demanding compared to my previous student employment job, which I loved. But on the other hand this job opens up more opportunities than the administrative assistant jobs I've been applying for with my university. 


To sum it all up. I've been panicking. I'm afraid I'm going to panic. I'm afraid I won't be able to handle the work load. And lastly I'm afraid that I'm going to end up quitting and go back to a life of unemployment. I know I can always return here back to my parents house, but I feel like it would be a major disappointment. I feel like my anxiety was under control when I was living in my apartment with my roommate while going to college, but the time being stuck here unemployed had brought back some of the old anxiety.

Today I took one of my left over anti-anxiety pills from 2011 and felt better for most of the day. I only have two pills left and am nervous about not having that safety net throughout the week. 


I guess I'm looking for advice and comfort here. Thanks for taking the time to read my post. 

TL;DR: Afraid of the difficulty of new job. Afraid I'll disappoint if I quit again. And nervous about the commute each day. "

Can I get someone to help me?,Ilwin,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2ch37a/20m_my_girlfriend_20f_of_5_years_broke_up_with_me/,"Hey. This is my first post. Think we can talk for a bit?

My girlfriend of 5 years broke up with me recently, and it's arguably been the most devastating time in my entire life. We were both 20, and she had recently got an internship, and finishing her last year of college, whereas I had just begun college. She told me she felt I was holding her back as well. Told me she didn't want to wait for me anymore(I fucked up a lot in the relationship).

Needless to say I took it terribly, and after 3 days of, well, a lot of crying, I feel better, but this hole in my heart just won't disappear, which I hope it does eventually. I have so many painful things in my mind that suicide felt like a really legitimate option, and still does to be honest, but I'm sane enough to know I shouldn't.

My biggest problem was that I...really never lived for myself. I didn't learn for me, I didn't get fit for myself either, etc. I did everything for her.

And this is probably really unhealthy advice(or I keep believing it is...) but people have told me to just get revenge. And not burn her house down revenge, but to better yourself so much that you'll make her, and everyone who probably knows about it, think ""man, she shouldn't have left him"". It's been the single motivation keeping me alive.

I'm sorry for this being long, and I'm sorry if this seems like rambling, as I'm quite a mess at the moment. I think it's because I got into a relationship as a time in my life where I should've been mentally developing alone, but I always had her as a support. So here I am, feeling like a complete fuck up, whereas she's... Going to bars, probably hooking up with some more successful guy. Etc...etc...

It's just so fucking hard. I've continued working out, and learning things for school, but there's still so much I wish I could've said to her, and now...I can't.

How does someone who's had an emotional crutch practically their entire life, stand on his own now? I can finally eat and sleep, but I still feel...mildly suicidal. And I'm afraid of it ever coming back up.

I've had great, great friends backing me up, and family as well, but every once in a while...I think about it, and it just makes me...I hate to repeat myself, but suicidal. I feel like I need to do so much right now, but it's just so very, very difficult. Again, sorry if this sounds like I'm just being a little kid, but It's been unbelievably difficult to cope despite everything I keep telling myself.

---   
**tl;dr**:
 I guess what I'm asking is, how can I start feeling alive again? Is it better to just drink the sorrow away? How can I get rid of all this regret? And the thought that she's still mine(jealousy) but no longer is, and will absolutely meet someone else is killing me."

Dont get me wrong, I am allowed a fair amount of freedom. I can usually hang out with friends and I have my own car. My parents though are very strict about the times that I am out.

I just turned 19 over 2 months ago, for the majority of my life I have been labeled ""fatass"" ""obese as f*ck"", I want to change that PERMANENTLY. Part of me is angry, but the other part of me makes me realize these people are right. I am currently 5'9 and weigh ~290 Pounds. I have a story, but to cut it short, I used to live out in Chicago until my parents decided to move to a small suburban town in Michigan. While in Chicago, I would always go outside and play various sports with my friends, and had weighed at least ~205-210 at the time. It has now been almost 3 years since we moved away from Chicago, and I know I am gaining weight.

Knowing I am overweight, my doctor back in Chicago would mention my cholesterol levels would be high, and had brought it to my attention that my bad cholesterol levels are too high. Though, after moving, I honestly just got super lazy, as entering a new place, I would just go directly to school, and come back home. The worst part is, there is nothing nearby that is of walking distance, so I just stayed home, or if had to go somewhere, drive. I have wrapped up an entire year of college, and am vegetarian by religion (always been), though, the ""freshman 15"" really did kick in, as I know that the biggest contribution to my weight gain was because of the junk food (especially eating pizza almost everyday).

The last time I visited a doctor for a blood test (11 months ago) she had told me my blood levels were fine, though I need to cut the weight, and my bad cholesterol level were too high. She was saying I can go a natural route to cut my weight and be completely healthy or she can prescribe me some form of medication (metformin I believe she mentioned, claiming I would use it until I reach my target weight) but from my reaction I immediately said I want to go the natural route.

It is now August of 2014, I have been working at an internship near my town at a local aviation shop, though, the job really is a computer desk job. From 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM, I am slouched on a desk and keyboard. 

In all honesty, I really want to change my life. Lately, I have been having acne breakouts, ingrown hair acne all over my body (head, shoulders, stomach, and of course face) and the biggest cause from my research indicate that it is heavily influenced I find is the lack of a proper diet and being overweight. I have noticed that though my glucose levels are fine (fasting, checking after 4 hours of eating) I am starting to buildup a black neck, having stretch marks, a ""double chin"" and flabby harms/legs.

Reddit, my main question from this thread is this: I openly accept that I am a fat SOB and I know it. I want to change my life around and live a healthy life instead of hurting myself. I have low stamina, and playing things like full-court basketball makes me tired as I have to catch my breath constantly. Is there ANYWAY I can reverse this, I want to lose weight and build my body to play sports like basketball again without getting tired and out of breath.

I still have till the beginning of October till I move back onto my college campus, but I want to immediately shift things around in my life and clear up all these problems around me. I want to have a regimented schedule in place to help me lose my excess weight, clear these issues of ""high levels of bad cholesterol"" and any other possibly complications in result of being overweight (high sugar levels, fatigue, blood pressure issues, etc..)

As for diet, being a vegetarian (by religion) does anyone have ideas as to which foods I should look into, and possibly what a weekly schedule of ""breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks"" look like? I would love more insight on this. 

Lastly, what are some good exercise tips you guys would recommend? I hear Yoga really helps, anything that I can do indoors (inside my bedroom) would be preferred, but can try to go outside and do something else as well.

I greatly appreciate the support, and would love insight and tips that I can use to change my life.

P.S.

I am Male, Indian-American, and have no medical issues or am on any sort of medication.

I went to Miami Ad School for art direction and realized halfway though that I am a copywriter. They wouldn't let me switch or I would have to start the whole process over at the higher tuition rate. They did let me take a few copywriting classes though and I thought I did pretty well. When I finished school I had just finished a terrible internship and I had a book I had no confidence in. So I just hid from the industry for two years with my tail between my legs.

The present:

Now with a few years away, some minor branding experience, and a little bit of confidence back, I want to get back into the game as a copywriter. However, I'm having a problem finding an art director to work with. All my ad school buddies are either way too busy with work or moved on to something else outside of advertising. So I don't know where to look for people to work with. I can imagine that current students don't want to work with someone outside of school and freelancers are too busy making rent. 

So I'm basically looking for any advice from you all in the industry. Where should I go to find an art director to work with. Does art direction even matter that much? Should I just keep my old stuff, and just redo the copy? Has anyone else made the switch post school? Has anyone even made it after such a big gap between school and work? 

So many questions! so much stress! Any advice would be greatly appreciated! 


Thanks!"

I am about to begin my second year of college.  My first year I was an Anthropology major (I still am) but my school offers a major in Mathematics/Computer Science, so I was considering switching to that.  

In high school I told everyone I would be an astrophysicist.  Then I went on exchange and decided I love other cultures.  However, I think I like *experiencing* other cultures much more than reading about them...and analyzing them.

I love Star Trek and I want to be the first person in line to sign up for other-floating-rock colonization.  Since we're not there, wouldn't it be a good idea getting my foot in the door as an employee of that very company?  Basically, anything and everything to do with space travel appeals to me, and I feel that Musk is attempting to provide a very revamped version of the way we think about spaceships.

So, /r/JobFair, what should I do?  Aside from revamping my schedule to reflect a more mathematical tone, what other things can I do to make myself a better candidate? (SpaceX has internships as well but that wouldn't be possible for a few years for me.  I am in the NYC metro area.)

Edit:  Also I am good at math, I had an easy 100 in Calc my senior year of high school.  I have only taken a dummy math course since then but I feel confident about jumping back on the math train.  I just don't really want to program code all day long.

**Edit2:  General consensus is that Spacex sort of sucks for employees.  Advice on other similar companies would also be appreciated!!!!!!!!**"

Never thought I'd be one to post on this subreddit but I am looking for some dire and wise advice. I had been dating my girlfriend for one and a half years exactly when she left. It has been a little over a week since she has left.  Long story short, we met studying abroad, have been through a lot in between there and now, she fell really sick while abroad and I was by her side the entire time in the beginning of our relationship. We do distance during the college school year after coming back from abroad but we see each other for breaks (winter and spring), holidays (thanksgiving), and birthdays. 

She was my first serious relationship, and definitely first love. The first fight that we ever had was when she told me about her past and how she had dated someone dating back to high school for 2 years before meeting me. At the time, I was so new to a relationship I was unable to maturely deal with this. Long story short, he eventually still tried to talk to her and I was unable to grasp why she wouldn't just block his number or his fb. I know, very immature of me in hindsight. This petty little thing literally was the only thing that I would ever fight her about, I would think man, you've had him over for all of your family outings and events, I am just #2 in everything, which was clearly the wrong way of thinking of things. Eventually in April this year, we ended p taking a break because of her ex still trying to contact her but knowing that we would be back together come summer(explained below). At this time I think the distance was also taking its toll on me and I was spending more and more time with my friends, and paying less attention to her. 

Last fall I was offered a great internship down in Texas for the summer. I talked it over with my girlfriend and we both thought it would be a new adventure to move down to Texas for the summer. She would eventually find an internship in Texas too which was only 3 miles away from mine (this is relevant as we would only have 1 car in Texas this summer and carpooled daily). I also knew ahead of time that her internship was unpaid and that I would be solely financially supporting her this summer. After taking this break and focusing on exams, in mid-May, a few days before she was scheduled to fly to my home (we would make the 18 hour drive down together in 2 days), she texted me and told me she was ready and willing to give me another chance if I was willing to change starting with never bringing up the ex regardless of his actions. 

We got to Texas, settled in, and everything was going great. We were traveling, dining out, just generally having a great time in a new environment. Eventually, she felt bad that she wasn't contributing anything financially and so she asked to move in a fellow intern from work who did not have a place to stay. He, in turn, would be paying us weekly rent/gas money since we would be taking him to and back from work also. I obliged, not thinking twice about it. 

He moved in and there was tension as I am a very private person, and this random person all of a sudden was living with us, eating with us, and riding in the car with us on a daily basis. That started the unraveling of our relationship this summer. As summer progressed, work  started to pick up. My girlfriend's internship was for a local sports team, and so on their match-nights, she was required to stay and work and also stay late to help clean up after. Basically, 2 weekdays for a month I went to her events and stayed until midnight instead of driving home after work (the commute from home to the venue was ~40 minutes each way and not worth it). I also had to get up around 7 every morning for my work. Also, on the weekends for a month, she also had matches, meaning that she would take the car with the other kid and be gone from 10 in the morning to midnight so we wouldn't be able to travel or explore like we used to and I would be stuck at home. In hindsight, this was all very selfish and a me-first way of thinking of the situation. 

Soon, we would be fighting about me asking her to ask her boss to leave early some nights, or me arguing about who's internship was being paid or led to a full time job offer. I would get angry that I was paying for her everything and yet she wouldn't leave early or take a day off on the weekend which was all very wrong in hindsight. My mom said after I talked to her that not only did I know that ahead of time, but she relocated to Texas for the summer because of me, and that was the least I should have done. Basically, because of my me-first attitude, I wasn't very supportive of my girlfriend during this time in hindsight, instead of cheering her on, I was only focused on the bottom line, leaving and getting home ASAP which was the wrong approach.

I had found out about 2 weeks before it happened that she was thinking about flying home early as soon as her internship ended (her internship ended the last week of July). I told her that I would treat her nicer and that we would enjoy the last 3 weeks of summer (her original flight home was mid-August). We had a nice 2 weeks after that, and the other kid who was staying with us flew out the last Monday of July. That Thursday, she was 30 minutes late in picking me up from work with no warning and I got too angry over that, and then Friday morning we had planned on going on another road trip(it was the first free weekend she had in a month). I had gotten a little angry at her on the drive to work that morning, over facebook out of all things (she had removed all of our pictures on facebook for a while and I had wanted them back on). I know, it is so ridiculous and immature in hindsight. She dropped me off at work, we kissed, and at 2 that day, I get a call from the secretary that my car keys had been dropped off. In the car, there was a note that she went home because of the fighting, along with her car key, house key, and debit card of the joint account we had opened. She left the dog we had gotten together along with a suitcase worth of her clothes. 

It has been a little over a week now. I am in a dark dark place. I believe that it was my immaturity, inability to look past the small things, and selfishness that led to almost all of this. I would say I am 80-90% at fault here. I really cared about and loved this girl so much and now because of me she is gone. 

Obviously I have done everything one is not supposed to do. She has me blocked on facebook, my cell phone #, everything else social media. She also blocked all of my friends that she had known. The only way of contacting her has been through email and wechat. Long story short she is cutting off contact, no matter what I say I can't change the past or what she decides to do, she told me she gave me chance after chance and I didn't listen, now she has to do whats best for her happiness even if that means seeing other people. 

I know I was wrong, I am seeking help, I realize now that cash isn't king and my eyes have been opened to how bad of a boyfriend I was in hindsight. I want to take time to better myself and be a better person from this in the present. Honestly all I want is to get back together with my girlfriend with time, however long it may be. What do I do from here/what are the next steps. I know I just have to focus on me now but it is hard.

2cigzn,2,2014-08-03,Car Costs?,clutch4,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/2cigzn/car_costs/,"I'm looking to purchase a car within a month or two, just got my NYS license last week(I missed my first road test, and had to wait a month). I'm looking to get on the road soon to gain some experience because after I graduate next year I'm supposed to start a job in a city where I have to drive to get anywhere, everyday.

Currently looking at these vehicles with under 150k to last me at least a year:

* **Mazda3 - 2004-05**
* **Ford Focus - 2001-05**
* **Sentra - 1999- 2004**
* **Corolla- 1999 - 2004**

Maybe:

* **Mazda6 - 2003-2006**
* **Altima  - 1999-2002**
* **Accord - 1999 -2004**

I currently have $3000 saved up, which I have determined is enough for one of the above vehicles, but I'm unfamiliar with vehicle maintenance, or cars at all for that matter.... Do I **need** to  increase my budget? How much extra should I have saved aside for maintenance, vehicle registration and any additional vehicle costs that I don't know about? I should be able to accumulate another $1500 from my internship within the next two weeks, would that be enough?

Lastly, I don't think I'll be able to afford insurance in NYC...current quotes are well above $300. I was thinking of registering the vehicle in my father's name until next year when I can stand on my own feet. Does anyone know of any cost-cutting insurance moves, or cost-cutting vehicle moves for that matter? I appreciate any useful information about cars, or the vehicles I'm interested in purchasing that'll help me in the future. Thanks.

ME: 19
Location: NY, NYC

2cihp5,2,2014-08-03,"Two weeks. Time to start deciding if I need to just cut some people out. Also, time to just put the whole story about what brought me here down so this may end up being a long read.",gwhlives,stopdrinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2cihp5/two_weeks_time_to_start_deciding_if_i_need_to/,"My best friend lives in Seattle (I'm in Arizona). It's only important to say that because the person I am having an issue with isn't him, the trouble maker of the moment is more like my best ""local"" friend.. We grew up together, lived and drank heavily through college together, after graduation he moved away, and I stayed here and went through several years of bartending and making really terrible decisions... Somehow, throughout that entire shitshow period of time, I had one friend who kept telling me I could do better. He didn't do it in an abrasive way, we would just start talking about ideas and plans and things that interested us... and he would point out how much bigger my life could be if I made some changes... the rest of my friends only talked about bars and girls and working in bars and ""mixology"" and how the bar industry is doing, and which bars the girls are going to be at, and which girls were ""putting out"" and what bars they frequented... lots of debating on who the ""real bartenders"" in town are (never did figure out what that means)...

Eventually started to realize how unhappy I was, started making changes. Went back to school, spoiling a lot of relationships in my only currently viable career area (you guessed it... bars) by not showing up to the parties, baseball games, or the ""it's Thursday, lets drink to prepare for the busy weekend"" things, the ""got off work at four a.m. on sunday morning, drank for a few hours, then opened the 6 a.m. bar with all the old smokey leathery old-timers"" stuff... also stopped doing the ""Tuesday... fuck it"" events... and so find myself nearly unemployable because cliques and shit-talking define this town... (I never said I was better than them, but they seem to think I did). Didn't stop drinking though, it just became ""I have to be up in 5 hours and I'll never fall asleep, better slam 4 beers and hit the sack"". 

Last May my best and most supportive friend, whose advice is always well grounded, thought provoking, and never fails to help me make a better decision, moved to Seattle. A week later my former college years best friend moves back. We start hitting the bars... it's summer time, so no real problems being caused, but the man lived in a town with like 1000 people for five years, he wants to stretch his legs again and start meeting girls and get back to the ""glory days""...  But he isn't like me, he doesn't understand what it feels like to know you're not in control of yourself. He also doesn't understand the magnitude of the decision I made to go back to school, and how much I had to change myself and how hard I have worked at it so far, and with no reward or promise of a better future yet... just a rapidly increasing student loan debt... 

See here is the thing. The main motivation behind stopping is that I want to get an internship for an engineering firm in town next summer, but to do so I have to bring my cumulative GPA up to a 3.0 by then. This internship will open so many doors for me that are so firmly shut right now I don't even know where to start... It is directly in line with my end-game and the process of starting my dream career...

Unfortunately, my cumulative GPA includes my first degree that I got from the same school, ages 19-25. I graduated with a 2.1... I was drunk pretty much constantly, I thought being a bartender would make me happy forever, and I bought into the line ""you just need the piece of paper."" So, even though my grades since I have returned to school to pursue Electrical Engineering are in the 3.7-4.0 range, my CUMULATIVE GPA which is apparently all that matters to the people who hold the keys so-to-speak, is still below a 3.0... There are other internships, but this is the one I want, and why would I do anything less than reach for the one I really want, given the already mind-blowing amount of change and sacrifice I have already made...To get my 3.0 cumulative though, I have to get 4.0's for the next two semesters, and I have to add a handful of electives as well. These are already going to be tough semesters, I have never had a 4.0 semester, and everybody says these next 28 credits are the hardest in the program. The ""weed-out"" semesters. I need 32 credits of A to get my 3.0.

So I have to cut out alcohol. I have to burn clean and be organized and focused and never, ever put myself in a position of ""fuck it, I'll be hungover tomorrow but I can get this done on Sunday."" For the next ten months, I have to be amazing. I have to learn how to sleep without alcohol and I wake up without the snooze button. I have to have a brain the flows seamlessly from one thought to the next, without a throbbing headache.

So, the friend that moves back doesn't get it.  Here are a few of his arguments:

* ""But dude, you will have to relax sometime.""

* ""You can take naps without alcohol right? So obviously you don't really need it to fall asleep.""

* ""You don't have to get hammered every time, what's wrong with just having a couple to unwind?""

* (after mentioning that I can do other things to relax, like hike) ""But the best part of the hike is sitting down and having the first sip of a delicious beer""

**And my person favorite:**

* ""Dude, realistically you probably can't get a 4.0 anyway""

I was calm, rational, and I spoke clearly. I told him about how he and I have different relationships with alcohol. How I can't control it, how I know that his family has a very open approach to drinking, but alcohol split my parents up and ruined my relationship with my father. How I learned when I quit smoking that I can't do moderation, or take a once-in-awhile approach. It simply has to be ""never again."" 


He just didn't get it. Afterwards I called the best friend in Seattle (they have never met) and he said ""Do what you think is right, but remember that rarely do people get in trouble for under-reacting. It's over-reacting that causes problems."" 

So I am trying to decide, do I cut him out, being that he is and is not likely to ever stop being a source of frustration and negativity? Just acknowledge that his own issues, which he has never been forced to address, are more visible in comparison to my new behaviors, and that he will do anything he can to bring me back into his comfort zone to eliminate risk of having to look in a mirror? Or do I be a better friend than he is, and get that 3.0, and get my internship while enduring his attitude, so that once we are on the other side, he finally understands why I had to make the choices that I did?

2cix60,20,2014-08-03,My Brother [26 M] Got a DUI &amp; Expects Me [22 F] To Drive Him,alba_botanica,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2cix60/my_brother_26_m_got_a_dui_expects_me_22_f_to/,"I want to start off by saying that my brother, Trey, is a very nice person. Yes, he got a DUI and I know many people consider that a massive felony, and rightfully so. Yes he did endanger his life and many others, but he's a very kind individual and I definitely think he learned his lesson. Please don't think he's an evil person who is terrible when you give me advice. He had a point in time where he wasn't thinking clearly, and I think he suffered a lot from the conviction and fine and revocation of his licence and he and I both realize he's done something very wrong and won't do it again.  


Basically my brother and I have been close for a long time. Our parents both passed away early, when I was 16 and he was 20. Our oldest brother, who was 26 when they passed away, took care of us until he got married and moved to Switzerland. Since I was about 17, I've been living with Trey and he's had to take care of me while I went to college and High School.


When our parents passed away, my brother Trey took it the worst. He became a bit of an alcoholic when he was only 20, and while he was never 'depressed' or angry or violent, he drinks a lot. He's gotten better, but he still gets pretty drunk at least every weekend.


About 2 months ago, he got convicted of a DUI when he was driving home from a bar. His phone wasn't charged, and the bar didn't offer a taxi service. He served some jail time and left on parole. He now cannot drive for a year legally.


I'm amazed he didn't get fired from his job, but he still works 5 days a week, and it's about a 30 minute drive for him. He takes the bus on some days, but he still needs a ride about 3 days a week because his work schedule is very inconsistent and doesn't match the bus schedule.


I have to drive him to work 3 days a week, while I work as well. However, I am currently an intern, and since I don't make any money, my brother feels like his job is priority before mine because he needs to pay our bills and things like that. I've had to tell my boss about this, and while he says he understands, I can't help but feel that this jeopardizes my chances at getting a paying job when my internship ends.


My brother also really wants me to drive him to his girlfriends occasionally, which is another 20ish minute drive that I need to make, and I also need to pick him up. I really hate his girlfriend.


It was becoming annoying the last 2 weeks when I've been driving him. He's not TERRIBLE, he understands that it inconveniences me a lot and he tries to make a schedule for the week so that I don't make plans during the times where I need to drive him, and he also tries very hard to not have his job/girlfriend affect my job or my boyfriend.


I think it pushed me to the limit when I was hanging out with my boyfriend, and my brother called me up asking me to drop him off at work because his boss wanted him to work this weekend last minute.


That meant I had to drive from my boyfriends, to pick up my brother, drive him to work, then back to my boyfriends. It just irritated me to no end.


I've thought about telling him that it annoys me, but I remember that he's let me live under his roof for the last 5 years. He never asked me to pay rent, and he's never used it over my head to get anything out of me. Like I said, Trey is very nice and I WANT to do this for him, but it's getting to the point where I really cant.


Also, I forgot to mention that his girlfriend is a selfish bitch who wont take some time out of her schedule to ever occasionally pick him up from work or drop him off. Did I mention that I hate her?


So yeah, please help me out here. I don't want to live his life and my life, I need some time to spend on my own things. Frankly, Trey really needs a driver because of all the stuff he has to do. However, I'm the only one who offered to help. My boyfriend picked him up once, but he is busy with life too.


Again, I want to still drive him, but I don't know how I can make it easier for me and still help Trey get to the places he needs to go. Yes, it's his DUI and he needs to suffer the consequences, but frankly... if he doesn't go to work, I won't have a house to live in either.


Please help, thank you.

I never imagined getting so many, and all helpful! This sub is a truly valuable place.


Man I typed a bunch. Going to try really hard to shorten, sorry for lack of grammar.

Background info : grew up poor, worked and saved hard since 14 (started working age 14, full time age 17), really wanted to go to college. Got in, got full scholarships (mix of need and merit), but was still always afraid of not getting them next year (had to re-apply and keep grades up). So studied really hard during school, worked hard summers, continued saving.

Entering last semester this fall (graduating one semester early). Ended up getting full scholarships each year, and a 3.89 GPA. Extremely happy about this, but also felt like I missed out on a lot in college. Didn’t make many friends, partially because of being cheap and overly concerned about my grades. (My college is known for being affluent, everyone just goes out eating and drinking all the time, school clubs often have fees of $200+/ semester).

Present: somehow graduating with $25k savings from always living below means. Never expected this to happen. Really want to splurge on myself, but very unsure/nervous.

What I want: to get LASIK eye surgery and travel Central America after the fall. LASIK because I have always hated my bad vision, and wearing glasses has been a huge blow to my self esteem since I was 12 (note: I’m a girl, and have done contacts, but I keep getting GPC (an eye infection)). Central America because I want worldly experience, the adventure, and I hope it’ll pull me out of my bit of depression. I guess I just want to be less down on myself by being more of the person I want to be (in looks and in experiences). 

My fears: LASIK will be $4500 and travel is $1000/month + $1000 plane ticket, and I want to go for at least 2 or 3 months. That’s $8000 minimum. Is it worth it? I feel like it is. I usually don’t want much at all, honestly. I have a flip phone, I buy thrift shop clothes, all the possessions I own fit in my car that I bought for $2500 at age 16.

But a part of me also thinks it isn’t wise. I have a good GPA from a good uni, but only a kinda decent degree (BS in Biology). I did have two paid summer internships and tried hard to have a decent resumé, but I still fear not finding a good job when I would come back. I also don’t know if I should be investing in something like grad school instead (not for biology though, that’d be a waste, maybe something like public health). 

So, I’d appreciate any advice. What would you do? Does it seem like a good idea or a bad idea? What might I not be considering or realizing? 

TL;DR: I have 25k, want to spent ~$8000 on LASIK and travel as a new grad. Feel like I’ve put too much into saving, want to like myself as a person more. Concerned about future- getting job, should I go to grad school. Looking for any input/advice."
2cjc4j,1,2014-08-03,How do I tell my [26 M] SO [24 F] of 3.5 years that I think we should wait another year before getting married?,throwaway83848,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2cjc4j/how_do_i_tell_my_26_m_so_24_f_of_35_years_that_i/,"I need to find a way to explain to my fiance that I think we should wait at least another year before we get married.

I'll try to spare as many details possible to get to the point:

We've been together for 3.5 years and knew for a while we wanted to get married.  For our entire relationship we've been long distance: she lives at home with her parents (working on getting into grad school) and I live with a roommate working on completing graduate school.  We've never lived together, and probably won't until we get married (her parents are fairly religious and would be extremely against it).


Next year I'll graduate and I'll be completing an internship somewhere in the country, but I'm not sure where.  Financially, she works part time, and I'm taking out tons of student loans to cover school, however I'll start receiving a salary once I start my internship.


So even before we were engaged we were talking about when we would get married, and we planned on next year, since I'll be done with school and she'll start grad school online or at a school wherever I'll be (she's willing to move with me anywhere I end up).  However, about a week before I popped the question, I told her I think we should wait, since I don't know where I'll be going next year and I don't want to start our lives together halfway across the country away from our families and in debt.  


She got upset at this, already expecting to be married next year, listed reasons why we should get married next year (start our lives together sooner, stop this long distance, the timing is good with school) and she started crying and saying how could I be ready to be engaged but not married?  So I gave in and agreed with her.


A week later, we got engaged, and now she and her mom are in the process of planning a wedding.  However, I've still had this nagging in the back of my mind that next year won't work out.  I don't want our marriage to end in divorce, and I think it would be better in the long term to wait.  But I've already tried to talk to her about this and I gave in, and talking to her again means going back on what I said.  


I feel awful about it, and I don't want to crush her, especially since she's already in the process of looking at wedding venues and trying on wedding dresses.  However, I also don't want a marriage to possibly end in disaster, especially with so much uncertainty.  My immediate family has all advised me to wait as well, and I think I agree with them.


So how do I proceed Reddit?  Is it worth going back on my word, or would getting married next year be such a bad thing?

**tl;dr**: Uncertain future, get married next year or go back on my word and tell her again we should wait?"
2cjmn5,1,2014-08-03,Guys I need help finding out why i'm being so grumpy lately. I don't want to be like this and I need help :(,Kaycat19,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/2cjmn5/guys_i_need_help_finding_out_why_im_being_so/,"This might get long, I need to vent. Sorry if it's a bit all over the place.

Ok, I've been in a LDR for the past 2 months and I am going out to visit him on friday. I was super excited about it but the closer I get to going the more bad tempered I am getting.

A little background. I come from a very low income family in the UK and he comes from a super wealthy family in the US. He is currently working in San Diego and paying rent for a room in the house where his dad rents a room. The rest of his family are in Idaho and his brother has recently left for Seattle to start a job.

In total we have been together 10 months and i'm struggling to adjust to being on my own again. I'm living on my own and he has a job,so we message a lot during the day and skype for 20 minutes at his lunch and when he gets home. 

I am having huge issues with his parents. Firstly they offered financial assistance for him to come to see me in the UK this summer if he got a internship and got a higher than 3.2 average. He got both and so I was really excited to have him come see me. It gets to the start of the summer and his dad refuses to help! Wtf??? He was the one that set the terms and I don't think he should have offered if he was never going to follow through. 
I told bf that we should book it super early to avoid fairs being so high because the cost of cancelling if he didn't end up coming would still be cheaper than booking a flight so close to him coming out and his parents shut that idea down fast.
Him and his dad like to do things in the evening, that is fine but when his dad asks him to hang out it is usually 9pm for me, and then I am stuck with no plans because I thought I was going to hang out with bf and he's just told me he isn't going to be able to hang out. We had a talk about this and asked him to explain to his dad that I needed at least 24 hours warning about plans so I could make plans to do something with my evening and it has got a lot better, but when his dad still asks too late he won't tell him he needed more warning he'll still ask me. And then I feel obligated to say yes because if bf says no it's going to be blamed on me and so again i'm stuck inside. It hurts because it just seems like my bf would rather do anything than talk to me. 

His mum is super nesty. She needs her babies around to the point I think is ridiculous. His dad told bf that his mom feels rejected because she's hardly spent any time with bf because I was always around when he came home (not too true I feel because I couldn't go home a lot of weekends as I had a radio show on a sunday morning while I was in the US, and they invited me skiiing I made sure to stay in a couple of morning so he could ski with his family because I was still stuck on the learner hill).
Now he can't spend any time with here because *he is 5 fucking states away*! Nothing to do with me. 

Because his parents backed out of supporting coming here at the end of the summer I am going out to see him, he helped payed for this out of his paycheck and I am so grateful to him for that. That's a huge commitment to me. So because I am coming to him, I want him to come here at christmas, and I know his parents are going to flip shit at that idea. His mom will be all passive aggressive and want her baby around the whole time. His dad won't help bf pay for it (i know he has no obligation to but he gave his word so this bothers me) because it isn't under $800 (like that price is ever going to fucking happen) . Idk how we can afford it otherwise. I know people will ask why we don't see each other at a later time, and I looked at that and our spring break and summer holiday times are  too different and when we both graduate we will be in no place financially to pay for tickets where as I have loans right now that I could use and we might have job obligations. 

His parents have consistently put off bf leaving the country and its starting to wear me down. When his dad found out how much the ticket this summer was costing he exploded at my bf because it was a lot of money (that my bf had earned and wanted to spend) and my money also. 

This weekend he is home and all I have been hearing is how whenever he picks up his phone to text me his parents bitch him out and make fun of him, Yesterday I was not texting him as much and just replied to him when he messaged me, which was hard for me. Then earlier today he told me that his friend (this friend and I are a bot unsure of each other because he's been a douche to me a lot) was saying I was super clinging and bitching at him because we text a lot and that it didn't help make my relationship with him any better. So I just told him I wouldn't bother messaging him because that made me feel so upset that everyone around him seemed to hate us talking, when it was literally the only time we could talk due to to the time difference. 
And in the evenings when he could choose to spend more time with his dad after work he plays league every night, and I don't see him stopping that. It's always me that gets asked to back down and to go away :(

He is super rich and I don't think he understands so hard it is for me to hear him about his parents paying for all this stuff (meals out every night - something I didn't even get every month, him having fun on his parents boat, jet skiis and all these other fun things. 

He has never stood up properly to his parents or his friend to defend me and I feel like he is never going to. I don't think he will be here at Christmas (and even if he was the UK isn't great at xmas), and I might not see him for god knows how long after this summer. 

My mum is being so sweet and supportive and is constantly pointing out things for me to take pictures of to send him, looking for little presents for me to send him and as much as she doesn't like me being on my phone when we are out she doesn't constantly bitch at me for it.
Am I over reacting to his family's apparent lack of support for our relationship, not only in a financial respect? All I ever hear is how my relationship is getting in the way of everything else in his life.

Why am I getting so bitter? I suffer from depression and will be starting medication soon but I am having a hard time articulating my feelings from my depression speaking. It is getting to the point where my resentment and hatred for this whole situation is getting on my nerves so much :( Please help me.

I'm sitting here alone, and I feel so numb and empty. I'm so sad. I just spent a few hours gaming with friends but now they've gone i'm faced with the reality that he hasn't spoken to me since midday and it's now 1am for me.

I just want him for once to tell his parents to stfu, and to get angry at them and come home and talk to me :( 

Please help me, I just want advice. Any advice. If i'm being OT and a bitch and controlling please tell me. I just want to get to the bottom of why I feel like this :(

2cjpav,0,2014-08-03,Me (20f) long distance relationship. Its getting to the point where suicidal thoughts are coming into play. Am I justified in my hurt and resentment or is it just my depression talking? Please help me I'm desperate :(,suchalonelythrowaway,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2cjpav/me_20f_long_distance_relationship_its_getting_to/,"Guys I need help finding out why i'm being so grumpy lately. I don't want to be like this and I need help :(

This might get long, I need to vent. Sorry if it's a bit all over the place.

Ok, I've been in a LDR for the past 2 months and I am going out to visit him on friday. I was super excited about it but the closer I get to going the more bad tempered I am getting.

A little background. I come from a very low income family in the UK and he comes from a super wealthy family in the US. He is currently working in San Diego and paying rent for a room in the house where his dad rents a room. The rest of his family are in Idaho and his brother has recently left for Seattle to start a job.

In total we have been together 10 months and i'm struggling to adjust to being on my own again. I'm living on my own and he has a job,so we message a lot during the day and skype for 20 minutes at his lunch and when he gets home. 

I am having huge issues with his parents. Firstly they offered financial assistance for him to come to see me in the UK this summer if he got a internship and got a higher than 3.2 average. He got both and so I was really excited to have him come see me. It gets to the start of the summer and his dad refuses to help! Wtf??? He was the one that set the terms and I don't think he should have offered if he was never going to follow through. 
I told bf that we should book it super early to avoid fairs being so high because the cost of cancelling if he didn't end up coming would still be cheaper than booking a flight so close to him coming out and his parents shut that idea down fast.
Him and his dad like to do things in the evening, that is fine but when his dad asks him to hang out it is usually 9pm for me, and then I am stuck with no plans because I thought I was going to hang out with bf and he's just told me he isn't going to be able to hang out. We had a talk about this and asked him to explain to his dad that I needed at least 24 hours warning about plans so I could make plans to do something with my evening and it has got a lot better, but when his dad still asks too late he won't tell him he needed more warning he'll still ask me. And then I feel obligated to say yes because if bf says no it's going to be blamed on me and so again i'm stuck inside. It hurts because it just seems like my bf would rather do anything than talk to me. 

His mum is super nesty. She needs her babies around to the point I think is ridiculous. His dad told bf that his mom feels rejected because she's hardly spent any time with bf because I was always around when he came home (not too true I feel because I couldn't go home a lot of weekends as I had a radio show on a sunday morning while I was in the US, and they invited me skiiing I made sure to stay in a couple of morning so he could ski with his family because I was still stuck on the learner hill).
Now he can't spend any time with here because *he is 5 fucking states away*! Nothing to do with me. 

Because his parents backed out of supporting coming here at the end of the summer I am going out to see him, he helped payed for this out of his paycheck and I am so grateful to him for that. That's a huge commitment to me. So because I am coming to him, I want him to come here at christmas, and I know his parents are going to flip shit at that idea. His mom will be all passive aggressive and want her baby around the whole time. His dad won't help bf pay for it (i know he has no obligation to but he gave his word so this bothers me) because it isn't under $800 (like that price is ever going to fucking happen) . Idk how we can afford it otherwise. I know people will ask why we don't see each other at a later time, and I looked at that and our spring break and summer holiday times are  too different and when we both graduate we will be in no place financially to pay for tickets where as I have loans right now that I could use and we might have job obligations.

I decided I wanted to learn a new language about a year ago and set my course for Swedish as, out of the many languages and cultures I researched, it seemed the most melodic language and the most fun and interesting culture. I've been using Rosetta Stone and have loved every bit of it, but I don't have any Swedish friends to practice with.

A little bit about me: I am going into my last year at university, studying Computer Science, and am currently in Washington D.C. on an internship with cybersecurity. I'd love to visit Sweden one day, but need some help on what cities to go to and what to see and do.

My big hobbies include photography, gaming, reading, and learning as much as I can about as much as I can while I'm alive.

Let me know if you are interested or would like to know more about me. I don't mind doing snail mail, but would also be up for email, Facebook, text, etc.

Tack och ha en trevligt natt!"

So I will make this short.  I am a 28 year old.  I am a recovering debt addict.  I used to have 40 grand in debt.

I paid my dues, I fixed my mistakes in the credit card and student loan world.  I pulled some long ass weeks to tooth and nail back to being a person with 0 debt.

I have been debt free for about 6 months and I have about 10gs in savings.  About 4 years ago I finished school and couldnt get work, blah blah blah.  The same old college failed be debt story.

My field luckily is web development.  I took a bad program that touched on the basics.  I was over qualified but I thought paper would help me.  Fuck my stupid 22 year old brain.

What made me learn how to make money programming was me picking up book in desperation and programming so I could feed myself with some ichiban noodles and hot pockets.  I used to get mocked by my friends who lived at home because I was always poor.

Anyways, I am now in the green but my credit sucks.  I need to rebuild my credit.  I live in Canada, my equifax score is like 570.  I know it is shit.

I am now a responsible adult and I want to rebuild my credit.  I am looking at buying a condo in the near future.  The problem is that I cannot even get a credit card.

Before you rip me apart for missing payments and being poor, I want to let you know I started my career off of credit.  I learned just enough to kick start my brain into absorbing software development.  I was delivering pizzas in the PM while I coded for minimum wage on an internship.

I think to fix my nasty credit I need to get another card (I dont need it but credit history or something?).  I need to fix my credit so banks dont see me as a criminal anymore."

2ckq97,1,2014-08-04,[22m] stuck in a difficult position with her [20 f],throwaway_627_,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2ckq97/22m_stuck_in_a_difficult_position_with_her_20_f/,"Hey guys, so basically, a bit of background. I'm at a university in the UK, and last September one of my female friends from back home also joined the same university (although we didn't really know each other beforehand, but had lots of mutual friends). 

So yeah over the course of the past year we became very close, and often ended up sleeping in the same bed and spooning/touching each other a bit, though it wasn't sexual, but I felt there was definitely tension and potential.

Fast forward a few months (to about may/June), I realise I've got feelings for this girl. However, we are both about to start an internship over the summer and I am going to be moving in with her in a few weeks until September, as I have no where else to stay. Baring that in mind, I tried to ignore my feelings and would wait until we've moved in together and wanted to see how things went before telling her/making a move, because I thought it mayve been difficult or awkward if she didn't reciprocate. As well as that, I had exams to focus on and didn't want this to get in the way of those.

About a week before we were due to move in, we went out and ended up in bed together and kissed. Before taking it further I told her we should probably talk about it, so we did. She admitted having feelings for me too, so I thought something may come of it. 

Just before moving in she said that she thought we shouldn't take it further incase it ruins our friendship. So, obviously this is not what I wanted at all, of course I don't want to ruin the friendship either, but I feel as though if we both want different things then it's going to get damaged anyway.

The worst part is that I am now living with her, in the same room/bed and am having to repress all of my feelings about her, it's very very difficult and frustrating, and sexually frustrating. I feel very stuck as I can't really simply just ignore my feelings now when they are so prominent and in my face, I can't just go back to being friends. I also feel as though I will need to get away from her to let my feelings fade, but that isn't really an option right now. Also, I feel as though once I get away from her then I won't want to speak to her for a while, to allow my feelings to fade - I don't particularly want to go through with that and I know she is going to hate me being distant from her. I also feel quite resentful towards her and feel as though if we hadn't have had that kiss before moving in together then this could've all been avoided - as I said above, I wanted to give it time before making a move. I am also quite reluctant to talk to her about it as I feel the more we talk about it, the more complicated it becomes and more distant I want to be. I also don't want to give her the impression that I'm really keen (which I kind of am I guess) to push forward with it. 

I'm not sure what I'm really looking for by posting this thread, but it's nice to get it off my chest and some suggestions would be great.
Thanks!"

I stumbled on it a few weeks ago, and I've realized since that if my dad IS a narcissist, your community may be an excellent source of support for me. A lot of this post is a history of my life with him, which I know you may not all be interested in reading, but it's therapeutic for me, especially because I only recently realized that he is a narcissist. If you don't care about those details, my current dilemma is closer to the bottom.


I want to start by describing my dad a little, because I've never quite conceptualized him as a narcissist until recently. Growing up, I thought he had bipolar disorder, and I believe he does have that too.


I’m from a family of 4. I’m second eldest, I have two sisters (older and younger), and the youngest is my brother. We were all conceived through surrogacy, which at the time (1985-1995) was a very ambitious idea. My parents (which at this stage was probably mostly my dad’s decision and influence), found women through putting ads up in the paper and things like that. They didn’t go through an agency, and didn’t pay the women. The women agreed to do this favor out of kindness and my parents covered their medical bills and gave them gifts. From what I can understand, my dad would jerk off in the bathroom into a tube or something and then my mom would use a syringe (she was a nurse for many years) to inject the semen into these women. I wasn’t going to include that in the post but it seems relevant now. My mom had hotckins lymphona as a teenager and was infertile after treatment. I suspect she saw my dad and his avant-garde idea as very supportive of her issues, as I know she really wanted a family. 


 Growing up, my dad was pretty volatile. I can remember times when things were happy and he would play with us or give us good parenting advice. But I’d say 80% of my memories are pretty traumatic. He was physically abusive on occasion with my two sisters (I only found out about one of them recently, and she said she never told anyone). He was an alcoholic, and at times would pick us up from after school activities or friends’ houses drunk. His relationship with my mom was highly unstable. She gained a lot of weight while raising us, and he began isolating her and shunning her. He would refuse to talk to her face to face or be in the same room as her. He reported that he was “allergic” to her and to her obese body. There were times when this “allergy” was worse and times when it was better and they could eat at the same table, but overall it was pretty bad and weird. He shamed our bodies too, calling us fat and criticizing our activities or eating, yet at the same time making rules about having to finish our dinner completely because we were lucky to have. 


My dad has also been incarcerated 3 or 4 times (I’ve lost count!). The first time when was I was 10, we were going to a family vacation to Disney land. My mom couldn’t come at the last minute because of thyroid surgery, and sent our babysitter and my father instead. We were supposed to meet my dads brother (my uncle) and his family. My dad got stopped when we were trying to catch our flight, and we missed it. I never found out what was happening during that time, but we got another flight and had a layover in a US state (we live in Canada). He was arrested as soon as we got off the plane, and as traumatizing as it was, we continued our trip with just our babysitter. Since then it has been in/out ever since. His crimes where money related, I don’t know the details but it was very sketchy. He’s even in a book of notorious criminals because the plans he would devise to steal money were so intricate and off the beaten track. Obviously he was bad at it though, since he got caught so many times and would return to that activity when he was released.


Over the years, there have been many stand out moments that were simply over the top and stressful and weird. For instance, he once was in a fight with our neighbor over something, and decided to cut down half his tree, because half the tree was in our property. This was embarrassing and caused a big fight and the police came.


During the world cup a many years ago, he was cheering for his home country. He hung flags up all over our back yard. In the evenings, he would set up a table with beer and lemonade and hope for neighbors to come drink with him (we are not from a neighborhood like that).


He often spent a lot of money on fancy clothes and on strippers. I once found a makeup kit in the car that didn’t belong to anyone in the family. He wasn’t really quiet about his infidelity because he said he had the right to. I also found letters once that he wrote to some mistress. It was really disturbing.


When I was 14 he encouraged me to have sex/date as many boys/men as possible. His reasoning was that I had to experience this in order to know what I did and didn’t want in a partner. I told him I understood the rationale, and that I thought it was reasonable to try to not be too shy or to let bad relationships last, but that I didn’t have it in me to date more than one person at a time or to seek a date with someone just for the sake of it. 


Okay, onto my relationship with my NDad and the advice that I need from this community. I have always been my NDad’s “favorite” or “special” child. He favored me because he said I was more intelligent and had a brighter future, and he communicated to me an expectation for very high standards. Though he would praise me for being intelligent and special, which I honestly didn’t get because I never really felt like I did anything that outstanding compared to my siblings, he also would put down my accomplishments for a chance to lecture me and show me how much more he knows. There’s been many tears of frustration when he shows disappointment in me for not reading the list of 20 books he recommended I read in quick enough time. He only shamed my body once, and I stood up for myself immediately. I told him his concept of fat was totally out of whack if he thought that about me, and that my body was no longer a topic of conversation. There's a lot of other things he has done but I've blocked a lot of it out.


Current Issue:


Since he’s been in jail a lot, it hasn’t been difficult to maintain limited contact. Unfortunately, he still does really crazy things to me even from behind bars in a different country. If allowed, he’ll write me 30 pages of handwritten letters and I’ll receive 1 or 2 a week. The content is ridiculous because it’s all about him, and if there’s something about me it’s giving me some amazing life advice that actually isn’t useful to me at all. Still, I let him do this because most of the time I didn’t read the letters and it seemed to make him feel good to have a relationship with me.

Last year, I made the mistake of engaging in several mail correspondences with him. I had just finished undergrad and been travelling for a few months and wrote him a big update about my life and such. Of course, no matter how proud I was of my accomplishments, he always had a criticism or a way to put me down. But then he really overstepped a boundary. I had a partner for 5 years at this time, and in fact thigns were quite stale. My dad wanted to encourage me to break up with him and consider my other options, date for a few years. He did write me a letter to this effect, but he also wrote a letter to my SO (we lived together), outlining all the reasons that we were a bad match and that he should LET me go so I could find myself and find a partner that would suit me better. I don’t know how much of the letter my SO read, I did warn him it would be crazy and I’d prefer if he didn’t read it, but it was his letter and his choice and I think he read enough to get the gist. Anyhow, fast forward a month or so and things between us are weird. They had been before the letters as well, I think in part due to some big life transitions making us re-evaluate our compatibility and happiness. But the whole breakup was so anticlimactic, he didn’t fight for me and that hurt me a lot. I always wondered if the reason he didn’t fight was because of the ideas that my father polluted his mind with. This plagued me for months as I tried to date others and then eventually again to try to salvage the relationship, which just ended up hurting me tremendously. I can’t help but wonder if any of that would have happened, if maybe we would have been able to discuss it and work past our issues, if he hadn’t been pushed by my father that way. After that, I wrote my father with a small update about other things in my life (responses to his questions and such), and at the end said that my relationship was no longer a topic of conversation.

I hadn’t heard form him in over a year. I had moved, he didn’t have my address, and I made no effort to have my mom tell him to write me. I was mad about what happened and trying to put distance. Well, I got ym first letter a few weeks ago, a year later. I really contemplated whether to read it or not. In the end I read the first two and last two pages to get a gist, and glanced at the rest. Again, as usual, most of it is about him, and only a page about him asking about me. At this point I have to mention that I just completed my first year of a combined MA/PhD in a prestigious field. I am building a professional career. So anyway, in this letter, he mentions something about having written to an institute in my field with an inquiry. I kind of freak out because his inquiry is really… naïve? Embarrassing? Like, it’s something that anyone in the field should know. He was writing to get the information for me, I guess because he thought I didn’t know. I thought about how if he mentioned my name, it could look really badly for me. I decided that this time it was not a huge issue because his letter probably only got to a secretary and it will likely never affect me, but I started considering changing my last name. I was chatting about this in passing with my BIL, and he told my sister. It turns out, my sister, who has a much closer relationship to him I think because of guilt, had helped him find a list of Children’s hospitals (my career interest is child health related). I got really anxious and stressed, imagining that he had contacted a bunch of people that could potentially evaluate me for future internships. This is huge boundary crossing behaviour for me, and can potentially negatively impact my career.

At this point, I have decided to seriously look into changing my name, and also that if it should come up, to simply be honest and explain my father’s personality and mood disorders. I wrote him a letter saying that it was unacceptable to communicate with any institute in my field on my behalf, and that behaviour had to stop. I also outlined the kind of relationship I wanted with him – a few letters a year, with certain content, etc. I told him I understood his intentions had been wholesome, that he wanted to help me, but that it was no longer acceptable for him to do that through other people, that he was only allowed to write me in letters about his advice.

I felt good about that letter, though the whole ordeal caused me stress for a week. My mom and my sister, who are in more regular contact, supported me and my stance. My mom said he basically flipped out at the accusation, that he was trying to build a relationship with me and that, even if it should reach someone important, that 1) it will be obvious he and I are estranged and thus won’t impact me, and 2) even if it does impact me or is embarrassing because he is incarcerated, that I shouldn’t be embarrassed because he is my father and he’s worked so hard for us (blegh).

I started questioning whether my letter was worded strongly enough and whether I should write another to really re-iterate my boundaries. The truth is I don’t even want a relationship with him, at times I feel it would be better if he were dead. But I also feel incredibly guilty because I know how much he loves me. I thought my boundaries were a good middle ground, but I don’t have faith that he will respect them anyway.

My questions:
1)	Is it useless to be trying to set these boundaries? He seems hell bent on having the kind of relationship with me that he wants, to the extent that it’s destructive for my personal and professional life. Maybe this should be enough for me to cut contact? One of my sisters has done this, but the rest of my family hasn’t and my brother in particular would be really upset with me. 
2)	If I decide to go no contact, is this something I communicate to him, or do I just stop?
3)	If I continue this limited contact, should I re-iterate my boundaries?
I’m new to conceptualizing my Ndad as a narcissist. I made a lot of mistakes growing up in how I dealt with him because I always tried to explain why he was wrong or how I felt, and that got me nowhere. I’ve learned, but I don’t want to make any more mistakes. Reddit, can you help me?

TLDR; NDad fucks up my life even when incarcerated. I am scared about his effect on my life and wonder if no contact is my best option, and if so how to proceed. If limited contact is okay to try, how to continue to set boundaries?

I talked to my priest and talked to my girlfriend (who I'm waiting until marriage with) and really psyched myself up for it, but it's already getting difficult, especially since I'm living on my own for a summer internship at the moment. I feel as though I'm going to need to do nofap in order to cut out porn, or the temptation is going to keep creeping back. Plus, I start second year of med school in a week and a half, which is going to be super busy with studying for the step 1, and I really can't afford to waste upwards of an hour a day fapping. So that gives me until wednesday of next week to try to power through and get over the initial hill. 

My questions is: for all you guys who have been going for years, how long did it take you to get to the point where you didn't think about fapping in the average day and didn't really need to actively remind yourself to fight against it? I realize that it's going to probably been a struggle I deal with for much longer, but I'm curious as to when you guys kind of got to the point when you felt like you had gotten past an addiction. 

Also, until that point, do you guys have any strategies for fighting off the urge? 

Thanks!"
2clf8z,0,2014-08-04,Very low budget diet help?,[deleted],Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2clf8z/very_low_budget_diet_help/,"Hey all,
So recently I've been trying to get back in shape/gain some muscle, but I think the one thing really standing in my way is my diet.

I'm a college student, currently working FT at an internship, but that's going to change when the summer ends. Chances are I'll be back to my part time job at a convenience store.
I have what I call 'severe budget anxiety', where I give myself $100 a week and if I use up too much of it too quickly-- or find myself in a situation where I'll have to go over-- it practically makes me sick to my stomach.
Because of this, and the fact that I rarely like to turn down social opportunities, I find myself dropping little to no money on food each week so I can afford other things.
I buy bread, pasta, eggs, cheese slices, and beer. My ideal is spending $20 or less a week on groceries, and $1 or less per meal.

My every day diet is usually:

Breakfast:
egg white/cheese sandwich, or 3 egg whites with toast

Lunch:
Pasta with something on it (usually lemon juice and parmasean cheese, or red sauce if I'm splurging)

Dinner:
Pasta again, or eggs again, or an egg white/cheese sandwich, whichever one I didn't have for breakfast.

Now this isn't having a huge toll on my weight. I'm 5'8 and about 145lbs, and have been in that ballpark for the past few years. But I guess what I need to know is what I can do to make this diet healthier without adding to the price.
Are there a lot of substitutions I could be doing? Maybe things I could add to the eggs/toast, or to the pasta, to help me put on some muscle and get in shape easier?
I'm currently taking daily multivitamins with Iron, so I'm not terribly missing anything, except for some protein. I've been considering getting fewer groceries one week and going for some whey protein powder, maybe making some shakes out of that?

Anyway, any suggestions? I'd be willing to go a few dollars over for food budget-- maybe bump it up to $25 at the absolute maximum. 

Thanks in advance for any suggestions. :)

(Oh-- and please don't make me cut out the beer. :( I only drink about a 6 pack a week. I just buy 12 packs in case a social gathering happens!)"

Some background info for what I'll be using it for, I am an intern architect so I want to eventually be able to use it for very graphics intensive work. I will need to be able to run both windows and mac because as of right now these programs I use do not work with mac. I have been using my MBP for a few years now to edit video in FCP and Motion, which is barely been able to handle what I want to do so I will be using both of those programs on the new desktop. Also third and lastly I want to be able to use it for gaming, that is not a major concern because i don't do it often, but I want the capability. 

Anyways though these are a few of my questions 

1. Where to buy (apple store or 3rd party retailer) 
2. If I get it from apple should i have them upgrade things like memory and storage (I am ""some-what"" competent when it comes to upgrading my computer, have only done memory and storage)  
3. iMac vs Mac Pro
          -21"" vs 27"" iMac

Thanks in advance for any of the advice i may receive!"

2cn9p0,1,2014-08-04,I [29/M] with my [24/F] girlfriend of nearly 6 years. She stayed at her childhood home without warning after a trip and is indefinitely not returning as she works through therapy.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2cn9p0/i_29m_with_my_24f_girlfriend_of_nearly_6_years/,"I met my current girlfriend when I was 23, she was 19. Long story short, I moved into her home in a different state for a summer job, because our parents knew each other. When I left to return to my home state, we struck up a long distance relationship.

The following is probably going to sound really stupid, so please bare with me: Within a year we were engaged and had a dog, and had moved into an apartment together. Our parents are friends, our families our friends. We've gone on countless family vacations and spent holidays together. This seemed like the kind of thing that only happens in movies. Fate if you will. 

When we moved out here in 2009 she tried to enroll in college, but that fell off. She started her own business which has more or less thrived. We had a small group of friends but became somewhat enmeshed. She felt isolated.

Two years ago, we moved back to her home, together, for a year. The (dream) job I had originally gotten an internship at called me back for real work. I became totally involved in my job, and around that same time she reached out to her ex under the pretense of settling unfinished business. Something lit up between them, a very brief emotional affair began, I moved out. I found out she had been lying to me and went as far as kissing him through reading her text messages. Trust was lost. This was devastating, but I chased her to get her back, we both went to therapy, and worked through it. She asked that we go back to being girlfriend and boyfriend, that being engaged so young was too much. I agreed completely. Due to the nature of my job it was done after a year. We moved back in to our original apartment in my home state.

When we first started dating (as is usual in relationship), we could not keep our hands off of each other. The sexual chemistry was perfect. It slowly tapered to something more realistic in those first two years. After the incident in 2012, we have been having sex about once a week, and I have to instigate about 90% of the time. About 1 in 3 times she gets really into it, even gets off, and there seems to be that same chemistry. 

Two months ago, because of my lack of trust from 2012, I made the mistake of reading Facebook messages between her and a ""friend"" after she had left her page logged in. There was no smoking gun, but it was extremely flirtatious, to the point I said something. Trust was again lost on both of our sides. 

Cut to this last week. She has been going through a very tumultuous time. Her parents just got divorced, the family home is being sold. We were on vacation together with her family. I came home from the trip, and she went to go help her Mom with the house that will have to be sold. While there she went to therapy and had the realization she had been sexually abused as a teenager by an older man she was in a ""relationship"" with. To spare the specific details I can simply say that it amounts to statutory rape at the least. 

She is now staying home indefinitely. She told me she loves me completely, but is not sure she is in love with me. She said that due to her abuse she has learned she became a good actress, able to suppress her feelings. 

She never had a real adolescence and her parents were emotionally abusive to her growing up. She went from that to another abuser, and six months after met me when she was 19. We moved in together within a year. She cried to me yesterday that I was the only person who had ever been nice to her, that she tried to build a safe home and life with me, but that there is little to no sexual chemistry between us anymore. 

She says she is trying to get ""clear."" She has essentially left me, indefinitely, in our home with our dog, most of her clothes and belongings here, shared possession and pictures. I am supposed to wait, and she says she can't make any promises we will be together or even go to a sex therapist to try to sort this out. 

I made it clear that unless otherwise stated, we are not seeing other people during this, as of now, indefinite period. 

I am speaking to a therapist of my own tonight, but I wonder, from the experience of others, what to do next. I love this girl, we have built an impressive and thriving life together. We have shared possessions and a pet. The idea of breaking up with her seems horrible and messy. When things are good between us they are great, but I recognize I have had sexual frustrations of my own. 

I feel that due to her abuse, and the way she has acted in the past, if I become complacent, and wait for her to make a decision through therapy, I am being weak and ""safe."" I am starting to feel like my only shot of being with her in the long run is to be the one that ends the relationship. It seems like I have given my power over to her and in some kind of fucked up way, though I feel horrible ending the relationship after she has revealed the abuse she suffered, it is the only option. I am basically waiting in limbo in our apartment as she ""figures this out."" 

I know this is long and may even be confusing but any advice would be great!

**tl;dr**: I [29/M] have been left in our shared apartment indefinitely by my [24/f] girlfriend of six years, while she ""figures out"" if she wants to be together."
2cna1l,4,2014-08-04,Problems with my marketing internship,[deleted],AskMarketing,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMarketing/comments/2cna1l/problems_with_my_marketing_internship/,"I recently got an internship position working with a record label to help market and promote a music artist through social media platforms. I was really pleased to get this position despite it being unpaid as getting experience is crucial for almost any sort of job within the music industry. After receiving my first few tasks I have been asked to also promote the artist through my own social network accounts which I am particularly uncomfortable with.

Whilst the artist is very talented, they are not exactly my favourite musician. The vast majority of my facebook friends and twitter followers are close friends and relatives, and thus know me very well. I often unfriend people who continuously share and promote their music/art/small businesses on facebook or twitter as I find it particularly annoying and in many respects, a bit pointless. 

The rest of my duties are fine and I am more than happy to help the label promote the artist in any way, however, I do feel asking me to share the artist through my own social media accounts is a bit too personal. However, I'm guessing they want the position to be filled by someone who is passionate about the artist and this is sort of expected but I would never share/repost anything from my absolute favourite bands online, let alone a band I'm not massively into. 

I've privatised my personal fb &amp; twitter accounts now, making them much harder to find, and have instead made secondary public accounts that will be solely for the purposes of this internship. Obviously this means they are currently lacking in followers/friends, so for the purposes of this internship I'm considering buying some twitter followers to beef up my secondary account, my personal account only has 150 followers anyway! I can also use facebooks ""custom post"" settings so that any posts will be invisible to the vast majority of my friends. 

Do you think secondary accounts/custom FB posts is a good idea? Or will it be pretty obvious and just look bad on my behalf? I don't want to jeopardise or lose the position so any advice would be great.

I hope this all makes sense! Thank you!"

Presently, I’m a web development intern at Kalkomey Enterprises - a company that provides state agencies with online testing and certification for hunting and boating education courses.  While I’ve been with the company, I’ve built a reporting and data visualization platform to be used internally by the company from the ground up.  I’ve worked on every aspect of development of the app - from writing the SQL queries and architecting out the app in Rails to storyboarding the design and writing the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

And while this is the only professional experience I am able to put on my resume, my history with programming is much longer than that.  I first fell in love with programming in high school, where I actually lettered with the programming team.  I still have my letterman’s jacket with the computer patch on the sleeve.  I just absolutely fell in love with programming.  There’s just something so incredibly satisfying about taking a seemingly complex problem and breaking it down and finding a perfectly elegant solution.

I did end up pursuing my other love for history while I was in college, but I never lost my love for programming.  And being a student at UT Dallas, where the Computer Science program is quite large, it wasn’t difficult to stay connected to coding and to continue learning new things.  I did most of my coding in Java at this point in my life, but I also began to branch out into learning web development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

And when my history degree shockingly did not provide me with a career path, I began learning Ruby and Ruby on Rails, which I was able to use to begin a career.  I hope to continue that career and continue to feed my passion for programming with a great company in Austin, Tx.

Quick summary of my skills:

-Ruby on Rails

-Javascript/JQuery

-MySQL

-HTML

-CSS

-Java

I have 3 months of ABAP experience from this summer's internship, and don't have prior experience, so this makes me relatively experienced.

I've been told that I should expect at least $60k+ as a CS, but I don't really know what is practical.

I decided to post here after reading the outstanding stories of some users who felt much better thanks to this awesome community. Hope you can give me a hand. :)

I'm a graduate student in computer science, currently studying in Europe. After I completed my BSc (with top grades) I applied for grad school, I got in with a great scholarship and now I'm almost at the end of it with *very* cool job prospects for the future. Everything looks great, right?! Except that during the past year I completely lost my willpower and the curiosity I had during my BSc. I wasn't exactly one of those guys who would do programming challenges ""for fun"" but I was passionate enough to feel very excited while working on a project (didn't matter if personal or academic) and put a lot of effort in them. I cared about the quality of my code and I loved learning how to use new technologies. Moreover I was a social guy and I liked playing some sports with friends whenever there was a chance.

All of a sudden everything stopped. I'm having the worst time of my life. I'm eating much more junk food than I used to, I always stay in my room and read news, watch series or play some games. I barely go out anymore...In other words: I'm fully inside my comfort zone. And I can't get out. Some people might argue that ""well, this is the average grad student's life!"" to whom I'd say ""thanks but no thanks"". Hell, I'm even feeling guilty because I'm wasting precious time I should be using for my thesis.

I have the chance to take an interview and get an internship in a big software company. Even though the idea kind of thrills me I'm not studying as much as I should because every time I try to open a book or focus on something I should learn, I feel lost after 2 minutes. And I'm in fucking grad school!

I don't even know how (and if) I'm going to finish my thesis. Right now I feel a complete void, as if there was nothing, literally nothing, out there that I might even remotely enjoy doing. I was full of dreams and actively searching a ""purpose"" until a year ago. I've always been a lazy person but only to some extent. This is something radically different and I have no idea how to face this challenge.

I wrote this to see if other people had similar experiences and to try to find the root of this ""feeling"". Is it grad school? Is my master's the primary cause? Should I drop everything and have like a ""gap"" year, maybe while sporadically working just to make a living? Should I start an entrepreneurial adventure (which has been at the top of my ""to do"" list since I started college)? Maybe try to get into a fulfilling relationship (I was in one, had a major breakup but got over it after a couple of months so I exclude that)?

I'm genuinely seeking advice. I know (or, better, I need to believe) I will eventually get over this thing but I would like to do it as quickly as possible (even if this probably isn't the right attitude). Usually I'm the ""shaker"" among my friends, maybe I just need someone who shakes me this time? I really don't know.

Thanks in advance for any advice.

Basically this girl and I, lets call her Michelle, began seeing each other in February. It was one of those things where everything just really clicked, it was senior year so we had a lot more free time. I started caring alot less about close friends and a lot more about her; truthfully it was the first time in my life that I began really caring and wanting to look out for someone that wasn't in my family. Baisically a first love situation, Im sure that can be understood. Things were really good for 2 months or so I mean it was the closest either one of us had to been to someone else. She slept over super often, it made for the best spring break a guy like me could ever ask for, beyond that she was just the most amazing girl. Then for around 2 weeks we spoke not as much as she was just a busier person then me with outside of school commitments. It culminated on one terrible night (a jewish holiday that involved a dinner, truthfully can't remember) where she just was acting very strange not really caring about me. I didn't want to overreact so as my friend began to assemble a group to go out that night I made sure with him that she would come. He asked me if I was sure and I said yes I really wanted her there, even if she was acting weird towards me. Got some drinks right after and it went all downhill, I knew something was up I knew shit would happen that night and I had a terrible feeling. We went out and in front of everyone 40 minutes into the night she was tipsy and hooked up with another guy. Awesome. Baisically had my heart thrown on the ground, I felt like shit. I saw her 20 minutes later in the place after friends tried to cheer me up and she was kind of really upset that I was there and I pushed her away from me (AWESOME. I was an idiot.). With that she had a reason to be mad at me, I had a reason to fucking be mad at her. Yet I was the weaker one and the whole next week I spent trying to talk to her she ignored everything she wanted nothing to do with me. That lead to both of us dropping each other, but mostly me being dropped by her. I took up a little drug binge and managed to embarrass myself when I saw her a few times in the park and in public. I realize finally, I could only get over her if I dropped everything. I deleted her contacts, got rid of her on social media, and in general friends understood not to bring her up to me anymore. Over time, things softened up. We spoke every so often as we still had mutual friends, mostly people I introduced her to (kinda annoying but whatever). Then at the end of May my close friend who goes to the same school as her asked me to come to their after prom. I was friends with a lot of people there through him and her. It was a little awkward since only a few months before I was supposed to be there with her but now people weren't sure how it was to be taken. When I got there we hit it off, we only spoke to each other all night. For the next month this trend continued, we could see each other as friends and we would text again a solid amount. However, I realized I could not handle just being friends with her so I gave it some distance. This ended up being one of the best calls I guess. For July 4th weekend I was away with friends and she began initiating all conversations with me. After that weekend I had to go away for ~4ish weeks for an internship (Ill be flying back him the 7th). So heres where it gets confusing. The first 2 weeks I was gone we literally spoke everyday. It was obvious that we were going to start things back up when I got back. We really missed each other, I was really back into her. Then she sent me a long message one night about how some personal things had happened and she at the moment didn't want to start anything with anyone, not at all something I should take offense to she made sure to point out. She didn't want to lose me but just at that time she wasn't sure about having a guy. At first I was upset, then I realized whatever 'life goes on' I got over her before I can do it again. And I did, wasn't hard this time. I found out recently she got pretty fucked up and fucked this not that awesome guy. It meant nothing and I asked her about it and she even said she was just fucked up and she was clearly very embarrassed about it. Theirs clearly some overlying tension when we talk about things like that. Anyways shell be back from a short trip 2 days after I'm back. It would be awesome if I could be given any advice whatsoever, Im not really sure what to even think for when I see her next but to have some way to prepare before would be really amazing. Thanks.

tl;dr me and girl were together, we ended things didn't talk for a while. we started talking their was tension, our talks got serious then she said she needs to wait, seeing her soon, need advice

Their hits include [trees](http://i.imgur.com/adAOhtJ.jpg), [Jesus](http://i.imgur.com/j7bDwVt.jpg), and [lots and lots of drinks](http://i.imgur.com/JkksEUv.jpg). This hit fad makes everyday, common objects come to life in a quick personification - it's like /r/Pareidolia on steroids. The humorous look on everything from beach balls to windows make eyebombing one of the funniest and most innocuous pranks out there. 

There are even [gifs](http://i.imgur.com/A0japgf.jpg) of eyebombing victims, that range from hilarious to [creepy](http://i.imgur.com/IPTEm.gif). Some victims even end up looking like [pop culture references](http://i.imgur.com/Gba4ENk.jpg).

Overall /r/eyebombing is one of the most innovative and hilarious subs out there, with high quality posts and an active fanbase. The posts are easy to digest and offer some of the most laughs-per-view that I have ever seen.

After having seen the hilarious antics of ""eyebombing"" firsthand, I have ordered my own set [of googly eyes from Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Watch-them-wiggle-Black-PIECES/dp/B0074MHV7W/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1407169547&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=googly+eyes). I know that I will soon be turning everyday objects into googly-eyed beings!

I asked /u/billybird about the subreddit, and here were his answers. 

&gt;1.) What gave you the idea to start an ""eyebombing"" subreddit?
 &gt;&gt;Actually I think “User17”, created it due to popular demand in the “Funny” subreddit. However I am a little unclear. As one of the founders of the eyebombing, I took on some of the modly duties some time afterwards.

&gt;2.) Do you, as the mods, ""eyebomb"" other things, or do you only do your modly duties? 
&gt;&gt;Well I do eyebombing fairly regularly, I always have “googly eyes” in my jacket. You never know, when you find the perfect spot. For me that would be an especially dreary place, with a need of some spontaneous smiles.

&gt;3.) Is there something you never leave your house without? 
&gt;&gt;Googliieies.

&gt;4.) What has been your favorite post in the subreddit as of yet?
&gt;&gt; I am leaning towards this: http://www.reddit.com/r/eyebombing/comments/22ftzg/we_meet_again_se%C3%B1or_banco/ I love how the guy have put so much effort into making his own giant googly eyes.

&gt;5.) Is there anything special about you that makes you stand out?
 &gt;&gt;Well, I think the sub is good for a few laughs. Personally I find it really rewarding to see the creativity, that most of the posts represent. It interesting to see how some ordinary thing, is suddenly turned into something hilarious.

&gt;6.) Is /r/eyebombing a spontaneous creation, or did it start from a single post, or was it a ""brain child""? 

&gt;&gt;“Eyebombing” was Peter and my brainchild, you can see a nice explanatory video here: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-25449223


&gt;7.) Is there anything else you would like to have us know about you or your subreddit? 

&gt;&gt;Not really, it’s a good humoured lot. :)

Not meant to be?",Anonymous442315057,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2co9f6/help_big_relationship_problems_im_22m_and_my_so/,"Read a post about sometimes its external things affecting your relationship instead of just each other. Currently I feel like me and SO are just two puzzle pieces that'll never fit together. We've been going on for 6 years and it's getting to the point where she seriously drains me on a daily basis, every conversation is like walking on egg shells and it's odd to end the convo without arguing about something. I honestly feel that I am pretty laid back and I try not to worry about the little things. I'm actually the guy who is thankful to be Alive and that I'm healthy every morning. But my SO...she's the exact opposite. I feel like I never make her happy anymore and she's always just on autopilot, she's either on her phone browsing or watching tv. The only time she puts actual thoughts and talks to me is when we get into a big argument. (Sigh) Currently I'm in college and I'm going to transfer next year, still live at home with a night job and a political internship in the day. She on the other hand works for a salon as a cosmetologist and sells makeup at another store. As of now, she hates her salon job, they are unprofessional and super annoying fighting with her everyday and dragging her down, it is family owned btw so they can just gang up on her. Also she comes from an addictive family, but yet wealthy. her mother had kicked her out last year of her home because of the moms new bf didn't like her, she lives with her grandma now and the grandma is super wealthy and very strict/mean. She hasn't talked to her mother since last year and now the mom is moving across the country along with her 2 sisters and with her now husband after dating for 4 months. They are leaving Wednesday. Ever since she's been kicked out last year, she has developed these weird like germ issues. Cannot touch the light switches, cannot use certain towels, cannot touch her bed....everything! If I accidentally do something wrong she screams at me and gets so angry...I honestly feel like I have a super mean step mother who is going to bark at me at any second whenever she is near, except it's my SO. Idk what I've let the relationship turn into, I always feel accomplished at the end of a busy day, heavens to Betsy watch out when she comes home from work. 
I feel like a dog who is always trying to love and always be there for her, but whatever mood she's in is what sets the atmosphere for the current time. 
A dog until recently, I honestly feel like I cannot take this much longer, I used to think of her and feel warmth and love and future wife...now I feel nervous when I think of her, like she's going to snap at me any minute. Btw whenever I try to bring any of this to her attention....snaps at me and says all the stuff I do wrong, I just try to control her, and I just use her. Then that hurts me, cause I try to do what I can to be her comfort zone and always make things right and keep her head straight. But I always get yelled at instead. 
I just don't know what to do anymore...this has mostly started when her mother had gotten a new bf and they kicked her out of her house and she got a job at a certain salon. 

I used to be her soft spot but now She's developed a huge layer of skin/ a wall. I am getting to the point where the relationship is not worth having anymore, cause of all the Negativity around it. I've gained weight over the past year I think from her stress she puts on me alone, and I think it will start affecting my schoolwork if I'm not careful.
I'm not sure if I should hang in there, see if there's a rainbow after the storm or if things just aren't meant to be...I'm open to suggestions, opinions. I'm willing to answer anymore questions. "
2cogpr,0,2014-08-05,The Parenting Prime Directive,[deleted],Parenting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/2cogpr/the_parenting_prime_directive/,"So yesterday, my 2 year old daughter didn't eat her dinner. She instead opted for some yummy, sugary snacks that we stash away for rewards and such. We told her 'no', which unleashed the fury of a toddler tantrum that could bend space/time. After about 10 minutes of this, my wife started to give in. She looked at me with those big green eyes and said ""what could it hurt? She's only two."" To which I responded, ""That would be a direct violation of the parenting prime directive.""

You see, I own a large business and I'm responsible for the employees well-being that work for me. I like to bring in lots of interns to teach them how a successful business operates, and how the ""real world"" works while giving them a little cash. I think it's a great way to try and erase the entitlement mentality that has permeated our culture. And believe me, it's bad. I can't tell you how many times I have to explain to my interns that not everybody gets a trophy... in the business world, when you screw up, you lose your job.

To that end, my wife and I have dedicated our lives to bringing forth a new generation which will end the entitlement and all of the surrounding issues. We share our philosophy with other parents, who see it as worthwhile and difficult to adhere to. Yet, we feel that in the end, our child will grow to be a responsible adult, hopefully instilling these values into her children, rather than the typical cycle of rebelling and doing the opposite of what we tried to achieve.

The Parenting Prime Directive goes like this: We have the duty to be parents, and not a friend, to our child. This means we are the teachers, overseers, government, and the judge and jury. We are obligated to do what is best for her while she is young and naive, despite her beliefs that cheesy-poofs are healthier than broccoli. 

As she grows, we have the duty to let her make decisions and learn about consequences from a very young age. We are training her to be an adult- which is a universal state of mind that cannot be defined by just an age depending on whatever country you are in. She will be granted freedom in stages, with our guidance and supervision behind her, much like your work at a business. She will not be granted unrestricted access to such things as weapons, alcohol, and the Internet. Rather, she will be trained on their use, as appropriate, and how to respect their inherent dangers. She will know that her online use is always monitored, and access is a privilege, not a right. 

We have the duty to teach her that religion and morality should be explored by everyone in their own unique way, and that we are not going to try and ""brainwash"" her like she may see in the media or on television. We will raise her knowing what it is like to be in a loving, Christian home, so when the time comes, she can make up her own mind as to the lifestyle she desires. We will NOT cram religion down her throat, but rather lead by example. We will teach the same principles that all religions have at their core: love, tolerance, and humbleness. 

And finally, we have been assigned the task to show her how a man and woman can express unconditional love, and work through problems without yelling, cursing, or hitting. We are to show her what a marriage should be like, and how a family works together to help one another. That means that we cannot simply ""give up"" on one another- we owe it to our child to keep the home together so she does not have to deal with feelings of brokenness and emptiness that comes with divorce. 

It is our most sincere hope that she will grow to be a well adjusted, thoughtful, rational adult, who is well equipped mentally and physically to enter the world and become a productive member of society. She will be proficient in whatever skill she enjoys, and will not try to get through life by living off the charity of others. And she will know that no matter what happens, she will have a support system of her family behind her, who will not judge her or disown her for her decisions once she embarks on her journey. 

I hope you, too, will also adopt your own Parenting Prime Directive, which is unique to your own lives and situations. I hope you will take your job as a parent very seriously, and do your best to raise responsible adults, denying your selfish needs in exchange for their betterment. This is the way to a better future, for our children and our country. 

Thank you for listening.

2cosvq,0,2014-08-05,[HELP] Need relationship advice,[deleted],gaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaybros/comments/2cosvq/help_need_relationship_advice/,"Hi guys,

So im in a relationship with a guy. We have been together for 3 years now. Sadly for one of these 3 years he did an internship in another country for a year. We stayed together but it was really hard. There was days we barely spoke. 

This guy is my first boyfriend, being too scared to go out and explore, he was the first guy i met and we just fell in love with each other. He's a bit older than me and has had his share of experience where as I haven't. He was so kind and spent most of his time with me. 

This all changed when he came back from his internship. He made lots of friends and has become kind of popular whereas i just waited for him to come home to be with me like before. I don't have many friends like him and god just as im writing this i feel like ive become so jealous of him. Hes had his experience in life with friends, relationships. I haven't had my chance to do it all.

The problem is I don't want to lose him. I don't want to break up or anything like that. I just wish i got to experience life like he has...

I don't know where im going with this post now, can someone just give me some decent advice? thanks

2cpghb,1,2014-08-05,hopeless.,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2cpghb/hopeless/,"Apologies for the wall of text, and poor writing. Hard to get down all these mixed feelings into words.

Some background: I live in a very small city (outside of US, UK) and practicing medicine here means having to study in one of the TWO medical schools here. Students usually apply straight out of high school (no need undergrad degree), and the way the school here works is that they weigh grades **very** heavily. Also, it takes **six years** to complete medical school here.

I recently failed to get into medical school for the second time, and it's hitting me a lot harder than the first time. First time I failed because I totally bombed the interview. I wasn't prepared, and thought I could just wing it (arrogant) - obviously a stupid mistake, but one I knew I made. So, I buckled down for the following year, determined to reapply, got myself involved in a lab studying lung cancer, and even got to shadow the oncologist for 6 months. All the while the oncologist I shadowed coached me on the interview, on my application, and even wrote me a great letter of rec (and he's a tenured professor on the admissions board for one of the two schools). So I reapplied, got invited for an interview for the two schools.

I've always struggled with anxiety, especially during high pressure situations, so even with all the help I was given, I was pretty nervous for the interview. In fact, my anxiety has always been pretty bad in social situations, especially around people I don't know because I'm very self conscious and wary of saying things that make me sound stupid. So, with that said, I was pretty damn nervous going in. 

During the interview, I tried my best to remember the things the doctor taught me, and some of the answers I had prepared for. However, there were some questions that caught me off guard and I ended up rambling a little bit. However, all in all, I came out of the interview feeling pretty good, because I did get the feeling like some of my answers impressed them. Also, interviewers from both schools made a point to comment on my CV, saying it was impressive. 

That was in April (school 1) and in June (school 2). Haven't heard back from them since and I know offers have been periodically given out. Also, might I add, school starts in about 2 weeks, so I guess I can take a hint.

I really thought I had a chance this year. I have two bachelor degrees (neuroscience and psychology), GPA is solid (3.89), did research, got clinical exposure, did community service, and even a letter of rec from a tenured professor in the school.

So I am very, very frustrated. This is my dream, and I really thought it was going to happen for me. Not with the same arrogance I had the first time, but because I felt like I put in the effort and time to consider what I did wrong, tried my best to address them, and tried to make myself a better applicant. I've been crying almost every other day because I am at a loss with what to do. I've applied to several related jobs - research, pharma companies, NGOs - and have ended up with not even a single interview. I am very, very, discouraged and have lost all my confidence. I hate socializing nowadays because I hate talking to people who all have their lives on track. It's getting harder and harder each day to get out of this rut and I have no idea how to move forward with my life.

I don't want to give up on my dream, but I don't know if applying is worth it anymore. Maybe I just don't stand out enough as an applicant, whether on paper or in person, and it will never happen for me. But if I do apply, and **if** I am lucky enough to get in on my third try, I would be entering as a 25 year old, and won't be a real doctor until I am 31. Specialization also takes another 6 years + 1 year of internship, so I won't be an established doctor until I am 38. Age may not be a factor for most, but as a female wanting to start her own family as soon as possible, this makes it a significant considering point. 

Anyway, I just wanted to get this out there. I feel incredibly hopeless and such a failure. If anyone actually bothered to read all of this - thank you so much."

2cpiur,1,2014-08-05,Me [16M] forever unsure how to act about her [16F],Throwaway12345231,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2cpiur/me_16m_forever_unsure_how_to_act_about_her_16f/,"I write this mostly to put my thoughts into words, which might let them rest; I'd still appreciate sage advice though. I realize that as a teen my emotions pretty much run free around my head and that how they effect my sheltered life won't really amount to much. That being said, I'd really like to not feel conflicted all the time. (God, please let my mind grow out of adolescence ASAP.)

I first saw her in the first grade, I was in her class in the second, and I talked to her in the third. By the end of elementary school, she sat next to me on the bus pretending to annoy me (I tried to prevent it because, you know, cooties) and I had gotten glasses solely because I thought they looked so pretty on her. 

Middle school rolled around and we rarely saw each other, perhaps waving once or twice. Sometime in there, I gallantly rescued her pencil pouch from a few guys throwing it around (I thought I was superman, pretty sure she didn't notice it was me). As I started thinking about girls, she was always the first that came to mind.

In my area, all the ""smart"" students (really just the ones willing to put in abnormal study hours) are put in a top 5 nationally ranked high school. The day of the entrance exam, she happened to be in the same testing room as me. Walking out of the test, I was pleased with my performance. I tried to casually say hi to her as I walked to my ride, but I shied away as my heart sank; she was crying a little bit. When letters were mailed later that year, it was the same story; I was happy to be accepted, but sad that she hadn't been.

I left my few friends behind and started up fresh at the new school. To be honest, I didn't mind that much. There weren't any gangs or clicks, the football team never won, and our math team always did. Students ate lunch on top of lockers we never used and we ran our own sysLab. Swell right?

A couple months into freshman year, I learned of Homecoming, the one official social event of the year. I went with a girl from a small circle of friends I had just met and generally felt awkward the whole night.

Skip forty some weeks of freshman BC calc and horribly written AP bio tests plus a few precious weeks of summer, and arrive at sophomore Homecoming. As I contemplated whom to ask (a seemingly eternal question) nobody at my school really came to mind. So, I did what all teenagers of my generation do and pulled up her Facebook. Ten minutes later I had a plan; I would ask her (over facebook)(smooth move, I know) to go with me and meet some of the people she hadn't seen in a dozen months. An eternity later, I hit the send button. 

Response? Essentially, ""Sure, sounds great, but I have to ask my mom to see if it's alright."" I think I almost jumped out of my chair I was so happy it wasn't a no. The next night I got another text, ""hey! i asked my mom, and i actually have piano lessons on saturday nights and i have a competition coming up so i can't miss it. i'm sorry!!! i wish i could go."" I think I almost sank into the earth's core I was so sad. I ended up going with friends and you guessed it, generally felt awkward the whole night.

And now here I am, rising Junior, sitting here in between rounds of SAT prep and internship hours, thinking about my weirdly constructed social life: movie going with friends, LAN parties with the same friends, and that ominous shadow of next years homecoming. Once again, I don't have a crush to act upon, or anybody I'd feel comfortable going with ""as friends."" And so, inevitably, my mind wanders back to her... the pretty girl I never really knew, living 2 neighborhoods away, going to school in what feels like another galaxy.

Thoughts reddit? Should I ask if she still wants to go? Have I missed some obvious hint in her reply that says she's completely uninterested? Should I opt to work on my DOTA2 game over Homecoming weekend? I have 3 months to think about it. 3 very long months.

2cpliw,10,2014-08-05,"Came out to my roommate for a guy I really liked. The guy has since disappeared (not literally). Need to vent, and need advice. [NSFW language]",[deleted],gaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaybros/comments/2cpliw/came_out_to_my_roommate_for_a_guy_i_really_liked/,"Hi bros! Crazy long wall of text ahead, apologies in advance. Skip down to the tl;dr, or grab yourself a drink to prepare.

So I met a guy, let's call him Jason, about a month ago on Tinder. We hit it off, had a really good first date just hanging out at his place (and subsequently had really good sex), and seemed to be really into each other. I slept over, and we stayed up until almost 5am talking and cuddling. After the first date we both admitted that it was one of the most fun nights we've had, that we really liked spending time with each other, and set up another time to hang out. Which again, we did, and went even AWESOMER than the first time. Conversations were better, sex was kinkier, and our connection just all around increased.

But one of the curses of dating as a resident of NYC around my age (24) is that you get a lot of people who just live here during the summer - mostly students home from school, or interns here just for a few months - of which Jason was. So after our second date (yes, things moved VERY quickly), he asked if I would be interested in doing a long-distance relationship while he was in school, and if not, if I would at least be willing to keep in touch with him and call him regularly, Skype, etc. And it sounds crazy, but I felt such a connection with him that it didn't weird me out to be asked that. I told him I wasn't so sure about the whole remaining monogamous while he was away (he agreed), but we decided that we should definitely keep in touch/sort of loosely ""date"" while he's away and hopefully resume seeing each other once he moves back to NYC for good next summer. 

Anyways, we set up a time to have our third date, which he wanted to have at my place. My roommate (and best friend) didn't know I was bi, so I figured I would come out to him, as I had been wanting to for a while anyways. I agonized over how to tell him for days, and eventually just sent a text, and of course, he was totally cool with it.

Third date came along, and it was mostly sex. (Not that I'm complaining, cause it was insanely hot.) Talked a bit, went into the bedroom, and fucked for like four hours. He left pretty much immediately afterwards.

But here's the shitty part - I started hearing from Jason less and less after our second date. Between our second and third dates, we talked a bit, but we were both busy, so I was fine with it. After our third date, which was two weeks ago, contact basically became nonexistent except for me sending one every few days and sometimes getting an apology and an ""I was busy"" of some sort. And finally, today, I just kind of exploded and sent a text berating him for telling me he wanted to date me long-distance and then not responding to any of my texts. He said I was being ""irrational"" and that he ""didn't want to argue with me"" and that I should ""calm down."" So I deleted his number from my phone, because I didn't want to deal with this drama anymore.

But I came out to my roommate for this guy. I know how crazy that was to do for a guy after only two dates, but we had this unexplainable connection. I just feel very hurt, especially since this was on track to be my first serious relationship with a guy.

Am I being irrational? Was he just using me for sex? Any advice for future relationships with guys (aside from take it slower)? I just need some outside enlightenment into the situation, cause I'm feeling pretty bummed right now. 

Thanks a lot, bros! You'll be seeing a lot more of me on this subreddit from now on.

**tl;dr: Had a few dates with a guy leaving town in a few weeks, Jason, who told me he wanted to continue to ""date"" me once he left. Agreed. Came out to roommate so that I could have Jason stay over and hang out at my apartment. Stopped hearing from Jason. Sad now.**"
2cpm36,2,2014-08-05,"How to get out of rock bottom? Have ignored finances forever. Meant to post here anyway, but just discovered an hour ago that I have $54k in student loans and am basically a freshman in my major.",InNeedOfALadder,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2cpm36/how_to_get_out_of_rock_bottom_have_ignored/,"So, a lot goes into this. Not sure how much I can condense, but will try.

Shortly, I have never cared about money, bills, credit, etc. I never meant to NOT pay a bill, but also never had a plan to keep up, and if I didn't pay? Meh. Partially, I think this may have been me giving up after declaring bankruptcy at 18 (with **$600 in debt** that seemed like an insurmountable level of debt at the time). Basically, since then, my credit has been shot, haven't had a ""real"" job, and none of it seemed to matter. Now I'm in my 30s and sort of waking out of this coma to foresee a lot of hardship over the next several years (or even decades) if I don't get a handle on things.

Income:

* I'm okay as far as survival right now. Not starving, but sometimes have to hit up the food bank on short months. 

* Living off student loans because I'm in a major (Physics) where I have zero free time for a job. For the moment, this is not negotiable. Hopefully that will change next summer as I gain enough experience to get into an internship or regular research job at the school. 

* I sell stuff online, but haven't put in as much effort as I could (dozens of items sitting around my house that I haven't even posted yet), and this only gives me an average sale of about $50 once every couple of months or so. Hope to use the next couple of weeks before school starts to post more items and get a more professional look for my online sales.

* Also worked at a family member's business over the Summer, which was enough to pay my rent, and that's a relief, but nothing extra.

* I also get about $250/month in food stamps, which will end forever in October.

Expenses:

* Two kids at the age where they grow out of clothes and shoes overnight. All their clothes are really rough looking right now. And too small. We're just trying to eke out the next few weeks before student loans come in.

* Rent of around $600. Student housing, so cheapest affordable in town, aside from subsidized housing, which I might actually look into for next year. The waitlist is at least a year or two long, depending on where I apply.

* Electricity. This is covered by a state program in the Winter months, but I owe several hundred for the Summer, which I'm planning to pay when financial aid comes in.

* Usual school expenses: books, supplies, lab fees, etc.

* Internet will be going up to $55/month after the student intro rate expires. Expendable? Not sure. Trying to get more serious about my online business. Also have to spend 3 to 5 hours a night doing online homework/writing papers and don't want to leave my kids while I go to the library all the time. ???

* Household stuff: Shampoo, Laundry, etc.

* Clothes. I need new underwear and have like two pairs of socks. Where do they go???

* Phone. $50/month. Expendable? I've been doing the online thing for a few months now, and it's okay, but apparently not everyone can get through to that number. I missed what would have been a really good, well-paid internship this Summer because the guy couldn't reach me there. Also missed a few doctor's appointments. My mom can't call. Etc.

* Food. I get food stamps and go to the food bank. However, I know that probably 60% of my income goes to eating out. I love food. I have a high metabolism, with no time anymore to cook, and eating healthfully either at home or out costs the $$. Please, tell me how to lower this expense!


**tl;dr I've listed all the short term income and expenses, but, like I said, I'm okay on survival for now. What I really want to know is what to do now for the near to far long-term. Will making a small investment now be worth it in the long term (5-10 years)? I've reached some sort of limit on my undergrad student loans and am getting a few thousand less this year than last year.  However, I've just finished my first year as a physics major and have 3 years of undergrad to go. After returning to school from a very long break, I feel like I'm finally on the right (practical and inspiring) path. Yet, how will I finish school if I hit the limit on my loans? And how will I start to fill in this hole I've dug if I can't finish school?**

**On top of that, I want to think long term. Looking at my consistently destitute and some aging family members lately, I want to do something different. I don't want to have the worries that my elderly mom has right now when I'm her age. I'd also like to take some of those worries off her back before she dies if possible , but that's probably another post. I'm posting here because I want to do something different, but I have no idea what it is and no immediate financial role models to show me. Completely groping around in the dark here.**"

I have internship at Pall Life Sciences last summer working at their research and development headquarters performing prototype sample preparation, construction, integrity testing, and data analysis. I worked equal amounts of time in a clean room environment as well as on the machine shop floor.


I have experience in a multitude of software including COMSOL Multiphysics for fluid mechanics visualization and analysis. I have experience from this past semester with modeling process systems and creating process control diagrams using ChemCAD for my term project in ""Process Design of a Greek-style Yogurt Facility."" I am extremely proficient in Microsoft Office, especially Microsoft Excel with Solver addon for statistical and linear equation solving. I am experienced in many applications used for non-linear equation solving such as MATLAB, Polymath, MathCAD, and Engineering Equation Solver. These programs all have their strengths and weaknesses, but my usual preference for this application is Polymath which I have on my personal computer. Additionally, I have experience with molecular modeling using Gaussian, ChemSketch, and VMD software. I have used LabView in various physics classes (newtonian physics, electromagnetism, quantum mechanics and solar energy physics) classes. I have basic use of AutoCAD and currently own the software for my personal computer.


I am interested in a wide range of industries including biotechnology, environmental science, process engineering, mechanical/design engineering, and manufacturing/R&amp;D/production. If anyone can give me any hints to anything I may be qualified for, please comment or PM."

    (defadvice rcirc (before rcirc-read-from-authinfo activate)
      ""Allow rcirc to read authinfo from ~/.authinfo.gpg via the auth-source API.

It just works, but I don't want to have my secrets exposed like that because I share my repo in github with some friends. How can  I make this work with .authinfo? do you use it too? can you share your rcirc setup so I can be more enlightened?  D:


Hey guys, I figured it out wit help of my friend.. THe .authinfo should look like

    host freenode port nickserv user cestdiego password mysecretpass


Somehow authinfo asks for secret but the syntax in .authinfo.gpg must be password mypassword

In July, I started my one-month internship in one of the top national ad-agencies known worldwide. I got this internship from a national contest (this company participate along with other top firms in a certain field e.g. banking, consulting and so on; they give internship to 3 people each year).

During the internship I noticed that I'm not given the usual intern work. I actually do things that are really important but there are no enough people in the firm that can take care of those things. So there's place for someone like me - a jack of all trades. 

I should end my internship this Friday, so i emailed my supervisor about ""what's next"". I stated all current projects that currently I take part of and that I'm being offered to help with new projects and I'm not sure whether I should rejects those offers because of my internship.

He answered me with ""We need to talk through it. I need to know if you are interested in staying as an intern on the same terms in August."". I replied - yes.

And here's the deal:
The company operated in city A. 
But for the last 3 years I studied in city B. 

Since October is the month when all classes start, I need to deal with my roommates in city B, find a new place in city A, which may be a little bit rough if I get the job and got less than one month to find someone for my place in city B and find a place in city A.

This is also a case of my comfort - in this situation I may be in a position where I don't know where I live and what I do in less than one month.

So, what do you think - should I just talk to him face-to-face an stated all there is and ask ""Do you want me or not?"" or else?"

So glad to find this awesome community. I turned 31 in March, and I am about to start my last year of law school. I got married just a few months before going back to school, and in the past year I've felt an unbelievably strong desire to have a baby. Like, I just can't wait any longer.  I've always wanted to a mom, but that biological clock has started ticking louder than ever! DH and I are beyond ready. 

I had a professor who told me she was pregnant during her third year of law school, and that timing worked out well for her. I know you can't plan these things perfectly, but I've got a fairly light class schedule ahead, and good health insurance, so I feel like the timing is right. Studying for the Bar with a newborn will present its own challenges . . . but I'll just cross that bridge if/when I come to it.

I stopped taking BC two weeks ago, and I'm finishing up a summer internship out of state. I went ahead and started prenatals, and I'll be home and ready for lots of charting and BDing in about a week and a half. As shitty as I've felt this week with my hormones going nuts, I am so eager to make this happen.

Anyone else have experience TTC or being pregnant while in school?

Seeing as I'm only here for the summer though, I have made it a point of emphasis to dabble in as many activities/events/things as humanly possible. One of these things was the famous Chicago music festival, Lollapalooza. I had planned on going to this event since I moved here, however, my mom had also been planning a trip to visit me in Chicago since I moved here. And her trip coincidentally happened to be for August 1st, 2nd and 3rd. When I discovered the conflicting dates my heart was broken. Lollapalooza is definitely not my mother's scene. So I gave up my dream... Temporarily. 

Early last week my lovely mother called to tell me that she actually wouldn't be getting to Chicago until the morning of August 2nd. I was free to go to the first day of Lolla on Friday, August 1st. ""WHOOOOOOOOO!!!! EMINEM FUCK YEAH!!!!"" When I looked at ticket prices though, my exuberant ""whooo! eminem fuck yeah"" quickly turned into a dejected ""woof....""

No way I was paying that much for one day of Lolla. But, I still really wanted to go to Lolla. I began to wonder, how could I still go to Lolla, but not pay for a ticket to Lolla?.... My young adult brain started to churn.

""Eureka!"" I thought. ""I'll sneak in."" And so the journey began.

After my epiphany I started by brainstorming as to how exactly I could sneak in to Lolla. I'll spare you that full process (as most of my ideas were complete shit) and simply tell you that in the end I decided I was going to be a reporter for the Chicago Tribune covering the event.  

The first thing I decided I needed was a press pass. Having limited graphical design skills, however, I used what I did know. And what I did know was Microsoft Paint. So I put my elbow the mill and churned out what actually wasn't the worst thing ever created in Microsoft Paint. Definitely not legit, but definitely not finger painted by a 2nd grader either. I was fairly proud. 

I completed the press pass by getting it laminated and buying a lanyard for it at the local Office Max. 

Then Friday rolled around. I dressed up in dress shoes, a nice pair of jeans, a button down shirt and brought the press pass, a professional looking binder and a notepad along with me to complete the ensemble.  Then I went to Lolla.

Upon arriving there I first scoped out the area. General impressions: Lots of weird people, way too many young people, a lot of really excited people, and 1 million wristbands. Seeing as how the wristbands were the entrance into Lolla, everyone had one. Everyone but me, that is. 

No bother, I was gonna sweet talk my way past a gullible security guard. All good. So I prowled, I stalked, and I found my target. Two youngish looking security guards protecting what appeared to be an exit gate out of Lolla. 

Me: ""Hi there. I'm [Name Redacted] with the Chicago Tribune. I was told by my editor, Matt Johnson, that I was to report to the Jackson Street entrance.""

Security Guard: (Blank Stare)

Me: ""So, uh, will you let me in? I'm already running late.""

Security Guard: ""Yeah, uh, media right? Yeah you can't enter here.""

Me: ""What do you mean I can't enter here? Matt specifically told me to come to the Jackson Street entrance.""

Security Guard: ""Well yeah sir. This isn't exactly an entrance. This is an exit. We can't let anybody in here. You're gonna have to go to the media entrance down that way.""

Me: ""I'm not just anybody though. I'm a writer for the Chicago Tribune. You ever read the Tribune?""

Security Guard: ""Uh, sure. Sometimes.""

Me: ""I'm sure you've read my stuff. I write on concerts and plays all the time. Now come on. I have an interview with Rod Lincoln that I'm already 25 minutes late for. He's a talent scout for C3."" (Rod Lincoln is totally made up person.)

Security Guard: ""Yeah, sir. I really can't let you in. I'm real sorry about that but my boss just came by and told me no one can come in through here no matter who they are.""

Me: ""Alright, where's the media entrance?""

Security Guard: ""It's about 3 blocks that way.""

Me: ""THREE BLOCKS!?! No way. I'm already 25 minutes late this guy is gonna fucking kill me. You have to let me in here. Come on. Look at the press pass. It's real. I'm not lying to you. Come on let me in.""

This went on a little while longer, but eventually, and I couldn't believe it, these mother fuckers getting paid $9.25 an hour wouldn't fall for this. I tried this or a variation of this at literally every gate to the fucking festival. Nothing. No one fell for it. I went to the Box Office, the main entrances, even the damn media entrance, and got no where. I was down, but I wasn't out.

I scoped the entire outside of the park and eventually I found an art museum right next to Lolla that was having some sort of exhibit. I walked up to the one security guard manning gate, flashed the pass, said ""Tribune"" and quickly walked past her. I then perused the museum, which directly bordered the Lolla fence, searching for entrances. Nothing, nothing, nothing and then finally, about 50 yards ahead, I saw a golf cart pull out of Lolla. ""There!"" I thought. ""There's my chance.""

So I started walking toward the opening from which I had seen the golf cart exit. 45 yards, 40 yards.... closer.... 35 yards... closer... 30 yards..... almost there.... 25 yards..... ""Hey YOU! You in the blue shirt! Stop right there!""

I had seen a cop and a security guard to my right hanging out by the art museum when I started my walk toward the potential pathway into Lolla. And now they had seen me. But I didn't stop. I didn't even turn around. I just kept walking. 

""They can chase me down if they want to."" 

Finally, I made it to the gate and turned the corner. Only to be confronted by an event staffer....

I froze for a second. He looked and me and I looked at him. But then I quickly recovered, straightened my back, gained my composure, flashed my press pass at him, said ""Tribune"" like I was the god damn founder, CEO and editor-in-chief of that mother fucking paper, and walked right on by. 

And I was in. I enjoyed a dope night of Lolla for the price of $7.95 it cost to make the pass. The night of music was definitely worth it.

And even more so, it was definitely worth the story.

2cq5sv,0,2014-08-05,Best option for cutting expenses due to vehicle?,[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2cq5sv/best_option_for_cutting_expenses_due_to_vehicle/,"So, I purchased a new car back in 2010. I was easily able to afford the payments and such with my salary. This last year I left that job and took an internship as a software developer so that I would have decent work experience when I graduate next summer. This essentially cut my income in half.

Fast forward to today, I have been budgeting like crazy for the last year and probably have just enough to squeak by until next summer, however, it's been very stressful and tight financially. This last month just drained the $1500 I had as emergency funds due to cats becoming terminally ill and needing lots of medication and veterinary care.

I still owe $10k on the car. According to KBB, I could sell it privately for 13k or trade it in for ~11.5k.

The options I have considered:

1. Tough it out. I like my car and once I graduate I have a position waiting for me, as well as any other potential offers, so expenses shouldn't be an issue then.

2. Trade my car in. Either for a base level new car like a Kia or for a newer used car. This should result in my still owing about the same amount of money, but ideally at a much lower amount per month (I pay $380/mo right now)

3. Asking my dad to loan me the 10k so that I can get the title from the bank, sell the car privately, pay back my dad, and purchase a 2500-3000 car with the remainder and hope it lasts another year (I have had serious bad luck with used cars in my past including being stranded and having to hitchhike down a mountain, hence the new car).

Which of these three options is the best, or is there perhaps something I haven't considered?"

We haven't talked since I went off to school. But we were always really good friends. And now you're talking to me again. My heart jumps in my chest. I always had such weird feelings for you. I mean, we were friends, sure. But there was always something more about you.

I do have to confess that I find you very attractive. And given the right opportunity I probably would make a move on you. But you don't know that yet of course. So I'll just play it casual for now. Maybe we could meet up at a coffee shop! Yeah, that would be a good idea!

I'm pretty Vanilla, but I'll shake some stuff up every now and again. Be imaginative! ;D 

And other then that I'm mainly looking for people around my age. Or at least act like they're my age ;) Just out of college, in college, or just a bit older would be nice. But if you want to fake it to make it that's fine with me.

HAVE FUN! :D

2cqc3s,3,2014-08-05,"Receiving first adult job offer tomorrow, what numbers should I prepare?",oneNightPrep,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2cqc3s/receiving_first_adult_job_offer_tomorrow_what/,"Hello everyone, I think I will be offered an entry level technical position tomorrow morning.  I've had two internships with this company over the past two summers and I graduate from university  in just a few months.  I don't like walking into any important situation unprepared so what numbers should I be prepared to talk about in regards to a job offer?

I have a lot of experience managing (and mining) data (SAS, java, SQL).  Following US government [guidelines](http://www.bls.gov/ncs/ocs/ocs95apb.htm#programmer), the work I've done this summer falls somewhere in Computer Programmer 2 or 3.  Glassdoor lists this company's software developer's salaries around 50k (location is one of Michigan's metro areas, not Ann Arbor).  How do I talk about a salary without sounding immature or greedy?

Life expenses:  
11k in student loans for a 4.5 year degree (2 majors, 1 minor)  
300-400$/month  Rent
50-60$/month  Food  
60-100$/month  Utilities (Michigan hasn't been kind to heating bills)
100-140$/month  Gasoline  
  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
Family loans:  
7k Car: My dad bought a car to help me have pursue internships, once I pay him for it he will transfer the title to my name. (I have no clue what to expect for insurance costs).  It is a 2009 Focus that now has ~85k miles on it.  
~13k University: He hasn't brought up paying back this expense but he is fighting to meet his retirement goal and I plan to show my appreciation for his help getting started.
  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
Any financial life advice for someone about to graduate is welcome (currently I'm reading through old posts on budgeting), but tonight I'm mostly focused on how to handle a job offer situation.  

&amp;nbsp;  
 
Edit: I should add that this company is known for offering their interns jobs just before they begin their final stretch of university the interns don't have as much time to find other job offers.  I had planned for my last semester to be spent searching for a job, taking this offer would limit my ability to 'look around'.  
  
Edit 2: They made me an offer I couldn't refuse. 52k, pension, acceptable 401k matching, and a few other industry specific benefits.  It looks like we both got what we wanted.  Thank you so much everyone, there wasn't much room for input other than questions, but walking into that meeting with confidence from your advice made the experience enjoyable.

2cqdim,1,2014-08-05,"I [21/F] have been with my BF [21/M] for just over 2 years, and I'm afraid it may be over.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2cqdim/i_21f_have_been_with_my_bf_21m_for_just_over_2/,"Apologies if this is the wrong place to put this, I'm relatively new to reddit. 
Would like to know if anyone has been in a similar situation and how they dealt with it? 
Or have you been this guy, and why?




So I have been going out with my BF for over 2 years now, lets call him Stephen. 
I met Stephen in my first year in college. 
At first we were just in the same group of friends, but gradually became closer and eventually started dating.




It started out great - we could literally talk for hours about everything and nothing, 
and everything about the relationship came so easily and naturally. 
College work was demanding, but making time for each other was never an issue, we always made it work.




Then something changed. All of a sudden we don't talk as much as we used to. 
The conversations have become pretty much one sided 
- I'll jabber on, filling him in with all my news since I've seen him last, 
and he'll simply reply with an ""Oh right"", 
followed by silence (until I start talking again to cover up the awkwardness). 




I try to engage him in the conversation as hard as I can; 

""How was your day"", 

""Did you hear about ____, what do you think of it?"",

 ""Anything exciting happen with you this week?"", 

""What are you doing in work atm?"", 

yada yada yada, all standard small talk questions, but the most common response it ""Nah nothing really"". 




When we meet up, it seems to be the same old song every single time. 

He's always too tired for going out to dinner, sex, and even just holding a simple conversation. 

Usually he'll just want to cuddle and sleep. 

Now, don't get me wrong, I love to cuddle too, but dammit there's just no excitement anymore.




I noticed we were beginning to drift apart about 4 months ago, and decided that maybe we just needed to go back to the start and try to rediscover what we used to have.

 I brought him on surprise road trips to different places for mini adventures, we played various sports, cooked him his favourite meals etc, all of which he loves.


These worked, and we had a great time doing all these things, but at the end of the day, when we were alone we'd go back to silence.





When I try to talk to him about it, he just tells me I'm being stupid and that he loves me, but then that's it. He doesn't seem to understand that ""I love you"" DOESNT make a relationship.

He refuses to get to know my friends, claiming they're ""not his kind of people"", despite knowing how important it is to me. More importantly, despite him never even holding a conversation with one of them.

I understand that he doesn't have to like them, but the fact that he won't even attempt to make an effort really gets to me. 

I get on great with all of his friends, and have always made the effort to get to know them, as I feel like that's pretty important in any relationship. 





Back to the seeing each other part. 

We're both currently on an internship. 

We're not living together, but we're living FIVE MINUTES WALK away from each other. 

Should be oh-so-easy to see each other, right? Wrong.

I'm lucky if I see him once a week. 

Usually he's just too tired to make the 5 minute commute, or even to put up with me if I want to go to him instead. 





His work, on the other hand, has several outings a week and you can be sure he does't miss a single one of those. 

I understand that his career is important to him and that he wants to make a good impression on his co-workers in the hope of a job post-graduation. 

I don't have a problem with any of this, and I don't expect to be the only priority in his life. That being said, I seem to be the only part of his life that he is ""too tired"" for.

 I'm just beginning to feel as if I am an inconvenience until it suits him otherwise.





Every now and again we'll have a great day and I'll feel like I have the old Stephen back, but I don't. 

I know I'm stupid for thinking that it's back to normal whenever this does happen, as I know damn well that we'll be back to this in two weeks.





I'm afraid to end it mainly because I can't imagine not being with him despite all the times he drives me insane, 
and I know how stupid that sounds. 

As I mentioned, he is also in my group of friends in college, so there's that whole awkward situation.

 I also know for a fact that he won't want anything to do with me if I do end things, and it kills me to think that he'd pretty much disappear from my life completely.





That being said, about 80% of the time, I'm not happy the way things are. 

I have so much more fun with everyone, and I know I'm just wasting my time leaving things the way they are. 

It's not even a case of wanting to be with someone else, I just feel like this relationship is driving me crazy lately. 





Even just writing it out now, it just all seems so stupid and obvious that this relationship is going nowhere. 
Maybe I just needed to rant to realise what bothered me the most...




My main question is; has anyone ever been in this situation? If so, how did you fix things / come to terms with ending it?




---   



TL;DR: BF of 2 years, growing apart, can't bring myself to end it but feel by not doing so I'm only fooling myself."

There are more jobs I've had my eye on applying for, but I don't know if they'll be worth it. I wish I knew why I kept getting rejected for jobs. On paper, my qualifications seem to match, but a lot of them want years of experience I don't have. There's a fellowship I want to go for, but I don't know if it's worth it. They want coding experience and all I have is a little HTML/CSS, and some mapping experience. My Ndad has told me companies wouldn't want to hire someone my age (late 20s), and would rather hire someone younger. 

In addition I'm stressed because a few nights ago, I told my Ndad my tuition for my final college semester is due, and how much it was. He started yelling about how much I was costing him, and making me feel like shit. He was the one who said I should look for higher priced apartments. He was the one who said I should accept this internship thousands of miles away. This was right after he told me he was going on an overseas trip next month, and had just bought another house. Then he asked me, ""Where is that tuition money going to come from?"" My heart sank because I was afraid he was trying to say that he wouldn't pay it (despite being able to afford to). Then he said, ""Don't worry, it will all work out"". I don't trust him at all. I emailed him the tuition bill after we talked, but haven't even gotten a response. He said on the phone call that we'd talk tonight and I don't know what to say.

Plus he wants to see me when I get back to school. I already had a panic attack when he told me he wanted to come here. When he was here he yelled at me because I didn't want to write out my bank account balances on a paper ledger, when I have them all online. He screamed at me until I did it anyway, copying them from online to paper. I don't know what to do if we have another fight in person or how to deal with him on the phone. I just want to know that my tuition will be paid. I wish I had more self-confidence to apply for more jobs, too. "

This fall I will be starting my second year at one of the top 3 colleges in my region. I'm going for a Comp Sci degree, but am starting to question it.

What I really want to do is front-end, and it seems like 90% of the CS courses are Java/C, and I really have little interest in that.

I also feel I learn much better on my own, by just doing stuff and looking at code on the internet and reading online tutorials.

Right now I am doing pretty well. I have two internships, one paying a decent hourly for a college student, and another unpaid at a startup that looks super promising. I have years of experience already, and people seem to like what I make.

I'm just afraid if I don't get a college degree, I'll take a big hit with pay.


So I want to hear everyone's opinions. Is college really worth it?"

I got **accepted for an internship at a very good company** (a large defense contractor in the US) for the fall semester** but in AR. I'm in NY**. At the time it was financially feasible to take this internship. However, now it isn't. The main reasons behind this is the cost of commute**. In order to live and work there I require a vehicle. I **don't have a vehicle or insurance** since I live in NY. There is no transportation or taxi service. The company will not cover the costs. 

The original plan was to take a year off for schooling, defer my loans and to go to the internship. I **haven't canceled my classes or housing** for the fall semester so I still have the option of going back to school. I'm **now torn between going into debt to just go to this internship and gain the experience or just return to school**. The following problems is this, I spoke to my career advisor from my university who also worked at this company and she said** if I back out now, it's the equivalent to burning bridges and to expect to not get employed at the company in the future**. So I'm currently in **a damned if I do and damned if I don't situation but I'm really leaning towards going to AR**. Can anyone give me some advice on how to make this plan more **financially feasible?** 

_________________________________________________________________________

**Specifics:** 

* Budget is **$2000 - $3000 for car rental** in total. This excludes any money I'm getting paid for the internship. 

* They have yet to give me an end date, but they told me it was for the fall semester. **Assume 3 - 5 months as the length of the car rental**. 

* Only 2 rental companies. The first one's estimate (Ent - Rent -Car) was: **$1671.93/month with coverage** and **$762.06/month without coverage** I think this was including tax but to be safe, exclude it. Once again, I don't have insurance

* The second one's estimate was  **$230 and tax per week without coverage. With coverage, it would be an additional $240 on the $230 and tax per week**. Once again I don't have insurance 

* I'm getting paid for this internship. It's **$19.75/hour paid weekly**. 

* Housing is covered. It is just the costs of the car rental that is making this a nightmare

* I have a **Mastercard that is shared under my parent's name**. I've been looking into credit card as the insurance option but I'm not sure how it would work since my parents are the one who will have to pay and they are not the ones driving the car. 

* **I am a student**. I'm not sure if that can lower the car rental prices though. 

* There are other interns however asides from carpooling to work, I'll need a car to buy groceries and I don't think that's really going to fly with them. I'm going to ask but **assume that having other people drive me isn't an option**. 

* I'm a **new driver. As in very very recently**. So buying a car may or may not be an option depending on insurance costs

* There's also non-owners insurance but I'm not sure if that has enough coverage given I'm a new driver and it's liability and no collision coverage. I'm also not sure if the state or city I'm working in will affect it's availability. 

* Costs for living such as gas, food, etc haven't been included. 

Thanks for reading and please help me make a decision. "

Before you ask, name's Alex and I'm a uconn student majoring in cs, graduating 2016. I'm looking for some free/paid work to keep my skills sharp during the upcoming school year, preferably in uconn. More details below.

Programming skills- HTML, python, some c++, php, java, and more
Comment or message me if you have some particular language you want me to code in. I either will know it or willing to learn it if your project interests me enough.
Taking 3666 for the fall so I'm willing to write basic assembly too.

Most of my projects are personal stuff I've done. This summer, I've done some web design for a friend and been working on a chatbot in Python in the free time between my internship and tutoring. Unfortunately, it's not in the demo stage and far from its release date to the public. Its nicknamed shitbot if that tells you anything.

The title said free or paid and here's why: I'm a programmer and need to keep my basic skills sharp. If you got something small, I'll do it for free. If you want me for the entire year then I would want money in return. I'm open to negotiations too.

Message or put a comment below if you got questions or wanna hire me. Keep it short or give me a paragraph as long as it gets the general idea across idc. We'll discuss in more detail about contacting, payment and other stuff if the work interests me. "

#/r/Eyebombing

**15,323** readers for **2 years**

There is a small, niche culture of people called the ""Eyebombers"" that don't travel anywhere without their trusty peel-and-stick googliieies (spelling according to the resident experts, the /r/eyebombing mods). They are said to roam the streets, looking for anything that even vaguely resembles a face, affixing their accouterments on the object to make it look goofy and foolish. 

Their hits include [trees](http://i.imgur.com/adAOhtJ.jpg), [Jesus](http://i.imgur.com/j7bDwVt.jpg), and [lots and lots of drinks](http://i.imgur.com/JkksEUv.jpg). This hit fad makes everyday, common objects come to life in a quick personification - it's like /r/Pareidolia on steroids. The humorous look on everything from beach balls to windows make eyebombing one of the funniest and most innocuous pranks out there. 

There are even [gifs](http://i.imgur.com/A0japgf.jpg) of eyebombing victims, that range from hilarious to [creepy](http://i.imgur.com/IPTEm.gif). Some victims even end up looking like [pop culture references](http://i.imgur.com/Gba4ENk.jpg).

Overall /r/eyebombing is one of the most innovative and hilarious subs out there, with high quality posts and an active fanbase. The posts are easy to digest and offer some of the most laughs-per-view that I have ever seen.

After having seen the hilarious antics of ""eyebombing"" firsthand, I have ordered my own set [of googly eyes from Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Watch-them-wiggle-Black-PIECES/dp/B0074MHV7W/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1407169547&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=googly+eyes). I know that I will soon be turning everyday objects into googly-eyed beings!

I asked /u/billybird about the subreddit, and here were his answers. 

&gt;1.) What gave you the idea to start an ""eyebombing"" subreddit?
 &gt;&gt;Actually I think “User17”, created it due to popular demand in the “Funny” subreddit. However I am a little unclear. As one of the founders of the eyebombing, I took on some of the modly duties some time afterwards.

&gt;2.) Do you, as the mods, ""eyebomb"" other things, or do you only do your modly duties? 
&gt;&gt;Well I do eyebombing fairly regularly, I always have “googly eyes” in my jacket. You never know, when you find the perfect spot. For me that would be an especially dreary place, with a need of some spontaneous smiles.

&gt;3.) Is there something you never leave your house without? 
&gt;&gt;Googliieies.

&gt;4.) What has been your favorite post in the subreddit as of yet?
&gt;&gt; I am leaning towards this: http://www.reddit.com/r/eyebombing/comments/22ftzg/we_meet_again_se%C3%B1or_banco/ I love how the guy have put so much effort into making his own giant googly eyes.

&gt;5.) Is there anything special about you that makes you stand out?
 &gt;&gt;Well, I think the sub is good for a few laughs. Personally I find it really rewarding to see the creativity, that most of the posts represent. It interesting to see how some ordinary thing, is suddenly turned into something hilarious.

&gt;6.) Is /r/eyebombing a spontaneous creation, or did it start from a single post, or was it a ""brain child""? 

&gt;&gt;“Eyebombing” was Peter and my brainchild, you can see a nice explanatory video here: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-25449223


&gt;7.) Is there anything else you would like to have us know about you or your subreddit? 

&gt;&gt;Not really, it’s a good humoured lot. :)

Note: This is my first story to /r/SubredditOfTheDay. I'm currently an intern and hope to soon become a permanent fixture here. 

I am a huge Marvel fan, as well as an avid tech user. My favorite subreddits include /r/jailbreak, /r/happycrowds, /r/marvelstudios, and my nurtured lovechild, /r/damnthatsinteresting."
2crhb1,10,2014-08-06,I might be giving up my career for her and now I'm freaking out. M25,Koszi,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/2crhb1/i_might_be_giving_up_my_career_for_her_and_now_im/,"So this is my first LDR, and I'm trying desperately to make it work. You guys are so much stronger than me and so I lurk around here to feel some sense of support. I don't know what this classifies under but I just need to be heard.  

I'll spare everyone details but it goes like this. We met in college, ended up becoming best friends. As most people do we went our separate ways after graduation in pursuit of our dream jobs. Being best friends and all, we kept in touch. As for our dream jobs, although I'm not there yet, it went better for me than her. I ended up in a similar industry with crossover potential to the job that I want. After years of pushing and working for free at times, I'm about ready to attempt to enter it and finally qualified. Sometime durning all that we fell in love.

As for her, she struggled along the way but recently just got an internship for the company she has always wanted to work for and I'm not going to lie, it's looking good. The thing is, it requires long hours of OT most nights and right now she takes them to make a good impression of course and plus she obviously loves her job. After it's all said and done we haven't been speaking much except for when we are both off on some weekends.

Recently a position opened up in her state and I've made it to the final interview. It has nothing to do with any of my career plans but it is still technically in the same industry. I would be lying though if I said I wouldn't be doing it just so we could close the distance. I don't even want it. Truth is, I probably have a better chance getting exactly what I want where I'm at now.

Meanwhile, I get no communication from her because I know she is working. It just has me thinking, that although we would be in the same location nothing would really change. Our work hours will always be different. I would get home after a standard day and if this keeps up she would always be getting home late.

I would see her roughly two hrs a day give or take and that's kind of what we do now in our LDR. Currently, I know never to get my hopes up when she promises to call or get home on time but for some reason I do and it hurts everytime she can't deliver. I know it's not her fault. I try to be supportive but without trying to sound like an ass, what would be the payoff? I wouldn't be happy at my job and there might be days where we barley cross paths.

I know I need to be more understanding, I know it's hard in her current position as well but I'm about to risk my potential future on the sheer chance of being happy with the woman that I love and she might not even be there when I get home.

I don't know what to say, ""it's me or your career?"" I would never do that to her but I'm kind of stuck in that same predicament. I guess, I would probably be doing the same thing if I were her. The fucked up part is that we are going to be meeting in 3 days after 7 months of being apart. What if she has to work? Am I supposed to sit in her apartment all day and basically experience a glimpse of my future to come? 

I'm come to the conclusion that one of us is going to have to give up our goals for a bit. I don't mind it being me but I really need to her to be there for me as well.

By the way, I've gotten curbed on two days in a row. I just get apologetic voicemails the next day during work. So I might not be thinking straight or maybe it's the clearest I've thought in a while I don't know.

I miss her so much I don't know what to do. 

tl;dr: I might be able to close the distance with my SO by taking a job that has nothing to do with my goals but even then our schedules would clash to the point where we might barley see each other. 

**Edit** I'm 22 not 25. I wrote this late last night in a bit of a freak out moment and I must have mistyped.

2crw4d,4,2014-08-06,[FICTION] Just something I spent the morning pulling together. Probably not done yet.,[deleted],mlpoc,https://www.reddit.com/r/mlpoc/comments/2crw4d/fiction_just_something_i_spent_the_morning/,"Game Changer took a deep breath, and sighed. *It's been too long. Far too long.* Shoving his trusty NEIGHS Gamepad aside with a futile hoof, he growled, a tear stinging his eye. Life wasn't fair – all these battles, no experience, and not a rare encounter in sight. 

After Sassaflash had left him, he'd felt stronger in a sense. But now, he sat, with his lonely conscience the only thing keeping him company. He could feel it growing more and more unsettled as the days passed. But it would never be desperate for the safety of a mare's embrace. No matter how long he'd have to wait, he'd always be picky. 

He returned to his makeshift bed on the floor, catching a glimpse of a bright white mare from the window. She wasn't alone. 

**A LITTLE WHILE EARLIER**

Rarity squealed with excitement as the train swept into the station, hardly noticing that one out-of-place hair in her mane. The doors opened to reveal who she'd been waiting for. It wasn't Hoity-Toity, returning for a few more designs. Neither was it Photo Finish, who'd seen the light and taken Rarity under her wing for a short while recently. And thank Celestia it wasn't Trenderhoof. 

The lights cast a stumpy shadow, lined with red. Rarity's cousin had the same flair and style as her fashionista counterpart, but with a few different tastes. Her more casual attitude wasn't enough to frustrate Rarity; in fact, it was liberating, despite her Applejack-like tendencies. 

""Ruby! Gosh, it's been a while, hasn't it?"" Rarity hugged her cousin tightly, who returned a smile. 

""Yeah, you're right! I've missed you! How're things round here?"" Ruby grinned with interest.
 
""Eventful, to say the least. I'm sure you've heard about most of it.""

""Nah, I mean the smaller things! The Boutique?""

""Ah, yes. Business is fantastic, at least when Opal and Sweetie are in line."" The latter was present, and scowled. A little scruff of the mane from Ruby made her laugh, though. Sometimes Sweetie wished for a sister who was a little more laid back. Maybe not like Rainbow Dash, and definitely not Applejack after the time Applebloom was left home alone. Ruby hit a fine balance. She seemed like fun. 

""Heh, it's a shame I can't say the same. Gems are so much rarer over in Manehattan...I can only just find enough to give to you on most days.""

""Aw...that's terrible! I should get Spike to help you sometime soon."" Rarity muttered something about getting him off her delicately-curled tail and returned to her usual pleasant smile. ""Shall we walk?""

""Sure, let's go!""

---

The pair passed by Game Changer's window. In the mood he was in, you'd probably mistake him for someone ill. He reached for the gamepad, then kicked the power button of the NEIGHS with a slow rear hoof. An old, rounded, tiny TV was all he could afford to buy while stockpiling for a better life. Press Start, he was told. He did, with a miserable slam of his hoof. Kchnk. 

""That didn't sound good,"" he murmured, fear building up inside him. He peered over the covers and sighed. There it lay, cracked into six pieces by Game's unfortunate and rather useless power. He didn't know of its origin, but he'd always been too clumsy, never knowing his own strength, since he was just a little colt. Today wouldn't stop getting worse. He shed a tear, alone with a broken destiny that he wouldn't try to fix. 

He stared callously into his weakness, straightening it out with some stern self-scolding through the CRT screen's reflection. He couldn't bear to see himself make a mistake for another second today.

It was then that he remembered the two mares in the window. He'd missed them now. A glimmer of hope, just passing by. Maybe it was still there. He had to try, and he knew it. 

---

""And here's where our tour stops,"" spoke a tired Rarity. ""Welcome,"" and with a little more grandeur now, she pronounced, ""to Carousel Boutique! Home of the finest gowns in Equestria!""

""Guess I can agree with that! I've forgotten to mention, thank for the business lately. It's been fantastic! I think your referrals seem to be working,"" Ruby smiled, pointing a careful hoof towards a little paper plaque under a beautifully-adorned mannequin. 

""Ooh, that's good,"" Rarity grinned, whisking Ruby away into the dressing room to try on a gown. After a short pause, debating whether she should say it, the white mare asked her cousin a favour. ""I'm not sure I can take the later hours today, so would you be a dear and take over until about midnight?""

""Sure, I owe you one!"" Raising a hoof to her chest with a confident smirk, she said, ""You can count on me!""

---

The thunder rumbled over Game's house. He wasn't really one to be desperate for social contact – he preferred to have a Player 2, really – but right now, it was his only option. Flinging his sheets at the wall, he leapt out of bed, now desperate and somewhat crazed – at least by his standards, I guess. And sure enough, the only lit building in Ponyville was the Boutique. He wasn't normally one to end up there. Besides, what was there for him anyway? But now there was no option. 

Moments later, after a painful race to Rarity's pride and joy, he burst through its door, landing on the floor with a thud. ""S-sorry...um...can I speak to the...uh...oh, the m-manager?""

""What've we got here?"" Ruby asked with a curious smile. ""You look a mess! – no offence, of course. That's why we at Carousel Boutique are here to fix that up for ya! What can I get you,"" she asked, offering Game a hoof. He unscrambled his tangled mess of hooves, revelling in the feeling of Ruby's soft touch. It did his composure no favours, and he continued to stutter. 

""W-well...I was just kinda looking for somewhere to go in this storm, sorry...but I'll have a look around. I...um...I guess I owe it to you,"" he smiled. ""I'm Game Changer.""

""Eh, okay,"" Ruby said, twirling a small ring in her hooves. ""I'd love to keep you company! The name's Ruby, by the way. How rude of me not to say so in the first place. I suppose if you want it that badly, we could make you an intern for an hour...""

""That sounds like the sort of thing I'd say!"" Game laughed, seeing his own occasional stupidity emulated elsewhere. He found it cute. ""Shouldn't you clear it with the manager first, though?""

""You can't tell me what to do,"" she laughed, restraining a slight wink. ""Welcome to the team!"" Finding solace in actually having a goal now, Game set to work finding out what the materials where and how everything worked so that he'd do a decent job. Between the odd customer, Game Changer chatted with Ruby, and the night turned out to be pretty fun. 

---

Midnight hit, and the lights went out.""Thank you so much, Ruby. It's been pretty awesome! I wouldn't mind pulling in to help you and Rarity out again...if that's okay, of course.""

""I'm only here on temporary business, mind you. I've got my own place in Manehattan, though, if you'd like to join me – wait, you're from round here, yes?""

""Yup.""

""Aw, that's a shame. Relocating 'n' all..."" Ruby looked to the ground. ""Anyway, sleep well!""

""Um...just one last thing before I go...don't suppose you're much of a prankster, are you?""

""Never really tried, but I know I've got the guts for it!""

""I guess I am if I'm with the right ponies..."" Game blushed a little, knowing he'd blown his cover. With a little laugh and a point of his hoof, he said, ""Care to join me?""

""What...waking her up? Naw...eh, sounds fun enough. Let's do it!"" The two headed for Rarity's bedroom.

---

Each pony perched themselves either side of the bed. Ruby's red mane was still surprisingly bright in the darkness. Game gave the nod, and Ruby gave Rarity a tiny tap on the nose. The duo chuckled as Rarity scrunched up her nose a little, obviously noting it. Game moved a straight hoof as slowly as he could towards Rarity's prominent ear, so as to avoid making the hit too heavy. Gritting his teeth tightly, Game tensed up on contact. Luckily, Rarity wasn't awakened, and instead made a strange huff that made the pair burst out laughing. 

""Last one,"" Game whispered. 

""Nah,"" Ruby grinned mischievously, giving Rarity a slightly harder prod this time. The white mare cleared her throat, and this time neither could hold back the laughter. Laughing quietly – but not quietly enough, the pair made a stealthy escape up the stairs as Rarity awoke, crying out for Opal Essence. 

---

They ended up in a bush. It seemed Rarity had completely forgotten about her guest and, somewhat luckily, her bed too. Noting this, Ruby sighed, and explained when Game asked her what the problem was. 

""My place isn't great, but I guess we don't have an option, huh... Knew I should've joined my sister in Manehattan,"" Game muttered. 

""Your sister?""

""Secret Door. She plays a lead role in Hinny of the Hills, so I don't see her much. She barely gets a break, but I guess she enjoys it.""

""Secret Door? I remember reading that name in the programme when I went to see it once, and I'm pretty sure she did a great job out there!""

""That's good,"" Game said, heading home. Ruby followed, easily able to keep in line with him. ""Um...I've kinda been meaning to tell you something.""

""Hm? What's that?""

""I just wanna say that...um..."" 

Ruby chuckled at Game's inevitable stuttering. ""Aw, c'mon! I thought you were over the whole shyness deal now?""

Following a deep breath, Game said, ""I...just think you're really nice, and I've really enjoyed this evening."" He could feel himself heating up, as he did when he had to do presentations back in school, or when talking to someone pretty important, which he hadn't done too much of lately...

""It's not over yet, silly! Unless you don't want me to come back to yours?..."" Ruby gave a devious smirk. 

""Of course! You deserve it,"" Game grinned in reply. 


Soon enough, the pair entered Game's house. Two rooms, no stairs. It wasn't dirty, but the boring atmosphere it breathed into the area made it tough to live in. Game's bed was an old double mattress on the floor, wrapped in a soft yet heavy duvet. It seemed to make a statement that Game wasn't really a style person – he appreciated substance more. Ruby seemed to have both, and her scent alone revolutionised the room. 

Game lifted the duvet, and Ruby sauntered in with a cheeky ""don't mind if I do"". The teal stallion soon joined her, after getting a glass of water for each of them. Ruby lay on her back next to Game, who was curled up on his side. 

After a short while, Game felt a light tap on his shoulder, and rolled over – only to be trapped on his back by Ruby and her devious smirk. ""You're so cute,"" she laughed. ""Sometimes I wonder if you're actually a colt...but that's no bad thing. I love it."" Ruby closed her eyes, triggering a rush of thoughts in Game's mind. 

*She's not gonna kiss me, is she? I wasn't prepared for this one, huh...and I thought I was the one who jumped in too fast! Whatever, she seems ni –*

It all stopped dead as Game felt Ruby's soft lips on his. Her carefree scarlet mane surrounded him, and her delicate hooves pressed hard on his chest.  Game didn't want to close his eyes, but he'd heard that was the rule or something now. Either way, he embraced Ruby, doing his best to match Ruby's skills despite his own lack of experience. His forehooves massaged her back and caressed her mane, and a long while later, the two ponies ended the kiss to their dismay and held each other tight for the short remainder of the night.

2cscs1,1,2014-08-06,Me [20 F] with my two best friends [20 M&amp;F] I am pretty sure that our friendship is over after long friendship. Need outside thoughts!,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2cscs1/me_20_f_with_my_two_best_friends_20_mf_i_am/,"So, I have been friends with ""Hannah"" and ""Greg"" since our freshman year of high school and now we are coming up on our junior year of college. Greg and I go to the same school while Hannah goes to a different one. Things have always been great. Nothing to complain about. 

This summer, I got a sweet internship out by my school and was planning to live with my boyfriend for the summer. I was excited but sorta bummed that that I would not be home for the summer with Hannah and Greg because we always do fun stuff together. I was always planning to have them make the 2.5 hour trip out to visit me one weekend to hang out and catch up. My boyfriend was gone on a study abroad trip for two weeks so I invited them (and one of our other friends (M21), but he is irrelevant to this story) out when he was gone so I wasn't lonely for the weekend. 

I was excited as shit to have them out! I told them I would cook for them and do awesome things and whatnot. I asked for like $10 from each of them to pay back for the food and snacks that I bought, they said it wasn't a problem.

So the weekend comes and we go to the mall and go the mall and do friend things. We start drinking and whatnot at night and chill. Hannah and Greg start getting too comfy on the couch and it was making me uncomfortable. I see them kissing sometimes but I try to advert my attention to the other friend and just ignore it. We sit around a BS for a few hours and I have enough of the ""Hannah and Greg"" show of them on the couch and bragging about all the fun shit they have been doing all summer while I am out here at my 'boring job.' I casually say that I am tired and want to sleep and so do they.

I expected them to leave that next morning at like noon. No. They left at like 5:30p and kept asking me what plans we had for the day. They were getting under my skin and being immauture about everything. Eventually they left and I was peaceful. Oh and they never paid me for all the food I bought, which pissed me off. I reminded them and Greg even brought it up but nothing. Not like that money is going to make or break me, but it was just the point. 

Since that weekend (about a month ago), I have had ZERO desire to text or communicate with both Hannah or Greg. That whole weekend just left a bad taste in my mouth with either of them. But they haven't contacted me either. I am okay with that. Greg's birthday was the other day and all of my friends from home went to this awesome state park to hike and stuff all day. It is like an hour from where I live. They were posting on facebook all day about how much fun they are having. I felt salty that I wasn't even invited (I know I work fulltime, but an invite is nice and I totally would have tried to get off to be there). 

I just feel that I grew up this summer and they haven't. I work 40 hours a week at a desk job and come home to by boyfriend each night and love it. They work local part-time jobs and spend all their money on weed (which I have stopped doing and absolutely love my decision to quit, I feel like new person). I still value them as people and see them as friends, but I cannot connect with them because I feel I am more 'mature' then them. I'm in a tough place.

So I guess I am looking for to see if other people have had this ""I grew up and my friends haven't"" situation and was able to rekindle the relationship from it. Any advice? Thanks!

**tl;dr**: I grew up this summer and my friends did not. I feel I can't 'connect' with them anymore because we are doing two different things. Is there a way to rekindle this relationship?"
2csgzk,2,2014-08-06,Prospective Cambridge Engineer Crisis,thecarlosgt,cambridge_uni,https://www.reddit.com/r/cambridge_uni/comments/2csgzk/prospective_cambridge_engineer_crisis/,"Hello fellow redditors,

As the title claims, I am a prospective Cambridge engineer, or at least I hope I will be, as disaster within this year has put my morale down. I am taking Physics, Maths, Further Maths, English, Literature and Spanish for A- Levels, and after 11A+'s and 1 A at GCSE, I was confident in being able to go to Cambridge. However, this year, many teachers at my school left, and I ended up with the same teacher for Physics, Maths and Further Maths. The problem came when throughout the year this teacher had an accident, and I ended up self-teaching myself half the term for these three subjects. 
I'm getting the results this 14th, but I do expect over the 90's average in  math, physics, english, spanish and in the fp1 module. However, the fp2 module went disastrously wrong, and it is difficult that I get an A on that specific module (I intend to retake it next year to be able to get an A* in FP maths). Given the large amount of competition that Cambridge has, I have no idea as to how my chances stand. I have decent extracurricular activity, such as several robotics projects, and a week internship at an engineering company. And here come the questions...

1) I can't do anything to improve my existing grades, but I thought I would apply to a college which has the greatest amount of evaluated tests, in order to prove that I am suitable for the course. Do you think this is a reasonable idea?

2) Is there any college I could apply to where entry is, to some extent, easier? Having a look at statistics, Trinity has the lowest acceptance rate. Is there any point in focusing in statistics?

3) What should I do to increase my chances?

FYI: I changed schools and the last years seems much more promising.

TL;DR: I screwed up my fp2 module, and don't know how my chances will hold up + some questions.

Thanks for any help given :)"
2cso3c,5,2014-08-06,"Me [23F] with my Supervisors [45M] [43F] Cultural Differences in Communication, Feedback &amp; Expectations.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2cso3c/me_23f_with_my_supervisors_45m_43f_cultural/,"I graduated last December with my Bachelor's degree, and began my current job in January. I work at an engineering consulting firm that has offices in multiple states. Our office has approximately 12 people. 5 of the 12, including myself, work in my department. 

My direct supervisor, let's call her Gina. My secondary supervisor, let's call him Ken. Ken is Gina's direct supervisor. Gina is from Iraq, and Ken is from Bangladesh. Both speak very good English, and I don't have trouble understanding them when they speak to me. For the most part they are pretty friendly, as is the rest of the office. 

My issue comes in mostly with dealing with feedback/criticism and management/communication skills. In many ways, I feel like I'm living in the ""Asian Dad"" meme 40-hours a week. I hold myself to high expectations in terms of quality, but there is only so much I can do when I'm not given the resources to complete a project correctly the first time. There was no training, no introduction. Just tossed straight into the fire (which is fine, as long as there's some flexibility during the learning process, which there wasn't).

For example, Gina will email me with a report that needs to be completed by X date. I am told to find something similar on the server and use that as a template. I clarify the due date, and submit my rough draft at least a week in advance for our Quality Control process. About half the time, Gina simply makes her changes and forwards the report to Ken for review. I don't see the comments, nor the reasoning for the changes. I get no feedback or acknowledgement. The other half of the time, I receive an email detailing what I did incorrectly. While this has tapered off in the last month, there is no way I could have known some of these details. They're buried in Gina's emails from clients, or in documents that never got saved to the common server. I'm trying my best to track down the information myself, but I need to finish projects reasonably quickly to meet my billable percentage goals.

There is never any face-to-face discussion about mistakes or improvements, it's usually via skype in a very short and curt message. There is no positive feedback, whatsoever. I think that I'm supposed to assume everything is fine if I get silence. I used to sit down with Gina every few weeks to ask her how things are going, if there's anything I need to be doing differently, etc. The answer was always along the lines of ""No, everything is fine. Just make sure you're working quickly to meet your billable percentage goals"". Then later that day, I'd get a lengthy email about issues with a deliverable.

I understand that there are no cosmic written rules about how to be a manager, or how to be a great employee. Everybody does it differently. But I just feel beaten down when I go into work everyday, like I'm going to inevitably screw something else up. Like I'm going to get thrown under the bus again for something that wasn't entirely my fault. I'm willing to take my share of the blame when something goes awry, but Gina is there to take 100% of the credit when things go well, and it's my fault 100% of the time when something goes wrong. I can do my job, but I would be much happier with some positive feedback or a different style of criticism. 

This isn't my first professional job. I had three internships before this, all in similar settings. I've worked many service jobs, had a lot of supervisors, and never run into these issues. I guess what I want to know is, is this a cultural thing? Am I just being an entitled millennial brat that needs to grow a thicker skin? How can I deal with this in a constructive way?

My question then is for those who have AMD vs intel, what has been the experience with the Rift? I currently have an AMD 8320, but with recent issues with Wildstar specifically and what I've been reading here, it seems like AMD is getting beat out handily by those with intel.

Is the CPU as important as I think I'm making it out to be, (not only for usage but development) or should I be fine with what I have and have no reason to worry?

For reference my applicable build currently (nothing is currently OC'd, I'm currently looking into it):

AMD 8320 3.5 GHz

PNY GTX 770 2GB OC Edition

8 GB DDR3 RAM


EDIT: All right, thanks guys, I think I'm just over analyzing all the arguments for intel and against AMD I've seen. Seeing as I've got the 770 I should be fine I think, and hell, my internship may provide a parting bonus ot help out.

It's my first real job after getting my degree, I've studied a lot to get that formation and it was hard.

All started alright, everything seemed promising, until a coworker had a huge fight with our boss (woman at her 50's). He asked to leave and acted rather unethical, harming my boss the work we developed there. Things went downstairs, everything went wrong with the office's projects. My boss started to blame me for it. That I was naive to rely in our co-worker. That I'm unexperienced. And such harasses went on until I started to talk back to her.
My customers like me really much, and so do my coleagues. My numebers are good and I'm the kind of worker that delivers it. And my boss seems to dislike it and try to expose my flaws as much as possible. This week I've received a warning for checking too much my phone. AND I SWEAR that I do not even text back my boyfriend for all day long. I don't even touch my cell phone. God. It's so evident that she is forcing me to quit!

I'm at this job since may this year. Before that I've been through hard times to get this job. Before that I came from another complicated internship that lasted for less than 3 months. And seems like things are irreversibly messed up here.

I'm quite aware of my strong personality. And I'm aware that the fact that I have talked back to my boss could have caused this. I just can't help it. I only do this when I feel like I have a point. And I'm 100% confident that my point is fair/right.

As pharmaceutical industry professional, I'm affraid that in my country, doesn't matter the company, I'd only find workplaces with such issues.

I know that if I quit that job, will be hard to find another one, and I'm afraid that any other job this could happen too.

Traveling is one of my passions and  I have been planning to travel immediately after college for a few years. I'm very good at budgeting trips and have a experience with planning them as well. 

So my plan is to secure a job and graduate in May then delay my start date at my first position. Then I will immediately visit Europe with a friend for about 1.5-2 months. I expect to spend $5500.

I'm currently at my second engineering internship, where I make $15/hr. My earnings from the internship (this summer and part-time during school) combined with my parents' bi-annual contribution will just cover the rest of my schooling.

For the last few months, I have been trying to save for this trip, but some family gatherings have eaten through what I expected to save. Come May, I will have about $1,000 in my bank account, which can be put towards this trip. So basically, I'm ~$4,500 short for my trip. 


My question is, how should I finance this trip? If my parents are willing, my first choice would be to lend from them. We are experienced in this so it won't ruin our relationship. I was also considering taking out federal student loan. In both scenarios I wouldn't take more than $5,000.

Though we have had our rough patches, we always stayed with each other and have frequently talked about our future. Like going on trips once we are finished with school, or living together. He isn't thrilled with the idea of marriage but I haven't pushed it at all because his parents and grandparents went through ugly divorces. No pressure, we are both just content having each other in our lives. ""Who knows what the future holds"" type of mentality.

So onto the point. Josh enlisted in the marines back in January and he has been working his ass off to get himself ready for boot camp. By that I mean he lost at least 60 pounds within the span of a year or so. I am so proud of him and the way he lights up when he talks about the military is great. I have no doubt he will serve our country well.

So, we have discussed the issue of the distance. For 3 months I won't get to talk to him besides letters. Then he will return for a few weeks before he is shipped off to train for his job (he wants to get into aviation maintenance) which will be at least a year if not a year and a half. Though he will be allowed to visit 10 or so days a year, this will be a long time for us to be apart.

The thing is though, I have only ever been his number one fan. He comes from a tough upbringing and has friends who are bad influences. He has told me many times that he doesn't want to get stuck in our small town or go down bad roads. Who am I to say anything against that? The most I've said is that I will miss him like crazy. But I think my enthusiasm for his goal has pushed him to want to go as soon as possible...

Recently, instead of going in the spring, he decided he wanted to go in December. But just last week the staff sargeant at his recruiting center said he is ready to be shipped out at any moment. So now it is looking like it might be October. He told me this with such excitement that I could do nothing but smile and say how happy I am for him.

Really reddit, I am so scared and nervous. It ended up coming way faster than expected. I guess I always just put the enevitable in the back of my mind and tried to enjoy the time we had. I am torn between sharing these worries with him and keeping them to myself. I am sure he is worried too but I want him to go to boot camp with the utmost support so I just kind of keep it to myself.

I know I will survive while he is gone, I consider myself an independent woman. I just bought a new apartment in a major city, and I'm starting grad school in a few weeks. I know I will keep myself busy with school and my internship.

I have faith in him and I. I'm just worried because I love him so much. I guess I am just wondering if anybody has gone through something like this. I have researched some tips and stuff but would appreciate any actual stories from real people!

tl;dr; My man is leaving sooner than expected to join the military, I am supportive but worried about him and our relationship"
2cu4cd,13,2014-08-06,It's recruiting season. Get yourself in gear now!,mel_cache,geologycareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/geologycareers/comments/2cu4cd/its_recruiting_season_get_yourself_in_gear_now/,"The petroleum companies are gearing up and going on recruiting trips now.  This is the time to contact your university's Career Placement Center and find out who (if anyone) is going to be interviewing at your school and when.  Sign up ASAP. 

If you have already graduated, do it anyhow.  The Career Centers are meant to serve graduates as well as current students.

If no one us coming to your school, then you need to go where they are.  The AAPG STUDENT EXPO is a good place to try; a lot of companies will be looking there.  

Another option is to contact someone on the inside if the companies you are interested in.  If you have developed contacts from prof. meetings, call them and ask if they can tell you who us recruiting at their companies and give you a phone number.  Then call that person and see if you can get onto their recruiting roster, even if you have to travel to get there (reasonably, if course.)

Do not text or email them instead.  This is a time when you need to actually talk to the people either on the phone or in person.

If your profs have contacts, use them.  If not, see if you can get the names of some folks off the memberships lists of a local geological society for people in different companies (look for people with job titles like ""Rocky Mountain asset supervisor""), cold call them, explain who you are and ask their help in finding who to talk to in their company about recruiting.  They may not help, but more often than not they'll try, and give you a name and phone number to call.

This is also the right time to use your interviews to find a summer internship for next year, if you're a student.  Many companies, especially the larger ones, seem to be hiring almost exclusively from the pool of people they've brought in for internships,  so you really want to do this.  In the O&amp;G industry, almost all internships are paid (and pretty decently, too) so go after them!

Good luck to all if you."

I am currently a college student and I want to put internship money into a Roth IRA to make my financial aid package better, as the university cannot touch retirement accounts (I hope this is correct). I was wondering what sorts of preferences of Roth IRA account providers you all have. This money is outside of an emergency fund I have and my only debt is subsidized loans, which I understand that Roth IRA money can be withdrawn without penalty to use for those up to $10000. So I believe this is the best allocation of this money. I am currently leaning towards Fidelity due to their low transaction fees, as well as the fact that they have a physical location nearby that I can go to. Though I understand that Vanguard has lower expense ratios in their funds? Please correct any of my beliefs/understands if they are wrong. Thanks!

2cuahz,18,2014-08-06,Did someone say tech jobs? We're hiring a few developers.,fortunado,Bend,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bend/comments/2cuahz/did_someone_say_tech_jobs_were_hiring_a_few/,"There was a post a few days ago about tech jobs, and I wanted to follow up with some openings for web/app development we have at Tivix ([our site](http://tivix.com)). We've tried Craigslist, but the signal to noise ratio is pretty lousy-- I figured we should give r/bend a shot. Mods, feel free to unceremoniously ban me if this is out of line.

We're based out of San Francisco and we just opened a branch here in Bend along the Deschutes River. Again, we do web and mobile development. Here's some of the tech we work with on a daily basis:

* Django/Python
* Django REST Framework
* AngularJS (and ReactJS, to a lesser extent)
* Native mobile (iOS, Android)
* Real mobile (Heh, HTML5)
* LESS
* Bootstrap

We're about 30 people strong (2 in this office) and we have clients ranging from scrappy startups to multinational megacorps.

---

Here are some of the positions we're looking for, in the order that we're looking for 'em:

**Frontend Developer**

We're looking for someone primarily with JS skills, but also an eye for design/usability. CSS should come pretty easily to you, and it really helps if you have experience with LESS or Sass. Bonus points again for templating experience with any major framework, or experience with Bootstrap. If you haven't stepped outside Photoshop in this decade, this position isn't describing you. We don't do a PSD &gt; HTML design process and we don't really have any ""designer"" roles. Our AngularJS projects seem to be multiplying like rabbits, so that's the biggest thing we're looking for. Please don't hesitate to apply if you're confident enough in your JS skills to apply without all the other stuff I mentioned.

**Dev ops**

Maybe you groan when you hear this buzzworded position title-- we do too. But there is something to be said for the support role in web development. If you're good at setting up servers/VMs, or if you know what Ansible or Grunt is, or if you can answer all the really hard questions our backend guys will throw at you in the interview(s), then I'd like to talk to you.

**Backend Developer**

Python is mostly what we're looking for here, but if you've ever worked on a backend that talks to the world through an API, that works too. Django experience is a plus. PHP experience is a minus (Hah, just kidding... mostly...). Your ability to work well with others is also important. As a consultancy, we're constantly spinning up new projects and handing them off, so there's a lot of communication required.

**Intern**

If you're a particularly talented post-high-school (sorry, high school kids!) student who's interested in diving deeper into web or app development, we'd like to hear from you. The position pays SF minimum wage, which is $11/hr. We aim for a good mix of solid learning/contribution opportunities and uh... well, the boring work that interns typically get stuck with (yay editing HTML markup!). Our last intern had a patent in her name, so I dunno... The competition is pretty intense. Include work samples! School-wise, I guess this would be for the winter semester. We're willing to sign the relevant paperwork and structure the internship around your school's hours requirements. This position's not guaranteed in our Bend office-- it might end up going to someone who applies in SF.

---

E-mail me your resume, Twitter, Github, thoughtful haiku, etc that you think tells me why you're qualified for the job at **rex[at symbol]tivix.com**. Please include the position title in the subject of the e-mail. If you do include a resume, please include either a URL to it (ie, it's web-based-- please don't dropbox a .doc), or a Markdown-formatted text file. Yes, interns, this applies to you too.

Remember: We work in a business where it's hard to communicate just how much we know. If you don't have work samples posted somewhere online, it becomes about 100x harder. Include those work samples!"
2cuixs,26,2014-08-06,[Help] Finding a job for my teenage self that won't make my anxiety go through the roof?,[deleted],Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/2cuixs/help_finding_a_job_for_my_teenage_self_that_wont/,"Hello, everyone. I'm a 16 year old heading into my senior year of high school in 2 weeks. I really should have a job. I should have some sort of income to save for college, maybe a car (if I ever get my license, but that's a whole other anxiety issue, one at a time), or just for disposable income to go to the movies and what not. My friends all have jobs and whenever we go out they absolutely insist on buying me food if we go out to eat and paying for me at other places such as the movies. I hate it and it makes me feel terrible. I constantly tell them not to but they still do it. It makes me feel pathetic that I'm the only one without money all the time because I don't have a job like they do. They have jobs or volunteer, drive, have bank accounts. I don't have any of that because anxiety restricts me from everything. I know this sounds like a typical case of trying to grow up too fast, but it's really not. These are kind of normal things at this stage in someones life. And I'm not doing ANY of them or even making an effort to do any of them because of anxiety. 

I literally (and I don't use that word hyperbolically) have not done a single productive thing this summer. I haven't visited colleges, tried to get a job or internship or volunteer, gotten my permit, etc. I sleep til around 12pm through 2pm, then just go on the computer or play 3DS or watch Netflix all day. Almost every single day of summer has consisted of just that. My moods and energy levels are all over the place. I fear for my future everyday and thoroughly believe I will end up homeless because I'm just too afraid to do anything. This is my last year of high school. After that, then what? What the fuck do I do?

The problem is that the jobs available to people of my age are mainly retail jobs, like a cashier or some sort of customer service. I do NOT want that at all. I could go on and on listing my irrational fears, but some of them include completely forgetting how to give change or do simple arithmetic even though the fucking cash register tells you how much to give because of the anxiety I'll experience of a person waiting on me to give them change and then having them yell at me, not knowing the answer to customers' questions and basically customer/human interaction in general, turning red (I have a huge fear of this and to help that I'm the palest person on the face of the earth) or just completely making a fool of myself during a job interview or on the job.

One of my biggest fears is seeing people I know in public. This has now become a HUGE problem for me because I've started see people I recognize from school fucking EVERYWHERE working at places I go to. It's especially terrible because these aren't people I talk to. I'm not friends with them. I'll just happen to know their name and they'll know me because I had a class with them or something. I couldn't even imagine working alongside one of them.

So I guess what I'm asking is are there any jobs I could get at my age that involve very minimal human interaction? Maybe accept online applications too? I would LOVE a job where I just clean tables or wash dishes. I can totally handle that. And I mean, that seems to be a pretty common job, right? The whole busboy gig. Just washing dishes/cleaning tables. I see people at restaurants doing it all the time. But I'm afraid that if I apply to a restaurant and start doing that they might want to promote me to cashier or something else at some point.

Well this was a hell of a lot longer than I wanted it to be. Sorry about that. It's really hard for me to make anything short, especially on this subject.

I'm trying so hard to fight this and not let it run my life, but it's just so extremely difficult. I've been feeling very suicidal for a while now. It's beating me right now. It's winning.

EDIT: Wow. I stopped checking this post last night and then fell asleep thinking that it was just gonna get buried. Then I wake up to a bunch of thoughtful comments. I did not expect this at all. Thank you all so much. I'm reading every single one of them."
2cundd,3,2014-08-06,So I met an awesome girl last week and go study abroad in two weeks from today...,throughwayunder,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2cundd/so_i_met_an_awesome_girl_last_week_and_go_study/,"Before I start this, here's some background as to who I am: a third-year computer science major at an engineering school who has never had a real girlfriend and only one kinda dated one. No relationships during highschool and none during my sophmore year of college.

The story is that I've been an intern since the beginning of June in NYC and she started as a new hire at the beginning of July. For all of July pretty much, we were pretty good friends and out of the blue, (to me) she invited me back to her apartment last Thursday after a going away party for a coworker. Now I really don't want to leave this fucking city but I also know I can't justify or sustain staying. My only plan right now is to keep in contact and remain friends until I can come back and visit and see where it's gone from there. Sorry, I just had to rant at someone about this and all my friends in the city work at my office.

TL;DR Intern meets girl. They become friends. Girl uses hookup on intern. Due to lack of time left together, it's highly effective! Intern is confused, annoyed, and maybe a little bit heartbroken."
2cusge,3,2014-08-07,Short term housing question,[deleted],indianapolis,https://www.reddit.com/r/indianapolis/comments/2cusge/short_term_housing_question/,"Hello! I am a recent graduate who will be interning for the government (downtown) for from late August- October. I was just notified that I was chosen for the internship and while I am very excited about having my dream job, it has left me with just 2 weeks to find housing. I've been doing extensive research and making calls and emailing people, but since I'm not from the area I feel like I might be missing out on a known company or apartment complex that has 3 month leases. 

My question for you all is there a place you recommend or know know that has reasonable housing or is there a particular area I need to stay away from due to crime (I am a young female)? 

Do you have any experience renting from companies like Execu-Stay or VIP Coroporate? is Craig List as shady as their reputation?

Thanks, I realize these are pretty broad questions but any and all information would be helpful! I am looking forward to being able to get to know your city!

2cv2sq,2,2014-08-07,[NF] Drum and Bass,in_casino_0ut,shortstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/2cv2sq/nf_drum_and_bass/,"This is the story of the night when one of my good friends, Jenni, texted my mom “Just show him your dick,” at five o’clock in the morning.

In order for this to truly make since to you, I need to start with a little backstory. I had only been living in Berkeley for a couple weeks when Jenni arrived. On one of her first nights at our new apartment, we decided to visit a local brew pub that was within walking distance. We started the short trek, and in no time were standing at the bar enjoying our first sips of I.P.A. We chatted amongst ourselves, but it wasn’t long before we noticed a man sitting alone, reading a book about “great bars in the bay area.” At first glance he looked like your average American father stuck in the middle of a culture not his own. Button up shirt, shorts, loafers, a hat that gave me the slightest feel of Indiana Jones, and glasses. He looked to be in his late fifties, early sixties, but in no doubt 20 years senior than every other patron. Jenni and I made a quick remark about his choice of books, and the peculiar fact that the bar he was enjoying this warm evening was nowhere to be found in the pages. Larry was his name, and he stated that he actually lived in San Francisco, but today’s heat was too much for him to bear. He crossed the bay in hopes that Berkeley would be cooler, and decided to settle here for the evening. We talked for quite a bit, and half way through the conversation his husband, John, had arrived. After a couple hours of talk about all San Francisco has to offer, Larry and John invited Jenni and I to dinner in the city. They wrote their number on the back of a receipt and passed it off to us, with the intention of dinner the following Saturday. We parted ways, and ended up at another bar later in the evening where we met a South Korean named Sung, who was doing an internship at U.C. Berkeley. He was drinking alone, and had mentioned that he didn’t really know anyone. We exchanged numbers with him as well, and that is where the evening ended.

The next morning, we realized that we had lost Larry and Johns phone number. This is a bit of a debate between Jenni and me about who lost it, but the fact still remains that it was gone. Arguments aside, I did a bit of detective work and ended up finding their address through the internet, and we decided the most logical thing to do was send them a post card from San Francisco that stated our grave mistake. We made the decision to go see Fisherman’s Wharf a week later, as well as attend a “Drum and Bass” show on 6th street, which we later found out was a bad area. We invited Sung to meet us at the show, and Jenni and I headed over early to check out the Wharf. It was packed with tourist and tiny booths that sold shirts, panda hats, shot glasses, and our most needed post cards. We picked one out that was a vertical shot of the Golden Gate Bridge, and wrote our information along with a short note about our errors on the back. We dropped it into the mailbox, and took a photograph to keep record. 

With our main task completed we ducked into an Irish bar just a block back from the Wharf, and ordered a couple local beers. An older man was doing an acoustic set in the corner. His voice was nothing extraordinary, but comforting, almost enough to make us decide to stay at the pub instead of going with our original plan of the drum and bass show. We made the decision to continue on, paid our tabs and started walking towards the club. We arrived about half an hour later, and met Sung outside. It didn’t start for another 45 minutes, but they were running a special for Buy one Get one free drinks from 10 until 11. That fact alone is what drew us to the show, and we were not going to miss out on it. While waiting in line, a man approached the queue from out of a nearby ally. He had been hit in the head, and his face was covered in dry blood from an open wound just above his right eye. His clothing hung from his shoulders as the back of his worn khakis dragged across the pavement. Incoherently he slurred a sentence, and left me wondering if he was drunk or concussed. Before any true words could be spoken the bouncer, in all of his 300 pound glory, escorted the man away. 

The doors opened and we descended the stairs into the basement venue. The room was poorly lit with murals all over the walls, as well as an extra lounge room beside the bar. The floors were concrete, and the recently moped surface caused your shoes to stick, making each step a struggle. We ordered our first round of drinks, and before the show had even started we were six deep. We listened to a bit of the first set, and the alcohol was already surging through our veins taking rational thought out of the mix for the remainder of the evening. Eleven o’clock had rolled around and the Buy one Get one had stopped, and at that point we made a crucial decision that came back to bite our asses later in the night.

For those of you not familiar with the Bay Area there is a train system called the B.A.R.T. which runs until midnight on Saturday night. However, it starts back up at 4 am on weekdays. I am sure you can see where this is going, but on Sunday morning the B.A.R.T. starts back up at 6 am. Jeri, Sung, and I were unaware of this, and at 11:30 we made the decision to stay in the city until 4 am and take the morning train home. Secure in our plans, and no longer worried about catching the last train home, we set out to another location.

Sung told us of a bar that was super great, and wasn’t too far away. He had learned about it from some of his classmates, and said the name was Beauty Bar. We swayed to our next watering hole, and waited in line for just a couple of seconds. The club was a sliver of open space with a bar that extended three quarters of the room, and ended to a crowded dance floor in the rear. It was filled to the brim with people, and held little to no room for forward movement. I nudged my way into a spot at the bar, and ordered two Budweiser’s. I passed the second to Jenni, and maintained my spot with the whole intention of ordering again in less than five minutes. Jenni started talking to a group of gay gentlemen while I talked to a female friend of theirs. The guys asked Jenni if I laid with men “in the biblical sense” to which she replied “I don’t know.” I quickly entered the conversation to set them straight, or in this case set myself straight in their eyes, and gave Jenni the evilest look as she giggled away into her beer.

The friend of the gay gentlemen had left but returned quickly and started talking again with Jenni and I about the glow sticks she had just acquired in her absence. She passed one off to me, and I placed it atop my head. Seconds later we spotted that Sung had made his way to the top of a platform currently being held by a group of early 20 something girls. He began to dance with them until he decided he wanted his own solo show. One by one the girls abdicated their territory and Sung became the sole ruler of the dance platform. We cheered him on with drunken shouts as he danced his heart away to thumping beats.

Two o’clock was quickly approaching, and the three of us decided to make way back towards the train station to get a bite to eat, and wait for our 4 am ride. We realized half way there that we could still hit last call, and hopped into the first bar we saw on our way. Once inside we walked straight to the wood bar and were greeted by the bartender. Jenni ordered a shot of gin, I order a shot of Jameson, and Sung was too drunk to order anything. The shots were poured, and I passed my credit card across the bar. The bartender shook his head, and pointed to a sign that said “CASH ONLY.” This left us in a bit of a predicament, because there was no A.T.M. nearby and the three of us were cashless. The bartender gave us a way out and said that he would give us the shots for free if I flashed him my crotch sausage. About this time we realized the dive bars name, Hole in the Wall, had two meanings and shyness overcame me. I decided I was not about to whip out my baby-maker in a gay bar, and Jenni decided to secretly let me know that I should just do it via text message. She ended up sending it to the wrong person and my mother awoke to two texts that night. The first being “Just show him your dick,” and the second being “Sorry.”

I never showed him my deep V diver, and he actually ended up giving us the shots for free, to the drunken promise that I would return the following day with twenty dollars. I never returned, and to this day I still feel like an asshole about it. We left Hole in the Wall and made our way towards the B.A.R.T. Jenni was way past gone, and Sung was barely staying up right. I essentially navigated us around in multiple squares while Jenni kept straying the opposite way every other block shouting “People don’t Judge you this way!” It got to the point that I had to hold her and Sung’s hands as I dragged them in my allegedly “right” direction, glancing down to my phone at every intersection for bearings. 

Around 3 o’clock we arrived at the train station, and fell into a nearby Carl’s Jr. for a late snack while we waited for the train. I sat Jenni and Sung down at a table, and went up to order a couple burgers to pass the time. While in line Jenni had struck up a conversation with a homeless man waiting to use the restroom. He had Blond hair and was wearing torn jeans and a T-shirt riddled with holes at the seams. He ended up sitting down with us, and I purchased him a cheeseburger as well. Jenni started hitting him with some hard questions about his life, and about half-way through his burger he got up and left.

Four o’clock approached and we made our way back to the station ready for the night to be over. The see through gates to the tunnel were still down, and we asked a man standing nearby if he knew when they would open. 

""I don’t think they open back up ‘till round 5:45.” He said as the information fell heavy into my ears with a glance around at my two drunken companions. “There’s a bus though, that runs all night.”

With our new information we started our journey to the bus station, stopping only at an A.T.M. to get cash. We caught our chariot, made our transfer in Oakland and arrived at our apartment around 6 in the morning, probably only 15 minutes before the train would have arrived.

Everything worked out well for us in the end. Larry and John got our post card, and we ended up eating dinner with them a couple weeks later. The only real downside was that Sung never hung out with us again, and I think he was too scared about what might happen if he did. The best part though is that my Mother called me the next day, and very casually asked, “Did you show him your dick?”

Her - 20F enrolled in community college classes, both online and in the classroom.  She serves tables during lunch and is a hostess in the evening.  She is an extremely talented painter and works as an unpaid intern in an art gallery.  

Her income is roughly $1200/month, BUT she is paid in cash and I worry that she will be audited if she doesn't report all of her earnings and pay income tax.  I helped her estimated the federal, state, medicare and SS taxes she should be allocating for tax payments, but she has difficulty keeping her budget less than her after tax income.  

To get a rough idea of our expenses: we both live in a city in the Midwest, she pays $150 of our $800 rent, pays $70 a month in car payments to her father, though she rarely needs the car because we live close to her work/school.  She is still on her parents insurance (auto/medical/dental) and isn't required to contribute.  Also, I'm fairly generous in taking her out to meals 6-12 times per month and paying for expensive groceries, so as not to lower my own standard of living, but not burdening her by my taste in food.  

She receives little to no financial support or advice from her parents after turning 18, though they're both loving and emotionally supportive. 

I try to explain time value of money to her, but I have a feeling that she doesn't comprehend what I'm saying.  I push her to finish college in a reasonable amount of time (she wasn't in school when I met her, but she has accumulated about 27 credit hours entering the F14 semester).  She sometimes references her ~35yo aunt, who is pursuing her second degree, albeit in acupuncture, and has significant debt, in saying that she is in no rush. 

What I want to impress upon her is that she should be in a rush.  I would like her to allocate &gt;$2000 this year to her college 529, save enough to pay her income tax, and take 9+ credits each semester.  

I also want her to learn how to manage her own finances, so I'm trying to set up incentive schemes.  For example:
Opt 1. Rent - $200 if college 529 deposit is $0
Opt 2. Rent - $175 if college 529 deposit is $50
Opt 2. Rent - $150 if college 529 deposit is $100

Do you have any other ideas for ways I could provide an incentive for her to practice healthy financial habits?  Our relative social standing and income disparity is frustrating to her and I don't want to shove it in her face.  Frankly, I want to marry this girl as soon as she finishes college.  However, I don't want to wind up paying off unnecessary debt and I would like her to start building some credit (sorry that's previously unmentioned, but it's a secondary concern).  

I'm having a difficult time explaining how she should finance college because I don't see a ROI if she pursues a fine arts degree.  I want to tell her that I don't have a problem with her earning very little money, but I want her to graduate college and be employed in a way where she feels fulfilled (probably art) and respected (not waiting tables into her 30s).  I can't seem to say this, because I don't want her to feel financially dependent on me at this stage in our relationship.  I would like to empower her to make better decisions, but approaching the subject is difficult, because she is quick to give up when she feels that I have superior knowledge of the topic.  

Sorry for the rant and lack of cohesive financial info on my part (I was initially going to post to r/relationships, but I think this post falls somewhere in between).  Please provide advice on what I can do to help her and I will try to provide answers to any questions regarding our financial situation and relationship.

2cwfir,11,2014-08-07,"Me [26 M] with my girlfriend [23 F] of three months, having trouble getting over past issues",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2cwfir/me_26_m_with_my_girlfriend_23_f_of_three_months/,"My girlfriend and I met a year ago and really clicked. We went on a couple dates that were amazing but then she started flaking out of nowhere. Eventually I gave up.  
  
Several months later her internship and housing lease were both coming to an end. She thought she was moving away so she hit me up to pick up a few things she had let me borrow on one of our first dates. We ended up hanging out for an entire weekend and falling in love. Like serious falling in love. We immediately made plans to see each other again and could not stop flirting at every opportunity.  
  
We saw each other again shortly after and had a lot of fun. Then came the good news, she wasn't going to move away! But then she started flaking again. Then she started giving me lame excuses.  
""You're too cool""  
“I don’t deserve you”  
""You don't like my music""  
""You're too happy""  
“I’m materialistic, you’ll just end up hating me”
  
I comforted her on all her worries and gave her space. I respected her choice of not wanting to see me anymore. But every day I thought about how we had fallen in love. About a week later I called her and told her I wanted to take care of her, love her, be with her, help her, etc. She broke down in tears and couldn't say anything back. She said she would call me back later. She never did...  
  
I gave her space again. I tried getting over her but I couldn't. All of a sudden I get a text from her. “You’re amazing, I want to be with you.” My heart stopped and I called her. She tells me that she was in a tight spot with money and moving out of her place. Some guy who lived nearby who she had gone on some dates with offered to store her belongings at his place and she said she had to accept his help. Otherwise she’d have had to move away. She further tells me that she’s now dating this person. She says she doesn’t really like him but had no other choice and that her goal is to ultimately be with me. She’s living with him. 
  
We start talking on the phone a lot and start texting again. All while she is officially dating this other guy. She promises once she finds a new place in a month or so she will break up with him and be with me. I’m surprisingly okay with all of this because I just want to be with her. I love her and I can tell that she loves me too.  
  
Now things are weird. We’re talking on the phone and loving each other but she just gets angry at me. She’s angry at me for pressuring her to leave her current relationship. But I wasn’t. I’ve been nothing but accepting of her current situation.  She’s angry at me for just about anything now. I break it off with her and tell her to just contact me when everything is figured out and she’s no longer with that guy.
  
One month becomes two, which becomes three… Then the father of the guy she’s dating dies and she tells me she can’t just leave. So three months become four which eventually becomes six.  
  
During this entire time we still had some fallouts where I would call or text her saying I was still thinking about her, or it was her who would do the same. We seriously could not get over each other. I tried dating other people but I just couldn’t.  
  
Finally after those six months (which were incredibly painful for me) she texts me something lame. I can tell she wants to talk to me so I entertain it. I'm eventually the one who tells her to invite me  to have dinner at her new place. Anyway, I accepted and it was amazing. The passion was still there and we went right back to making tons of plans and flirting with each other non stop.  

She put me through a lot when she had started flaking after we fell in love. She would often bring my hopes up by contacting me while she was dating the other guy but only to get angry at me again. When our relationship finally started I felt like she owed me a true sincere heartfelt apology. I didn’t want her to feel guilty or sad about anything but still, at least an apology. I also expected her to fight for me a little bit. She never did. I’m worried I was always so easy for her to have.

I think our relationship moved to quickly when it finally started and within a week we were already telling each other “I love you”. This created lots of expectations in my mind and then lots of things started coming out that were creating so many worries in my mind.  
  
Here are some things I found out when we finally started dating:  

- When we had first met about a year ago and had gone on a couple dates, she was in a long distance relationship with someone (she lied to me about this when we first met and kept trying to lie about it throughout our relationship, they were communicating with each other until the middle of her relationship with the guy who helped her move [red flags??] aka, she had 3 guys in the picture at one time)

- She started getting super jealous about girls who liked my things on Facebook and Instagram. I always assured her that she had nothing to worry about. And she didn’t. I even deleted some people to help ease her mind because I could see it was really bothering her.

- She had opened up to me about some guys who always hit on her at parties or gatherings with friends. Some of them apparently made some ultra creepy moves on her while they knew she had a boyfriend. She said she hated these guys. Then I find out they like each other’s stuff on Facebook and Instagram, and even Snapchat… This wouldn’t bother me that much but threw me off because of how she freaked on me about girls on my social media.

- If I ever bring up these guys in her life or ask questions she gets super withdrawn and the whole thing feels sketchy. But I don't know if maybe I just shouldn't be asking in the first place.

- She gets distracted a lot. For her job she has to stand outside sometimes and her face gets a lot of sun (bad for her skin). So one time we were out we went into a CVS and I bought her a super nice sunscreen for her face. She didn’t even say thank you. I asked her about it and she got defensive and said “dude come on! i was just distracted!”

Anyway, certain things remind me of how awful she has treated me in the past and I’m having trouble getting over it so I can appreciate what could be a good relationship with her. Is it just me who has to get over things? Does she owe me more trust and respect (like not talking to those guys anymore)? Are we doomed?

---   
**tl;dr**: We've had a rocky past and since we started dating everything has been a tricky issue and we often start arguing. Should we keep trying? We really love each other.



-----------------
EDIT: Is it fucked up that I want someone in the comments to defend her? Is it fucked up that I want to be with her so bad? We connect on so many levels. I don't know if I should stick it out and keep trying to make things better or if this really is a relationship I need to get myself out of."

I am a junior in college and for the last year I have been receiving a scholarship that pays me a monthly stipend, an annual book stipend, an annual health insurance allowance, and summer internship support payments. In total, this all comes to around $38,000 each year. Last year my scholarship began in August, so I only had around $12,000 to report on my taxes. I received a 1099-misc detailing the payments they had made to me. I used turbotax to file last year's federal and state returns, which cost me about $80.

My question is this: I followed turbotax's instructions for the 1099-misc and the tuition information my school sent to me, but I didn't feel very secure that I had reported everything correctly. Is it worth it for me to invest in a CPA? About how much would it cost to have a CPA file my taxes if I do go that route?

Also, should I be making quarterly estimate payments as if I were self-employed, or just pay the lump-some at the end?

Finally, if the scholarship is automatically paying my tuition, do I report that money as income? I believe I did last year, I just want to make sure I know for sure next time around.

Thanks in advance for your help!"

Everything is going really well! We are about to reunite after two months of study abroad (both of us). We're seniors in college, but graduating in December.


When we first started dating, she had a part-time job at a retail store and kind if liked it. But as time went on, she grew to really hate the place and the people there. It was partly because the management changed and she was more 'with it' than the new person in charge. It hurt to see her having such a lousy time.


I've been very lucky in that I've never had a job that I didn't enjoy. I'm a STEM major, so I've mostly worked during the summers in different labs, but I have worked during the year as an tutor. The tutoring center at our university pays really well, and I had a great experience there. So I recommended it as a decent place. I did warn her that I only worked about two hours a week there (enough for a little extra cash) and that although I knew I could have taken more hours, I don't know how many. She was so eager to quit the retail job, she took the new one anyway.


She applied for and got the tutoring job and then quit the retail job at the beginning of summer. But the tutoring center didn't have any hours available for what she could tutor during the summer, so she had a job, but no hours. And now that she's back from China (and unpaid internship that she had to pay for) she is really low on cash to get by (but school and rent are taken care of. She isn't sure if she'll get enough hours this fall. 


I know this was her decision, but I love her a lot and I feel personally responsible for her financial situation (which is mot dire at all, but sucky). 

---   
**tl;dr** I recommended an old job to my GF, she took it and they haven't scheduled her. How can I help?

EDIT 
I should add that she has not shown any kind of ill-feelings at me despite the fact that this is my fault, but I have no idea whether she resents me for it."

Unfortunately, things haven't gone as planned and I never got pregnant during 3rd year.  If I get pregnant in the next few months, my due date would be right as I start intern year, which seems like terrible timing.

Before all of this I said I absolutely did not want to have a baby during intern year at all.  But now, I feel like we should just keep trying and let it happen when it happens.  After all our careful plans didn't work out and who knows how long it will take us.

Does anyone have any input on this?  Anyone who has had a baby during intern year, or after?

2cy0aa,2,2014-08-07,(17/m) struggling to get over ex (17/f) of 2 1/2 years,michaelcooll,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2cy0aa/17m_struggling_to_get_over_ex_17f_of_2_12_years/,"Edit*: Reading the title it sounds kind of confusing, basically we dated for 2 1/2 years and broke up about a month ago

Basically we broke up because I was recently being an unhappy person, just all around, it was no one's fault, but my own. I was just having some personal issues I had to deal with and I'm currently getting a lot better actually.

But she moved about an hour away to pursue an internship with a director to follow her dream of being a film maker. We dealt with it at first, but sooner or later she got fed up with how I was acting and couldn't see our relationship working for the time being. 

We tried to be friends right after, but it hurt me too much, and we both decided to have time away. She wanted to work on her dream, and I'm trying to figure out what I'm going to do with my life. I still love her deeply, but I agree with the decision 100%

Now here is the kicker, she stated she think she ""might like"" someone else. He's been a really close friend of her since before I even met her and I was always uneasy about it but who am I to say who she can and cant hangout with so I trusted her 100%. I know she didnt cheat on me so do not accuse her of that. But when we talked about it she said she doesnt want any relationship at all right now and that she thinks ""dating anyone that isnt you is dumb"" 

We had a long talk and long story short she basically said that if after highschool I still care about her the way I do now, then to give her a call, because I deserve a second chance if I care that much about her. AND I KNOW that sounds really fucked up and shitty for someone to say but I think she meant it in a genuine way. She is open to the idea of trying again, but later in life.

Well, oddly enough, I already feel happier than I did back in our relationship, I'm over coming anxiety and sleep issues, which was the main cause of my personality change and break up, and I started to hangout with my friends like I used to in the beginning of high school.

I can truly say I feel better about myself (I even kissed this random girl the other night, something I normally would not have had the confidence to ever do in my life). 

BUT everything I see somehow reminds me of her and I still love her very very much. I don't plan on heading into a relationship anytime soon at all and I'm still holding on to the hope that I will call her down the road...

I just don't know what to do at this point? Should I even bother hoping for that? I honestly just feel like we were so happy together when I was in a happier state of mind and I miss what I was able to give her and what she was able to give me..."
2cy90p,5,2014-08-08,I hate my cat.,Cat_throwawawayyy,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2cy90p/i_hate_my_cat/,"My cat used to be my sweet little guy but ever since I moved away from college three months ago he has been unbearable. I live in a house with some friends. He has peed in carpet, on couches, and in laundry bins and boxes of books. He actually shat all over a spare bed in the basement. He has been crying and yelling for the past month straight. 

I can't take it anymore. 

I can't take the stress of coming home and discovering another thing he has destroyed. 

I can't take the texts and calls from my housemates of something he did that I will have to replace.

I can't take the general uncertainty I have when I leave him to go to my unpaid internship while I work a second job everyday. 

I can't fucking take it.

He peed on my bed today and just discovered it recently. He is a fucking menace. My housemates don't want him in the house and it makes sense. My fucking cat is ruining my relationships with them. 

They have had to chase him to get him inside multiple fucking times. 
My cat is bringing me nothing but stress and sadness. 
He is currently outside because today alone he has peed three times after I shooed him out of my friends laundry bin. 

Honestly I hope one day when he escapes he can get lost so I don't have to deal with him any longer.

I'm so fucking done. He was the sweetest cat before. I miss his old self. 

Edit #1: my housemates do not like him at all. I mean if I were them I wouldn't. Also the litterbox has been a big problem to place. Once he pooped all over the bed he is no longer allowed in the basement per landlord. So now it's in the spare bathroom but it's right by the door. I lived in a house last year and he was totally fine. At this point I feel like I may have to move out when the lease is up just because of him. I think I'm mostly stressed because he damages other people's things.

**Episode 11: The Return of Tech**

Hello my old friends! I know it has been over two months since I last posted. I apologize for letting you all down. During the time period of  Episodes 9 and 10, ""Honey I called the electricians"" parts 1 and 2 some things picked up in my life and reddit went on the back burner, but now I am back baby! Be prepared for exciting new tales of my adventures as a new tech. If you guys really want to know what became of our hero the new tech when he faced the separatist $electrician forces, I will gladly fill you guys in, but I will say that not much happened. Now on to the story...

By the way, all new tales will be posted under the name /u/PvtBacon1stClass as I have wanted a new name for a while. This post has also been posted on that account.
__________________________________________________________

We find our hero, the tech cheerfully entering the office... errr I mean his secret base... theeeee ummm the... Coffee Cave. Yes the Coffee Cave.

He is equipped with the bare essentials. 1 cup of hot black coffee and 1 cream cheese bagel. It is a beautiful summer day. All is well in our hero's world for today the IT staff will be moving into their new offices! Yes, while we were away our hero's company renovated the floor that IT is located on. This was great news as the IT department was expanded. The additions included actual offices instead of a single room with desks along the walls and a work table in the middle that provided 2 1/2 feet of space between the workers and the table. It was quite cramped.

The new offices aloud for two IT hero's per office. These offices surround the old 1 room office on 3 sides. In total there at 12 new offices. Not all are filled though. (Hints to expansion perhaps?) The old room still has the work table but also a full area with tools for hardware work, a monitor system that displayed certain data on the server room such as the temperature, humidity, readings on any power fluctuations, etc., and the old tiny closet that was once both a work area and storage space was now plain storage. The IT crew also pitched in and bought a [Delonghi BCO130T Combination Coffee Espresso Machine](http://www.coffeeforless.com/delonghi-bco130t-combination-coffee-espresso-machine.html?gclid=Cj0KEQjw6pGfBRD09M-TmYTBzqIBEiQAcRzH5y2pYDS0OCOp4NBigPIoRxbaL24ixQO_3AL-9Ale2ncaAjUk8P8HAQ#.).

&gt;Me: Hey there Bryan! (My friend who first got me the job at this place)

&gt;Bryan: Oh, hey there Professor_Derpsalot. Guess what? We are office mates!

&gt;Me: Dude this is so epic! I guess we should go set up our computers.

&gt;Bryan: Actually, IT Head had the two interns set them all up for us. Everything is ready for us to get to work without a hitch.

&gt;Me: Hey hold it now, these are interns we are talking about. Are you sure they did it right?

&gt;Bryan: Yup I checked, they got it all right.

&gt;Me: That is a relief. I am so ready to watch the portable we have been in for the summer be carried away. (The IT department has been in portables since a week after the $electricians incidents. Turns out those projectors were a precursor to the renovation that we should have picked up on.) Alright lets get to work.

As we all settled in and rejoiced over our shiny new work environment the head of HR popped in.

&gt;HeadHR: Hey there IT! I just wanted to pop in and ask what you guys all think about the new office.

&gt;HeadIT: It is great! We all love it.

&gt;HeadHR: That's good to hear. Well I will talk to you guys later.

HeadHR had not been through the doorway for 5 seconds when we heard the distinct sound of a pair of black dress boots we had come to fear. Now down in the south where I am, some people opt for black cowboy boots that are well fitted and made as opposed to black dress shoes. You know, the kind that creek with each step because they are so stiff. A large portion of them are ostrich because it is just viewed as more professional. Anyways, there was only one person at our place of work that wore such a pair of boots and he walked very loudly in them. It was the **COO**, ~~perhaps the most incompetent man I have ever met~~ perhaps the best man I have met that is cut out for an executive position at a company.

&gt;COO: Hello there HeadIT, I have a task for your department.

&gt;HeadIT: Oh?

&gt;COO: Yes. You see, I need someone in here to---

&gt;HeadIT: COO, I am sorry, but I need to stop you there. You see, I need to read you a bulletin sent out to the company.

HeadIT proceeds to pull out his phone and go to an email.

&gt;HeadIT: rrrrr hrmm hrmm ""Attention all [Propane Company] employees, from this point forward anyone that has a need at all related to IT no matter how small must use the request or ""ticket"" system to officially submit a request that the task be addressed directly from their own account so that we can keep track of all the fine work that IT does for us. Any employee that has trouble grasping this concept may be viewed as a security risk. Thank you all for your hard work, [Herp Derpson] COO, [Propane Company]."" So as you see [Mr.Derpson] I am going to have to ask you return to  your office and submit a ticket.

The COO opened his mouth as if to produce a retort, but closed it and simply walked out muttering to himself.

&gt;HeadIT: You know how long ago he sent that email? 4 years ago. You know what else, I have had that bookmarked on my home screen for 4 years waiting for the chance to rub that email in his face.

Lol

**10 Minutes Later**

*ding*

The sound of the notification that a ticket had been submitted rang through the offices. And I was the lucky one that just happened to get assigned to it. Lets see... *scroll* *scroll* *scroll* Oh boy, I get the *""pleasure""* of changing out 8 of the computer monitors in the marketing department because someone (A certain boot wearing executive) told them to put them all in one place out in the open during the renovation and a residual ladder had fallen and broken them. But whats more is that apparently this was a mishap on IT for not ensuring the ""proximity safety"" of all the hardware.

What the fuck does that even mean?

2cyqw9,2,2014-08-08,I need insight about my current internship.,[deleted],graphic_design,https://www.reddit.com/r/graphic_design/comments/2cyqw9/i_need_insight_about_my_current_internship/,"Hey guys, I currently have an unpaid graphic/web design internship with a small local print/marketing shop. My problem is the owner, Jim, says he doesn't like the amount of web banner revisions I had to make (about 3-4) for his new website. This isn't anything new to me because this sort of communication error happens from my previous internships as well. 

Jim stated that wasted his time and doesn't want to micromanage me, but he's willing to give me a second chance. This absolutely pissed me off because the purpose of the unpaid internship is for me to improve as a designer and letting me go does not solve that. It is also worth noting that was my first design project from him. 

Another problem is he doesn't think I'm not doing a good job on fixing small problems on his site via liquid.css because it's hosted on Shopify. This is personally my fault because I told him I can do it but, Jim must have interpreted as I can do it well. 

It's weird this was all of a sudden these are problems for him because we got a long well and even considered him a friend. There might be a hidden 'stress factor' in this considering he has a 1 yr old child and his business is only 3 years old. 

So my question how should I should have handled his problems? I pretty much conceded the entire time because I feel disappointed in myself for not communicating well. Which also brings me to my next question how can I communicate better based on the given information?"
2czciz,0,2014-08-08,"I live in Charlotte, NC, am currently a junior pursuing a BS in Computer Science, and want to move to Seattle ASAP!",atlas_novus,Seattle,https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/2czciz/i_live_in_charlotte_nc_am_currently_a_junior/,"I will definitely be finishing school here in the Queen City of course, but I think that relatively soon after I graduate, I would really like to move out to the west coast, specifically Seattle, WA. I've done a ton of research on the city and I have no doubts that I'd love it there. My only hangup is finding a stable, salaried position *before* making the move. Like I said, I will have a CS degree when I make it out there, but I'm just not sure how the job market is, who's hiring, or if Seattle is even big for IT/computing careers. 

I'm not entirely sure that I want to sit around and write code for a living either (this is all they teach us in school, and it more-or-less puts me to sleep!). I am certainly willing to work anywhere in the industry in a position which pays decent-well, provides a steady 9-5 schedule, allows me to live comfortably (I know the cost of living is a little higher there), etc. etc. My main question that hopefully some locals will be able to help me out with is: How tough would it be for a young, single bachelor with a CS degree seeking employment in the IT industry (preferably not programming or straight software development) to make it out there and live comfortably in Seattle? Any responses/advice is greatly appreciated! Thanks!  

EDIT: Thanks for the responses you guys! It's all great advice. For those of you familiar with Charlotte, I definitely appreciate your reinforcement of what I've already found to be true about this city. Don't get me wrong, it's clean, and there's a lot of opportunity out here, but much more on the business/banking side of things (and yes it is *very* soccer mommy). Anyway, I will definitely think about looking into an internship this coming summer. I am hoping to find something paid, as my school is paid for largely with financial aid (I couldn't be here without it) and am not sure about the specifics of living expenses, etc/how UNC Charlotte handles all that. Anyway thanks again guys, and I hope to see some of you out there within the next few years!

EDIT2: Also, mainly out of curiosity, for anyone who's local to the area and familiar with BC/Vancouver, how 's the living up there? "
2czhuc,3,2014-08-08,"Hi TwoX, I'm 19F and during a summer internship abroad I lost my virginity to someone I may never see again (potentially nsfw?)",geographicallysad,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/2czhuc/hi_twox_im_19f_and_during_a_summer_internship/,"Okay, story time TwoX! I've lurked on this sub for a long time and I didn't know where else to find some support and guidance. I really hope that I don't sound as needy and selfish as I do in my head, but please bear with me. 

Let me start from the beginning. The someone that I lost my virginity to was an older expatriate that I worked with. Let me start off by saying that it was all completely consensual and that my contract ended at the company before anything happened. 

It all happened as kind of a whirlwind romance; I definitely admired him a lot upon meeting him earlier during the summer. His team at the company all love him, he's great at what he does, and he's overall just a sweet, great guy. (Sure maybe a bit of a player but hey) 

Because I was new in town (along with another intern that I lived with), our trio would grab dinner a lot since he's more familiar with the area. One of the things I loved most about spending time with him would be his stories - all these crazy, crazy stories about his experiences and adventures. 

We would grab drinks a few times during my last two weeks at the job, and we talked a lot about just life in general. He talked a lot about his personal life; he's been throwing himself into work because it's really what makes him happy now- he's satisfied by it. He had a few serious exgirlfriends but they never worked out.

Last week after my contract had ended, I went to a get together he was having at his place, one thing led to another and we ended up hooking up - but we didn't have sex. I ended up crashing at his place for the next 2 days because we were both dealing with a wicked hangover, but afterwards he said I could move in for the remaining few days I had in the city. Free rent and cuddling! :)

We ended up having sex two days later (I totally ended up jumping him oops). All was good and dandy; I wasn't involved in his social life and he wasn't in mine. I was convinced this was basically a fling, no emotional investment, no strings attached. 

However the next night, which would be our last night together (as I was going to be leaving for another city), he was hesitant about sleeping with me again. He talked about how he didn't want to cause emotional distress for himself. He didn't have a purpose in sleeping with me since he was at the stage when he should be investing in a family, a relationship etc.  I obviously told him that that was totally a logical fallacy - this wasn't a relationship blahblah with my buzzed logic and talked him into it after like two hours. So we slept together again our last night together. And that night.. I did tell him that it had been my first time when we slept together the night before. In retrospect I think he really did have my best interests at heart when he talked about emotional distress - he wasn't worried about himself - I think he was worried about me. I left the following day. 

TwoX, I'm probably never going to see him again. I was kind of a wreck the afternoon that I left when reality finally sunk in- I hadn't realized it, but I had already gotten emotionally invested the night we first hooked up.

Connection wise, I think that he was one of the first people I have ever met that I've just clicked so well with. It was never awkward to hang out with him - it was comfortable being with him. I've never found that type of connection before, and I guess I doubt that I'll be able to find that sort of connection back at home in college. Especially college... I've never had a good experience.

Moving away from all of this, the work that I did here this summer was really damn fun - and I was a damn good worker too. It'd been my first real job where I'd actually been trusted to handle large projects with little to no guidance. Compared to the futile bullshit that's known as school - I enjoyed it a lot more. But now I'm faced with going back to struggling for three years doing something that I hate - putting effort into something that you don't care for is difficult - you get burnt out. 

I guess it's safe to say that I'm leaving the country with a tangle of unresolved and tangled feelings. 

I don't really know what I'm doing right now, but I do know that time will run it's course and I know that I will probably feel better next week, next month, next year. But right now, all I feel is sad. TwoX, I'm not happy with what I'm doing - but I don't know how to change it either.

2czn9w,10,2014-08-08,Have you ever lived with both your girlfriend and another friend in the same apartment?,[deleted],AskMen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/2czn9w/have_you_ever_lived_with_both_your_girlfriend_and/,"I've been out of town for an internship and am moving back shortly. I have a place where I'll be renting an extra room for august, then I need to figure out my housing situation after that.

I'm graduating in december, so I'm trying not to sign a lease for a year as I want to be able to move for a job if necessary (almost all places around here require a yearly lease, and I'll graduate 4 months in).

One of my good friends lives with his girlfriend in a 2br apartment and the 2nd room is currently just a catch all for random stuff, they don't go in there often. He offered the room to me, but my concerns are as follows:

1) I don't want to be a burden and impose

2)I don't know if it'll be weird being a 3rd wheel roommate

I hang out there all the time and have crashed on the couch a decent few times, so I THINK it would probably be fine, but I'm just looking for input, possibly from people who've been in a similar situation.

Thanks!"
2czrk5,0,2014-08-08,"I'm 19, have ~$2000 saved from this summer. Is it time for a credit card?",smartho,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2czrk5/im_19_have_2000_saved_from_this_summer_is_it_time/,"Saving up $2K hasn't been an easy feat as a young intern in NYC, but I am SO happy I've finally done it! By the end of this month, I should have another ~$1800 in my pocket.

I know it's not a lot, but I come from a poor family, and I was able to give my mom $500 last week, no questions asked, and I don't expect to be paid back by any means. So. Basically. I'm at a point where I'm not freaking about which parent to ask for how much or whatever or if I can buy a new backpack or charger when I need to.

I've averaged about $600 in spending a month, not including the $1300 of rent I've paid. Mostly food, entertainment, and clothing.

Once school starts again, I'll be spending close to nothing a month. Maybe $30/month on laundry (IF that) and the occasional restaurant or shopping trip, but otherwise, I'm pretty tight-fisted during the school year. My full ride covers almost everything, but I did take out about $1000 in loans last year to survive (plane tickets home, incidentals, etc).

Part of me thinks that I should stay away from credit cards for as long as possible. The other part of me thinks now is the time, while I've got a decent amount piling up and nothing else to do with it.

Any suggestions?"
2czsb4,18,2014-08-08,My mom is very homophobic and the most important person in my life. Advice?,nipple_hornet,askgaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/2czsb4/my_mom_is_very_homophobic_and_the_most_important/,"Hey bros! I'll try to keep this fairly concise, but I want to make sure I describe my situation adequately.

I come from a very religious, conservative background in the Midwest. My family is all like this (with the exception of some relatives on my dad's side who are less religious and/or more liberal). My dad is a bit homophobic, but I don't think he would care too much about me being gay. I really don't have much of a relationship with him, though. My mom, on the other hand, is extremely homophobic. We like to watch a few TV shows together, and some of them (e.g. Doctor Who) will occasionally include gay characters. Even if they only make one comment about being gay, she'll turn to me with this look of disgust on her face that says ""How dare they include something like that?!"" I tend to just ignore her, or shrug, or whatever.

Now, some background on who I am. Being brought up in this religious atmosphere, I was into it wholeheartedly. I went to Lutheran and Baptist schools growing up (never public school before college), and I was heavily involved in a couple of Christian student organizations at my university for my first three years. My religion, faith, whatever you'd like to call it, was honestly the most important part of who I was for a long time. But I still had my ""dark"" side. I knew from a fairly young age (maybe like...10, 11) that I had a thing for men's underwear. For years I convinced myself it was just that and nothing more - I wasn't gay. But eventually my curiosity with underwear led to getting into gay porn and such. I was ashamed, tried to keep myself away from it, but I always came back to it despite the guilt.

So I began the painstakingly long journey to accept the fact that I was gay. It started by opening up to other Christian male friends about it (about four years ago). They encouraged me to resist it, and that's exactly what I wanted to do at the time since it felt wrong, because I had always been taught that it *was* wrong. I kept this up for about three years, giving into my desires every so often (read: fapping to gay porn) and then confessing it to these other guys (we were all open about sexual things and tried to help each other resist them, since we were all of the ""no sex before marriage"" mindset, even for the rest of them who were straight).

During this time, my parents accidentally stumbled upon a journal I had been keeping during my trip to Rome four years ago, which is when I first started coming to terms with my sexuality. I had written about the entire thing in there, and you can imagine the kind of phone call that took place afterward. My dad was quiet as always, but my mom was in tears. I assured them that I was fighting against my desires, which was the truth at the time. That didn't prevent a few awkward subsequent conversations, though. After a while it got to the point where we just didn't talk about it anymore, and things pretty much went back to normal.

Fast forward to the end of my spring 2013 semester. I meet a guy online. He's halfway across the world and likes to talk about naughty things. I was still clinging onto my religion, but I was in one of those times where I was watching more porn and feeling less guilty about it. I even had a one night stand with a guy which sucked and made me a little doubtful as to whether I was actually gay, but that's another story. Anyway, this guy online, let's call him AJ. To make a long story short, AJ helped me to accept myself for who I am, a straight-up-6-on-the-Kinsey-scale gay man. I basically abandoned my religion (unsure whether I could reconcile it with my sexuality - that's still something I need to figure out for myself) and fell head over heels for him. We eventually dated for a short time, but that is also another story.

I know that's a lot of information, but here's the crux of the matter. My mom is so incredibly important to me. She's very supportive - in fact, I'm living with her and the rest of my family this summer while I do an internship in my hometown, and she's probably going to put up a bit of a fight when I try to move out after I graduate college in December. We're very close. When I'm at home, I spend more time with my family (especially her) than with friends. She loves me a lot, I know that beyond the shadow of a doubt. But it will break her heart to know that I've accepted my sexuality. Thankfully she hasn't brought it up in a long time so I haven't had to lie directly to her very much, but she is still under the impression that I'm resisting these desires (or maybe she thinks that they've just gone away since we haven't talked about it in so long). I even leave the house for an hour and a half every Sunday morning and cruise around town under the pretense that I'm going to church on my own, just to keep up this false image of who I used to be.

What should I do, bros? I'm not worried about being kicked out. My mom is much more the type of person who would do everything she can to help me pray the gay away. I'm with my family for the summer, but come fall semester, I'll be back at my university which is two hours away (although I still visit home quite frequently, usually once or twice a month). In December, I'll graduate, and I have no solid plans for what will happen then. I'm already pretty certain that I'll wait until I'm on my own to even think about coming out to my family, but are there steps I could begin taking with them now? Anything that would give them a nudge in a more accepting, understanding direction for when it does happen? Any advice is appreciated.

**TL;DR** - I love my mom a lot, but she's homophobic. I used to be religious and suppressed my sexuality, but not anymore. She thinks I'm still the same. How can I come out to her without destroying our relationship?"

I graduated in May from a middle-of-the-pack law school with a decent G.P.A. and resume. While I picked up some solid experience during law school, I didn't end up with anything that stuck. I've been applying for jobs and studying for the Bar since graduation, and now that the Bar has come and gone, it's all job appin' from here on out. The process has been quite discouraging thus far, and I just felt the need to vent. 

I've kept in touch with my school's career services office, and they've been of minimal assistance. Same goes for my school's job board. Most firms appear to be looking for either students, or licensed attorneys. I used to be the former, and soon I will be the latter, but for now I am just a discouraged graduate with six-figure debt. 

I have very minimal connections. One attorney is passing my resume around for me, but there have been no bites on that. Emailing professionals for informational interviews/resume formatting pointers has proven helpful, but hasn't really produced any leads so far. I've applied to over 100 jobs on major job boards (Indeed, Monster, etc.) but I get the impression that they're too saturated with applicants for that to realistically result in anything.  

At this point, I'm not even limiting myself to the state where I took the Bar. I'm not limiting myself to law -- I've applied to jobs not requiring a J.D., and have not gotten any responses. I'm willing to work hourly at a firm, I'm willing to intern unpaid for a few months if that's what it takes.

2d0e54,3,2014-08-08,When dreams falter.,arloun,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2d0e54/when_dreams_falter/,"I moved out to LA three months ago, I moved right out of college thinking everything would be great.  Everyone I connected with said that they would help me get a position, I’d won awards, I was known throughout the school and had the largest body of work.
	
A year ago I was here, with a great internship, a new girlfriend and hope for graduation, I worked tirelessly on my thesis project in hopes it would help me get a position somewhere.  I struggled to find an apartment and car at first, when I did I believed it to be only a month away from starting my career outside school.
	
But this was all wrong, those that said they would help me pretended to never tell me such things, and that I “shouldn’t lie”, my internship was in the process of firing most of their staff.  My apartment was going to be renovated by the owner, and it was un-livable for three weeks.  I was homeless and jobless only a month out. 
	
I turned to my girlfriend for comfort, but she told me she didn’t love me anymore.  A year, down the drain.  So now I had nothing in my life, and all my friends back home who stayed the summer are having a blast.  Fast forward two months later things aren’t much better, I’m bleeding money and I’ll be out on the street again before I know it.  
	
I’ve saved up enough to make sure I have gas money to drive back home.  And that will be it, I will never return here if I can help it.  

They always tell you to follow your dreams, they just don’t tell you what to do when they fail.

2d0gqt,3,2014-08-08,Will I Be Okay with Associates Degree + Certs? Should I Go For Bachelors?,egriz10,computertechs,https://www.reddit.com/r/computertechs/comments/2d0gqt/will_i_be_okay_with_associates_degree_certs/,"Hey guys. 

So I'm trying to figure out my future in regards to education. 

21 year old. Currently employed in a 6-month IT internship. I am getting experience in a LOT of stuff. Linux servers, sys admin stuff, database management, etc.

I am taking classes right now to finish up my Associates in Information Technology. I should be finished up by next summer. This 6-month internship has the possibility of extending to full time employment. 

My thought was, once I finish my Associates, work on getting a few certs under my belt. My thinking is that more time doing real work along with certs should be more valuable than spending 2+ more years as a student for my bachelors. Can anybody comment on this?

Which certs would be best to focus on? How long do these certs last for? How much pay increase can I expect from getting these certs? For example...if I obtain certifications while I'm employed...what kind of pay increase should I aim to negotiate for?

p.s. On a side note. For anybody with experience in IT Internships or managers who have had Interns under them. Is $13/hr too low of pay?  I've looked up some data and it seems like $13/hr is on the low end, with the average sitting at $17-20/hr. 

Thanks!  "
2d0zzz,6,2014-08-08,Final Investigation inthe The PANDA Affair,Eliminioa,GoodMorningPeriwinkle,https://www.reddit.com/r/GoodMorningPeriwinkle/comments/2d0zzz/final_investigation_inthe_the_panda_affair/,"In the midst of the current upheaval that is rocking Chroma, I would like to take a moment to report on a less serious topic: the mess made by PANDA in the Periwin Grove. Previously our ~~unpaid intern~~ respected reporter [Rockdale](/u/RockdaleRooster) reported that debacle [here](http://redd.it/2cue8h). However, the leader of the PANDA administration was dissatisfied with this report, and I myself, as an investigative journalist, was curious about the situation. On account of my own curiosity and the pleas of [Mr. Funni](/u/Lolzrfunni), I decided to dig deeper into the event, and the claims made by both sides. 

My first order of business was to interview the culprit himself, Mr. Funni. When asked about his reasoning for initiating the mock raid in the first place, he explained that he wanted to, “hone raiding skills, and make sure our newest PANDA members knew how to raid.” The reasoning itself is fairly sound, and there are certainly precedents for mock raids. Nevertheless, this raid lead to catastrophe. As most of my readers know, the mock raid turned tragic when the late Periwinkle Prime opened fire with mini-nukes against the raiders. The reason for this, according to my own analysis of the code as well as PBI statements, is the initiation of Prime's invasion protocols. In other words, it mistook the mock raiders for real invaders, and acted accordingly. This mistake was, it seems, caused by the destruction of active ships of the Skaro Fleet. I asked Mr. Funni about where he got the idea that they were decommissioned, and he replied that, “They were not decommissioned, however, they were hulked (Meaning they could not be restored to seaworthiness) and designated as targets. It was simply easier to say they were decommissioned.” This is both a startling revelation and a surprising about-face for Mr. Funni, who has previously insisted they were already decommissioned. 

Deciding to pursue the exact status of the ships at a later date, I continued with the interview, bringing up a PBI talking point: that high command wasn't notified of Mr. Funni's intention to stage a mock raid. Yet both Mr. Funni and the logs of the conversation at the time indicate that Mr. Funni, “informed everyone in chat at the time, including General [Sahdee](/u/Sahdee), and Rockdale. [Tape](/u/myductape) may have also been listening.” Gen. Sahdee later revealed that she was, at the time whispering with Mr. Tape, and so it is likely he was in the loop as well. Mr. Funni elaborated that, “Sahdee gave permission” for the raid. He then went on the defensive, disputing the PBI's statements that he was ordered to stand down by Gen. Rockdale. He said, “After we'd started, Rockdale said ""You're lucky I don't court martial you all"". However, he refused to elaborate on it, and we all disregarded this as a reply to someone else OR an empty threat.” Upon further questioning, Mr. Funni admitted, “I did not have permission from [Tiercel](/u/Tiercel). However, we assumed that permission from one general with no obvious opposition would be fine.”

Moving on, I asked Mr. Funni what he was thinking when he first realized that Prime was attacking his forces. He explained that at first he, “assumed that he had mistaken our codenames for an orangered attack force and attempted to reason with him. We did not fire on him in any way.” Additionally, Gen. Sahdee mentioned that Mr. Funni contacted Periwinkle High Command as soon as Prime began attacking. Looking for more details, I inquired about the steps he took to try and prevent the catastrophe that occurred. He elaborated that he first attempted to reason with Prime before, “realising that he was resisting all attempts to change his database, ordered all ships to he abandoned and all aircraft to leave.” He added that, “All of the shot down pilots escaped safely.”

Pursuing another point of contention between Mr. Funni and the PBI, I inquired about the state of several ships, specifically the RPS UWotM8 and the RPS Dave. The PBI has previously asserted that both of the ships were sunk by mini nuclear ordinances delivered by Prime, while Mr. Funni insisted they were still sea-worthy. However, Mr. Funni appears to have either backed off of his position or received new information, as he agreed that, “The RPS UWotM8 and RPS Dave were confirmed to have sunk.” However, he also asserted that both were lost, “without loss of life.” The PBI, however asserted that there were thousands of casualties. My own research into the topic has shown both of these claims to be greatly exaggerated. Comparing personnel documents before and after the incident (a task that was suspsiciously difficult) indicates that there were 513 deaths, largely sailors aboard the RPS UWotM8 and the RPS Dave. Obtaining information on the number of injured was even more difficult, but I eventually found that an estimates 1500 were injured in some way, using local hospital records. As a side note, Mr. Funni mentioned that, “Skaro Fleet Status Quo Protocol means that a replacement ship of each class is maintained in storage. The replacement ships will be given the same name and number as the sunken ships, in accordance with the Status Quo Protocol.”

For my last question, I asked Mr. Funni what he thought of his own incarceration by the PBI, and that of his troops. He was remarkable vague in regards to the question itself, but expressed deep regret, admitting that, “Well, most of the people involved in the operation, including me, and excluding [AllStarr](/u/TheAllStarrBand) and [Rem](/u/Remnance627), messed up on some level. Over all, this whole event was a bug fuss and several million chromanium's expenditure on what us effectively going clay pigeon hunting”

After leaving the interview, I decided to pursue Mr. Funni's claims that the ships were not decommissioned but hulked. Inquiry at the Skaro Fleet's Records Division provided me with piles of paperwork on the ships used for target practice. After some digging, I discovered the The ships were still in the process of being decommissioned, and were labeled as hulked ships. Curious as to why Prime would decide that the destruction of hulked ships warranted lethal force, I inspected Prime's final log. The log revealed that, somewhere along the line, someone forgot to mark the ships as hulked in the Skaro Fleet Database. It seems as though the ultimately cause of this destruction wasn't Mr. Funni's carelessness, nor the negligence of Periwinkle High Command, but a tragic failure of bureaucracy. "

2d1joj,1,2014-08-08,Massage therapist considering either accounting or computer science. Yeah seriously....,[deleted],Career,https://www.reddit.com/r/Career/comments/2d1joj/massage_therapist_considering_either_accounting/,"So, a little about me... I'm a female massage therapist, working as a therapist for the past 3 years.  I've taken the Meyers-Briggs test about 4 times and each time it said I was an INTJ.  The massage therapy field is beginning to take it's toll on my body and to be honest I'm not sure if I want to directly do patient care anymore.  I used to want to do nursing/physical therapy, but to be honest I want to be in a field that is better suited to introverts. I think healthcare is fascinating, I've had to deal with illness personally and many of my close relatives have had to deal with illness and all my knowledge that I've gained through the year has been health related.  It's fascinating to me! At work I am the go to person when anyone has any health related questions.  Honest, because I am an INTJ most people come to me about everything, since I enjoy research in general which is why I don't think I necessarily need to limit myself to just health care.  I thought about doing infection control or public health nurse, which are more research/introvert friendly fields which would tie in my healthcare experience.  However, I hear it is getting reallyyyyyyy hard to find nursing jobs, so I can imagine how difficult it would be for other healthcare fields such as respiratory therapy.  I feel like the decent healthcare fields that have a good job market, stability, good pay are all at least masters level and higher, such as nurse practitioner, physical therapist, occupational therapist, and ect..  However, I'm not sure if I want to do direct patient care anymore... however massage therapy is veryyyy physically demanding and I think I wouldn't mind it as much if it were in a field that were less physically demanding.  
However, before you can apply to any masters level program you still need a bachelors degree! This is where my problem lies...  I am 25 and have about 2 years worth of college credits that are spread out from old business associate prereqs. to nursing school prereqs... so I have the sociology and English type classes already done.  Computer science was a degree I was considering, but at 25 years old and without a background in computers at all.  I spend hours and hours on the computer doing research, but I don't really know much about computers other than I love spending time on them! However, they do seem fascinating to me!  However, with job outsourcing and what not and the fact that I haven't been programming since I was 12 years old like almost every programmer I know I feel way too behind.  I was also thinking about accounting, which also seem introvert friendly and I wouldn't be behind catching up to get into the higher level maths and more of my general eds would fit with accounting better.  However, I'm not sure how lucrative it is anymore.  At my age I want to do something passionate about, but I also need to start making a decent living since my parents are getting more and more sick.  Do you think it is getting too difficult to find accounting jobs for new grads?  I was thinking about maybe getting an accounting degree and an mis minor, so I can get a little of both. The only problem is I don't have excel or quickbook experience, I mean shit I haven't even worked behind a desk in years, so I feel like it's going to be really hard for me to get an accounting internship.  I see excel and quickbook as requirements for a lot of the accounting internships...  My cousin is vice president sales manager for an IT company that focuses on educational products and said he could help me get an internship.  Do you think this internship could help me gain some office skills that could get me an accounting internship.  I was also thinking about volunteering at a hospice to get more healthcare experience, since I was thinking about focusing on accounting in the healthcare field.  Do you think there would be a better way to go about getting a healthcare/accounting job? BTW,  I am taking an intro to accounting class and some general ed.  business IT class that focuses on spreadsheets next semester along with some other classes.. Any tips or comments would be really appreciated! "
2d1kt6,0,2014-08-08,I'm pretty sure I'm a neckbeard: Is this necessarily a bad thing?,mrnkl,neckbeardstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/neckbeardstories/comments/2d1kt6/im_pretty_sure_im_a_neckbeard_is_this_necessarily/,"Some traits about myself:

-I don't actually have a neckbeard nor do I wear a fedora. Sometimes I'll go a couple weeks without shaving because I'm lazy and I'll get some bad looking facial hair though. 

-I like video games (mostly Japanese ones), anime, and other just general nerd-culture stuff a lot. I'm pretty weeaboo in general though I'm self aware about it.  Not everything I like is like nerd culture territory though, I like a variety of movies/music. 

-My hygiene isn't very good, mostly just out of laziness. I mean, I take showers, brush my teeth, etc. regularly but I'm still end up smelling kinda poorly. 

-I'm fairly chubby. I haven't really been fat all my life, I was just sort of skinny-fat as a kid and I've slowly gotten fatter and fatter until now (in university) I'm definitely chubby territory. 

-I'm really, really socially awkward. Like, really. I do all of the stereotypical things, like having a really weird sounding voice, having trouble making eye contact, etc. I took speech therapy as a kid and it helped some but I'm still really awkward. 

-My fashion sense is pretty bad. I mostly just wear blank, slightly oversize t-shirts and basketball shorts and nothing else.

-I still live with my parents, hang out with my parents, and probably will in my 30s. I've never worked a day in my life, though I'm probably going to get an internship within the next year or two and end up in a good job. 

-I don't really have a holier-than-thou attitude. I actually think I'm worse than most people at most things. 

-I don't say ""m'lady"" or whatever. 

-I'm not sexist and I agree with most feminist viewpoints in general. 

-I've never been on a date with a girl, though I've never asked a girl out or really shown interest in one, so I'm not one of those guys who latches onto girls. I know that if I did it would probably end up being really cringy and weird so I don't. 

-I'm not atheist, I'm actually pretty Christian/Catholic, though in a pretty progressive way in general. 

But, despite being a neckbeard (or at least having a lot of neckbeard-esque traits), I'm still pretty happy with myself for the most part. Well, any unhappiness I have is entirely unrelated to my neckbeardediness, at least. Judging from this subreddit a lot of people on here are like ""Well, I used to be a neckbeard but I improved and I'm so glad I did!"". Is there anything significantly wrong with any of the traits I have if I'm still happy with myself and my life? I don't really have any motivation to improve honestly and I'm happy with just being a neckbeard. "

Would telling interviewers that I am already an incoming MSW student hurt my chances of getting the position?

So today i got a letter that they liked me and i showed that i can and want to work but i dont seem healthy and am unsure bout myself constantly and not very concentrated..

Im currently doing a bussines school to finally have something in my hands next year. Now it maybe not work out at all or i have to repeat another year.
Its 2 1/2 education 1 year internship and then you are finished.

I tried many things since i was 15 and i failed at all of them. Didnt show up or made up huge idiotic lies. Im very depressed and know my condition for about 6 months.

Im 20 years old and my mother is a Single parent with 4 kids. I got scholarship money from the government  for this and during the time i have to wait for a next internship, my mother gets a lot less money (insurance etc because my education is now interrupted for half a year until i can start a new internship or whatever will happen..

I never wished to be here and i want to leave or kill myself for such a long time, im just to afraid of hurting myself and sometimes get motivation to keep on by thinking about the life after i got my diploma in my pockets.

Its a constant pain to make my family sad, angry and dissapointed.
Im ill in my head and feel like someone else whos languange i dont understand tells me what to do. I cant understand why but i understand what to do. I was mostly just taking to psychatrists about my past and shit, but that doesnt help me. I need medication because my life is slipping away from me for 4 years now. I already lost 3 different educations before this.

It just hurts so much to make so much trouble which my family doesnt deserve.. We never had it easy and still dont have. And i only make it worse.

Got to talk with the direction and everything on monday to figure out which options i have.

Honestly im thinking about just leaving Liechtenstein central europe and look for a easy job in some country far away from my family so i cant provide them with all my constant problems anymore.

Why does life have to be like this? Why am i fucking up my life? 
I know that i am the problem and i want to change and i will have to from monday on. 
But in the same way it feels like a right choice to leave everything behind and die somewhere else than here.

I always get jobs and everyone likes me because im an nice person who tries to do their best and is helpful to others. So its always kinda sad to see how i fail at life because im not healthy in my head.
I never broke a bone or was seriously ill ( im skinny though and need to change that aswell)
i wish i could explain why im failing everyrthing i do. But i guess thats part of the psychological problem.

Fuck me and fuck this life. I now need to change and its time to recognise for real that i need help to make something of this life.

Wishing for the strengt to just end myself thou. The pain my family would have would be more of a relieve of the constant stress im putting them in.

I just wanted to write this down "

2d29h4,21,2014-08-09,Dance Project Picnic,[deleted],LetsNotMeet,https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/2d29h4/dance_project_picnic/,"Yesterday was my last day at a sixth month internship at a secondary school, it's the summer holidays so the school is closed but we were using the dance studio for a dance project, so there's me (the intern), the dance teacher,  who is pretty fresh out of college herself, and my manager who was spending most of her time in her office catching up on paper work. 

Also around in the school there was a nice older lady teacher a couple of ESOL students in the sixth form common room, there was one person working on reception (instead of the usual three or four,  and some contractors/builders and of course the kids; who were there for the dance project - 8 girls aged, between 11 and 14.
So the school was pretty deserted, right? 

On lunch the dance teacher,  my manager,  myself and the 8 girls decided to have a picnic because its a lovely sunny afternoon.  
We're all sitting together, having a lot of fun when I decided to quickly slope off the school premises for a cigarette.
There's two electronic sets of gates to get through, you have to press a buzzer and they buzz you through,  I buzzed myself out and sat on a bench, put my headphones in and lit up. 

I noticed the vibe of this guy before I even looked up. 
The bench I was on is by a bus stop so there was a few comings and goings but I was just sitting reading things on my smart phone when I got a horrible, cold, creepy feeling. 
I looked up and he's walking past me but he keeps swinging his head back to look at me, as if he's deciding something in his mind but he's unsure whether to come over and do it. 
His face scared me so much,  his expression was just filled with hate.
I decided to go back into the school at this point but as soon as I stood up for the bench, he froze and turned back to me. I started walking back towards the school, he started walking back towards me. 
I absolutely freaked out at this point, my knees felt like jelly and my arms were shaking uncontrollably and I ran across to the other side of the road, away from the school. 
He crossed the road as well and  slowly edged towards me.
I crossed back, and so did he,  but there was a bus parked at the bus stop now and he sort of crouched behind it so for a second I thought oh good he was just getting the bus! 
The bus pulled away and he was standing a way off from the bus stop and there's a blonde woman there at the bus stop and I tried to tell her what's happened. 
Problem is no matter, he was in between me and the school. 
I just wanted to get back behind those electronic gates at this point.  
She was telling me to breathe, be brave, he was probably harmless. 
Then her bus came and no sooner was she on the bus, did he start walking towards me again.  
I decided to act, I ran up to the school gate, my hands, shaking so much, and I held the buzzer down for ages and Thank God the buzzer clicked me through,  and the door locked behind me. 
I ran fast as I could to the second set of gates,  and got buzzed through, as the door locked behind me, I breathed.  
I realised I was shaking from head to toe,  and I should tell my manager about the strange experience because I needed maybe a strong, sugary tea or something,  I was in shock a bit. 
But as I walked over to the field, I could only see the dance teacher with the girls,  so I turned back around to see if my manager is in my office,  I turned back around to see the man from outside the school BEING BUZZED THROUGH THE SECOND SET OF GATES! 

At this point, all I could think is, 
""I am going to die, but even worse, I have brought this trauma into a safe place for these poor teenage girls"". 

I ran over to the dance teacher,  told her I needed to talk to her, and gave her the lowdown in a few seconds.  She very calmly asked the girls to pack up their lunchs and come inside now,  they protested and said, 
""But break isnt over yet!  What's wrong with Miss, she's all shaky!"" etc. etc. 

As they're protesting, he turns the corner into their eye line and instead the questions were, 
""Whose that man? Why is he staring at is? Why is he walking towards us?"" 

At this point I am TERRIFIED,  I literally was just yelling and everyone to run inside,  so I missed what he said.  
But the girls and the dance teacher said he pointed at me and said,
""There she is. That girl."" 
And started walking towards me again, same hateful, angry look on his face.  
The dance teacher pulled us all into the sixth form common room,  and asked the poor older ESOL teacher to get help, and the time me and the dance teacher spent,  in the small classroom with 8 teenage girls, pretending to be calm but being aware there was only one door,  no windows or anything, and we had no plan,  was some of the most hardcore minutes of my life. 
The ESOL teacher returned with help, in the form of a receptionist who came and asked me for a description (She must have been the one who buzzed him through, ffs). 
So we took the girls back to the dance studio,  and nobody was allowed on their own all day.  
The builders/contractors searched the school, they were amazing and fearless and just ready to protect all the women and girls in the school, but nobody found him.  
The dance teacher gave me a lift home, as she didn't want me waiting at that bus stop, but he wasn't still hanging around outside,  but we noticed how scary and rundown the flats opposite the school are, and we wondered if he lives there."
2d2hv2,57,2014-08-09,Advantages and Disadvantages of an LTR as opposed to spinning plates,aresta,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/2d2hv2/advantages_and_disadvantages_of_an_ltr_as_opposed/,"Advantages of an LTR as opposed to spinning plates. 

To preface this, I have done both, I am speaking from my experience and that of my friends. 

**Advantages of an LTR**

•	Constant sex with little to no effort. Spinning plates you have to put yourself out there. As a naturally introverted guy, finding an introverted homebody like myself is ideal. 

•	Sex is better your wife/gf knows what you like. Also you get better with sex, a fuck buddy is a lot less likely to give you tips on what to do better. Don’t expect mind blowing sex from a fwb, mentally it will be good because it’s a new girl and you have the rush going for you but physically not so much. 


•	Sex with no condom if your girl is on BC. Simply no comparison, if you only fucked a girl with a condom than you are still partially a virgin in my book. Fucking a plate raw, is a bad idea because you might as well expect her to be sleeping around. 


•	You have a plus one, huge boost to your social standing having a cute girlfriend. Spinning plates gives you similar benefits but you can’t bring a plate everywhere you go. 

•	Girl you get in a relationship with is going to be more attractive than your fuck buddies/hook ups. If you are a 7, you can fwb a 5,6. And get in a relationship with a 7 or an 8. 


•	Girlfriend does cute things for you, cooks for you, cheers you on. There was a time when I had bad back acne from swimming in the wrong lake. My gf regularly popped these nasty ass pimples for me. No  guy friend or plate will do that shit for you. 

•	Emotional fulfillment, knowing someone loves you makes you feel good. I am sure there will be some stoic alpha males calling me a pussy for this but IDGAF. Plate may desire you sexually but really won’t give a fuck about you besides that. 


•	You might find a girl that is your ideal match. As in loves the same shit you do, gets your humor, etc. This is rare, but if you find a girl like this it is amazing. 

•	You have somebody by your side. Older you get the harder it gets to spin plates, not everyone will become the silver fox, fucking cute interns. Plus even if you are attractive girls will expect a lot more gifts/sugar daddy arrangement than just you laying down your 50 year old pipe. Most college girls will be fucking college guys simple as that.

**Disadvantages of an LTR**


•	Eventually fucking the same girl will get old. Sex might improve but you won’t be as excited to fuck your girl. Spinning plates you get the rush of fucking a new girl

•	Girlfriends require you to talk to them. You can expect a phone call/skype call at least twice a week. A lot of times you will want to talk to them, however, after a while it becomes annoying. Plates you can just fuck and set up times to meet up. 


•	Girlfriends also require your emotional support which at times can get boring. Example, my girl’s uncle died and I didn’t know what to do she was crying all the time and I didn’t even know the dude. 

•	Girlfriends can require you to take them out time to time, however I still find this much cheaper than spinning plates since you aren’t going out nearly as often. 


•	Girlfriend can cheat on you, destroy you emotionally. This goes without saying even worse if you get married. PROCEED WITH CAUTION. This right here is probably the biggest reason why most of you don’t go the LTR option. The more vulnerable you make yourself to a person the more you can get fucked over. Plates can be replaced.

Now mind you this has been my personal experience. For me every girl I have been with has wanted sex equally or more than I did, for some dudes this might not be true. Also some guys may talk or spend more on their girlfriends. 

I will say this though, one of the hardest parts about an LTR is finding the right girl. You won’t find her on an online dating site, or at a club. The girls that make the best LTR material are most of the time in LTRs. Finding plates is easy, if you are a decently muscular dude, and you have pics of you in social places where you don’t look awkward as fuck, Tinder is easy pickings. Expect to DATE DOWN though. For my tinder game so long as they are White and not fat I swipe right.

My father promissed me a expert on trans people,turns out my therapist never had a transgender patient. I stopped seeing her after some months and found a new therapist,a gender therapist,but my father refused,and to this day keep saying he will find me a therapist.

My mother is still in denial,she said some hurtfull things and prefers to pretend nothing wrongs,only she will ask me if I'm sad,but I'll always say I'm fine. I'm close to my brother but we never talk about it. I know they all love and care for me,but I'm tired of being made feel guilty for being depressed,un-interested and not social. I wish I weren't like that too.

Social anxiety makes my life hell,specially at college. Everyday all I want is to go back to my room and do nothing. Only I have tons of things to do for college and thinking of it makes me very anxious,specially internship. The responsabilities of college and being forced into social sittuations make me feel exhausted.

I feel the only time I'm actually happy is when I'm sleeping,the moment I wake up and remember all the things I have to do and everything I hate about my life,I feel overwhelmed and hopeless. I never had actual thoughts about suicide until recently,I'm starting to think all the pain and discomfort I feel everyday,all the time is not worth.

I know I'm 18,turning 19,I could find a job,pay my own therapist and transition,but I still feel like a little kid in so many ways,specially about needing a adult to help me with things like that. I feel I'm too damaged to be able to do all those things on my own.

I feel I will never have a life I want,I'll end up having to depend on people for everything(I have relatives that deal with depression and other issues that are like that,and maybe that how I'll end up). I feel depression made permanent damage,like even if I had the perfect life I could never be happy. I also think someday I'll end up killing myself,and that trying suicide is the only way my family can take this seriously.

It wasn't even sunrise. Looking to his left, he saw Ruby and realised he was covered by her bright red mane. ""I'm getting too attached,"" he sighed again, watching Ruby sleeping peacefully beside him, and gave her a shy peck on the cheek. Holding her close, he shut his eyes again and slept. 

---

""Ruby? Oh, where *did* that mare end up? I don't think she'd ever run off with some stallion...oh, I *do* hope she didn't."" Rarity leapt out of bed, panicking, and sent Opal flying into the wall with a squeal. With a gasp, she realised that she'd forgotten to sort out a bed for her cousin. *Where could that mare have gone? She wouldn't have just abandoned the Boutique at midnight? What if something's been stolen? Oh, Rarity...what* were *you thinking when you hired that girl?* Increasingly frustrated, Rarity paced around the shop, dashed around the town, peered into hotel windows...

Some time later, she stopped at a B&amp;B that towered over her, smelling of sweet and tasty cereals she couldn't recall the names of. Before her hoof could touch the doorbell, an orange-yellow pegasus stallion burst for the door, waving avidly. ""Welcome, welcome! I'm guessing you're here to enjoy the first – and best – meal of the day here at Golden Graham's, yes?""

Rarity blushed awkwardly, raising a hoof to her cheek, then got serious. ""No...sorry, darling. I'm actually looking for someone. My cousin, Ruby. She looks a bit like me.""

Golden Graham raised an eyebrow, flicking through his memory of the various curious faces he'd come to welcome to his B&amp;B for the past...well, forever. Graham wouldn't forget a face, even if that face didn't quite match the strangely attractive grin of Creme de Menthe... ""Nope, got nothing. Terribly sorry I couldn't help. Care for breakfast?""

A little guilt welled up inside Rarity before an exasperated ""No, sorry,"" escaped. She turned to continue the search as Graham cried out, ""Not even on the house?...""

---

Game Changer watched the window, eyeing a mare who looked similar to Ruby. ""Hey, Ruby. Over here! There's a mare running around like a maniac who looks just like you!""

""Huh?""

""Yeah! She looks out of her mind. She's knocking on doors – wait  she's coming for us now...""

Rarity flew through the door, landing in a heap on top of a badly-positioned NEIGHS console. ""Ruby,"" she spoke, in that strange throaty voice she'd take when she was crying. Ruby recognised it a lot, since as a filly, she was sometimes the cause of it. As time went on, she became its cure. ""Where have you bee-he-heen?!"" She clung to her cousin, sobbing, ranting on and on about the consequences of her absences. 

""Rarity..."" Ruby spoke calmly, having to repeat herself a few times before eventually snapping. ""I took care of the place until midnight, just as you asked, but you didn't make me a bed, remember? I needed somewhere to stay, and Game Changer over here,"" who reached out a hoof to Rarity, ""turned up to help.""

""Did you even know this stallion?"" Rarity started to regain composure, looking a little more stern. Maybe threateningly so. She snuffed Game's handshake.

""Um...no, but he needed somewhere to stay in the storm and we're the only place that opens round here at that time, so why not?""

By this time, Rarity was enraged, not seeing any reason why or how Ruby could defend her actions. ""You didn't even *ask*!""

""How could I? You weren't awake. Why would I do that?"" She smirked a little at the mention of this, giving Game a sly wink. 

""Well...if you've got the insolence to hire a random stallion for the night when you're not the manager, I should think you've got a good reason to."" Rarity's teeth were firmly gritted, and the illusion of grace she carried so well was truly broken. It was replaced by a callous, prissy fury. 

""To be fair, he did pretty well. I don't think we lost a customer last night.""

""That doesn't matter – rrgh!"" Rarity stormed out, giving up. ""Go and be with your silly new stallion if you want! I don't care,"" she cried down the street. 

Game sat in the corner, still frozen in place by Rarity's anger, knowing he never came for this. Scratching at the barren floor with a heavy hoof, he wondered if he was a little out of place here. 

""She'll come round, Game. She always gets there...eventually. Even if she doesn't, I'll stick with you. At least you don't get jealous when you don't get what's not yours..."" With a romantic hoof on his chest, she kissed him, and said ""Well... I don't suppose you'll need to, now,"" looking into his eyes with an unnervingly beautiful stare. 

---

Some time later, the duo left the house for a tour of Ponyville. Ruby had armed herself with some stylish saddlebags, and Game had a few bits to hoof. ""Rarity's never given me a tour. I've always wanted to see what this little town's like compared with Manehattan. I guess she probably doesn't think it's all that interesting...she'll flit around Manehattan like it's nobody's business, but something tells me she doesn't like it that much here.""

""Yeah, me too. She certainly *looks* out of place...in the sense that she should be in Canterlot instead.""

""Sorry, by the way,"" Ruby said, stopping for a moment. ""I feel like I'm boring you with a life story here...""

""It's okay! I want to know more,"" Game smiled. ""Have you given her a tour or something?"" He was interested in Ruby and Rarity's relationship – and, even better, it looked like it could do with some fixing. 

""Yeah! She knows all the best places now,"" she laughed, ""and I don't mean to sound spoilt, but I've got no idea what this place has to offer.""

""I owe you one. Nah, probably about...um...six! Six?...How much is an internship and the best night ever worth?""

""I'm flattered,"" Ruby grinned. ""Consider us square. After you!""

Although Game would normally shove his tour clients around like Braeburn on apples, he wanted to keep it cool and go at a...well, understandable...pace. The pair passed the nearby Carousel Boutique – ""Don't think I need to explain that one. I remember when our lot dropped in while Celestia was in town. Rarity went crazy about nobody laying a hoof on that dress of hers. I was kinda frightened, now that I mention it"", Game laughed. 

A little further on, the pair hit the high street. Sofas and Quills (which had both in stock, for once) towered over them, with Joe's Donuts casting a shadow opposite. Various other stalls and a market delighted Ruby's inner desire for somewhere a little more humble. ""Fancy a bagel?"" Game asked somewhat randomly. The Manehattan mare laughed in reply, and her accomplice dashed up to a very large stall adorned with sweet-smelling baked goods. ""Um...something about you says you'd prefer a croissant.""

""How did you know?!""

""Lucky guess, honest. You just seem like the type.""

""Whoa, that's something,"" Ruby muttered with a guilty smile. ""I think you forgot that I'd –""

""...like some jam with that?"" Game smirked, only to be defeated.

""Not this time, casanova,"" Ruby said, deviously eyeing the butter instead. Still somewhat impressed with his efforts, Game dropped some bits into the baker's hoof and zipped back to Ruby's side. ""Thanks, dear.""

*Something tells me #006666 is the wrong colour for me now. Needs more red.*

""No problem,"" Game smiled in response. ""Hmm...where to now? I'm thinking Sugarcube Corner.""

""That sounds interesting. I think I remember someone mentioning that back in Manehattan. Some party stallion or something. What was his name again?...""

""I don't remember too well either, but Pinkie Pie seemed to have a nice time with him. She runs the place, if I'm not mistaken. Let's go!""

---

The pair strolled through the doors, and Game took a seat by the window. ""Hey, Pinkie! Business as usual, yeah?""

""Remind me. Milkshake, right? You're funny,"" Pinkie giggled, knowing the only other townsponies who'd regularly take milkshakes were the Cutie Mark Crusaders. Even Mint Copy wouldn't have one, and he'd often be seen with them, having taken them under his wing after a prank left his tail blonde. Strange for a grown stallion to make that his trademark drink. Ruby joined her in laughter, requesting a Celestia sponge cake slice instead. Game hopped off his seat to hand Pinkie the bits again.

""Want a sip?"" Game asked, nudging the milkshake towards Ruby. ""I'm still thinking about Rarity...I'm so sorry for what happened. It's just one of those situations where it feels too bad to turn somepony away, it's my fault, it really i –""

""Shush,"" Ruby smirked. ""It was worth it, and that's all that matters. Like I said, she'll see sense, trust me."" 

""What if she bursts through the door looking for you?""

""Nope! Trust me,"" Ruby insisted. ""That reminds me. I'll probably end up back there tonight, if you don't mind...is that okay?"" Her head lowered somewhat remorsefully, wishing she never had to leave Game behind, but Game nodded nonetheless with a soothing smile. ""I've had a really nice time, so thanks..."" Ruby took Game's hoof. She wanted to convince him that she was a little harder to get, as mares tend to, but she dropped the act now. Out of sympathy for Game and his kind nature? Maybe. Because she stood for something else? Surely. Since she was sick of playing the game Rarity loved to play as a filly, twisting all the colts around her hoof? Of course. Because she loved Game? She wasn't certain, but her heart was left a crying mess under her flirty façade, so what could she say?

""It's not over yet! The views from the top of the Town Hall are nice. Why don't we make that our next stop?"" Game grinned avidly, sipping the last of his milkshake. ""It'd be nice to make the most of the afternoon up there. How does that sound?""

""Sure, sounds pretty good!"" Ruby sounded a little less enthusiastic than before; her mind lingered on her connection to Rarity, or what was left of it, at least. She decided to clear her head the only way she knew how. 

The pair rose from the table, giving Pinkie a small wave and strolling out of the door. Suddenly, Ruby grabbed Game and pulled him aside, taking him to a small alley beside the café. ""It's time you lived up to your name, Game Changer,"" the mare smirked with fiery eyes matching the heat of her mane's colours – and her body. With a forceful pull, she held him close and kissed him hard in the darkness. She stayed there for what felt like forever to both of them. Game stood silent, stopped by the feeling of her soft lips on his. 

It was then that Game realised that he was loved by this mare – since leaving Sassaflash, he'd always been sceptical of mares, thinking of them all as human sirens. He thought they were always just out there to tame you, just another victim to add to their records – that is, unless they weren't intending to get you and were just another friend, which was somewhat rare in Game's case. He'd never really talk to them anyway, for fear of embarrassing himself or falling under their spells. 

But Ruby was magical, not in an enchanting sense, but in that she deserved her cousin's name – she truly was a rarity, a mare that felt that life should be simpler. She was similar to Applejack, albeit lacking in a humble background. Being in the city helped her realise the value of industry, and helped her find her own talent: making jewellery from scratch. Mining the gems, forming alloys and carving out the most beautiful jewels herself. 

These were all things Game Changer came to learn in some honest conversation on the balcony of the Town Hall. He took interest in Ruby's story, thinking about where he'd fit in somewhere, and told her a little about himself too. 

""I guess I should really mention that it's kinda tedious mining. Lucky Rarity's got her own little dragon to do it for her, and I remember her saying he helped her out when some Diamond Dogs got hold of her and kept her in a dungeon...""

""The best ponies have the toughest lives,"" Game smiled. ""It'll pay off!""

""Hang on...if I remember rightly, that's one of the richest areas to mine jewels round here! I don't mean to waste your time, but...any chance we could go down there tomorrow?"" Ruby bit her lip, considering this a pretty tough ask.

""That reminds me! I forgot to tell you something...I don't know my own strength.""

""Hm?""

""I've got awkwardly strong forehooves. If I so much as step too hard, I'll crack the ground...""

""That should come in handy tomorrow...that is, if you can join me.""

""You didn't even have to ask!"""

I was home for college for Christmas and purged myself of some of the worst eating streaks of my life, almost 2 years of serious gain and indulgence. I felt good to be in my childhood home, cooked food, and even with a few holiday sweets, I felt balanced. It was refreshing. I topped out at about **355 pounds, 5'11"" 22 years old.**  On my smartphone I found an app called LoseIt and started playing with it. I found it entertaining to count my calories and try to limit my intake. 

As I went back to school, I was busy, but had more time than I had some other semesters, I was able to come home for just about every meal, and occasionally I ate out, but always kept it reasonable, and due to budget constraints, eating out and places like Chilis or Five Guys where I could really have problems controlling myself, were kind of written off. Even the college stereotype drinking, which was never my big thing, was pretty easy to manage. 

I headed into an internship that following summer weighing a significantly different **310 lbs. At age 23** (I don't think I got any taller) At that internship, I was busy and food preparation and storage were limited (we were living in a dorm nearby with only a fridge and microwave, and there was a cafeteria at work with options ranging from healthy, to not so healthy, but I did alright)  I also met lots of people my age and had started running, They were very active, and also there were lots of cute girls to keep me motivated toward looking better.  By the end of the summer, I hit my lowest weight since high school, 280lbs. 

As I went back for my last semester of school (yeah fall finisher, I'm lame) however, I was forced to room with strangers, and their wild partying, and drug use made me unwilling to rock the boat, (it didn't really intensify until we were less than 2 months from my graduation), but throughout the semester, I felt uncomfortable in my own house, and my own kitchen. I tried to keep the running up, but I was extremely busy with a stressful, busy final semester. I fell off my game, I didn't fall too far, but I graduated that winter at about 285-290.

I ended up working at the place where I interned, and moved into an apartment by myself in January 2013, I quickly realized this was not the same thing as my internship, I work 48-52 hours a week instead of the 40-45 I did as intern, and instead of being surrounded by fit active people my age, I'm in the midst of 30,40, and 50 somethings obese IT people, who eat out almost every lunch (and spurn those who don't join them) and celebrate every week or two someones birthday, anniversary, baby, (insert life achievement here) with donuts, cake, cookies, baked goods. These are things I have the hardest time resisting. In my little bubble of control, I have the ability to just not buy them. On a cheat day, I would buy a small box of candy or a cookie, but this is just thrown at me.

As time went on, a few respites have been able to get me back under 300 pounds but otherwise the trend is a steady climb. Recently I really went off the rails, I'm too heavy to feel like working out, and I have been spending more time at work than ever before. I have completely gotten out of the habit of cooking for myself because of the time. Weekends aren't really the respite they would be to organize myself and prepare food for the week or shop because I'm in a LDR with my girlfriend I met right before graduating, and she's still at school 3.5 hours away Throughout the school year and even most summer months, I'm spending 2-3 weekends a month on the road to go see her, or she comes to visit here and we tend to treat our visits as ""maximizing time"" so we eat like we're on vacation.

I am a 25 year old man, I weighed myself for the first time in about 3 weeks and found that in that time my weight had shot up to about 325 pounds. I about cried. I feel worthless.  

I want to fix this, but I don't know where to start, to get my footing under myself, to get myself organized and into habits that will foster good eating as well as good living. To navigate this exhausting schedule and make this time for myself that isn't zoning out, feeling like crap after overeating, saying ""tomorrow will be a better day, I'll control myself tomorrow"" Please help.

EDIT: Ah crap, Lightning, not Lightening. "

Climbing the corporate ladder: I have just started a new job at a big law firm. I am only just above the interns and i'm getting paid a pittance. With tens of thousands of dollars in student loans i will do anything to work my way up. I am slaving away on a case one night, i'm pretty much the last one in the office when you, my boss walks past and comments on m hard work. i say 'i'll do anything to get ahead. Anything? you question. You tell me to come to your office. When i walk in the door you pull me to the floor with my tie and put you foot on my face. ""welcome to the quickest way up this company office bitch""

Who's a good boy?: You have been moaning at me for weeks, begging to get a pet, a kitten a puppy anything. Every time i turn you down saying i don't want one and we can't afford one. Eventually you have had enough, you are going to get your pet even if you have to turn me into one.

Locked up: My car broke down, i had to walk home in the pouring rain only to get home and realize i have lost my key. Luckily i left a spare key with my neighbor. I knock at your door soaking wet. Unfortunately you have lost the key so you call a locksmith. In the meantime you tell me to go have a shower. After my shower i leave the bathroom in my towel, i am looking for the laundry to put my wet clothes but can't find it. I call out but there is no answer, after the third door i try i walk into a room that i was not meant to be in. The walls are soundproofed and covered will all manner of BDSM toys and whips and there are some devices in the center of the room. I am about to turn and leave but i hear the door click behind me. I turn to see you. ""oh i'm so sorry you had to see this, i'm afraid i can't let you leave now""

There are just a few ideas, and i'm happy to try any you might have. I'm a sub as you can see, my kinks include humiliation, bondage, edging, orgasm denial, pegging, pet play and just about anything else. We can include as many or as few of those you want. My only limits are gore, scat and vomit. As you can see i put a bit of effort into my roleplays so i hope i can find someone who will to."
2d51ia,3,2014-08-10,27(M) Road to freedom...Where is it?,anxietyfornoreason,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/2d51ia/27m_road_to_freedomwhere_is_it/,"I am started this as a journal to myself, I have a very complicated way of thinking and I need to write this down in order to straigthen the thoughts. Perhaps seeing them in this form will bring clarity or cause some sort of revelation. Perhaps not, but I am willing to try it nonetheless. First, let's paint a picture of my life in order to establish that my anxieties and fears aren't due to a horrible upbringing or terrible struggle for survival on a day to day basis. I am not lacking people that love or care about me, nor am I lacking financial or career security. I am the son of a 27year US ARMY special forces retiree. My mother and father had me when they were 19, my father joined the military - the army as a way to support his new family. He was gone most of my childhood, fighting for our countrie's freedom and supporting his family. He didn't know how to relate with a child when he came home from his 3-6-9month deployments after killing people, and watching his friends die beside him. I don't blame him for this, I am proud that my father sacrificed in order to support his family. My mother worked at a mortgage firm until I was 7ish, so my first years going to preschool/kindergarden-3rd grade I had many babysitters/afterschool programs to keep me busy while my parents were away. At the end of 4th grade we moved, and my parents decision was to homeschool me from there on out due to the schools being terrible in our new district. My brother was born when I was 9. I got a job when I was 14, setting up tables/chairs for events - cleaning bathrooms waxing floors. I kept this job until I was 18, I was making 8-9$ an hour, I was a hard worker and had good work ethic. That place was super clean and the events were always setup perfectly. At 18 I got a job as a network consultant, they initially hired me as an intern but after proving that I could manage their clients on my own they made me full time and I eventually managed about 80% (they had about 150 clients) of the clients they had. I installed/setup servers/printers/workstations/cisco routers/switches for small/medium businesses. Mostly medical, dental offices locally. I worked day to day with the company owners and discussed their problems and developed solutions to fix them, whether it be hardware, software. I worked at this job until I was 21, It was decent pay I was making around 35,000 a year - towards the end of my job I realized that I was worth alot more money than he was paying me and after working weekend after weekend and recieving no additional time off or overtime compensation. It was that June that the owner announced that he would be switching the way he paid George and I (we were the main techs, or engineers whatever you want to call us) He announced he would be paying us based on the hours that we bill out, and this should work in our favor - he said as long as we have 120billable hours?(honestly I don't remember the amount) a pay period we should make the same amount of money that we are making now, but if we billed out more that we would make more. We didn't sign anything, there was no paperwork just his announcement. Well the month of June - George and I both had 20-30 hours higher than the amount he announced and we still got paid allllot less that pay period than normally. This wasn't a huge problem for me because I was still living with my parents, and didn't have obligations other than my car - insurance etc. George had a new baby and wife, along with a home he had just purchased. His check wasn't enough to pay his bills which then launched him into debt and ultimately George lost his home months later. That week after that paycheck I quit my job, I marched into his office and told him all the hundreds of ours of my weekends that we had given him for free with no compensation or days off, the recent paycheck - I told him I was worth more and that I was done. He had some kinds of excuses, I don't remember, this was a very emotional time for me as I was quitting my first real job that I was very good at and launched into insecurity of finding a new one. We agreed that I would stay on for a couple of weeks and train a replacement and hand all the clients I managed over to them. I showed him the ropes, and nothing extra. At the end of my 2 weeks, the owner took me to lunch and offered to make me a partner and some other shit, I said no and wished him luck. That day driving home, I got a call from a friend of mine that had moved away the previous year. He asked me if I had my resume updated that he had a job for me. With disbelief I asked him if he was shitting me, and if he had heard that I recently quit my job. He was surprised that I had quit, he did not know, and again insisted that I give him my resume. 2 weeks later I had a new job, and was making around 120,000$ a year at 21. I've been very resoncible with the money I've earned and immediatley paid off my car, and I bought a house the first year working with this new company. I couldn't stand the idea of renting and wasting 10s of thousands of dollars a year when I could be building equity. I have 200,000$ in my 401k, 30,000$ in the stock market and around 100,000$ in an emergency fund my home is almost paid off, I have 2 vehicles paid off. No debt other than the remaining mortgage.I am 27 now, still making between 120,000-220,000 a year depending on how many hours I work. I am very good at my job and stand out among the rest of my peers. I have noticed, being here 6-7 years now that the people I hired on with have become lazy and complacent, non motivated but I am still very thankful for this opportunity and I love to work and the work that I do. I met the love of my life last year, and we were marred a few months ago. She is my dream woman, everything I wanted in a wife and more. Her love continues to amaze me on a daily basis. I spent most of my life as a skinny/fit kid - over the last couple of years I've been going to the gym off and on, currently I am 6'1 235 and about 15% body fat. I look the best I ever have. My point is I am a well off, beautiful and very very loved man. For some reason I am plagued by anxiety. It always starts with one small thought, and develops into a large fear which eventually makes me phyiscally sick to the point where I can't think of anything else and it controls me. I can't go to the gym on those days, my coworkers say oh he's grumpy again. My wife knows me well enough that she recognizes it and says you're letting the lies in again honey, you are cloudy. Come back to me. The truth is I can't always make it go away. I am typically very good at logic, noticing patterns and troubleshooting/fixing problems based on differences in patterns. The pattern with me seems to be, I'll be super happy, high on life completely engulfed in positive emotion, during this time I go to the gym more, I feel super motivated and just so full and happy. I write my wife long emails about my love for her... I always go the extra mile in my job but during these times I go a step further. And then it happens, something is said wrong, a thought wonders into my head and takes me over. The only example I can provide and I feel shameful even stating it is this - I am currently on a business trip away from my wife, I've been gone about a month. Typically my wife and I talk about an hour or two a day, good mornings and good nights mostly. This week she is visiting her best friend and investing some time into her since she hasn't seen her in almost a year. She is staying with her friend and spending the week there. My wife made it aware to me that obviously she won't be able to spend as much time with me as we usually do, she doesn't know her friend's schedule and can't form her own schedule around our usual talk times like she typically does. I understand this. I know we won't talk as much. She knows I have an anxiety problem and goes out of her way to ...baby me. The first few days it's fine, no problem. There is no anxiety, we aren't talking as much as we usually do, but I am keeping myself busy and she is investing in her friend. The third day, we had a communcation problem she said she was helping her friend with a project for going back to school, I took this as she didn't have time to talk that night (we skype or facetime) so I went to sleep, she messaged me about an hour later saying she loves me and misses me, about 30 minutes after that she stated ok honey I am about to go to bed. When I woke up and she was asleep I started feeling like she didn't make time for me, the next morning she asked me what I was doing last time and that she was trying to talk to me and wanted to skype before bed, I obviously misunderstood her and I took her messages as hey I am busy tonight but I love you I'll talk to you tomorrow. This started a reaction in my head saying I am not as important to her as she is to me. The next day, again was a busy day for her, they were waking up early going into the city visiting places to eat and going to musuems whatever, my wife skyped me good morning as texted me throughout the day with updates and i love yous. we briefly talked and said good night, she was exhausted from being in the sun and not getting alot of sleep the day before. The next morning she woke up and wrote me a long deep loving message about how much she loves me and cares about me. I responded with how much she means to me and how much I love her. it takes her awhile to respond...I understand she was busy yesterday but this morning she just woke up and has time to talk...but she is taking in between 2-5 minutes to respond to me, I am giving her all my attention and I don't feel like she is giving me all of hers. I take this very personally - This builds onto the thought that popped into my head the day prior saying that I am not important to her. I ask her why she is taking so long to respond, she states honey I am just reading the facebook while I am laying in bed messaging you. This further elevates my anxiety and I realize she definately doesn't need me as much as i need her, I am giving her my full attention and I am expecting to recieve it back but I am getting delays in her responces. We talked very little the day prior so I figured today since she has more time to talk than she did the day before she would use some of that time to invest in me, her husband who she hasn't seen in over a month. I am getting upset now, the anxiety has grown into fear  and we get into a spat about how I am completely focused on her and I am not recieving the same back from her asking her why she doesn't miss me. This has caused strain on my relationship... but this instance has enabled me to identify a pattern. It's a terrible example but this happens weekly or biweekly basis there's always some lie and the lie seems to take me over until it escalates to a fight and my wife puts all my fears to rest and brings me back to the truth. I don't want to keep pushing on her she can't always be strong for me, and I realize that I will need to be strong for her when she needs me or we are going to have serious problems in our marriage. 


**Obviously on a day to day basis, talking to my wife for an hour or two a day being away these anxieties are suppressed. They remain there, but the affirmation of her attention and love that i receive over those hours she invests into me diminish these ideas and thoughts. When I am at home, they don't exist - we have a healthy sex life, and we are very physically touchy feely - so the positive emotions from those actions affirm me enough to where these things never enter my head.Like I said, when I am away I am not able to get this affirmation completely and we supplement it by talking ya know 1-2 hours typically good mornings and good nights. I can't sleep unless we talk first. This week, obviously - this wasn't able to happen so it's been very difficult for me but has also opened my eyes to a very large problem and pattern of behavior in myself.**


*tl;dr - I have a pretty good life, but I've always had anxiety. My wife realizes this and caters to me/babys me - sometimes she has a rough day and isn't strong enough to carry me. How do I stand on my own, and ultimately carry her when she needs me?*"
2d5enr,1,2014-08-10,Need someone to talk to.. I have no one real to talk to.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2d5enr/need_someone_to_talk_to_i_have_no_one_real_to/,"Throwaway for the sake of friends on Reddit.

I honestly thought I would be never here, I usually try to help others with their problems either here, or /r/relationships. But there's just too much on me right now, and I have no one to turn to.

Some context for myself, I am almost 22, and just finished college with a bachelor's degree. I am in love with my internship, but my final day is in a couple weeks. I'm nervous about applying to my first real job, but I'll get to myself last.

The real reason I'm here is because I think my four year relationship is a mess, I honestly think it's over. Secondarily, my dad's side of the family I haven't talked to in years, and I want to change that.

For priorities sake, I will start with my family:

So when I was 4, my mother found out my father was cheating on her. He left and had two kids with her moving out of state when I was 11 or 12. I remember the day like it was yesterday. My mother remarried to my now stepfather about 10 years ago, and their two girls (sisters to me) are THE ROCK OF MY EXISTENCE. The reason I believe I haven't offed myself years ago is because of them (I'm not considering suicide now, it's not worth it.) Me and my stepfather never really got along until a couple years ago.

ABOUT MY FATHER: I always thought he was a monster, and I hated him. He would promise things after things, and never deliver on them at all. He was an unloving father at best, and only sought to manipulate people, and only care about himself. 

Now my dad's side of the family is all over the place, the two kids that were a result of my father's relationship with the woman he cheated with are teens. Recently, it was claimed by the family that ""he was attempted to be kidnapped"" and ran into a store. Police were called and everything. Ever since, I have been trying my best to get back involved with my dad's side (letters, Facebook, etc.) but it doesn't help that I don't have my license, I could be doing more before I sit here and say ""it's all their fault"". A wedding on my dad's side (she's my aunt) was a month ago, and I wasn't invited at all.

I think that's good enough, I just want to be in my two brothers' lives, and with my father's family. 

My relationship, in my opinion is a mess, we'll call her Ash for the story.

Ash and I have been together for nearly four years, and the first half of the relationship was going great. Sex life was there (never mattered to me), but our ability to synch and communicate were absolutely perfect, and we were ""the couple"" to be. The only real issue was that I paid for just about everything we did, which was tough because I was at college hours away, but we managed.

However, the last two years have been downright miserable, and some of it was my fault. Ash met this new group of friends (many in their 30s) and ""fell in love"" with one, we will call him Kyle. Ash would ditch our meetups after my job to met with Kyle. Eventually, I spazzed after blowoff after blowoff of me getting off work when they both ""went to a waterfall"" together, I still don't know what happened that day, and I'm not sure if I want to find out. Ash wanted a break from our relationship because we weren't getting along (I knew what it was for in reality, and it ended a week later)

However, in September, we had a huge fight, because she was with another guy (not Kyle) and apparently let this guy kiss and feel her up. I let it go because we were fighting, and broken up, but maybe I was wrong. Months of it being a ""ok"" relationship at best until May.

In May, my grandfather passed away in front of my eyes, it was the first person I've ever seen die right in front of me. And Ash wasn't there, she was with friends despite me telling her earlier in the day (around noon) that I would be coming home due to the decline of my grandfathers' health. She was too late, here a half hour after he passed, and I felt broken that the one person who I wanted beside me was here just too late. I feel like this has been the story of us.

The straw that broke my heart was a week ago, when she said I was a ""manipulative monster"". Immediately, my heart stopped, I was being called the very thing I hated; my father.

I honestly just.. Can't handle this relationship anymore, I feel that making Ash happy is more of a war then a pleasure. Our ability to communicate is garbage, and she's become so complacent with her life, taking her education slow (she's 20) and not having a real job (she scorekeeps, super seasonal. She's extremely lazy and nearly repulsive; her room is always riddled with trash (mostly food) and plates are always stacked 5-7 high. There's fucking period stains on the bed, they've been there for months! And she wears the same outfits for 2 days in a row. I just think for being twenty, she doesn't take care of herself like a twenty year old should. Whenever I CALMLY talk to her about these things, she flips.


I guess.. That's all of what's on my mind, any and all advice is welcome.

More importantly, thank you for listening."
2d5erk,1,2014-08-10,My girlfriend of 2+ years[20 F] and I [20 M] are no longer on the same page sexually,throwaway01132,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2d5erk/my_girlfriend_of_2_years20_f_and_i_20_m_are_no/,"As the title says, my girlfriend and I have run into some issues over the past few months.  When we first started dating we had sex nearly every day, but that has dropped precipitously, to MAYBE twice a month now.  Part of this is due to circumstance (we both held time-intensive internships this summer), but part is simply due to her lack of sex drive.  It has gotten to the point where she almost never makes any sexual advances, and seems to have sex only to appease me.  Obviously, this is not a sustainable thing for me.

This a complicated, sensitive topic for her (and me) though, as she was sexually assaulted a few years ago (before we started dating), so I am hesitant to bring this up to her.  We have had a couple of conversations and she assures me that she is still very much attracted to me, and loves me, but that her body just can't have sex, and she is still affected by what happened to her.  She also added that at the beginning of the relationship she didn't want to say anything, but that the amount of sex we were having ""was just too much for her to handle"".  I do believe she is still attracted to me and loves me, and everything else about our relationship is great, but I can't help feeling like we've simply turned into best friends who occasionally have sex, as opposed to romantic partners.

The question here is: how do I handle this?  I feel as though speaking to a psychologist might help her a bit.  It's clear that she's still affected by what happened to her.  I just want to go about it in the most gentle, sensitive way possible, without offending her or forcing her to re-visit things she doesn't want to.  I am committed to the relationship and I want to help us, but sex is a part of that, and I feel like this is something which needs to be addressed, for her sake and mine.

TL;DR: Rarely have sex, having hard time bringing this up, as it is a sensitive topic for her due to a past sexual assault..."
2d5jbm,113,2014-08-10,A submissive moment [f]or the reserved college intern who had never [m]asturbated before.,[deleted],gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/2d5jbm/a_submissive_moment_for_the_reserved_college/,"""I don't think this is the way to your house"" she said as I pulled on to the main road.

She was 24 years old, 5 foot tall, and maybe 125 lbs.  I'll call her ""Rita"" for discretionary purposes. Rita was a half Chinese native from Peru. She attended college in the US, and somehow ended up across the country interning at my place of work. You wouldn't know by looking but she always wore a thong, and it complimented her perfectly round ass.  Smooth legs and a flat stomach seemed to be accented by her caramel skin.  She was definitely proud of it.  But she was self conscious breasts. They were somewhere between an A or B cup, but she had the largest puffiest nipples I had ever seen.  There was nothing about her body I couldn't appreciate.   I had worked with her for a month before anything had happened.  From day one, I knew she had a crush on me, but I had been seeing someone else at the time.  The day after a nasty breakup I realized I was not emotionally prepared to deal with it, and I had decided alcohol and this girl would help me through it.  That first night/weekend is another story I could share.  

Getting back to the point, during our sex filled month together, she had confided that she had never masturbated in her life, and had no interest in toys.  It seemed like a crime to me that such a beautiful and sexual women deny herself such a fundamental joy in life.  After two weeks of suggestions and requests it was obvious that she was just too self conscious and repressed to even consider it. I had decided to do something about that.

Her car was damaged and in the shop.  She had asked me to barrow some camping gear and for a ride to a carpool for an intern only farewell camping trip.  I had no problem agreeing to do so.  I'm an avid camper myself and had more than enough to loan to someone who just brought a suitcase to Michigan.

I had pulled into the local adult erotic shop and her eyes went wide. She demanded to know why we were there. I very calmly explained that we were there to buy here a vibrator.  She tried to argue, but when I explained that it was going to happen and she was going to miss the carpool if she argued, she eventually tried to negotiate ""well, we can go inside and look for a minute, but that's it.""

I didn't say anything, just passionately kissed her and got out of the car. As soon as we walked through the threshold we were greeted by a friendly clerk. Rita was hanging off my arm and dug her fingers deep as she shyly tried to hide behind me.  The openness of the clerk seemed to scare her, it was obvious she had never been in this kind of environment before.  After about 15 minutes of perusing the store and her attempts to negotiate (""we're not doing this, okay - but let me think about it, I need to sleep on it, don't do it I'll never use it),  Periodically the store clerk would walk buy and ask if we had questions. As soon a she left for the 3rd time I looked at my watch and informed Rita that she was going to be late, and if she didn't pick one the new agreement was that I would and I would make her use it in the car. 

She seemed confused. I could tell that she didn't think I was serious, but was fearful she could be wrong. Another 5 or 10 minutes passed.  She wasn't openly making the decision but I picked up on a few ques, she liked the color blue and wanted something about the size of my cock.  I had been with her enough to know some of what she liked.  Clitoral stimulation was too much for her, she could take so much oral and fingers were too rough.  She loved penetration.  I won't claim to know everything about women, but there was one she kept going back to that seemed as good as any.  I grabbed it from the shelf and started towards the register grabbing lube, cleaner, and batteries.  She pleaded with my not spend the money, I was determined of what would happen next.  I suggest to her that she buy some lingerie to wear the next time I visited, but as soon as she saw what was on the mannequin her eyes went right to the ground.

I paid, and kissed her again walking out to my car. She said to keep the receipt and she didn't want to use it.  We sat down in my car, here face lit with fear when I started opening the box and putting batteries in the vibrator. I handed it to her and coldly said ""Use it.""  She refused and I started the car.  I explained where the direction we needed to go and pulled out in the other direction. She begged me not to do it, but it was obvious that she was immensely turned on by the situation. I pulled her over the console and kissed her again, she bit my lip as I let go and she fell back into her seat.  My right hand went right to her jeans and started unbuttoning at a stop light. A truck pulled up next to me, high enough to see into my car and she started to fight back.  I just swatted her hands away and continued.

Her pants were open now and I could see a wet spot on her panties.  She still refused to touch herself and my request.  It wasn't new. I pointed at the clock and explained ""you really need to convince me turn around now."" I opened the lube and dropped some onto the blue silicon.  I handed it to her and she sighed taking it in hand. She asked for a blanket and I pulled out a fleece I kept in the back.  As soon as it was on her lap she began to moan. She was vocal about never having done this, but how much of turn on it was.  I smiled at my success. Though she admitted she didn't know what she was doing.  I told her just to play around and see what felt good as I turned around.  She began to moan and squeal, I was instantly jealous.  We generally tried to be quiet, but I never got her to make sounds like that.  I asked her what she was doing and she explained that she had just inserted the tip.  I reached under the blanket and forcefully used her hand to push it in all the way.  It was obvious she came as soon as it happened.  I began to push and pull it in and out as she squirmed in the seat.  she once she calmed down I tilted her hand trying to stimulate her G-spot. She immediately began to breath heavy again, which made me smile.  Her pitch got high again and she overpowered my hand pulling it out, screaming it was too much.

We're working on things which is great but affection/intimacy from her is now basically 0. Ladies of Reddit - how do you reconnect with a partner after your confidence in a relationship is rattled.**

So I (27 M) closed out a 10 week period of long distance where my GF (of 10 months) was in another city for an internship. We really didn't do long distance well and even though we managed to see each other 3 times during the summer I feel like our relationship has taken a big hit. 

Our communication wasn't great (which led me to feel like she was pulling away) and the distance exacerbated some issues she was having with me which she hadn't yet expressed.

We had a big blow out fight about this (after our first two weekends together were tense/awkward) that ultimately left her feeling unsure about us as a couple. We seem to have two major issues:

1. My feeling like she seized all the power and her feeling like I had unfairly put the responsibility for fun/energy on her

2. Her needing to make a lot of big life decisions that won't affect her for a couple years (but must be made right now) which she is finding hard to talk to me about. Specifically she may want to move to the west coast and I would prefer to stay on the easy coast though I've said I would, when the time comes, be ok with moving for her. Ultimately I think it's very difficult for her to make these decisions (which are critical to her) while considering me - which is causing her to alienate me.

We're still together and have both been putting in effort to fix things (much improved conversation, more energy from me, increased attention to my interests from her etc) however things still feel off. We are sort of re-engineering the relationship roles to encourage me to be more assertive / less deferential and for her to be more encouraging of my interests. This is great but it definitely feels a little unnatural. 

More concerning is that while we are making progress I feel like she's been friendly, but a little cold. She's only been back a few days (and we spent one additional weekend together a few weeks ago) but affection from her seems basically non-existent. It's mostly unspoken but actual intimacy is basically off the table but even kissing/cuddling seems like too much for her. She's been back for a couple days and we've spent both nights together but it just a little soul crushing when you feel like you have to pull every ""I love you"" or peck on the lips out of her.

I think the main issue is that she still feels she can't talk to me about her big decisions and feels she needs to make them on her own. Since they consume so much of her thoughts she is feeling disconnected from me 

As a side note during out first two meet ups this summer (which by all accounts weren't great) our intimacy/affection was pretty good. It seems like the fight (more so than the actual issues) really rattled her confidence in the relationship. Even though we are addressing the issues that were making us unhappy, just airing all that negativity seems to have made things worse. Frankly it's the first time I've really expressed my concerns/minor disatisfactions with the relationship and I think that might have gotten to her. I've been very open about how much I love and care about her but that doesn't seem to help (and makes me feel worse because she isn't vocalizing those same thoughts).

I am just finishing up my first summer internship where I earned a lot more money than I previously did, and I am not sure how to best invest it. I go to school full-time and my parents pay for that so I do not need to put money away for that. I have also been working jobs since high school and saving most of the money so here are my finances right now:

~$6,500 in stocks and funds on my TD Ameritrade account

~$600 in a roth IRA i opened last month and it auto deposits $100 every month

~$600 in another trading platform where I also deposit $100 a month and invest much more conservatively

~2,400 in my checkings account (I never keep this much in the account but the money from my paychecks has just accumulated)

~2,000 in my savings account (Would like to move most of this money).

So total I have about ~$12,000 with no clue where to put it. I am very fortunate in that I do not have to pay any housing expenses, tuition expenses, or anything other than my discretionary spending. I would like some help in putting the money somewhere that it would at least keep its value with time. Also I graduate in 2 years so I have one more summer of interning before I graduate.

Thanks, "

I wrote some of this a few months back for some reason I can't recall, so it might have a weird writing style... 

I have lived in the same house for the entirety of my life thus far. But even still, I have never had a home. A house is not a home; it is simply a shell to contain and centralize the events, situations, and physical objects involved in the life of its denizens. But a home? A home is where the heart is. And my heart could not possibly reside in such an environment as my house. Even from a very young age, I knew I did not belong in this small northern suburb of Chicago.  
  
For my house to have been a home, I would need a family. But I did not have one. Sure, I had a mom, dad, sister, brother, and dog, but that doesn't always mean it can be considered a family. My mom was always sick, sleeping, or running errands. The few times we saw each other, she had the expectations of a Tiger Mom. My dad was always working or out with his buddies. More so, he is an emotionally aloof-but-volatile man, who always believes himself to be right. He is self-centered to the point where he cannot understand how people can be happy when he is mad, and how people can be mad when he is happy. My brother is emotionally oblivious and stunted. He never had time for me, between  school, homework, tennis, and his own friends. My sister left home when I was 4 and never came back - she had her own set of issues. I learned to play the computer when I was 3 (though I was horrible with the mouse) and for the years to come I would just play by myself as things happened around me.
  
For my house to have been a home, I would need friends. But I did not have any. At my K-8 school, my grade consisted of 76 kids, most of whom I had know for over 10 years before we were even 13. As such, we were grandfathered into our friendships. Therefore, I never had to, got to, or needed to learn how to make friends. Had I gone to a larger school in a larger town, I could not possibly have been friends with everyone in my grade, and therefore would have acquired those vital skills by necessity. But instead, I went from a grade school of 300 and a grade of 76 to a high school of 4500 and a grade of 1096. I was thrown into this shark tank thoroughly unprepared. When I entered high school, I realized that I only associated with the people from Jr. High / elementary school because that's what I had always done - I never really liked any of them. So I distanced myself, but at that point, everyone in school already had their friends groups and I was out of the loop, unable to get in. For my high school career, I had no friends and barely left the house for anything but school.

The lack of a family or friends influenced my depression and entirely-self-reliant personality. Even before I turned 7, I would always wake up to an empty house, walk to school alone, slog through school, walk home alone, do my homework alone, and wait in my empty house for someone else to come home. In these times, my only enemy was myself, and my only friends were my knees as they hugged my crying head between them. No one ever showed me love, though I strongly desired to receive it. And I showed love to no one, though I strongly desired to give it.
  
I never even showed love to myself. I hated my situation, hated my personality, hated how everything about me only served to separate me further from others, and hated my physical self. As much as I wanted to be loved, how could I ever truly love someone if I don't even love myself, especially as gay man? How could I be sure that what I was feeling was a want for them to be in my life and not a want for their body or person to be or replace my own? Therefore, when I see someone I am attracted to, the feelings that arise are envy, fear, self-loathing, and despair. Envious of what they are and have that I deeply desire. Fearful that I will never become the person that I want to be. Self-loathing directed at all my flaws. Despair due to the thought that I will never find love and passion. I could always feel the pain of a heart turned to ash, and veins that felt as though filled with cold sand. As such, to take all the love I so desperately want, I fear that no one person could ever satisfy me without being drained to their core. [end pre-written stuff]
  
In the summer of 2013 at the age of 17, after a complete emotional and mental breakdown because my mom wanted me to come inside to an REI store, I finally admitted that time wouldn't make things better - I had to take the steps. So I left for Mountain Valley Treatment Center. I spent 93 days there learning to cope with depression and anxiety, and more importantly, with myself. It was hard. It was *fucking hard.* It wasn't like anything on TV. It was breaking you down to build you up. It was *specifically doing* what was hardest, specifically feeling that anxiety and instead of any avoidance, attacking it head-on. If you were afraid of judgment and your therapist knew that you would never dress goth, you were going to be at Dunkin' Donuts in full goth get-up (black leather with studs, black make-up, and your name is now ""Morticia,"" not ""Erin,"") and you were going to hold up that line for 15 minutes asking the cashier to read every type of donut they had because ""I don't read good"" and asking whether Boston Cremes were made in Boston, made by people from Boston, or if just the cream was from Boston. If you had obsessive thoughts about accidentally stabbing someone, you were going to be handed a giant knife and your therapist will be yelling ""STAB ME, COME ON, STAB ME RIGHT IN THE CHEST"" over and over at you until you cry. If you were afraid to inconvenience someone, you were going to a restaurant and sending the same meal back *three times.*  If there was someone who triggered you because the man who raped you, beat you, cut you, and seared off your skin looked just like him, you were going to sit next to each other whenever you could. It was serious. It was work. It was cutting away the walls in your mind and laying everything inside you bare, right in front of a bunch of people, and giving them the hammer to crush any part of you. But instead the took you into themselves and vowed to make you whole again. I had support like never before. The program was set up fantastically. The clinical staff were immensely skilled and cared deeply for us kids as people. The non-clinical staff were amazing and supportive as well. And most importantly, the other kids were incredible - people who had gone through so much, whether they were 13 (the minimum age) or 20 (near the max), their stories were harrowing and of pain, but always lined with the want for something more and something different. Even if we were doing something that totally sucked, I always had a blast with the other residents - some of my fondest memories were of picking beans in sweltering heat or going to WalMart. It was a community of love and caring that one very rarely finds. I shed more tears, belted out more laughs, dug deeper into myself, and put myself out farther during my time there than any other. I never felt more comfortable and at home. It was one of the happiest, hardest, and most important experiences I had ever undergone. It didn't cure me of depression or anxiety, don't get me wrong - I don't think that's possible, anyway. It just gave me the tools to deal with it and to begin to heal and love myself. It was learning to ride a bike from nothing - Mountain Valley was my training wheels and I graduated not because I could ride the bike perfectly on my own, but rather because I could stay upright and just keep getting better and better without the wheels. I learned some amazing skills and ideas that I have incorporated into my life and personage and am so thankful for. Mountain Valley gave me my life back.  
 
When I was done with Mountain Valley, it was the very tail end of October and my senior year had already started. But there was no way I would be going back to my old school. Not only did I feel no tie to it, there was no way I could go back and connect with those kids after all I had been through. The kids who I had so long envied, I now more-or-less felt superior to them in their myopia. So after discussing with my EC (education consultant) I decided to go to Surf House Puerto Rico (a ""modified gap year experience), where I am now.
  
**[From here until the next bolded text is about the structure of the ""program"" I'm in right now and is sort of boring, so you can skip it if you must, but I think some background is important.]** Surf House was founded in September of 2013 and I got there in November of 2013 as the 4th student. It would be hard to explain what its all about, because it's changed so much since its inception, but I'll explain it as best as I can as it is now (August 2014). There are two buildings, the ""house"" in the mountains where most of the kids sleep/keep their stuff/spend the weekends, the ""school"" in town where the kids spend most of the day/do their academics/use as the central hub for shepherding everyone off to all the activities. Underneath the school is the ""apartment"" where the stage 3 kids live. There are 3 stages. Stage 1: people who are new (or got knocked down to the the more-or-less non-existent disciplinary system). They must participate in all activities (water sports on M/W/F, yoga on T/Th, Spanish class T/W/Th, basketball on T, track night on W, art walk on Th, Saturday Adventure, Marine Biology whenever it is, and Academics everyday for HS students), get 1 hour of free computer time per day, have no off-campus time, and must schedule all phone useage/calls in advance. Lights out at 10. Stage 2: People who have participated in all the activities sufficiently, they must participate in water sports twice per week, yoga once a week, Spanish T/W/Th, Saturday Adventure, Marine Biology, and Academics. They may also choose to do Academics at the school instead of the evening activities (basketball, track, art walk). They get 1 hour of off-campus time and may self-monitor all technology usage. Students must pursue an internship within the community, be it working in a dive shop, a horse barn, or as a ""raw foodist's"" assistant. Lights out at 10. They live at the house. Stage 3: we live in the apartment. You must have completed high school, be 18+, and have proven that you are responsible enough to live without supervision. We don't have to participate in anything. We can go out whenever and wherever we choose. We purchase our own food and make our own meals.  If something is needed, we must advocate for ourselves. **[Bolded text]**  
 
This is month 10 or so and I'm fed up and just want to leave. I don't identify with the kids at all and the community is non-existent (there are 12 kids, 3 including me are in the apartment) - they make a mockery of the program by not doing what they need to, disrespecting the staff, using their time off-campus to get drugs/smokes/alcohol, being obsessed with all that typical ""high-school stuff"" and completely ignoring their duties. They're extremely difficult to get along with and I try to keep things amicable and ignore them as much as possible. They absolutely hate the kids in the apartment because we have more freedom than them (but really we sort of don't, but that's a tangent, though it's not like I haven't gone off on a million of those). The administration doesn't do anything about their behavior and it creates a terrible environment, especially for new kids, *especially* for young impressionable new kids, and especially for people who have been working hard to stay clean and actually accomplish something in the now and for the future.   

And so this is where I am: I want to leave, but it would not be pragmatic at this time because I don't have a plan. I want to go to college and want to go sooner rather than later. If I were to go this fall, I would be on track, but I don't have a whole lot of options because of how late in the season it is - I want to go to *my* school, not just settle for *a* school. If I were to go in January, I would have more options college-wise, but it would be harder to establish myself socially because everyone would be in the swing of things already - and the social aspect is the most important part of college for me. If I were to go next fall, I would have more options college-wise, but I would be less-than-enthused about being a 19-year-old freshman (thought I know that's more common these days), and I would have to figure out what I would do *that would be productive to my future goals and wants* in the year until next fall. I think going back home would be easier now, since I feel like my family understands me better and we're all older now, but I wouldn't want to fall back into my old, bad habits.  

So in essence, I just don't know what to do or where to go. I don't think many people my age feel like they know just what to do, but I feel I have less direction than normal. And as the days sort of stagnate as I try to formulate a plan, I just sort of fall into despair, the biggest of which is **complete lack of body confidence.** I have no satisfaction with my body. My hair never does what I want, my skin has too much acne and too many blemishes and I can't stop absent-mindedly picking at it, my arms aren't muscular enough, my chest isn't muscular enough, my face is too fat, my stomach is too fat and has too much skin, my jawline isn't pronounced enough, my ears are too big, I think my dick is too small and don't want it to have stopped growing (I don't think it's below average, but I would like it to be bigger, especially as a gay guy), my smile is too lop-sided, my teeth are too small, my nipples look weird, my voice is annoying, my tongue is discolored, I can barely grow any hair, my feet are too flat and wide, my thighs are too fat, my butt isn't smooth or bubble/muscular enough, my skin is too pale, I have too many scars, etc. Some of it I just hope time, growing, and development will take care of (I hope I'm not done with puberty yet), muscle/bodybuilding-wise it's all on me to fix. But I don't know how - what exercises to do, what food to eat, what the hell ""bulking"" is, how to bulk, etc. And my work-out equipment consists of a yoga mat and a single dumbbell. Not even a set. More-or-less my dream body, for reference: [here.](http://31.media.tumblr.com/5f42bc66d2d46ded118d777f4a6a31cd/tumblr_mtb55vFJsW1s97wbdo1_500.jpg)  
 
**TL;DR: Rambling aside, I don't know where I'm going to college, when I'm going to college, or if I will succeed to my personal definition. I also don't know how to deal with my complete-and-utter dissatisfaction with my physical self.**

In the summer of 2013 at the age of 17, after a complete emotional and mental breakdown because my mom wanted me to come inside to an REI store, I finally admitted that time wouldn't make things better - I had to take the steps. So I left for Mountain Valley Treatment Center. I spent 93 days there learning to cope with depression and anxiety, and more importantly, with myself. It was hard. It was *fucking hard.* It wasn't like anything on TV. It was breaking you down to build you up. It was *specifically doing* what was hardest, specifically feeling that anxiety and instead of any avoidance, attacking it head-on. If you were afraid of judgment and your therapist knew that you would never dress goth, you were going to be at Dunkin' Donuts in full goth get-up (black leather with studs, black make-up, and your name is now ""Morticia,"" not ""Erin,"") and you were going to hold up that line for 15 minutes asking the cashier to read every type of donut they had because ""I don't read good"" and asking whether Boston Cremes were made in Boston, made by people from Boston, or if just the cream was from Boston. If you had obsessive thoughts about accidentally stabbing someone, you were going to be handed a giant knife and your therapist will be yelling ""STAB ME, COME ON, STAB ME RIGHT IN THE CHEST"" over and over at you until you cry. If you were afraid to inconvenience someone, you were going to a restaurant and sending the same meal back *three times.*  If there was someone who triggered you because the man who raped you, beat you, cut you, and seared off your skin looked just like him, you were going to sit next to each other whenever you could. It was serious. It was work. It was cutting away the walls in your mind and laying everything inside you bare, right in front of a bunch of people, and giving them the hammer to crush any part of you. But instead the took you into themselves and vowed to make you whole again. I had support like never before. The program was set up fantastically. The clinical staff were immensely skilled and cared deeply for us kids as people. The non-clinical staff were amazing and supportive as well. And most importantly, the other kids were incredible - people who had gone through so much, whether they were 13 (the minimum age) or 20 (near the max), their stories were harrowing and of pain, but always lined with the want for something more and something different. Even if we were doing something that totally sucked, I always had a blast with the other residents - some of my fondest memories were of picking beans in sweltering heat or going to WalMart. It was a community of love and caring that one very rarely finds. I shed more tears, belted out more laughs, dug deeper into myself, and put myself out farther during my time there than any other. I never felt more comfortable and at home. It was one of the happiest, hardest, and most important experiences I had ever undergone. It didn't cure me of depression or anxiety, don't get me wrong - I don't think that's possible, anyway. It just gave me the tools to deal with it and to begin to heal and love myself. It was learning to ride a bike from nothing - Mountain Valley was my training wheels and I graduated not because I could ride the bike perfectly on my own, but rather because I could stay upright and just keep getting better and better without the wheels. I learned some amazing skills and ideas that I have incorporated into my life and personage and am so thankful for. Mountain Valley gave me my life back.  
 
When I was done with Mountain Valley, it was the very tail end of October and my senior year had already started. But there was no way I would be going back to my old school. Not only did I feel no tie to it, there was no way I could go back and connect with those kids after all I had been through. The kids who I had so long envied, I now more-or-less felt superior to them in their myopia. So after discussing with my EC (education consultant) I decided to go to Surf House Puerto Rico (a ""modified gap year experience), where I am now.
  
**[From here until the next bolded text is about the structure of the ""program"" I'm in right now and is sort of boring, so you can skip it if you must, but I think some background is important.]** Surf House was founded in September of 2013 and I got there in November of 2013 as the 4th student. It would be hard to explain what its all about, because it's changed so much since its inception, but I'll explain it as best as I can as it is now (August 2014). There are two buildings, the ""house"" in the mountains where most of the kids sleep/keep their stuff/spend the weekends, the ""school"" in town where the kids spend most of the day/do their academics/use as the central hub for shepherding everyone off to all the activities. Underneath the school is the ""apartment"" where the stage 3 kids live. There are 3 stages. Stage 1: people who are new (or got knocked down to the the more-or-less non-existent disciplinary system). They must participate in all activities (water sports on M/W/F, yoga on T/Th, Spanish class T/W/Th, basketball on T, track night on W, art walk on Th, Saturday Adventure, Marine Biology whenever it is, and Academics everyday for HS students), get 1 hour of free computer time per day, have no off-campus time, and must schedule all phone useage/calls in advance. Lights out at 10. Stage 2: People who have participated in all the activities sufficiently, they must participate in water sports twice per week, yoga once a week, Spanish T/W/Th, Saturday Adventure, Marine Biology, and Academics. They may also choose to do Academics at the school instead of the evening activities (basketball, track, art walk). They get 1 hour of off-campus time and may self-monitor all technology usage. Students must pursue an internship within the community, be it working in a dive shop, a horse barn, or as a ""raw foodist's"" assistant. Lights out at 10. They live at the house. Stage 3: we live in the apartment. You must have completed high school, be 18+, and have proven that you are responsible enough to live without supervision. We don't have to participate in anything. We can go out whenever and wherever we choose. We purchase our own food and make our own meals.  If something is needed, we must advocate for ourselves. **[Bolded text]**  
 
This is month 10 or so and I'm fed up and just want to leave. I don't identify with the kids at all and the community is non-existent (there are 12 kids, 3 including me are in the apartment) - they make a mockery of the program by not doing what they need to, disrespecting the staff, using their time off-campus to get drugs/smokes/alcohol, being obsessed with all that typical ""high-school stuff"" and completely ignoring their duties. They're extremely difficult to get along with and I try to keep things amicable and ignore them as much as possible. They absolutely hate the kids in the apartment because we have more freedom than them (but really we sort of don't, but that's a tangent, though it's not like I haven't gone off on a million of those). The administration doesn't do anything about their behavior and it creates a terrible environment, especially for new kids, *especially* for young impressionable new kids, and especially for people who have been working hard to stay clean and actually accomplish something in the now and for the future.   

And so this is where I am: I want to leave, but it would not be pragmatic at this time because I don't have a plan. I want to go to college and want to go sooner rather than later. If I were to go this fall, I would be on track, but I don't have a whole lot of options because of how late in the season it is - I want to go to *my* school, not just settle for *a* school. If I were to go in January, I would have more options college-wise, but it would be harder to establish myself socially because everyone would be in the swing of things already - and the social aspect is the most important part of college for me. If I were to go next fall, I would have more options college-wise, but I would be less-than-enthused about being a 19-year-old freshman (thought I know that's more common these days), and I would have to figure out what I would do *that would be productive to my future goals and wants* in the year until next fall. I think going back home would be easier now, since I feel like my family understands me better and we're all older now, but I wouldn't want to fall back into my old, bad habits.  

So in essence, I just don't know what to do or where to go. I don't think many people my age feel like they know just what to do, but I feel I have less direction than normal. And as the days sort of stagnate as I try to formulate a plan, I just sort of fall into despair, the biggest of which is **complete lack of body confidence.** I have no satisfaction with my body. My hair never does what I want, my skin has too much acne and too many blemishes and I can't stop absent-mindedly picking at it, my arms aren't muscular enough, my chest isn't muscular enough, my face is too fat, my stomach is too fat and has too much skin, my jawline isn't pronounced enough, my ears are too big, I think my dick is too small and don't want it to have stopped growing (I don't think it's below average, but I would like it to be bigger, especially as a gay guy), my smile is too lop-sided, my teeth are too small, my nipples look weird, my voice is annoying, my tongue is discolored, I can barely grow any hair, my feet are too flat and wide, my thighs are too fat, my butt isn't smooth or bubble/muscular enough, my skin is too pale, I have too many scars, etc. Some of it I just hope time, growing, and development will take care of (I hope I'm not done with puberty yet), muscle/bodybuilding-wise it's all on me to fix. But I don't know how - what exercises to do, what food to eat, what the hell ""bulking"" is, how to bulk, etc. And my work-out equipment consists of a yoga mat and a single dumbbell. Not even a set. More-or-less my dream body, for reference: [here.](http://31.media.tumblr.com/5f42bc66d2d46ded118d777f4a6a31cd/tumblr_mtb55vFJsW1s97wbdo1_500.jpg)  
 
**TL;DR: Rambling aside, I don't know where I'm going to college, when I'm going to college, or if I will succeed to my personal definition. I also don't know how to deal with my complete-and-utter dissatisfaction with my physical self.**

A little backstory, because I thinks it's necessary to know my past to understand my present. I wrote some of this a few months back for some reason I can't recall, so it might have a weird writing style... 

I have lived in the same house for the entirety of my life thus far. But even still, I have never had a home. A house is not a home; it is simply a shell to contain and centralize the events, situations, and physical objects involved in the life of its denizens. But a home? A home is where the heart is. And my heart could not possibly reside in such an environment as my house. Even from a very young age, I knew I did not belong in this small northern suburb of Chicago.  
  
For my house to have been a home, I would need a family. But I did not have one. Sure, I had a mom, dad, sister, brother, and dog, but that doesn't always mean it can be considered a family. My mom was always sick, sleeping, or running errands. The few times we saw each other, she had the expectations of a Tiger Mom. My dad was always working or out with his buddies. More so, he is an emotionally aloof-but-volatile man, who always believes himself to be right. He is self-centered to the point where he cannot understand how people can be happy when he is mad, and how people can be mad when he is happy. My brother is emotionally oblivious and stunted. He never had time for me, between  school, homework, tennis, and his own friends. My sister left home when I was 4 and never came back - she had her own set of issues. I learned to play the computer when I was 3 (though I was horrible with the mouse) and for the years to come I would just play by myself as things happened around me.
  
For my house to have been a home, I would need friends. But I did not have any. At my K-8 school, my grade consisted of 76 kids, most of whom I had know for over 10 years before we were even 13. As such, we were grandfathered into our friendships. Therefore, I never had to, got to, or needed to learn how to make friends. Had I gone to a larger school in a larger town, I could not possibly have been friends with everyone in my grade, and therefore would have acquired those vital skills by necessity. But instead, I went from a grade school of 300 and a grade of 76 to a high school of 4500 and a grade of 1096. I was thrown into this shark tank thoroughly unprepared. When I entered high school, I realized that I only associated with the people from Jr. High / elementary school because that's what I had always done - I never really liked any of them. So I distanced myself, but at that point, everyone in school already had their friends groups and I was out of the loop, unable to get in. For my high school career, I had no friends and barely left the house for anything but school.

The lack of a family or friends influenced my depression and entirely-self-reliant personality. Even before I turned 7, I would always wake up to an empty house, walk to school alone, slog through school, walk home alone, do my homework alone, and wait in my empty house for someone else to come home. In these times, my only enemy was myself, and my only friends were my knees as they hugged my crying head between them. No one ever showed me love, though I strongly desired to receive it. And I showed love to no one, though I strongly desired to give it.
  
I never even showed love to myself. I hated my situation, hated my personality, hated how everything about me only served to separate me further from others, and hated my physical self. As much as I wanted to be loved, how could I ever truly love someone if I don't even love myself, especially as gay man? How could I be sure that what I was feeling was a want for them to be in my life and not a want for their body or person to be or replace my own? Therefore, when I see someone I am attracted to, the feelings that arise are envy, fear, self-loathing, and despair. Envious of what they are and have that I deeply desire. Fearful that I will never become the person that I want to be. Self-loathing directed at all my flaws. Despair due to the thought that I will never find love and passion. I could always feel the pain of a heart turned to ash, and veins that felt as though filled with cold sand. As such, to take all the love I so desperately want, I fear that no one person could ever satisfy me without being drained to their core. *[end pre-written stuff]*

There are some days that I wake up and am completely happy-go-lucky, totally enjoy the day, and think I look pretty good. And there are some days that I wake up and getting out of bed is a struggle, nothing is fun or satisfying, and I avoid mirrors so I don't hate what I see. I know that it ultimately is my decision which sort of day it is, but it's never easy turning a day that starts like the latter into the former. I've gotten into a slump and have a hard time drawing on the teachings and lessons of Mountain Valley when I get so lost and caught up in confusion. I just need to stop myself from going down the wrong path for the day, but when I think of the future it gets that much harder.

I'm at home for a few weeks (a gap between my summer internship and my last year of college; I live in a 10-month dorm, so I had to move back home for this month) and am going to see my SO tomorrow (about an hour away from here; he's moving from our college town in a couple of weeks). My dad strongly disapproves of shacking up before marriage, and while my mom knew that I practically lived with an ex for about six months and slept at his place every night, we NEVER discussed it. I've lied to her about staying with a female friend tomorrow night instead of with my SO. 

Do any of you have to fight family expectations about relationships in your LDR, especially with visits? I worry about the shit storm that will occur when I tell her that I'm going to spend a weekend in the city with him next month! "

Cards up to Upstalk  

Deck built on [NetrunnerDB](http://netrunnerdb.com).



Key Deck Concepts
--------
* Taxing all the way. We want to have as many turns as possible where the runner can't run, which allows us to use our ID ability. The most important taxing cards are [Tollbooth](/en/card/01090), [Eli 1.0](/en/card/02110), [Inazuma](/en/card/05016), [Wall of Thorns](/en/card/01078), and [Caprice Nisei](/en/card/04114) (which forces multiple remote runs)
* Use your ID ability to place an advancement token on [Haas Arcology AI](/en/card/03011) (which can be done even when rezzed), then use the token to score agendas from hand. By placing [Haas Arcology AI](/en/card/03011) in a taxing server instead of an agenda, you gain all of the benefits (scoring next turn), with none of the risk of putting an agenda down.
* Trick of light to agendas from other installed cards is a back up plan, but also works just fine in many situations. 
* This is a Fast Advance (score from hand) deck, but is not a Rush (finish the game quickly) deck.

Playstyle
--------
* Try to ice up both HQ and R&amp;D with ice like [Eli 1.0](/en/card/02110), [Yagura](/en/card/04093), [Pup](/en/card/05018), [Rainbow](/en/card/05025) and create 1 taxing remote which you will be using to put [Haas Arcology AI](/en/card/03011), [Caprice Nisei](/en/card/04114), or agendas into (if you identify an appropriate timing window). Your remote will ideally have 2 or 3 pieces of ice and will cost a lot to get through. Archives can be lightly protected (maybe 1 piece of ice), with a [Shock!](/en/card/04073) dumped in there asap.
* [Gila Hands Arcology](/en/card/03023) is important for your economy, so scoring one early is important.
* During the early stages of the game, don't be afraid to not rez central ice and allow accesses if it benefits your mid-term aims like getting a [Celebrity Gift](/en/card/04012) or [Hedge Fund](/en/card/01110) played the next turn. Exception: if you're agenda flooded in HQ or for special runs like Indexing or Siphon.
* If you suspect siphon, just make HQ expensive to get into so that they don't profit from siphons, then use [Gila Hands Arcology](/en/card/03023) and [Celebrity Gift](/en/card/04012) to recover once the pressure has abated. I don't usually feel it necessary to use [Caprice Nisei](/en/card/04114) on HQ as it often serves your remote better, but use your judgement and adjust for each game.
* Interns is stunning in this deck. The most important cards to use it on are [Caprice Nisei](/en/card/04114) and [Haas Arcology AI](/en/card/03011). 
* Don't be afraid to manually advance a facedown [Haas Arcology AI](/en/card/03011) if they're making too many successful central runs. This forces an expensive remote run and either opens up a regular scoring window, or one using a different mechanism once they're poor.
* [Trick of Light](/en/card/02033) can either be used on its own to score 3 advancement agendas, or in combination with [Haas Arcology AI](/en/card/03011) to score [Nisei MK II](/en/card/01068) or the first [Medical Breakthrough](/en/card/05005).

Weaknesses
--------
* Decks with very strong economy and efficient breakers. If they can ensure a successful run every turn, it may be tough to tax them to the point that they can't keep running. Aim to place and rez more ice on the servers its needed.
* Successful/cost effective Account Siphon recursion. This is a weakness of most decks. Make HQ expensive to get into and use [Caprice Nisei](/en/card/04114) if necessary.
* Ice destruction. These decks will make it tough to keep your centrals taxing. Use [Interns](/en/card/04060) (and then [Jackson Howard](/en/card/04015) to return [Interns](/en/card/04060) to your deck), to return destroyed ice to play where you need them most.

Potential Adjustments and Alterations
--------
* [Ice Wall](/en/card/01103) is pretty great in [Tennin Institute: The Secrets Within](/en/card/05003), but I didn't really have the influence. It'd be nice to be able to do something with the advancement tokens placed on ice , though.
* Agenda mix up. I considered [NAPD Contract](/en/card/04119) and [Unorthodox Predictions](/en/card/04053), but felt this composition was more beneficial when scored.

Additional Notes
--------
* After completing the deck, I discovered that someone had made use of the idea [here](http://netrunnerdb.com/en/decklist/5888/tennis-institute-hass-archology), so props to Chicken Slayer!

2d71vm,1,2014-08-10,How to speed up reboot,smoothm,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/2d71vm/how_to_speed_up_reboot/,"I've found one way to speed things up man, but it's not easy: Total blackout from women. Avoid women as much as possible. Don't watch TV, look at advertisements, check out girls when you're in public etc.. Pretty much avoid anything that could trigger you to think about women in a sexual way. I've done this for the past week (day 28-35 of my no fap journey) and it's helped dramatically, my libido is starting to come back. I've been able to do this by working from 8:00-6:00, making/eating dinner from 6-7, playing basketball from 7-8:30, and anytime after 8:30 and any other free-time I have I'm preparing myself for the interviews that I'll have for next year's summer internship. By the end of the night, I'm exhausted and go straight to bed. Keep yourself busy at all times, and it'll be much easier, and a bonus is that you can use all your free time to focus on a specific goal and become a better version of yourself.

NoFap can change your life if you keep your priorities in order and use it to be productive! Stay dedicated gentlemen, NoFap doesn't need to be a struggle if you frame it in your mind in a different way."
2d77sz,2,2014-08-10,Housing demand in winter,alligatorscrocs,AnnArbor,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnnArbor/comments/2d77sz/housing_demand_in_winter/,"I'm coming into Ann Arbor for an internship this fall and originally tried to find short-term housing near downtown (I'll only be there for september thru december). After I realized that was not going to happen, I have decided that I am going to try to take over someone's lease or start a 12 month. My question is: Does anyone have experience transferring their lease during the winter months? I'm wondering what kind of demand there is around January for studio/one-bedroom lease takeovers in the downtown/kerrytown area. Would it be a better idea to take a less expensive, 6-month lease 20 minutes out of downtown? I do not want to be stuck with a $1300/month rent payment when I move back to my current apartment and begin that rent payment again.

Sidenote - I am super stoked to come to your city. Visited this weekend, and it was awesome. Thanks for your help."

2d7ktr,6,2014-08-11,"Me [20 F] with my boyfriend [20 M] almost 2 years, He's leaving for a year, I'm not sure how to cope",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2d7ktr/me_20_f_with_my_boyfriend_20_m_almost_2_years_hes/,"I'm not quite sure where to start this, but basically I met my boyfriend at the start of freshman year in college and we kinda knew we'd be together right off the bat. We've had some really good times. I guess we'd always been a little bit 'that couple' the kind that's glued to the hip? I mean we have our own separate friends and activities but we did most things together and he slept over every night at my apartment. I know it probably wasn't good to spend that much time together, but it never felt like it. We were just so close. 

So anyways, he's a software engineering student and our school has a lot of internship requirements for that major. This means that for the past two summers he's worked full time in California on internships. This is literally cross country from me considering we both live and go to school on the east coast. It was fine for us last summer but for some reason this summer has been different. It's just for some reason, everything he does now drives me absolutely crazy. 

I know myself, I'm usually rational to a fault, but i can see myself just go full crazy girlfriend. For example: I ask if he wants to talk on the phone but he can't because he's at a party and in my head I just get crazy irrationally mad at him. One day on facebook one of his posts pops up, he's planning a movie party with a girl who he has never mentioned to me before. My mind goes wild. I know I need to trust him and I crap but I can't help getting nervous anytime another girl is brought up in any situation. 

I brought up to him how weirdly upset I've been in the relationship and he claims he honestly had thought nothing had changed and it was the same as last summer. I just feel weirdly distant to him. I thought for a while it was because he was being bad about contacting me, but he wasn't really. Then I thought maybe it was just because we were separated where before we'd seen each other everyday. Still, we'd been totally fine last summer under the exact same circumstances. 

All summer everyones been telling me to just wait till we're back at school together because we'll just snap back to the way it was. Well just a few days ago he announced that he received a job offer for an entire year at a startup in California and he'd accepted. He didn't ask me and I wouldn't have expect him to. I would never ever ask him to give up this awesome job to come to be with me because it's what I believe in. I don't want to make him feel like he's choosing between the job and me but that's kind how it seems to be shaking out. I wouldn't ever want him to choose me. 

I asked him if he wanted to take a break, see other people, and when he comes back we can deicide how we feel, but he said he wanted to stay with me and really didn't want to lose me. I really really love him and it breaks my heart because I don't know how we can stay together through this with me being the way I am. I really really want to too. I'm just too neurotic and sensitive. A part of me just feels a little too young to be dragged into such a commitment with him when we could I guess move on and find people who suit our needs better. I don't know what to do here.

**tl;dr**: I'm a little crazy about long distance relationships and my boyfriend has been across country all summer will be away for a whole nother year and I don't think I can do it."
2d7mys,0,2014-08-11,(17/m) can't get over ex,michaelcooll,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2d7mys/17m_cant_get_over_ex/,"I've posted plenty times before and I'm sure a couple people are tired from hearing from me, but in all honestly, I cannot get over my ex. We broke up a month ago and She was my first girlfriend and we dated since Freshman year until right before the beginning of senior year, so about a good 2 1/2 years we were together. 

Long story short I was unhappy with myself and it wasn't anyone's fault. It took a toll on my relationship when she moved about an hour away from our hometown to pursue an internship and work on her dream job. My unhappiness led to lack of motivation to keep anything around, that meant my friends, family, and of course my girlfriend. 

She dumped me due to lack of communication and her just not feeling the same. (Which I understand completely and know where she is coming from).

She wanted to stay friends and kind of go from there as we both just saw where life would take us, but it was too hard on me, so we had a long conversation and I broke up the friendship (for now at least)

But during our conversation  we both decided it was best for us to focus on ourselves and to have time away from each other. 

I told her I just want to get highschool over with and move on with my life, and she basically said that if after this year of working on myself and becoming a happier person then to give her a call because I would deserve a second chance. And I know that sounds really shitty. But she meant in a genuine and comforting way. 

But here is the kicker, she has been hanging out with a close friend shes had over the years who I was always sort of worried about, but I never controlled who she would hangout with, and basically she said she ""thinks"" she likes him. And I know he's liked her for as long as I can remember and the second we broke up he was there for her to comfort her and take care of her. 

I can honestly say I'm starting to feel better about myself and happier, but whenever something reminds me of her I just take a step back and it takes a while for me to regroup and feel better. We talk briefly at times, just saying hi and seeing how each other, but I just still really have feelings for her and I cannot get over her.

I still have that sliver of hope in the back of my mind to try again, but I don't even know why I have it to be completely honest. I don't even know if I want to be with her ever again, I just miss her a lot. 

And I know that I'm only 17 and there are plenty of fish in the sea, but I honestly don't think I can ever feel as comfortable with another person as I did with her. It's just a weird feeling and I don't like it. "

2d7pzs,1,2014-08-11,I'm [21M] have no idea how to move forward with my [20F] ex-casual partner,thorwgodofaway,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2d7pzs/im_21m_have_no_idea_how_to_move_forward_with_my/,"(yes, I know I messed the title up)

Okay, this one's long. I'm sorry.


I go to a small liberal arts school in New England. It's a place where you kind of know people even if you've never met them, just because you see them around all the time. I ended up developing a crush on a girl who was one of those people you know *of* but don't really know personally.


I'm not really sure how this happened, but I guess I must have told the right person about it, because out of the blue this girl shows up at a party and really obviously indicates that she's interested in me, too. At the time, I pretty much told her I was too drunk to hook up with her, but she respected that and the next day we ended up sleeping together for the first time.


Thus began a 4-5 month long casual relationship. We did not see each other every single day, but were in more-or-less constant contact. We probably got together and just hung out together in one of our rooms a few times a week. We'd also go to parties together and generally do stuff together that you'd see ""real"" couples do (all without ever reflecting on it, weirdly). We had sex a lot of the times we hung out, but there were plenty of occasions where we just watched Netflix and fell asleep together.


To be clear, we never once discussed what our deal was. I never referred to her as my girlfriend; she never referred to me as her boyfriend. We never discussed exclusivity but I know for a fact that we weren't doing anything on the side. Over this period of time we obviously became close friends in addition to lovers, and friends of ours tended to just act like we were ""a couple,"" largely for their convenience I assume.


As school let out for summer, we finally had our ""what's the deal with us"" talk, and it went... not very well, for me. She asked what I wanted to do. I (stupidly) said that whatever she wanted was fine with me, but I thought we could make a serious relationship work. She gave a number of minutely contradictory answers, but they ultimately boiled down to ""I don't know if I have romantic feelings for you, so we probably shouldn't take this thing any further."" She gave a couple of reasons for why she was anxious about the prospect (it would be her first relationship, she wasn't sure she was emotionally ready, she had seen her parents go through a really, really rough divorce, stuff like that), but in retrospect that just makes me feel worse because she felt like she had to justify her feelings to me.


She did make a very, very specific point of telling me that she did not want to stop being friends with me, as she genuinely believed we have some sort of interpersonal chemistry and wanted to continue spending time with me. She believed (as I had sort of noticed, too) that we were eerily similar people, and we do get along surprisingly well for people who were essentially friends-with-benefits with the benefits preceding the friendship.


I initially felt like she was just trying to soften the blow of the ""I don't want to date you"" talk we were having (which could be true--she's preternaturally nice and definitely the type to ""spare"" someone's feelings), but when I reflected on it, I figured that she had never once done anything wrong by me--she'd always been the model of the kind of person I'd want to hang out with even without the sexual aspect, and I'd be a humongous dick if I dropped out of her life just because she didn't want to be in a relationship with me. So we essentially decided to just be friends, though it wasn't as if we were entirely on the same page about it.


By chance, I landed an internship in the city she lives in, so I've been hanging out with her in person a good deal. It's still exactly like we were when we were pseudo-together, except we just don't have sex. 


So, that was all background, I guess. Here's where the problem comes in:


**I am still not over her. Not one bit.**


I think when we started sleeping together, I imagined that she actually liked me because I wanted it to be true, and over the course of our time together, sort of forgot that I made it all up to begin with. I think she'd probably shy away from saying this to my face, but it's entirely believable that she simply just wanted to have sex with me and did not know how to communicate that that was *all* she wanted. And at the same time, I'm aware that I'm over-analyzing the entire thing to such a degree that anything I say about it might as well be meaningless.


I recognize that the standard advice for ""getting over"" someone is to avoid them and go do something else with your life. Obviously, my situation makes that process a bit more challenging. While she evidently did not want to date me, she still apparently enjoys my friendship to such an extent that I would feel like an asshole if I just disappeared from her life.


But it's also pretty hard on me, since dealing with her just makes me flip back into this pathetic mode where I keep entertaining thoughts/fantasies of us rekindling the kind of thing we had and/or having a real relationship. I have no idea how she feels now. I look back on a lot of what she told me, and a lot of it *could* be interpreted as ""I'm not ready to be in a relationship right now"" kind of stuff, which gives some hope that she might, at some point in the future, be ready. But I also know that, realistically, she is not interested and probably never will be. I should really just be happy that I got to sleep with her for as long as I did, since I really didn't even deserve that much. Being with her is fun, too; she's a fun person to talk to and be around, but I can't help feeling like my inability to get over my feelings for her isn't going to get better.


So, what do I do? Do I talk to her about this? If so, how? What on earth do I say? She obviously knows that at one point, I wanted us to be in a relationship, but it's never directly come up since. Basically, how do I get over this girl without hurting her for no reason other than her lack of interest in me?


---   


**tl;dr**: hooked up with a girl for a long time, she did not reciprocate my interest in a relationship but insisted that we stay friends. now we're friends and i'm still not over her. what do i do?"

(MF, MMMMMMF, FF, FFFF, MMF, animals, relatives, trees)",[deleted],Erotica,https://www.reddit.com/r/Erotica/comments/2d8gwp/what_do_you_guys_think_of_this_outline_for_a_mary/,"EDIT: SEE LINK at end of post for a MUCH better formatted version.


Origins of a slut:

-Mary Jane (MJ) Watson recounts her youth. 


-MJ’s mom kicked her out of the house at age 18, when MJ’s parents came home and caught her being spit-roasted by Harry Osborn and Flash Thompson. 


-MJ gets a job on soap opera as an actress.


-MJ moves in with Peter and they start dating


-MJ meets Jonah Jameson and Robbie Roberts at Peter’s work social. When Peter slips out to fight with the Green Goblin, MJ flirts with his coworkers and ends up having sex with Jonah.


-Harry Osborn sends MJ a dick pic while she’s on a date with Peter. MJ gets horny and starts to ignore Peter. She excuses herself to the bathroom where she fingers herself in one of the stalls while admiring the picture of Harry’s dick. MJ feigns sickness and leaves the date, secretly planning to go see Harry Osborne. Peter gets suspicious and follows her as Spider-Man. He confronts her at a crosswalk but the Green Goblin appears on his glider before MJ can say anything. Spider-Man and Goblin fight, until the Goblin injures Spidey. Then he swoops in and grabs MJ as a hostage. The Green Goblin takes her to his lair and ties her up. He tells MJ he will. fuck her until she tells him who Spider-Man is. She says nothing, so Norman fingers her wet pussy and then rams his thick cock into her. The Goblin keeps pounding away at her snatch for over twenty minutes and she climaxes harder than she ever has with Peter. The Goblin cackles and sticks a finger in MJ’s asshole. She gasps with pleasure. He fits three fingers in MJ’s asshole, then he shifts his position and starts licking her ass too. The Green Goblin’s tongue feels amazing and she climaxes again as he explores her anal cavity. MJ moans like a cheap whore as she tells the Goblin how great of a lover he is. The Green Goblin pushes MJ on all fours and bends her over, grabbing her by the hair. Then he pauses to line up his cock with her asshole. MJ anticipates his cock and grinds against him, craving its fullness in her tight asshole. He teases her further by sticking his cock inside her and slowly pulling it in and out. Then he pulls his cock out completely. He tells MJ that he doesn’t want to fuck her anymore. MJ begs him to rail her asshole, she promises to do anything. The Green Goblin stick his dick back into her and says “Who is Spider-Man? tell me or I’ll stop fucking you.” The Goblin starts pumping her with his pole again, slowly at first. MJ screams out Spider-Man’s identity and tells the Green Goblin that he has to get her off now. Then MJ, turns around and pushes the Green Goblin to the floor. Instead of running away, she squats over top of him and guides his still-erect cock into her asshole. MJ lowers her round buns until they completely cover the Green Goblin’s shaft. She bucks her hips and rides up and down the Goblin’s meaty shaft like its public transportation. After 40 minutes of MJ aggressively riding the Goblin, his goblin serum finally faded and he had to cum. MJ kept riding the Goblin’s cock even as the first large spurts of semen entered her hungry asshole. The warm man gravy shot out of the Goblin’s cock like a fire extinguisher spray and completely plastered the walls of her rectum. MJ climaxed for the third time in a row, which was more than she had ever done with Peter. Sweet lady cream dripped out of MJ’s cunt and covered her thighs and the Goblin’s crotch. MJ milks the Green Goblin’s cock a few more times with her ass then she rises up off of him. Instead of standing up, she gets on her knees and starts cleaning her own anal cream from his cock. +++ 

 


-MJ is watching TV when she gets horny and starts masturbating when she sees Venom’s huge tongue on the news report. She imagines Venom eating her pussy and sliding his cock into her. Then Peter comes by to visit MJ. She plans to break up with him, until he reveals that he is Spider Man. MJ asks if that means she would be a target for his enemies. Peter says yes, and MJ says she’s fine with the consequences. A few nights later, Venom abducts MJ in the middle of the night. She bets that she can outfuck him. Venom accepts her challenge and MJ happily fucks the alien symbiote. They go at each other for hours, until Spider Man arrives. Mary Jane sees him first and warns Venom. She helps Venom to escape and tells him to visit her soon. 




-MJ is tired of acting and wants to try a career change. Mary Jane blows a casting director while being eaten out by his young female intern in an attempt to get her first modeling gig. The casting director tells her she didn’t get the part because he has to give it to his niece (the intern). The casting director adds that she would be better off doing porn anyway, and mentions that’s how his niece got established. He says this while his niece is licking his balls clean. MJ thinks he’s got a point and takes his card to set up her first scene, then she heads home to husband Peter. Peter hasn’t eaten anything, but Mary Jane says she is too tired too cook for him.




-A week later, MJ sneaks out to visit Doc Ock who she has been cheating on Peter with. Otto fucks her with his tentacles, making her scream out in ecstasy. After she orgasms, MJ tells Ock about her plan to start doing porn while playfully licking his cock. Otto makes a joke about Spider Man but MJ is too busy sucking on his cock to hear it. She finishes off his cock and gives him a kiss. Then she makes him a large breakfast before finally putting on her clothes and heading home.



-MJ is confronted at home by Black Cat, who followed her home from Doc Ock’s lab. MJ begs her not to tell Peter. Black Cat agrees on one condition; she be allowed to eat out Mary Jane. MJ eagerly agrees and Black Cat tongues her on the couch. After her twat is cleaned, MJ eats out Black Cat’s pussy. After multiple orgasms Black Cat and MJ take a break. Black Cat comments that MJ is a better pussy licker than Gwen Stacy ever was.  





-Kingpin secretly arranges to hire Mary Jane for a big budget porno. When she gets to the set for her first shoot, Kingpin appears and reveals that he has tricked Peter into thinking MJ is going on a two month long vacation. Instead she will be fucking the entire Sinister Six on camera. The villains are surprised when instead of resisting, she surprises them all by being an eager slut for their cocks and she gets gangbanged on film by Green Goblin, Kraven, Vulture, Kingpin, Lizard, and Mysterio. After a week of fucking each member of the Sinister Six multiple times, MJ is extremely satisfied and exhausted. The Sinister Six decide to give her a break and put together the best footage for their video. While MJ is sleeping, Lizard sneaks back into the room and carries her away.




-Following her first ever gangbang scene, MJ is kidnapped and taken to the NYC sewers by the Lizard. He reveals his plan to breed her and build a lizard army to take over New York. MJ takes this as a compliment and happily lets the Lizard attempt to impregnate her. They have rough sex for a few weeks straight and MJ has taken gallons of sticky lizard cum. Her belly has begun to look pregnant. The lizard explains that the eggs have an accelerated growth period, and will be full grown adult lizards a few months after hatching. A few days later MJ finally lays the Lizard’s eggs. He tries to kick her out now that she’s served her purpose, but MJ wants to stay and make more lizard babies for him. He tells her that he needs to ensure the eggs hatch and that her sluttiness is too much of a distraction. He carries her out of the sewer and leaves her in an alley way. She checks a newspaper and realizes she has been gone for almost two months.




-MJ settles back in at home, but is still extra horny from her reptilian romp. She constantly asks Peter about the Lizard and whether he has been found. While Peter is fighting crime, MJ convinces the Black Cat to shoot a porno with her. Black Cat agrees and the two girls french kiss, eat each other out, and share a double ended dildo. MJ adds the video to her website, which already includes a few solo scenes. Later that night, she receives a call from the Green Goblin who tells her they won’t air the gangbang tape as long as MJ fucks them whenever they call her. MJ agrees, saying that she would have done that anyway. Then she tells the Green Goblin how much she misses his cock and how she wants it deep inside of her. He tells her he’ll be right over, and she adds that he had better bring a copy of the gangbang to watch together. She then calls Peter and tells him that she will be extra busy at work for the next few months. After hanging up, she sets up a camera and starts fingering herself while waiting for the Green Goblin to arrive.




-Luke Cage takes Peter and MJ out to a Snoop Dogg/Ice Cube concert. Peter has to leave to meet with the Avengers, but Cage and MJ stay. When the concert ends, Cage tells MJ he has a VIP pass and they get to meet Snoop Dogg and Ice Cube. They meet Snoop and Ice and they all smoke weed together. MJ feels amazingly comfortable and just wants to suck on a big black cock. She eyes up the three men, and then reaches for Snoop’s crotch. Snoop just leans back and chills. MJ takes out Snoop’s cock and starts to suck on it. Then she tells the other boys to hurry up and join the fun. Luke and Ice Cube don’t want to get left out so they hurriedly remove their pants. MJ gets up from Snoop’s cock and does a little strip tease for the boys as the jerk off. She removes her clothes until she’s wearing nothing but her boots. Then she squats down on the ground and takes Luke and Ice Cube’s hard cocks in each hand. MJ jerked their cocks, while sucking on Snoop Dogg’s cock in front of her. Every few minutes she would switch to sucking a different cock. Snoop makes a joke about MJ smoking dick like Snoop smokes weed. After a few more times around the cock carousel, MJ is pulled up by Ice Cube. He lies down on the ground and pulls her on top. MJ positions herself on Ice Cube’s cock and starts bouncing up and down on it like she’s in a low rider. Snoop kneels  behind MJ and slides his own erect cock into her tight asshole. MJ yelps in surprise at first, but then eagerly pushes her hips against the cock to help ease it in. Luke Cage is still standing up jerking his cock as his superhero friend’s wife is being double penetrated by two hip hop superstars. Cage decides that what Peter doesn’t know won’t hurt him, and then he stands in front of MJ and jerks his dick in front of her. MJ doesn’t even need any instruction, she had her lips around Luke’s cock as soon as it was in range of her. MJ gave Cage the type of head that would make Jenna Jameson blush. If Peter was getting this, he was one lucky guy. MJ choked herself on the big black meat in front of her as saliva dripped out of her mouth and onto her cheeks. She wasn’t really “choking” but she thought the sounds were sexy. MJ could easily take a hard 12 inch piece of meat all the way to the hilt, balls included, without making a sound ...all while being fucked by two more big black dicks! Luke was in awe of her dick-juggling abilities and was struggling not to fill her mouth up with his own african sperm. He wasn’t going to last much longer if she kept it up. Ice Cube came first, he thrust his dick deep into her pussy and covered her insides with his spunk. MJ rolled her eyes in satisfaction as she felt the cum splashing around her insides. She wondered if she would get pregnant with all the baby batter coating her inner walls. Snoop almost immediately after, and also finished by bottoming out on MJs hole. His creamy goo filled her sphincter to the brim. As he removed his cock from her ass, a dribble of cum leaked out. Last was Luke Cage. His superhuman endurance had helped him to not blow his load. But now MJ was doubling her efforts, she was hungry for Luke’s nut butter. MJ let Luke’s hard cock pop out of her mouth and then she gripped it with her hands. She pumped his cock with both her hands, starting off slowly but getting faster. Luke came when after a building up some speed, MJ wrapped her tongue around his cock again. Luke’s giant balls had coated MJ’s entire face and she was still cleaning it off. She wiped the cum off of her face, then licked it off her hands. Luke takes her home and drops her off. MJ decides to show Luke the web site and he buys a membership. She offers him free lifetime membership if he shoots a video with her. Cage happily agrees and MJ sets up a camera.

2d8plb,11,2014-08-11,"My [23F] SO [24M] doesn't want to do long distance, but now that I've moved nothing has changed, duration 1.5 years.",facingthewinter,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2d8plb/my_23f_so_24m_doesnt_want_to_do_long_distance_but/,"My boyfriend and I have been together since last March, but only officially since last September. Since March, we haven't fought about anything, we enjoy the same activities, same movies, same tv shows, we're both involved with each others families. I love him so much, he's my best friend and we always have so much fun together. Being with him has always felt so natural and easy and just, right. We both just graduated from the same school in the same degree, but only I had found a job before we graduated - and that's where the problem arises.

Back in April we had the big talk of ""what do we do when I move 12 hours away?"" and he couldn't give me an answer. He's had 2 bad LDRs, one of which ended with him being cheated on, and so he was hesitant to say either way, I on the other hand did LD for 4 years with my last bf and then stayed together for another year after the distance was resolved, so I'd say I'm pretty experienced with LDRs going right. This resulted in some tense times, because every action made me think ""is this going to make him want to stay or make him want to leave?"" and so we had the talk again.

He said it was better to assume we wouldn't stay together so that I would be hoping for the best instead of waiting for the worst. He says that he just doesn't see long distance going well for him since he is already under a lot of pressure looking for a job. His family wants him to take any job he can get, but we have the kind of degree where you can be picky and get the job you want. He's interning 3 days a week right now to get more experience before applying for jobs in the fall, and all his parents seem to care about is that it's an unpaid internship.

Anyways, I accepted this, but was obviously upset and still hoping for the best. I went away to travel Europe for 4 weeks and we did really well as far as communication went. We scheduled times to Skype and texted when I could, which ended up being a lot more frequently than I'd thought. Of course this got my hopes up even more.. If this is how well we do without being able to talk whenever we want then it could only get better when we're in the same time zone and country.

I bring this up a few weeks after the trip, if we're still breaking up and he says ""well I thought that was still the plan"". I bring up all my points and he says ""I know that long distance would be easiest with you, but if we stay together I'm going to spend my time wondering what you're doing and feeling unmotivated when I have to be focusing on finding a job."" It's still a real possibility that he could get a job where I work, and he said that if he does then he wants to be with me again when he gets up there.

He drove me up to my new job and spent a week here helping me move in. We hung out a lot with our friends, several who have offered to take his resume and I really think there's a high probability that he will end up with a job here come January. 

I drove him to the airport yesterday, and he kept saying ""we'll see each other soon"" (I'm going back home for a weekend in October) and since then we've still been texting all the time, saying 'I love you' when we get off the phone. I just don't get it, we're basically in a LDR without any commitment. I told him I wouldn't be seeing anyone else, but he said that would just make him feel pressured and would make it harder for him. Meanwhile, he said he wasn't going to be seeing anyone else. I asked him, ""if we're talking the same we always have and our feelings are still there, how should we act when I see you in October?"" and all he could say is ""you're reading too much into this"" and that he couldn't tell me how it's going to be. 

I'm so confused. I know he loves me, I know he wants to be up here with me and working here. I know he wants to talk a lot and keep up our feelings while we're apart so that we can pick up where we left off if/when he gets up here. At the same time, he can't give me any answers about the future, and I know it's because he doesn't exactly have them because it's all hypothetical. How do I make any sense out of this?

**tl;dr:** I've moved out of state and away from my BF. He says he doesn't want to do a long distance relationship, but now that we're apart we're still talking the same amount and saying 'I love you' and looking forward to seeing each other in 2 months. How do I make sense of this?

2d8vq0,2,2014-08-11,"Me [26 F] dumped by my bf [27 M] of a year, long distance relationship ended because I was too needy. Having a LOT of trouble moving on.",mycrowbiologist,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2d8vq0/me_26_f_dumped_by_my_bf_27_m_of_a_year_long/,"We met online and then in person and dated for about a year and it was great while it lasted. At that point he was on the West coast and I was on the East coast and even with the distance, things seemed good, and we tried to make time for each other. 

Then he moved to another continent for a short internship and assured me everything would be ok and we would get through it, but things changed as soon as he moved. He stopped calling and got annoyed when I tried calling him and made excuses about work.

 I tried to be as considerate as I could about the times I called him making sure he wasn't at work, but I guess I was more emotional that I initially thought. There were particular occasions when I tried to get in touch with him more that I should have, but only because I felt completely left out of his life. Anyway, he broke up with me over the phone and decided we should never talk again. 

It's been over 7 months and I can't get him out of my head. I am usually a quite sane person, but I am beginning to wonder if I am crazy. I should add that it was my first relationship, maybe that's why the scars are deep. I have gone on dates since but I can't seem of think of anyone other than him and he doesn't even want to talk to me, so I just feel like a wreck all the time. What should I do? 

I should probably also add that we are both graduate students, and his equation with is advisor wasn't the best, so that was something that put pressure on him, but in my opinion he took things his advisor said way too seriously.

**tl;dr**: Long distance relationship ended sort of without closure and having trouble moving on!"
2d936c,2,2014-08-11,"Me [29M] with my long-distance fiance [33F] (been together for over 3 years), discussing calling it off",engagementissues,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2d936c/me_29m_with_my_longdistance_fiance_33f_been/,"My fiance and I have been dating since early 2011. Our entire relationship has been long distance (the longest continuous period of time we've spent together was 2 weeks). By long distance, I mean we've lived in different states the whole time, and airplane is the only reasonable mode of transportation between us. In the beginning, the distance was fine because it forced communication, but it's become a huge burden.

I've made mistakes. I've never physically cheated on her, but I emotionally cheated on her 8 or 9 months into the relationship. I just got too close to someone else, tried to hide it, and she found out about it. Since then, she's understandably had some serious trust issues. I take full responsibility for this. It kinda came to a head a little over a year into our relationship, and we broke up for several months but then reconnected and got back together. She was with another guy during that time, but I wasn't with anyone (I was talking to a few girls - internet dating - but I never met them).

I'm a grad student (Ph.D.). When we first started dating, she was wrapping up her Ph.D., but I was only about halfway through. 1.5 years into our relationship, I got a summer internship in a new state. During this time, she was looking for a postdoc near my school, which we were both really excited about. During my internship, she accepted a postdoc just a few hours from me. My summer internship ended up getting extended pretty much indefinitely (i.e., until I graduate). So: she moved to get near me, only for me to end up living even further away. This caused (understandable) resentment on her part.

Despite this, things seemed to be getting better for a while. When we're together, things are generally great. We have so much in common and just really enjoy each other's company. But when we're apart (sometimes, literally hours after being dropped off at the airport), fighting picks up. The problem is that we're only together a handful of weekends each year.

We got engaged last year and have been engaged for a little over a year now. We haven't set a date yet because I haven't set my thesis defense date yet, but I should be defending this fall. I've made it fairly clear that I don't want a long distance marriage and that I don't want to plan a wedding without living together. Not setting a date has put a lot of stress on the relationship. Another stress is the fact that she'll be 34 in just a few months. She feels her biological clock ticking, and while I don't currently want kids, she still has mixed feelings. So she (again, understandably) feels like this is getting dragged on. A Ph.D. can be unpredictable.

Things have been up and down, but they've been much more down than up over the last 4-6 months. In early June, we decided to take a break (that is, she hasn't been wearing her ring, and we haven't been talking much). I haven't been on any dates, but I don't know if she has. A week or two ago, she said she had a date planned for the weekend, but I haven't asked about it.

We have barely been talking the last few weeks. She's up for renewing her postdoc contract and lease, and we're trying to figure out what to do. I've come to really love my work here, and I've been offered a postdoc that I'd like to accept. Last night, we discussed our situation for the first time in probably 3 weeks, and she's basically wanting to know what to do.

The problem is that during this break, I've been happier overall. Not happier because we haven't been talking, but happier because we haven't been fighting. She seems to mostly feel the same way. I honestly don't know what to do. Our relationship right now is clearly unhealthy. It's affected my work ethic, and I know it's affected her's as well. Neither of us are clinically depressed, but the fighting has definitely had us both feeling really depressed at points.

For a long long time, I've felt that if we could just live together, most of the issues will work themselves out. But now, both she and I are worried that this just isn't capable of working. I love her more than anyone else I've ever loved, but right now, I feel emotionally disconnected, and I know she feels the same way.

Any and all advice is appreciated.

**tl;dr**: We are a long-distance engaged couple that's been fighting for far too long, and we're looking at calling it off. What should we do?"
2d95gr,2,2014-08-11,The family business can't seem to get off the ground and it's slowly dragging us down.,mysuitisblack____not,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2d95gr/the_family_business_cant_seem_to_get_off_the/,"Hello reddit. I'm a long time lurker but I finally convinced myself to ask the internet for some advice. 

I'm 18 and I just graduated high school. My father has been working on a mostly pre-revenue startup for about two years since he lost his job. He's in his 60s and he has thrown pretty much every single egg into this one basket because he says no one will hire someone over 65. He has a background in engineering but has mostly been a project manager for the past decade. 

We weren't rich when he was working but I would probably describe us as upper middle class. He had enough money put away to try to run a business (without much revenue) with about 4 people all unpaid (very low budget) and support our family for two years. I respect my father and he's smart but now I'm working a private equity firm and I've seen what successful businesses have and the company he has started has a lot of red flags that instantly take it out of contention for any investment from the firm I work for and many others like it. I put in a fair amount of time working on the startup's software and we continue to make a better product but our sales team is lacking and we're at a point where we've (not that I was involved in the decision) spent pretty much all the cash we have to spend. I'm caught in this weird position where I want him to succeed and that's really the only hope to not have to let him scrape by with social security checks. I'll be leaving for college in six months and luckily college is paid for by some very generous financial aid and scholarships but I don't know what to do about my parents, their finances and my future. 

We are down sizing and are going to sell off smaller assets like a trailer and some hobby equipment that's probably worth around $10k. We are trying to generally spend less but I'm met with a general apathy towards making a hard budget or even discussing the situation. I have asked my dad to take me through our expenses (maybe I haven't pressured him enough) but I still don't know what we spend.  


**Assets** (From What I Know):

$1.2M Home value after paying off remaining balance. (we live there)

$150-200K Condo value. (Needs repairs before sale or rent ~$50k)

$22.5K 3 Cars (We will sell one when I leave for college in 6 months)

Retirement? I think we've spent most of it...


**Expenses** (I honestly don't know. I've heard $150k /year tossed around and that sounds about right):
$3k/month medical insurance and bills

$500/month property tax

$200/month Car Insurance

Food?

Electricity?

Water?

Gas?


**Income**

$1.5k/month Programming &amp; Private Equity Internship

$1k/month Mother's dog sitting. 


Should we try to get a loan to fix up the condo to rent it? It would probably net about $2k a month after we take out the mortgage that it has. How do I confront my parents and tell them pretending nothing is wrong and taking small, inconsistent steps won't work? How should I evaluate whether I/we should keep trying to build the business? Any advice for helping find my dad a job as a 65 year old? How will this situation affect my credit? I'm not really sure what I should do because I know I'll be fine I'm going to a great school and I've got plenty of opportunity ahead of me but I would feel guilty just letting my parents figure it out on their own even though they kind of got themselves into this. 

Thanks for taking the time to read through this. I hope it didn't come off as complaining or off topic. I am willing to work and take all the advice I can get from the finance and life advice perspective.

I knew her well, as she was probably the best intern I ever had. This particular service was especially heartbreaking, since not a soul knew if Lisa was actually still alive. No body, no note, no trace. Not even a good reason to run away.

Her parents were wearing their Sunday best, faded and 20 years out of style. Her older brothers were wearing the same faces they had when they heard she was gone. Nieces and nephews were solemn, though I'm sure they were too young to remember her. Some of her old friends even managed to show up, smiling when greeting her family, but all of them were shaking in the middle of an Atlantan summer.
There were countless photos of Lisa with a cheery smile and reddish-brown, curly hair tossed in her face, surrounded by wreaths that didn't look like much, but were clearly made by hand.

When they prayed and begged for at least some closure, there wasn't a dry eye in the church. To me, there's no sadder sight than a father so distraught that all he can do is lean on his wife's shoulder for an entire afternoon.

Maybe I felt that way just because I already had closure, if you know what I mean.

I just graduated this past May with a bachelors in accounting, and started a Summer internship with a non-accounting firm I interned with last Summer as well, which ends this Friday.  Throughout college I interviewed here and there for audit/tax positions that I wasn't interested in whatsoever, but needed something proactive to do.  

In my very last semester, I took an Accounting Information Systems class and really enjoyed it, and am now looking for positions in IT Risk Assurance.  I was also an info. systems minor, so it suits my interests and skills really well.  The problem is that I didn't figure it out until the recruiting season for big4 and large regional firms had come and gone.

After doing some research, almost all of these firms hire entry-level IT Risk Assurance employees exclusively through campus recruiting, with the exception of one of two experienced hires.  I went to school in Maryland, but now live in CT, which would make getting to an interview down there really expensive and difficult to work out logistically.  I'm really not sure what to do, because when I try to apply as an experienced hire, I keep getting told they're looking for people with more 1-2 years of related experience (for their entry-level position... awesome).  I really don't know how to proceed; it feels like I missed the boat.  I'm starting to prepare for the CISA exam now to see if that will improve my prospects, but have no other plans as of now.

TL;DR:  As a recent accounting/info. systems graduate with no accounting experience, how do I get a job in risk assurance?"
2d9s3t,3,2014-08-11,All I wanted was to go to college.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2d9s3t/all_i_wanted_was_to_go_to_college/,"I came to U.S. when I was ten years old. I was born in a foreign country and immigrated to America because my parents wanted to start fresh and provide better education for my sister and me.
Although I spent the first decade of my childhood in a foreign country, I spent the rest of my life in U.S. and will continue to live here.
Because I was the only one in my family who knew how to read/speak/write English, I was given the responsibility of translating almost all the mails, emails, phone calls, documents, etc.
Adjusting to this sudden new life was difficult at first but I adapted quickly. I had to. My parents came home late at night every day, exhausted, tired, but they would always smile and told me that life is still good and there's nothing to worry about.
I should have known earlier that life wasn't so alright after all.
I went to elementary school, middle school, and went to high school. I studied hard and was overall an excellent student.
However, life began to get shitty when I turned junior in high school.

First, there was the fraud incident. My parents decided that it was time to apply for the permanent residency (a.k.a. ""Green Card"") They contacted one of the attorneys and paid him handsome amount of money to get us the green card.
Couple months later, that attorney disappeared with the money from not only my parents but also from several other desperate and hard-working families.
Then came the college application process. I applied to many colleges, just like any other ordinary American high school seniors would do. I had to apply as an international student because I wasn't U.S. citizen nor U.S. permanent resident even although I had lived eight years on U.S. soil.
That wasn't the bad part. The bad news was the tuition. Most of the honors programs, internships that my teachers personally recommended to, and scholarships that I could have surely received or accepted into were for.. guess what.. US citizens or permanent residents.
There were other scholarships for international students. But none were enough to pay for the crazy expensive tuition for my dream schools.
Although I got accepted to good universities, there was absolutely no way that I could afford the out-of-state/ international student tuition. I had to pick a much affordable option which was a state university. Don't get me wrong. They are awesome institutions but they weren't my ""dream schools"".

It was time for me to get a new visa, F-1 status (student status) because I am going to attend college in U.S. Okay. Everything seemed to be all good. Until today.
I got really worried about the fact that I haven't heard anything from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service for a while. So when I called them, they said I still had 30 days left on my status which is still pending.
I called my school and asked them what I can do about this situation but only thing I got was this: If I don't get my new visa status on time, before the first day of my college (September 1st) I have to withdraw my admission status. Today is already August 11th. There is no way I'm going to receive it on time.
What that means is that I can't go to college.
I can't go to college.
I worked so damn hard and my parents worked twice as hard for the last eight years.
I have never felt such a sorrow like this before. I am devastated and lost.
What do you do when you're so sad that you can't even cry?

I've considered joining the military to at least try to get the permanent residency. My parents seriously considered getting divorced, marry a US citizen just so that my sister and I, as dependents, could get the citizenship along with them. And I also seriously considered marrying a US citizen right after high school graduation.

I understand that acquiring US citizenship or permanent residency is extremely difficult, especially after 9/11 attack and other various foreign conflicts. Of course granting a foreigner such a status must be taken into careful evaluation. 
However, what I do believe is that if that person is worth anything valuable to this country's future, such as students with great potential, specialized workers, etc. I think the government should at least expedite the process.
I took the US citizenship test for shits and giggles with my friends. I received a perfect score. 
People who are born as citizens don't fully appreciate (at least as much as those who would go so far to become one) what awesome privileges and rights they get to have and enjoy since the moment of their birth to their last day on Earth. And that pisses me off.
I wish they could cherish their status more than just take it for granted. Get to know your rights, get to understand how your government works, study the history of your own country.

I know I should not complain much about my life. 
Hell, there are people who can't afford to live in a house with a roof, people who can't get any education at all, and some of my undocumented (illegal) immigrant friends are living in fear every day that U.S. government would show up on their doorsteps and deport them. 
But that's like saying ""You can't be happy because other people are fucking miserable."" 
As a human being I have a right to be happy. I have a right to receive education. 
""Not going to college is not the end of the world,"" you may say. But it means everything to me. 
It means that all my hard work for eight years have finally paid off in a form of higher education. 
It means that I will make my parents proud because I'm the first to go to college in my family. 
It means that my younger sister will have someone to proudly look up to. 
It means that I will be happy. 
But above all, it means that American Dream is true, real, tangible, and it can be achieved."

A bunch of my other best friends were back for a  short period of time as well, so we all decided to get some Phillies tickets and tailgate. We get to the tailgating area and decide to set up. We brought a bunch of beer (obviously), some weed for dabs, and had a small portable table for various, drinking games. I had caught wind that our friend Brianna was going to bring a friend of hers that she studied abroad with. I had done a small bit of recon and it turns out she was a hot girl. I'd say an HB8 (she had these beautiful yellow/green eyes). Anyway like I said we set up and got to drinking and throwing a football around. This goes on for about ten to fifteen minutes and Brianna and her hot friend shows up. When I saw this girl I told myself, ""You are going to talk to her and not be a pussy and get all awkward like you always do. You are a good looking dude and is going to think you are totally awesome."" We all introduce ourselves and I always like to make some sort of impression and told her to just remember me as ""Black Austin"" (Brianna has another friend who used that name to remember me by) She laughs and says that Brianna had already told her about me which I thought was a good start. A little later four of my friends started playing a game of pong so I nudged her and said, ""Hey play some pong with me my friends are all lame and paired up without me,"" which afterwards sounded a little lame, but I feel like I was convincing and charming because she agreed. She made a comment about how she is inconsistent when it comes to pong and I laughed said that I was the same way with pong. We got our asses kicked in pong which was fine because then I started talking to her and getting to know her. 
    I asked her about school and what she wants to do and found out that she is an actress. She did theatre in college and was trying to break into tv, film, and modeling. Interestingly enough I am also trying to break into modeling so we talked about that for a little and eventually Brianna called her over to drink a beer or something (I forget) so I started to put music on and sort of DJ the tailgate, periodically joining in on her conversation with Brianna and making them both laugh. At some point a little later I spot like 6-7 girls tailgating behind us. I have excellent peripheral vision and it turned out that there were some hot girls in this group. So I lean over to my friend Kent and whisper how there are some cute girls behind us ""enough to go around"" I said jokingly. He smiled and made an excuse about how they look too young (which they weren't) or how he ""doesn't have the balls."" I realized I wasn't going to convince him to go walk over there so I start telling my friends about these girls behind us. Of course none of them wanted to take action so I got a little upset that the guys I call my best friends were too scared to talk to a few girls and were being crap wingmen. I figured the clock was ticking and some other douche bags were going to approach these girls and our chances would be over. I also did not want to feel like I was competing for the same girl because Brianna was off limits for reasons that are complicated (although she is a cute girl). I then decided I was going to go over there by myself, fuck it. If they reject me then whatever, I can still talk to Kelly (hot actress friend) and make her laugh some more. 
    
   As I began to walk over, I'm like half way there give or take, my friend Kent smiled and asked, ""What are you doing dude?"" To which I give a devilish smile and reply,"" I'm going to talk to some girls man,"" and gave him a judgmental finger point. I got a little nervous as I walked over, but I immediately shut that out and fixed my posture. I walked up to the hottest one who was a short blonde with beautiful blue eyes and asked her, ""Do you guys wanna play some extreme flip cup?"" Then one of them asked, ""What is extreme flip cup? What makes it extreme?"" I smiled and said, ""I don't know, I just found out about this game like 2 minutes ago."" So one of the girls asks, ""What are the rules?"" I laughed and said, ""I have no idea, come over and find out,"" and turned away and started walking back to my friends. I peeked over my shoulder and they were following me! I was completely surprised that worked. I felt like the coolest dude in front of my friends. They were so confused and happy all at once. I walked up to Kent again and said, these girls are going to play extreme flip cup with us. He said, ""What!""and I said, ""Yeah man,"" while laughing. So we all introduced ourselves and get to talking. I asked if they were in college and they said they had all just graduated which was the same case for my friends and I. I tried getting my friend Kent over with me yet again to talk to these girls with me because he interned on a movie that had come up and I was trying to talk him up to one of the girls. He was lame and kind of left. 
  
   I ended up having three of the girls surrounding me asking me all kinds of questions. They asked me about my hair ( I have long curly hair down to my shoulders), what race I was (mixed Black/Cherokee, Puerto Rican) my siblings, and a buch of other questions. It  was so strange to me. I had never really had attention like this from women. I was always way too chicken shit to approach a girl I thought was attractive. But here I am going up to a gang of girls and talking to them by myself! So anyway they asked if we were going into the stadium and I said, ""yeah we are, what about you?"" and they said they had standing room tickets and I said, ""cool so do we, we should meet up again."" I exchanged numbers with the lesser attractive one like an idiot though haha and didn't get the number from the hot mixed Korean girl. About thirty minutes into the game I texted the girl to see where they were at and she didn't reply. I wasn't even upset though because I looked really cool in front of my guy friends. I know because they were all saying how crazy it was that I brought seven  over. It was awesome and a huge confidence booster for me because I've had self esteem issues my whole life. It was crazy to me that I got all that attention just because I went over by myself to talk to the girls. "
2daalh,2,2014-08-11,Me [22F] with my live-in boyfriend[24 M] of a year and a half...is he not doing enough or am I controlling?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2daalh/me_22f_with_my_livein_boyfriend24_m_of_a_year_and/,"My boyfriend is great.  Really. He's  sweet, smart, creative, and a hard worker.  He's the best guy in his whole family, honestly. We clash over some standard stressful things like money, chores, work, etc., but we always end up comforting each other and helping each other. 

Let me say now that I know I have a high standard of cleanliness. Just for examples: 

- I put dishes straight into the dishwasher. No food or dishes are left on the counter or in the sink for more than 15 minutes after it is prepared or eaten. 

- I do laundry once a week. 

- I vacuum once a week. 

- I do a deep clean of my home at least once a month.

- All clothes/shoes/books/games/whatever was used that day are put away before I go to bed. 

- Everything is organized and clean. 

- I sweep the hard floors a couple of times a week and mop once a week. 

I just like living in a clean home.  I feel grimy and unpleasant if something is dirty. 

My boyfriend, on the other hand, is not as clean. I'm not saying he's messy or anything, but in comparison to me, he isn't as clean. I find myself emotionally exhausted and irritated with him fairly often lately because if he sees a mess, he doesn't do anything about it.  

Our relationship is not balanced atm.  He's a student (but not in classes currently. Fall semester starts in a month) and he works about 15-20 hrs a week. He also does creative writing for an unpaid internship that he puts several hours into each week as well. 

I, on the other hand, work full time. M-F 8-5.  By the end of the day, I am exhausted and just want to sit in the peace and quiet to unwind. I am very much an introvert and need the quiet and solitude.  Instead, I will come home and find stuff that needs to be done. Nothing huge, but stuff that he could have cleaned. If he does clean something, I firmly believe it is only because I repeatedly remind him throughout the day.  Often times, I see what he's cleaned and have to fix it or redo it for him, for various reasons. 

Here's some examples: 

- He puts stuff in the dishwasher halfhazardly. Our dishwasher is not large, so stuff needs to be put away neatly or else we'd have like 5 things in there. That's a waste of soap, water, and energy.

- Today he said he had laundry to do (usually it falls to me to do our laundry), so I asked him to throw in some of my stuff as well. at 9, 10, 11, and 2 today I texted him ""how's laundry going?"" (it was a single load) and he said fine.  I got home and saw that he had only just put it in the dryer and he asked me to help him fold it when it was done. He didn't have work today and he spent his time reading and writing (for fun.)

- He often leaves random stuff just lying around. Shoes, books, clothes, notebooks, all over the place.  I get home and feel like I am cleaning up after my toddler. 

He says he doesn't want me to feel frustrated or exhausted by him, and I believe he is sincere.  But he has a terrible fucking memory.  I have reminded him at least a dozen times in the past month that the dishes have to be put in the dishwasher neatly or else not much will fit, and that raises our bills.  He never remembers. He just always says ""sorry! I promise I'll remember and do it right next time.""  

I know that in the long run, these things are not huge.  But as he is the one who has a shit ton more free time and days off than I do, I feel he should be taking point on many of the day to day chores around the house.  I honestly feel that, if I did not remind him to do something, he simply would just day dream all his free time away.  It is *NOT* difficult to keep our place tidy - seriously, just 10-20 minutes a day of cleaning up little standard home messes and it would be spotless basically always. 

I'm just frustrated. Please give advice!!!

2daeap,2,2014-08-11,Second Credit Card,[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2daeap/second_credit_card/,"Looking for a little advice about getting a second credit card. I recently, April or May, got a credit card through my moms credit union. They don't do secured ones, they use consigners instead. 

So background:

I've had a credit card for 4-5 months with a limit of $500 with my mom as a cosigner as well as renting an apartment and having electric in my name for 3 months. I also had a paid internship for 11 weeks. I'm not sure if all of that contributes but I figured I'd add it in incase. I'm a full time student also. 

I doubt I'll keep this card forever as it's through my moms credit union and I'm not sure the process to remove the cosigner as of yet. I want to get a second because this card's limit is pretty low, and if I ever do cancel this first one I don't want it to erase years of credit.

I was thinking about getting the Discover It card for students as the second card. Will I be able to get this card? And will a hard pull be bad at this point if I don't get it? Any other advice is welcome as well!

Thanks in advance!"

I've begun to find my niche and how I like to work, but I'm interested to hear how others set their environment up to maximize coding/testing efficiency. 

At work I used a 28' iMac, so I would usually run Sublime in two column mode on 2/3 of the screen, and the inspector on the last 3rd. Then I have the website usually in the background behind those, and if I'm using terminal, that usually runs in the back behind everything too. 

However, when I'm at home, I use my 2011 Macbook Pro and I'll attach my TV via HDMI for a second monitor. In this case, I'll usually run Sublime full screen on my laptop and have the site/inspector on the other screen. 

Am I forgetting anything? How do you set it up when you begin coding?"

2dai0s,2,2014-08-11,My [29/M] girlfriend of 4 months is reluctant to break her [25/F] ties with her ex/best friend,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2dai0s/my_29m_girlfriend_of_4_months_is_reluctant_to/,"I started dating this girl about 4-5 months ago. I've dated a lot of girls over the years (short and long term relationships) and this is the first time I've really felt I've loved a person. We are extremely compatible sexually, have similar interests, career goals, views on life, etc. Basically the full package marriage material for me.

However, there is a HUGE red flag that has been at issue for essentially this entire relationship, and I don't know if the circumstances have poisoned this relationship irreversibly, and I am worried about her emotional maturity as to make her someone that I believe is ready for the type of commitment I am looking for.

So going in chronological order, we began dating in March. At the beginning of our relationship she told me her best friend was a male (We will call him Fred) and told me a number of things about him:

They had been best friends for ~6 years; he had moved with her from the east coast to the west coast approximately 2 years ago; she said he became her best friend by stepping up when her previous best friend died; in passing she had mentioned that Fred had confessed that he had feelings for her (this happened back in January 2014, a few months before we started dating); she said that after his confession, she decided to sleep with him to see if any feelings were there, and decided there wasn't; she said that she remained friends with him and that the two of them hung out regularly and relied on each other for emotional support; he regularly came over to her apartment to hang out and sometimes slept over on weekends (on the couch of course).

Of course, hearing all of this I knew there were red flags all over it and I suspected there was more to the story. I kept silent as to the ""rest of the story"" part, but made it very clear that it was inappropriate for her to have a best male friend who had confessed feelings and previously slept with her coming and sleeping over at her place while she was dating me. I didn't tell her she ""had"" to cut off her friendship with this guy, but I made it very clear that I didn't want to date a girl that maintained such a close relationship with a guy that she has history with. Of course, she protested and maintained that they were platonic but she agreed that him coming over was inappropriate and she would stop and try to turn the relationship into a more ""at arms length"" relationship.

It's probably important to throw in there since it will be relevant later - during the first month we were dating she had a real problem with the fact I texted happy birthday to an ex of mine (7 year relationship that had ended almost 2 years prior to me dating my current girlfriend). This was the only contact that I had with my ex: we would text happy birthday on each's respective birthdays. She said that was a sign that there might be still something between us. ""why would you text happy birthday to your ex?""

Well, as time went on, my suspicions about this guy grew. I knew that if he confessed his feelings then they most certainly still were there and would likely be a source of drama in our relationship if he is sitting there as the third wheel (I've dealt with this in past relationships). I kept expressing this fact in order to slowly nudge my girlfriend into pushing this guy away. She admitted that I was probably right but had a number of excuses for not doing so, such as the fact that ""werely on each other too much for logistical stuff, he doesn't have any other friends, I need to do this slowly so that its not like I'm suddenly pushing him away, etc.""

About two months into the relationship, she said something to me that really gave me the ammo I needed to confront her. When she was talking about some stressful things that were going on in her life I told her that I would be there for her and do whatever she needed to help her deal with her work things - she replied ""that makes me so happy to hear that, Fred would probably be whining if I don't make time for him."" - I knew when she started making relationship comparisons that something else was going on. So I confronted her, and asked her what the real story was with Fred. I told her there was more to it because people don't just compare their boyfriends to their best friends like that. She denied there was anything more to the story, and I started asking her questions about the various things she had told me about her and Fred, and I ended up catching her messing up her dates and what not, such as when she said she slept with him. I could tell there was deception going on (of course I couldn't prove because she used the plausible deniability excuse ""I'm tired, I don't remember exactly when things happened, etc"")

The next night she ended up later confessing that Fred was actually an ex of hers. During the first few months of our relationship she had said some things about her exes in passing (she had been in two other LTRs, and the most recent one was 3 years which had a long distance component where he cheated on her). Turns out Fred was actually the ""recent ex"" she had told me about who cheated on her. I was really pissed upon hearing this, and her reason for not wanting to tell me was because I told her before we even became exclusive that I don't really want to date a girl that maintains friendships with exes. So she didn't think I would give her a chance if I knew about Fred.

When I heard about this - I felt betrayed and deceived and even though she was making this confession - now I felt like I couldn't trust her version of the story and thought that the story might even be worse and she was giving me the trickle truth. So I decided to go over to her place and sat down with her and told her she needed to call up Fred and we were going to talk to him and get the full story from him, BEFORE she can talk to him about it, and see if the stories match up.

She got really nervous about this, and she tried to call him and he didnt answer. I told her to text him, and she said he was in the middle of moving and couldn't talk. She continued to text him while I was sitting there and I got really agitated (I started assuming they were now colluding their stories). I asked her why she was continuing to write back and forth and she said she was trying to explain why I wanted to talk. I asked to see and she refused, claiming that he is saying negative things about me and she doesn't want me to see and dislike him before meeting him. She continued to text him and I asked her repeatedly to see the texts. She gives me a firm ""no"" and I just throw up my hands and said ""this was your last chance to maintain any semblance of trust, now you have nothing because I can only assume now that you are colluding and I'll never know the full truth about the two of you."" 

Right then she admitted that is what she was doing, and told me that she didn't tell me that even after the two of them had broken up, they continued living together on the east coast for a year (because they had a lease arrangement together). She said she thought I would dump her for leaving that part out (which, in my opinion, really wasn't that big of a deal considering everything else going on). Since I thought it was a bullshit cop out, I asked to see her texts, to which she replied she deleted them. Needless to say I was pissed, and I should have dumped her ass right there.

Instead however, the next day I asked to show me her gchat logs with Fred so I could see the truth (she regularly uses gchat and it has saved history for a year+). She reluctantly agrees and I go through and see that basically I was right - without getting too much into detail I knew that they had continued sleeping together up to at least February, they were still telling each other they loved each other and for all intents and purposes still seemed like they were in a relationship. Even though she told him she needed to take a step back from their relationship when she started dating me, she basically maintained that ""she wasn't sure if I was the real deal and if it was going to be serious."" It basically looked like from the chat logs that during the last few years, the two of them had continued sleeping together even while she was going out and dating other men from okcupid (no relationships panned out), and essentially she was keeping him in the ""bullpen"" for ""if/when we get back together."" She was also still asking him to come over and visit her when me and her were dating and after I told her that it was inappropriate for this guy to do that (for reasons which are now extremely obvious). She would talk to him about my relationship with her, the problems we were having, etc - basically he was her emotional tampon and he of course backed her up and took any opportunity to smeer my name in the dirt.

Needless to say I was floored upon seeing this and in my eyes it was borderline cheating. There was no proof that they were continuing to sleep together up to when I started seeing her (or after) - though my common sense says people don't just stop fucking until there is a backup dick to take the place.

Regardless, I ended up forgiving the lying because of everything else she has done in this relationship that demonstrates her devotion to me. I know reddit will jump all over this point, and there is really no reasonable justification other than me taking a leap of faith. But it was closely guarded optimism.

The story doesn't end here though. After this revelation, she agreed she needed to cut him out of her life, and she said basically gave him the ""this is it"" speech. I remained skeptical about it though, and she admitted that she had to still keep in contact with him to facilitate logistical stuff, such as the fact that he was currently taking care of her cats while she is 7 hours away doing an internship, and he was also driving her parents to/from the airport. She also would be seeing him at a mutual friends wedding that (of course) I could not attend. These reasons were legitimate, but I obviously suspected that the conversations would quickly revert back to at least talking about our relationship.

About a couple months after her basically telling him she was cutting ties (the cutting ties occured beginning of June, and the most recent event was last weekend), we got into a fight about unrelated things. A couple days prior I asked if she was continuing contact with Fred, and she told me she would just talk to him about her cats and that he would send her random pictures and jokes. I asked if she ever talked about our relationship, and she said sometimes he brings it up but she tells him they shouldn't be talking about it and reminds him that they are trying to step back. She tells me this while on Skype and I can just tell that I am getting the trickle truth again (don't ask me how I know, I just do). A couple days later we get into a fight about something unrelated and I just get fed up and dump her. After the fighting when shes asking us to stay together I ask her what she told me the other day about the conversations she had with Fred. I tell her that I think she is lying and she admits that she had been going to him for advice about her relationship with me, saying that hes really the only person that really understands her and shes trying to better her relationship with me by getting advice from him.

She admits to me that when we broke up (I decided to give her another chance the next day), Fred confessed that he really wanted her back and couldn't be just friends with her and yadda yadda yadda. I basically tell her that this entire situation is fucked up, and she needs to either choose her friendship with Fred or her relationship with me because I'm not going to involve myself in this 3 way dynamic. I tell her that despite whatever she says about him, her feelings are inextricably intertwined with her past relationship with Fred and the two of them are never going to be ""just friends."" Basically I tell her that she needs to cut him out completely from her life - especially considering the amount of deception that occured regarding him for the entire length of the relationship.

She tells me that she is having a really hard time doing this. Her reasons are: he has no friends and she is worried about his safety (suicide risk), he has no emotional support, he is the only person on the west coast that is her tie to the east coast, there isn't anyone that knows her better than he does, etc. Basically a whole myriad of reasons why she can't just drop him. She also feels shitty for admittedly stringing him along for YEARS while she went and dated other people, including me.

The admits that everything I'm saying is true and she needs to get rid of Fred entirely.

My main concern at this point is what does this say about her emotional maturity in that she cannot say goodbye to this guy who she says is just her best friend now. I feel like she is either incapable of doing it (and will just maintain a friendship in secret), will resent me for pushing her to do this, or she is really still stuck on this guy romantically. She has also expressed great fear that this relationship with me is not ""stable enough"" in order for her to let go of Fred. This sounds like monkey branching, and it just makes it seem like she really is still stuck on this guy romantically.

Also what is a HUGE problem for me is the fact that she allowed this situation to exist, while similarly maintaining that she wouldn't be able to accept me having close female friends, and she said it would really upset her if I replied to one of my exes who had texted me happy birthday yesterday (8/10 was my birthday). She gets extremely jealous/insecure, yet I'm expected to adhere to a pretty strict standard when it comes to my interactions with women. FWIW I agree with the opposite sex friendship boundary, I tend to think that close friendships with opposite sex friends are a bad idea (with some exceptions). I know opinions on this are deeply polarized and I would ask that you guys not comment on this aspect other than the fact that a double standard seems to exist here. I guess its worth mentioning that she recognizes the double standard and hypocrisy and says it shouldn't be like this - but she is having a ""hard time"" absolving this friendship with her ex. And she says she can't handle me being in contact with my exes in ""any form"" or being close friends with women because of her past experiences with her cheating ex.

I just don't know what to think about all of this. Part of me thinks that she really wants this relationship between us to work out and will do whatever it takes, another part of me thinks that despite this she doesn't have the emotional maturity to do so and the timing of our meeting and her being still hung up on Fred when we started dating made this entire relationship doomed from the beginning. Is there something worth salvaging here?

2daivx,36,2014-08-11,Professionals of TwoX: how do you handle having a career and being a mother?,tentacletango,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/2daivx/professionals_of_twox_how_do_you_handle_having_a/,"Hi Ladies,

I'm currently a medical student, and have started seriously looking into my future plans with my SO (also a med student) regarding residency, etc. In doing so, we have also broached the conversation about our opinions on having children. He is 100% positive that he wants to have a family, and would honestly be a fantastic father. I'm less sure about becoming a mother, mostly because I struggle to imagine a time when I will be at a point in my career/life where I can (slash will want to) take time off to be a Mom. In medicine, you're a student until you're an intern until you're a resident until you're a fellow until you're a new attending until you're a senior attending, at which point I'll be a bit old for babies. 

There are, as I see it, three options: 

1. Don't have kids; 
2. Have kids and take a significant amount of time off work (or cut significant work hours); or,
3. Have kids and take a limited amount of time off work (and hire a full time nanny, etc).

None of these options seem satisfying. My current partner would be unhappy with option 1, and although I don't particularly desire ""kids"", I do want to have a Family with my SO. Option 2 seems frankly unreasonable in the profession that I'm pursuing, and furthermore would be completely unfulfilling to me as a goal-driven individual. And finally, option 3, which seems like the shittiest of all - if I DO become a mother, I would like to ""do it right"" and not feel like I was shortchanging my kid. I have had a few friends in school have been raised primarily by nannies, and it just seems like such a cop out on the role of the parents. 

So reddit, what gives? How does one career and mother at the same time?

PS: My SO and I are on the same page as to how we would parent a child and he has voiced his willingness to also cut down on work hours to equally help raise a baby, so neither of those potential problems are concerns of mine. 

TL;DR: Am going to be a doctor, not quite sold on the whole mom thing. Is it possible to do both without shortchanging either career or kid?

EDIT: Some people have taken offense to the fact that I seem to be demonizing working mothers. To those people, I apologize - that certainly was not my intention, although I understand where it was coming from. Here's a comment I made to a poster below on the issue:

&gt;First off, I want to apologize if you (or anyone) thought I was ragging on parents who work. My mom was actually a single mom working full time, and I never felt that I was being let down by her at all. I love my mom, and think she did a fantastic job raising my sister and I. Obviously, the options in original post were intended to be polarizing when compared to each other - there are clearly gradients between all three choices, and working full time does not mean abandoning my children.
&gt;
&gt;That being said, I feel as though there is a difference between the hours she was working (approx. 40 or so hours/week) and the hours that I will be working as an intern/resident (easily 80+ hours/week). Furthermore, I grew up very close to my grandparents, and they helped my mom out a lot when I was little. I will (probably) not have the same luxury, as residency programs in my home region are limited.
&gt;
&gt;Furthermore, I don't just feel like my child might suffer as a result of my working full time (and maybe even with an 80+hr work week, the life of my kid won't actually be negatively affected) - I would also feel ""short changed"" if I was unable to be an active participant in my child's development. My kid might be 100% great regardless of what I choose to do in my career (kids are resilient like that), but I know would feel unfulfilled if I were to miss out on watching my kid grow up.

2dauga,23,2014-08-11,Some advice for a tricky situation about my education,wairimu1,networking,https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/2dauga/some_advice_for_a_tricky_situation_about_my/,"To keep a long story short, I started as a physics major with a philosophy minor and then switched to something called multidisciplinary studies. Multidisciplinary studies means I choose up to three disciplines and create a major out of them. So, I chose physics, philosophy and Asian studies so I could teach English and physics in Japan. 

Anyway, my plans changed again and I want to switch my major a little or a lot, depending on your advice. I want to get into some computing career - most likely system administration. I am going to be a junior at school and I feel that I won’t graduate on time if I jump into a computer science or information systems major. 

So, I was wondering, instead of some specific degree like that, what if I choose to my redesign my multidisciplinary studies major to be physics (since I have two years of that under my belt), computer science and information systems? Or perhaps some other combination? If I do this multidisciplinary studies major, I am more likely to graduate in four years. What do you think?

I have been repairing and customizing computers for almost six years now. I’ve been in three computer repair internships and have a small business on the side. I don’t have certs and I’m convinced that A+ is just silly. Are the networking certs worth the trouble? 

E/ By the way, my girlfriend and I want to open an internet business within the next two or three years

E2/ Thanks for the upvotes, friends

E3/ I ought to also mention that I can complete my philosophy minor with only three more courses"
2dax9t,2,2014-08-11,I want to tell my grandparents what they missed. NAW.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2dax9t/i_want_to_tell_my_grandparents_what_they_missed/,"I grew up in the country. The south. The middle of no where.

My grandparents lived down the road. 

Up until I was 18, I was at their house almost every day. At the very least once a week. I would spend hours sitting on their front porch. Just talking to them about anything and everything. We were very, very close. Everyone knew I was the apple of their eye. I was their favorite between my brother and I. My mother, their daughter, even admitted that. Anyone could see it.


When I was 18, I got my first ""real"" boyfriend. We dated until I was 20. A little over 2 years. He was alright, but not ""the one.""

When I was 18, I was also disowned. I was told that I was an embarrassment, a disgrace, and to never speak to them again. A white boy would never want me again. I would miss out on so much.

My (ex) boyfriend is black and I am white. They never met him.

Several people tried to talk to them. They stood by it.



I'm about to graduate from college with at least a 3.5 GPA (possibly higher, as I have this last semester). I'm graduating early. I'm applying to graduate programs to get my PhD. I have an internship in my field (Anthropology - specifically Primatology). I've been to different institutions where I was trained to do research. I've presented at conferences.  I have a job that I enjoy. I bought my own car last summer with my own money. Plus, I found the love of my life, which I never expected to happen as dating has never been important to me. I go on a vacation every summer that I pay for. I work my ass off. Literally blood, sweat, and tears.


No white boy would ever want me again. - Wrong, as the guy I'm dating now is white. :O

I would miss out on so much. - I've missed out on nothing, but spending time with my grandparents.


I had never been so hurt when they disowned me. There was no fixing it. The two people who I admired the most kicked me to the ground in 20 minutes. Never looked back.


Until recently, when my grandfather told me mother to tell me he's sorry. As if that was going to cut it.

Then the other day he told my mom that I should give him a call sometime. She asked him when I should call him and not the other way around. He couldn't think of an answer.


My grandmother is in the beginning stages of dementia. She's still okay, but it won't be long before I'm called by my mother's name again (as other family members have done once it got bad).


And while it doesn't bother me as much anymore, I just don't think I could ever look at them the same way ever again. I'm not really angry or upset. I couldn't smile at them and pretend it's okay. I couldn't hug them. I couldn't go visit any day, any time. It will never be the same. 


Though, I would just like to take all of my accomplishments and immaturely rub it in their face. Ask them what I missed out on. Or maybe ask them what they missed out on. 

Obviously, life has gone on for me. 

I don't know if I've forgiven them or not. In some ways, yes. In others, no. It's not heavy on my heart though. I was wanted until they realized how short life was a few months ago. They didn't want me. I was dead to them and I didn't get a say in it. There's nothing more hurtful than being told that you aren't wanted. So I took that and grew from it. I've worked hard. 


Part of me says do it while they're still alive. Tell them what they're missing. But I don't have the right words yet. And I know as soon as I walked in and open my mouth I'd cry. I don't want to cry. This part says I may regret it some day if I don't.

The other part of me says be done with it. They dropped you like a fly. You don't need people in your life who only want you around when you're doing exactly what they want you to. 


Though, I'll make a decision this year, I've decided. 

Time is running out."

Here are my [starting pics](http://imgur.com/a/2sMYP#0)

Here are my [completion pics](http://imgur.com/a/afYBX)

**Congratulations Everyone!**

Well it's been a time and a half fellow BTFCers. I wanna congratulate everyone who not only completed the challenge but also anyone who stuck with it for any period of time. It's not an easy thing to stick with, especially when you have a job or a family to take care of (I have neither...). So, fellow redditors, I'm happy for all of you!

**Intro/Shameless Excuses**

That being said, I'm pretty disappointed in myself. The Monday after I took my before pictures I started my internship in NYC. This internship, rather inconveniently, lasted the entirety of my cut, which made this far and away the most difficult cut I've ever had. My commute was 2 hours both ways, I was up at 5:30 every morning, and didn't get to the gym until around 8pm. I also had to pack my entire day's worth of food with me to work because I tried not to eat ~4 hours before bed. I averaged about 5 or 6 hours of sleep on weekdays, tried to hit my macros as best I could (but there were far too many days where I was way under), went to the gym right after I got home, and then showered, shaved, did a little more work (mostly reading), and went to bed. This was my daily routine for the last 9 weeks or so. The lack of sleep wasn't very healthy, I didn't eat enough food on too many days, and as a result I lost some muscle in the process. Most of my lifts went down 10lbs or so, or they remained constant. I'm also not nearly as defined as I'd hoped but I'd like to enjoy the rest of my summer now (drinking, eating normal, less healthy foods, etc.) so I've decided to end here. 

**Exercise Routine**

Well I wish I could put a lot down here for anyone interested but it's kind of all over the place. The first two weeks I went 6 days a week. This was a huge mistake. I was burnt out by the end of week 2. I switched to a 5 day routine and held it at that for the rest of the cut. This is an example of my routine, but if anyone is interested in specific lifts/weights/numbers I will gladly provide further information.


Day | Routine
---|---
Monday | Shoulders and Traps
Tuesday | Off/30min Cardio
Wednesday | Chest and Abs
Thursday | Bis and Tris and 15min Cardio
Friday | Back
Saturday | Legs and Abs
Sunday | Off/30min Cardio

Some extra days I did 15 minutes of cardio, but on those three days I always did cardio. 

**Diet**

I watched my macros for my diet, which were around 80g Carbs, 230g Protein, 110g Fat at the start, and by the end I was down to around 60g Carbs, 230g Protein, 90-100g Fat. I ate a lot of the same food day in and day out. Chicken and broccoli were the two most popular dishes. Probably 60% of my meals were that. I also ate 4-6 eggs every morning, 4 scrambled with cheese or 6 over easy without cheese. I ate a lot of ""Progurt"" which is full fat greek yogurt (I like Fage) with chocolate whey added to it. ""Proatmeal"" is good too. I ate a lot of chicken caesar salads, asparagus, peanut butter on low carb wraps or sandwich thins if I really wanted to treat myself, a little less than a cup of some sort of pasta if I hadn't had any carbs all day, whey shakes, quest bars, turkey burgers and turkey hot dogs (it's what my mom buys, I'd've killed for a steak or actual burger but I didn't have time to make my own food), and some nuts and cheeses. That's pretty much all I ate. I only drank water or protein shakes (with water, no milk). Only time I had alcohol was on my week of vacation (which I'll get to in a minute). This diet isn't too bad as long as you find what you like and, uh, force yourself to not hate it... It works for me but I can imagine it not being as easy for others (and trust me, it's not that easy for me either). 

**Vacation**

This was my downfall. After 5 weeks my family went on vacation, and I think I looked better before vacation than I do now. I tried to be somewhat strict with my diet on vacation but that lasted all of about 10 hours. I ate a lot, drank a lot, gained quite a bit of weight, but I had fun and that's all that matters. Had this vacation not happened I would probably look better than I do now, but oh well. 10/10 would do it again.

**Final Thoughts**

Congrats for reading this much (or just going straight to this, in which case shame on you but, eh, I'd probably do the same). This was not easy at all. It took a toll on my mental state from the lack of sleep, commuting, eating the same thing, blah blah blah, but overall I'm happy I did it and I'll probably do it again. I haven't weighed below 170 since freshman year of college so that's kinda cool. Good luck to everyone doing this and I hope you're all happy with what you've achieved! Now it's time for me to feast.

In fact, I spend the whole day at home to avoid asking her for her permission to go out, and this is just nourishing my depression, my shiness and my fear of taking any step in life. Now I'm in a holiday period since 2 months and I still have only one week to go for an internship but I did absolutly nothing in my vacation, it was just boredom from the beginning till the end, I feel like there's no enough fullfillment in my life, and what makes me more depressed is seeing all my friends spending the best days of their life traveling, going out, partying ... while I'm just here watching them on facebook. In addition, I try to take a step that could change my situation or make me just feel a little bit good about my self, like having a dog in the house, but once again my mother doesn't understand what it means for me or for my moral issues, she just refuses telling me that I can do that when I'll be working and earning a salary. I'm just too tired of it all !"
2dbzk8,3,2014-08-12,(22/f) severe anxiety related to boyfriend (28/m) and his mom,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2dbzk8/22f_severe_anxiety_related_to_boyfriend_28m_and/,"Hello! Before I begin I need to go over a little bit of background. I live in Texas and my boyfriend lives in Michigan. We have been dating for a year and a half, long distance the whole time. He moved back in with his parents to save money (He works at Home Depot) to get his master’s degree in bio-medical engineering. He graduated with his masters a year ago in May and has yet to find a job. He previously has his Bachelors in Chemical engineering and his mother told him that he needed to go back because he couldn’t find a job then either. (His parents told him they would only pay for his college if he did engineering in the first place.) He has been sending out applications all around the US  and his mom took it onto herself to send out applications on his behalf, linking them to her email. She got him one interview and then after they said ‘you aren’t the right fit’ (It was something he had no experience in, not even an engineering job) she personally emailed the person getting an attitude with them about why he didn’t get the position (this WHOLE time the person that she was emailing believes that it was him and has given him a bad rep with that company) He has been diligently sending out applications. Sometimes he will get a “no” email but mostly he hears nothing. About two weeks ago he got an interview for an area close to me and it seemed to go over great but in the end it was a  ‘you aren’t the right fit’ (He has no experience other than a semester or internship).
Okay, so fast forward to last Sunday. His parents returned home and his mom starts sending him angry texts (she said nothing to his face). We talk on skype daily so he was telling me what she said via skype. It was things like “I can’t take this no ambition lifestyle that you want to live” (He has been putting in apps daily) and stuff like “I want you out of here, I can’t take you being here, I can’t take your smelly room (I don’t know if it smells but it’s fairly clean), I’m mad about the garbage (His brother and girlfriend had been there since the second his parents left so it wasn’t all him) and I want you out” and then a text along the lines of “Maybe you can go live with (insert aunt name her). She has internet, that’s all you need RIGHT?” “You could live with her and work at home depot. I think that sounds like a GREAT plan”. I couldn’t believe that she was sending him texts like that. He is already really bummed out about the job situation and frequently refers to himself as a ‘loser’ and a ‘failure’.  I guess I’m just really baffled that a parent would say something so demeaning to their child. Aren’t parents supposed to tell you that you can do anything in the world? As he was saying that to me I started pleading with him to just move out. I told him he could live with me. About that time he gets another text saying “Tell her that the move is happening soon” At that moment I felt embarrassed and betrayed. She was listening into our conversation. Before he has walked out and saw his mother standing at the door but I thought it was just a coincidence. I am now afraid to talk with him about anything on skype because I feel like I was invaded and that everything we have talked about, maybe even the dirty things I’ve told him have been heard and it’s so embarrassing but it also makes me angry at the same time. He is coming to visit me in 2 days and I am very afraid that when he’s gone something bad will happen. He’s going to see about transferring home depots to the one here but I’m really anxious about it because I feel that when he comes back after his week here she will have thrown out all of his stuff or tell him that he has no place to live. I am currently in nursing school, it is finals week for me, and I have anxiety through the roof about school and now his mom and his living arrangements. I said that he can live here but I am very nervous because he has yet to meet my family and I couldn’t even have friends stay over for more than a day without getting annoyed and antsy with them.  This is the guy I want to marry so I know that we will be in this stage eventually; I’m just scared of the way I act messing it up. Maybe I will start to hate something about him. Maybe he will start to hate something about me.  Maybe he will come here without a job because his mom suddenly kicks him out and he can’t get his transfer through .  I don’t know, it seems that I am freaking out about it more than he is. At this point I practically loathe his mom. I haven’t even met her yet and I don’t want to! I’m also anxious about how that will fit in with our relationship. He doesn’t want to have contact with her for awhile but I know one day he will (and I think he should be in contact with his family) but I am terrible at letting things go. Sorry that it was so long! I didn’t know where to turn to. Any advice? (on the whole thing or anything in particular)

tl;dr  My boyfriend’s mom is kicking him out and I’m really anxious about him moving in and the relationship with his mom

So a while ago I posted a thread, link below, asking if it was a good idea to ask my girlfriend to partially finance my trips.

Some background; me and my girlfriend are together for about 17months now. She lives in the USA and I live in the Netherlands and see each other about 4 times a year. At least, we try to. 

As of now, I am paying all of my trips alone. Which are usually around the 500-850euro price range. Because I come way more often to the USA than she is coming to me, I thought it would only be fair if I asked her to partially finance my trips. 
I was planning to ask her last march, when I was with her at her college. But I guess I didn't have the balls.

However, now I did. Last night actually. 
When I asked her, she didn't say anything at first. So I looked at her and she said to me that she hoped that I didn't expect an answer right away, and that she had to think about it.
So now I am just basically waiting for a response from her.
Is it a good idea to bring it up again tonight?
Also, I told her that of course I would be financing her trips to me as well. I said that I wanted her to finance my trips partially, or come to me more often. Her reply was that her not coming to me more often is because of money. However, she worked all summer long (I had an internship, in the USA, unpaid though, and I had to pay for my travel expenses), and she is going to work while she is at college. Her college is fully paid for by her parents. While I have to pay for my own college, health care and all my other expenses in the Netherlands.

Any tips/thoughts/opinions? Or anything? 
As always, thank you SO much.

2dc8ne,11,2014-08-12,"I feel like I lost a part of my soul, and that I'm better off for it.",burningnumbness,infj,https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/2dc8ne/i_feel_like_i_lost_a_part_of_my_soul_and_that_im/,"First, a brief sketch of myself. I'm a 21 year old guy from the United States. I'm probably as close to successful as someone can be at my stage of life. I'm a senior, attending an Ivy League university on a scholarship, currently finishing up a competitive internship and looking forward to graduation with honors and a fast-track into a great JD program. Personality-wise, I'm an INFJ and a 1w9 -- or at least, I feel like I *was*, until relatively recently. 

For most of my life, I've felt emotionally numb or hollow. My feelings were always there, though distant and controlled, and always subjected to the one dominant emotion in myself, my anger. My childhood was deeply dysfunctional, and I learned to adapt to it by suppressing and channeling my anger at my surroundings and social environment towards constructive goals. As a result, I became an overachiever, ending up near the top of all of my classes and acing the SAT, which gave me access to the scholarship that put me where I am now.

I've always been somewhat cynical and harsh, or so I believed. Despite that, some idealistic part of me survived that believed in the innate goodness of humanity and that sought the best in others, and I was often helpful and kind to those around me, which gave me some sense of feeling, some escape from the vacuum inside. 

**That part doesn't exist anymore.**

About eight months ago, I became involved with a woman, and made the cardinal mistake I had never made with another person; I opened up to her. At the beginning, it felt as if we had some sort of connection. She was also an INFJ, and communication flowed freely and easily. For the first time in my life, I took a risk and revealed some of my vulnerabilities, fears, and imperfections to another person, and the anger inside began to dissolve.

She deceived me. For those of you who have some inflated view of the ""saintliness"" of people with the INFJ type, you have obviously never been on the wrong end of a negative relationship with one. With her knowledge of me, she wounded me as only she could. The entire premise of our relationship turned out to be a lie, and when I confronted her on her intentional deception, she lashed out at me. I responded in kind, and she retaliated by throwing everything she knew about me back at me to cause as much pain as she could. And because I had let her in, because I had relaxed my barriers and protections around her, everything she said stuck me with a force nobody else could wield. And she knew it.

It's been a couple of months. I'm in another relationship now, though it's nothing serious. Just some guy I knew from one of my classes. I don't feel as if I have barriers anymore around other people. Rather, I feel as if that sensitive core that used to exist has vanished, leaving nothing to hide. I am a rather charismatic public speaker and very good at interpersonal negotiations, and since I've always been fascinated by politics, a career in elected office has always been something that has interested me. I only held back because my prior experience with the harsh and brutal world of politics as an aide for a local state senator made me fear my skin wouldn't be thick enough to survive all that hostility. I no longer fear that. I've been networking with other students in my school that also have political ambitions within the Democratic Party. My LSAT score should allow me to get into an Ivy League JD program without a problem, and after that it's three years of study before I begin chasing appointments and currying favors.

That anger within me no longer feels as if it's repressed. Rather, I feel like I'm relishing in it. Where before I used to feel guilt when I engaged in competitive behavior that caused losers and winners, I now feel a sickly-sweet feeling that is somewhere between revenge and catharsis, something akin to what I suspect sadists feel when brutalizing their victims. The part of me that enjoys to see others fail while I succeed has finally been freed. In some abstract sense, I enjoy watching other people's dreams collapse so mine can be actualized, as it proves that I am better, stronger, and superior to them.

I sense that something inside of me has been lost, but oddly, I actually feel something approaching happiness for the very first time in my life.

Recently my father stopped by to visit me. We spent a couple of days visiting local cafes and talking about life in general. When I mentioned my desire to go into politics, he warned me that ""you will become hard if you go down that route"". When I responded by telling him that I believe I have already learned that lesson, he told me something I never knew about my past. According to my father, I was always a ""sensitive child"" when I was young, the sort that would cry when flowers wilted and people died on TV. Apparently at some time when I was in grade school, my personality began to change, and I became cold and distant, unfeeling and callous, only showing flashes of my former self at rare moments. 

When he told me that over the last couple of days we had spent together, I had seemed colder and harder than he had ever seen me, I had no idea what to say. He is absolutely right. But I'm perfectly happy with who I am, and I have no desire to ever change that.

I don't know if I'm still an INFJ, or a One, or even if I'm something that can fit into one of these stereotypes. But I do know that I feel a strength and certainty in myself that I have never felt before, and all it took to find that was to lose a part of myself."
2dcbhk,1,2014-08-12,Amazes me how many ways international students can be tormented,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2dcbhk/amazes_me_how_many_ways_international_students/,"Three years ago I made a choice to go abroad to a premier university for my undergraduate studies. Boy oh boy did I wish I didn't, right about now.

I want this off my chest because I'm now a third year student, and I had applied for an internship in this country. I went to multiple interviews and finally secured one with a really prestigious Electrical Energy Generation company. It would be in a pretty exquisite power generation station of theirs and it was a dream come true for me.
It has now been 2.5 months out of my 3 month ""Summer Internship"" and I have not yet been ""cleared"" to set foot on that site by the national clearance body despite having cleared the interview, a medical exam, a drug test and despite having every other aspect thoroughly checked. (including their internal company security vetting for gods sake!)

As an international student from a developing nation, my background and history were extensively checked before I obtained my passport. My parents financial status was thoroughly checked for me to get my visa, and all sorts of biometric verifications were conducted.
In all honesty, this country knows everything about me and my family and yet all other interns who are locals have been cleared, and being the only international who got accepted on this site, I have been kept out for more than 2/3rds of my internship now.
The city I live in is especially expensive to stay in during the summer and my family and friends have been supportive enough to keep me here all this while, hoping I can start working some day and start earning enough to keep myself here. I'm on the company's pay roll but haven't received a single form of compensation at all.

So as I see it, personal merit doesn't matter one bit now does it?
&gt; Got good grades enough to study abroad? *No problems, lets give you financial headache every step of the day.*
&gt; Somehow manage to scrape all your financials together to make it to Uni? *Too bad! Let's keep raising the fees every year!*
&gt; Want to live in the city? *Let's give you hell with your accommodation forms and references.*
&gt; Want to be placed by the University? *Oops! Women and locals first.*
&gt; Good enough to get interviews and clear them as well? *Let's get you stuck at the ""National Clearance"" level.*

Honestly. I thought that coming abroad would be the push I needed to get somewhere doing the subject I loved, but this has honestly turned into the worst decision I ever made. Even the kids back home are doing some form of internship and all I'm doing here is sitting on my ass and losing crucial work experience &amp; time.
I am thoroughly disappointed and dejected and have no face to ask my family for any more money even just for daily expenses in hopes that I might work at this company even for a single day. I'm somehow got myself another part time job but it barely pays enough for other expenses.

I really don't understand why international students are treated this way. Forget a foreign citizen. Even just as a student, I'm only here for 4 years, I'm not doing anything but asking to be treated equally with the rest of the students in my classroom.
Is that too much to ask for when I pump in 21x as much tuition fees into your system as the locals?

Maybe the world is just as cruel as they say it is and you **DO** have to be born in the right place and in the right circumstances. Or maybe I just shouldn't set my sights too high.

Sadly, I arrived way before he did and we only got about a month or so to get to know each other. 

It took me quite some time to realize how much we had in common. We were talking about the same music, sharing a passion for the same video games, excited about the same series, and mandatory cat gifs, whereas the other interns didn't seem to enjoy all that as much as us.  We always ended up talking about our nerdy things at work. We just had a great connexion! And he has good taste, is super smart and very kind. 

To me, he was always way out of my league -and inversely I'm at a time of my life where I'm not feeling very confident- so I didn't look much further. Also I heard him mumble the word ""girlfriend"" once and I was not sure in which context, so I assumed he was taken.

However, on the very last days of my internship I started crushing hard. We were using instant messenger at work and just joking around everytime we'd cross paths or work together on projects.

And in the morning of my last day (friday), I found my desk covered in post-its he made with little video games references we had in common. That was way too adorable for me not to crush even harder.

So here I was, leaving this internship with the biggest crush I've had in a while.

Before I left I recommended him an indie video game (cause we're both into that), and he played it over the week-end and spoke to me on Facebook about how he loved it and even set it as his cover picture. So we're still talking a bit outside of work. :)

Today was his birthday so I surprised him with a dozen cute gifs on Facebook when he was sleeping. When he saw them in the morning (I was sleeping) he commented each one of them and seemed super excited about them! But I overslept and missed some Facebook messages he sent me after that, that I should go get lunch with him and the other interns at work for his birthday and when he called me at 12 it was too late for me to get there in time. :&lt;

I'm wondering if I'm getting some sort of signals that I should make a move (like the post-its or just him keeping touch and being excited to talk to each other) or if he's just very very friendly and kind. I want to keep in touch and actually see him outside of the context of work (so that kind of excludes lunch with him and all the interns) but I'm super shy about it and still unsure about the ""girlfriend"" mumble I caught that one time. 

---   
**tl;dr**: Having this huge crush on a fellow intern but not working there anymore. Not sure if I'm receiving signals or not and wondering if (and how) I should make a move."

Came back off a weekend away last night so I feel a bit down after that and today was my last day of my internship, I am now an unemployed graduate.

Anyone got any tips on coping with this? If I tell most people this is why I am upset they will say I am being stupid and these are ridiculous reasons. 

On top of this, whenever I get down like this time seems to slow right down, I end up thinking, how long untill today is over and then I sit over thinking everything.

I think I just needed a bit of a rant and hopefully other people are able to understand what I mean here! Not sure if it is a dyspraxic thing or not"
2dchq8,1,2014-08-12,"Me [22 M] with my Ex [22F] were on and off for 3 years, don't know if she ""cheated"" on me before break up was official + venting.",woody982,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2dchq8/me_22_m_with_my_ex_22f_were_on_and_off_for_3/,"Sorry this might be long. My ex and I started out as best friends, one drunken night we hooked up, one thing led to another, and we have been in an on and off relationship for 3+ years ever since. The most recent time got back together, would have been 1 year ago soon, we were doing great, loved each other more than ever before and set out to make sure we didn't screw up the relationship again. She and I had an internship over the summer but hers was a 12 hour drive away from home, so she was away for almost 2 months. I helped her move into her new place and stayed with her for a week before I had to go home for my internship. We had the most amazing week together. But as time went on and she made friends with her co-workers, she became more distant as the weeks went on. We used to skype, call and texted all the time, but after it seemed she would rather spend time with her new friends than talking to me alone in her house. Understandable to a point. Which is why I kindly asked if she could put a little more effort into the relationship as it felt we were drifting apart due to the distance. Fast forward to her last couple of weeks before she came home, we had been having pretty big fights, more than the usual few snarky comments. I wrote it off as simply due to the not seeing each other in a long time. We don't do well when we see each other less than once a week. But she finally tells me that the reason she has been acting this way is because she can't accept the situation with my family anymore and because of that I am holding her back from what her life could be. We are/were(?) an interracial couple. 

My parents are very traditional and expect me to find and marry a girl of the same background. Because of this I have had to hide the relationship for a long time. It is the reason we have broken up multiple times in the past. So she demanded that I confront my parents that night and tell them I am with her or we are broken up. I tell her I need to think about it. The next day I tell her I am willing to confront them, but I need to see her and talk to her in person before I do this. I thought this was a reasonable request as we haven't seen each other in almost 2 months and I would be making a huge step in our relationship and I just wanted to make sure the girl I loved, the one I spent the best week of my life with, was the girl that was coming back home after all the time apart and fighting. She agrees after some arguing. Two days later another fight erupts and she changes her mind about wanting to talk about it in person and she demands to have me confront my parents that day. I said I couldn't do it that like, I needed to see and talk to her in person. At this time, my internship was over but I had started a summer course, which required me to spend a lot of time on the work. I'm 1 year away from graduating college and I don't need a bad grade in my transcript in a class that is important. So I couldn't fly down and see her, plus I'm going through some tough times and a $400+ plane ticket would have made things worse as I am a full time student during the regular semesters. Because of this, she said I didn't care about her enough and didn't put her first in my life. She didn't understand that I had responsibilities and she was only 1 week away from coming home. We had a ugly ""break up"" over the phone and didn't talk to each other in the last week before she came home. 

As the days passed, I went through every emotion known to man, my mom walks into my room late one night and asks why I have been sad and distant for the past few days. I break down and tell her everything. I couldn't hold it in anymore. My mom was very disappointed in me but I feel like she took it a little easier on me as the relationship was over and she saw how much I was hurting. I saw my ex the following day, we talk. In her last week of her internship, the interns were suppose to go into the city and give a formal presentation about their research and the work they did over the past 2 months. But she tells me, instead of staying in the city for the week, she ended up staying with a ""friend"" at her place as his car broke down and had no where to go as his lease was up. I remember her saying the person she was booked to share a room with in the city was having her boyfriend stay with her so my ex was going to share a bed with one of her girl friends until the boyfriend left. I mentioned I told my parents about us, I was expecting a shocked and hopefully a happy face, but I got a ""oh my god what did you do"" reaction. I didn't understand, I did what she wanted. She kept on saying it was too little too late, I did everything she wanted but it was too late and she wasn't changing her mind. While I was there talking to her, It didn't occur to me that she could have done something with the guy who stayed at her place while she thought she was ""single"" even though we agreed to talk in person if something like this were to ever happen when she went away, so I didn't ask. But I did say that I didn't know if she already moved on to someone else which is why she was acting the why she was. She gave no response. After talking in circles, it was clear that we were not getting back together even after I confronted my parents about us, so I left.

So here I am 2 days later with it just hitting me, that there is a possibility she had been hooking up with some guy while we were going through the break. I know ultimately is doesn't matter as we are officially broken up now, but I'm going absolutely crazy not knowing if she did or not. Too late for what???! It was 1 week. Did she already move on which is why its to late? The sinking feeling in my stomach has returned as the thought the of the girl I love, kissing, touching possibly having sex with some guy in the bed that I helped make, in the house I helped cleaned and set up for her. I don't know if I should ask her to put my mind at ease.

**tl;dr: Ex girlfriend ""unoffically"" breaks up with me the week before coming home after spending 2 months away. Saw her a few days ago and tells me she spent the week in between with a (guy)friend. Just realizing that there was a possibility of her ""cheating"" on me during that week. Going crazy not knowing. Please read the full post, it explains a lot more than the tldr does**"
2dcwk1,126,2014-08-12,[SUPER LONG] A quick overview of my wedding and my nmother-in-law's attempted sabotage.,[deleted],raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/2dcwk1/super_long_a_quick_overview_of_my_wedding_and_my/,"OK, I found this while in a different subreddit (of course). I will start by saying that I do have both nMom and nDad. And this is SUPER long, my apologies.

But this post is about my husband’s nMom and her attitude toward me. There are a million stories, but here’s a quick overview of our wedding.

Backstory: 

Husband and I knew each other/were good friends for 6 years before we started dating (always loved each other, but we were always in other horrible relationships). On our first date, I told him he had to wait a year before asking me to marry him. Awwwwssss, almost a year to the day we get engaged, we were both 26 years old. His nMom is NOT happy, no surprise there. She says we “cannot get married until we’re financially stable”, I am supporting him through his doctorate in psychology; we aren’t going to be financially stable for at least a decade after our engagement, so screw her. We still remain engaged for 4 years before finally just biting the bullet and setting a date (note, we have been together 6 years at this point). By this time I refuse to see her when we visit her house when we are in her state for Christmas/other holidays (we moved 3,000 glorious miles away to get him into the school of his choice).

The wedding planning: 

We begin planning a year in advance, because again, we are poor folks living off of just my income while my husband is a fulltime student and then a fulltime student plus an unpaid internship, all while he’s trying to finish his dissertation. His mom is still pissed that we are getting married. Even after 6 years she still considers our relationship a fluke, and constantly tells him things like, “What if she becomes terminally ill, you’d be tied to her for the rest of your life!” (That is a DIRECT quote, she said this to him! For real!!)

I have the best friends who go through and help me plan everything to the last detail. We send out invites. And guess who says they aren’t coming? That’s right, my soon to be mother-in-law. She refuses to RSVP, and calls on the regular to tell my husband he’s making the biggest mistake of his life, he’s too young to marry, we are “rushing into things”, and any other idiotic/nonsensical excuse she can come up with. It should be noted that we are now both 30 years old and have been friends since we were both 19. I would also note that I am not a bad “catch”: I have a BA, graduated with honors, and I have a fairly successful job that I enjoy in my chosen career, and I am *supporting her son 100% through 7 years of grad school!!!*

Of course I still set up a head table including her, because God forbid she shows up unannounced and she doesn’t have a seat. Because of her adamant denial that she would ever show up to this event, my husband makes the executive decision to not invite his extended family. He isn’t close with his aunts/uncles/cousins (because his mom has alienated them all, big surprise, right!?!), and if they came and saw that his mother wasn’t there it would be a huge embarrassment that we didn’t want to have to deal with. My family isn’t especially close, but we know the familial obligation of inviting everyone in my extended family, and having them show up, because that’s what (even dysfunctional families) do.

Day of the wedding:

Her husband forces her to show up (he normally doesn’t show any kind of backbone in these situations, but apparently refused flat out to miss his oldest child’s wedding day. Good on him, for once!). 

We have been unable to split the sections into bride and groom sides, because essentially none of my husband’s family has been invited. Oh, did she have an issue with that! Even though it was all her doing. She essentially acted like our whole ceremony was tacky, but whatever, there was no way to make her happy. And we had a great day, nothing was going to ruin it. We were surrounded by a ton of other people who loved us.

After the ceremony, in which she sat in the back and sulked, my husband’s father came up and hugged me while nMom stayed out of sight not making eye contact and scowling the whole time. She refused to be in pictures, and we had had to tell the DJ there would be no bride/groom dancing with the father/mother, and we also had the reverend take out the line about “if anyone objects to this pairing” line.


Reception:

Apparently, she forced my husband’s father to drive back to their home (2.5 hours away) while he begged her to reconsider and go to the reception. She finally gives in and shows up a couple of hours after it started. That’s fine. She acts snarky that we set a place for her, who knows why! Nothing makes her happy.

They stayed for about an hour, in which time, she never even said a “hello” to me, let alone look in my direction. Then they left without saying goodbye.

Gifts:

My absolute *favorite* piece of this story! And if you’ve read through this entire thing, this is really the icing on the cake. We start opening gifts (mostly cards with money) the next night. Then we get to this one:
It says “To: [husband]” and then in a different colored pen, clearly scribbled as an afterthought “and [my name].

We open that sucker up (I will also note that they did not pay for any portion of our wedding, my husband’s dad makes a very nice living; my parents are dirt poor and helped us in every way they could), and what do we find inside, you ask!?!

Drum roll please!

A generic wedding card that just has “Love, mom &amp; dad” at the bottom, but the kicker is that inside was a jury duty notice for my husband that had accidentally been mailed to their house.

I still laugh about it, and it’s 3 years later. Total class act!

Soon after the wedding she told my husband that we shouldn't even consider having kids until we're at least 40 years old, because we are still ""financially unstable.""

She also tells him how horrible I am because *I* didn't invite his side of the family to the wedding. She is positive it was all my doing, and an intentional slight. As described above, this was all on account of her actions (for over a year!).

TL,DR: My nMother-in-law says my husband and I will never work out, refuses to go to our wedding/shows up anyway, gives the most absurdly passive aggressive wedding gift I've ever heard of. Husband and I have been happily together for 8 years. And she's still a bitch.

However, we have yet to complete very many projects and now, my artist can not contribute at all. My primary goal for creating my own independent games has been to build skills and experience towards a career in the industry. Therefore, I am now looking for a team to work with that will be able to stay motivated and finish a project.

Game design is my passion. I love programming also, but I learned it so that I would have a tangible skill to contribute with beyond design. The perfect project would be already planned and underway, yet open to potential design input. I am available to meet in person in the Raleigh, NC area or work remotely.

I am willing to work for a profit share from the game if that is the only form of compensation a small team could offer (I have been there myself). I am also open to an entry-level hourly rate or even an internship with the right company.

You can check out my previous endeavors at [Detour Games](http://www.detour-games.com/home.html). I also host most of my code on [GitHub](https://github.com/amplify91) if you would like to take a look. I have even taught programming to 8-10 year old children as part of a week-long Minecraft modding camps. You can check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amplify91) for more information about me.

If you have a small project already under way and are looking for another programmer to help finish completing, PM me with details about the project and the team and maybe we can work together. If you are looking for something else, PM me anyways and I may consider it. Thanks for your consideration!"
2dcxx8,16,2014-08-12,Ongoing podcast plotlines?,ksaid1,comedybangbang,https://www.reddit.com/r/comedybangbang/comments/2dcxx8/ongoing_podcast_plotlines/,"Comedy Bang Bang, the podcast, has a great deal of focus on realistic characters and intricate story arcs, much like my favorite TV show, *Friday Night Lights*. A lot of these arcs are resolved within a single episode, but there are some that stretch out over the course of years. I'm trying to remember them all, but they're so deep and complex that it's hard for me to keep them all straight.

So far I can think of:

* The teenaged tribulations of CBB intern Marissa Whompler, featuring such diverse personalities as Charlotte Listler, Eric ""Gutterballs"" Gutterman, and Tracy Rierden.

* The equally twisted love affair of Gillian Jacobs and Garry Marshall (who are engaged to be wed next Valentines Day by the guy who directed the Underworld films)

* Scott and Jason Mantzoukas's epic battles against Don Dimello's forces of evil

* And of course whatever the fuck is going on in the Farts and Procreation episodes.

Are there any other ongoing series / plotlines in the CBB podcast?"
2dd2tl,69,2014-08-12,Did you change your mind because of him? [RANT],d00mshine,childfree,https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/2dd2tl/did_you_change_your_mind_because_of_him_rant/,"I am a CF 27/f. One of my best friends was my roommate all 4 years of college and we went through a lot together. Her boyfriend (now husband) joined the army and deployed, I got into my first major relationship and got engaged (way way way too young). We had one of those friendships where we could really dig into the tough stuff, and as a result we knew everything about each other. 

Fast forward. I graduated from graduate school and broke off my engagement and she got married and moved to Europe with her husband per the military. She got married in 2010 and moved to Europe late 2011/early 2012. We have had minimal contact since then. She doesn't come home that often. I went to Europe for 2 weeks in 2012 to visit. We occasionally talk on the phone.

In August of 2012 I started dating my (staunchly CF) SO (currently 27/m). Friend has met him once in a very, very condensed way when she and her husband visited over Christmas 2013 and stayed in our new place with us for a night. Since she's moved to Europe I've changed a lot. I've changed my career path, I've become much more extroverted than I've ever been, and I've been an all around happier person. I attribute this to my SO. He is truly my other half. I also solidified my CF status. 

The other day we were catching up on the phone. It's always been fairly clear to me that she's dubious at best about my SO. I honestly don't care. He is a wonderful, caring man. We have so much in common, we are incredible at communicating, and we want the same things out of life. Well, friend (who acts more like my mother) was rambling on about how she was so disappointed that she and her husband didn't get pregnant before he deployed, but he's really ""emotionally connecting"" with the idea of being a father and it makes her so happy to feel like she's truly ready to be a parent. 

So, first of all - gross. But whatever. I make a comment. Nothing mean, just something about how I'm all set. This seems to intensely worry her. She says ""well I thought you were always on the fence."" I was on the fence when I was 22 and engaged to someone I really didn't want to marry who really wanted kids. I explained this to her and she said ""I would just hate it if you made this decision based on Boyfriend and then regretted it later."" I assured her I wouldn't. She seems to think my SO has this power over me that prevents me from making my own decisions. Let's do a little analysis here. 

I went into grad school directly out of college, got my Masters in 3 semesters, dumped my shitty fiance and spent 3 years working on myself, my career, and traveling. I met a wonderful guy and we have an amazing relationship. I have tenure at a company I've been at for 7 years. In the past year and a half I've been promoted 4 times. I consider myself an intelligent and independent person. 

Friend worked several internships in college. Graduated and started working as a part time toddler's gymnastics teacher (she has a degree in fundraising and event planning and interned for a ton of amazing companies promoting social justice. She headed up a club that fundraised enough money to build a well in Sudan by the time she was 19). She then moved to Europe, didn't work for the first 2 years, and now is self employed teaching tumbling and coaching children's softball on a military base. 

I'M NOT JUDGING BUT I'M JUDGING. She doesn't even have kids yet and she's already thrown her ambition away. I respect the hell out of military people and their spouses (my SO was AF) but watching my friend throw all her brilliance away for her borderline verbally abusive husband and the crotch fruit she's just *dying* to bear while simumtaneously throwing my success and life choices back in my face is completely unacceptable.

She criticizes me for everything, and the children thing was the last straw. I need to cut this person out of my life if she can't respect my decisions. I'm hardly an idiot, but getting married and moving across the world at 23 gives her a false sense of entitlement that makes me cringe when I think of her with children. Before she moved she used to ask everyone everywhere for a military discount and then berated them if they didn't offer one. It's only going to get so much worse, but OH MY GOD. It's unbearable."
2dd5fc,12,2014-08-12,"NParent, Lying, and Guilt Trips",phishn37,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/2dd5fc/nparent_lying_and_guilt_trips/,"I just found this sub recently through /r/depression, and it’s been a real good tool for me. So just for starters, thanks to everyone for being so open and honest, because it helps the rest of us too :)

Anyway, I have an NMom and our relationship has decidedly soured since I got into college. It’s never been great – we’ve fought a lot since as early as I can remember – but since starting university it has definitely gotten worse. Without getting into too many details, my mother and father are divorced and have both signed court agreements that require them to pay for half of my schooling up until a certain number of semesters. They had the same agreement about my older brother. However, despite this, my mother has blatantly lied to me multiple times about the nature of that agreement, because she claims she can—and will—stop paying for my college tuition if I don’t do what she wants. In her mind, she is totally justified – when I’m living at her house, if I don’t follow every single rule, I know that’s the trump card that’s going to be pulled out. If I don’t apply for internships or jobs that she has found for me through connections of hers , then she’ll say the same thing, and also act like I have an obligation to her to do whatever she says regarding the internship/job because “she set it up for me”. But then I almost always find out that she’s lied about her involvement in it, or once again lied about financial agreements between her and my dad, or lied about some other thing that she has no reason to lie about. 

So, basically, my mom is not only N but seems to be a pathological liar. But whenever I try and confront her about the lying, she attempts to guilt trip me into convincing myself that it’s okay for her to have lied about the thing in the first place. Or, she acts so offended that I would dare call her a liar, even though we both know when she’s blatantly lied about something.

The unfortunate thing is that I think this always works out well for her. It’s really hard for me to not take the bait and either get furiously upset, or cave in just to get her to start talking to me again. My question is, how do you guys avoid the guilt traps? Is it really about no contact, or are there any other tips you guys have? I’m sick of living my whole life just to get her approval, because I’m starting to realize I don’t even know if I could EVER get to a place where she fully approves of me. But every time I do something I know she wouldn’t like, I can just hear her voice in my head telling me how selfish and immature I am for doing it. How do you block that out?

Thanks for any advice, and even if you don’t have any, thanks for just reading. It helps me just to know that I’m getting it off my chest and that other people will at least see it. "
2dd7rk,101,2014-08-12,LPT: Getting the first (or next) job,northshore12,LifeProTips,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/2dd7rk/lpt_getting_the_first_or_next_job/,"These are my personal experiences and the following advice will reflect that, but these strategies are general vectors to approach a job hunt and can be repurposed for most situations:

1. Traditional Methods: everything a 'how to get a job' help guide suggests (use the internet to post directly to company websites and job sites like monster, check craigslist careers section every day, have a great resume with PERFECT grammar, read about behavioral interview methods, have excellent grooming and attire, show up to interviews 5 minutes early, know about the company, etc).
2. Recruiters: if you have a professional skill or college+ education, these are a great way to make sure you never go hungry.  Their motivation is to shove you into any job (they get paid regardless of your satisfaction) but be clear about what you want and what you don't want, and they'll usually come through with something relatively quickly.  Recruiter websites are also great resources for learning tips and tricks.
3. Guerrilla Marketing: got no experience and gotten nowhere with traditional methods?  Get creative.  If a job calls for personal skills or assertiveness, put on your best suit/dress, grab a stack of resumes, and cold-call potential employers.  Just walk in the front door without an appointment, explain that you don't have an appointment but you would be a great candidate, and see what happens.  Remember that somebody, somewhere, wants to hire someone like you, and it's in your interest to help them find you, and the only approach you should not consider trying is something that would personally piss off a prospective employer (mailing your resume to their personal address is creepy, not entrepreneurial).  This works best for relatively small companies, or branch offices of big companies, because you can't just want into the lobby of Oracle or PepsiCo headquarters and expect the receptionist to let you in without an appointment.  Aiming for a big company?  Get an in with someone on the inside (how is up to you, google around for ideas) and ask them to send your resume to HR.  They get a referral bonus if you're hired, and HR almost always gives personal attention to employee referrals.  When it comes to guerrilla marketing, think like a Navy SEAL; the odds can never be too large, the enemy always has a weakness, and when it's time to strike, strike fast and strike hard.  The biggest limitations are your creativity and fear of failure.  
4. University Clubs: if in college, for god's sake join a professional society in your major!  First, it's great for a resume that probably isn't too crowded with experience yet.  Second, these clubs frequently bring in guest speakers from locally-based employers, and these speakers usually collect resumes at the end for internships and new hires.  Third, if a company in industry X is looking to hire, a regular place they look is the industry X club at the local university, and officers in the industry X club are usually first in line for being hired.
5.  Keep multiple irons in the fire:  Try all of these things at the same time with as many companies as possible and keep it up until you have a job.  
6. Remember that HOW you get a job does not matter, so if what you've been doing so far hasn't worked, keep doing it but also try new things until something connects."

2dddrl,1,2014-08-12,College student needs advice,goddammit11,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2dddrl/college_student_needs_advice/,"Hello there,

I'm a law student in Brazil, living in São Paulo and, first, I'll try to explain my situation:

Ok, first things first, in Brazil the best colleges are free once you get admissed, so no college debt to deal with. Second I'm living with my grandpa, so no rent for now. Third, I work as a intern on a nice law firm. And forth, my parents give some money to help each month. 

Speaking in numbers, this is:

* $600/month from the internship;
* $190/month from the lawfirm (food stamps);
* $440/month from my parents.

* Total: $1230/month.

I can live with the $440 plus the $190 food stamps. So roughly I have $600 to spend on party, some pizza, clothes, and the non-essential stuff.

But, I want to know how can a 19y/o use that money properly, so it can become MORE MONEY in the ~~near~~ future, without giving up of my pizza.

Tks.

2ddh7u,17,2014-08-12,I haven't watched wrestling since 2010. Currently watching this past week's broadcasts and putting my notes here,sadderdaysunday,SquaredCircle,https://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/2ddh7u/i_havent_watched_wrestling_since_2010_currently/,"**Preface**

I'm not sure if there's any interest in this, but when I moved away for college I didn't own a television and abruptly stopped watching wrestling altogether, even though I had spent the previous five years on IWC forums, writing for e-feds, and just generally being a fanatic. At the beginning of this year, however, I've frequented this sub out of curiosity about what's happening these days, but never took the time to watch anything besides the occasional Youtube clip or botchamania. After catching a few minutes of SmackDown a couple of weeks ago at a Coyote Ugly down in Tampa, I decided I was going to start watching it again--starting with WWE, moving on to the bigger indy feds and avoiding TNA altogether.  

Those of you who gradually got used to the current atmosphere of the WWE might not realize how staunchly different things actually are versus when I stopped watching (around the time NXT/The Nexus first happened). It feels like an entirely different organization to me. Maybe it'll fade the longer I watch it, and it'll feel like it did five years ago. So, while the novelty is fresh, here are some notes from someone who has tried to keep up, but still sort of has no idea what's going on:  
__________________
  

**NXT (8/7/14)**
  
* NXT seems to be more of what FCW was rather than a reality show. That might be really obvious, but I had no idea that it was no longer a semi-scripted competition. Now it's like, well, I guess it's still a semi-scripted competition. But without the confusing ""wait are they talking about him developing his character? Are we still in kayfabe?"" part  

* I'm surprised with how smarky this crowd is! I mean, it makes sense. I used to be stoked at seeing CM Punk and American Dragon on tv, but now I'm seeing Claudio, El Generico, Consequences Creed, Tyler Black, Pac, etc. all doing well and getting recognition. Still, the ""you can't wrestle"" chants (and to a lesser degree, the ""Bayley's gonna hug you"" chants). The ""ole!"" singing when Sami Zayn walked out. I don't know, it's not quite ROH, but it's Impact Zone-levels of smarkiness at least. 

* I know it's a place to let these performers develop, but everyone seems to cling to lines and battle cries. Seriously, watch a show and pay attention to how often someone yells something before delivering their finisher these days. It can be cool, but more often than not took me out of the moment and made me remember I was watching sports entertainment. The show began with a synchronized reciting of a bit between the crowd and Enzo Amore. Like, everyone knew it word for word. This isn't a novel concept (see: Konnan, New Age Outlaws), but it being the first thing I saw was kind of weird.  

* The really gimmicky guys seem way more over than everyone else. Are there actual storylines in NXT? The kind that put guys over without being ""the guy with the wacky antics we all know and love""? It seems like the faces are hams and jokesters and the heels are straights that are the butts of the joke.

* Were they chanting ""Teddy Boy"" at Tyson Kidd or ""Teddy Hart""? Either way, it's kinda cool that the wrestlers react to the crowd doing things that wrestlings five or so years ago would pretend like they don't hear. I saw a video of AJ reacting to ""CM Punk"" chants, and now this. Also, I saw mentions of PWG and the Package Piledriver on Steen's announcement page on WWE.com. It no longer seems that the WWE is in its own bubble where it's the only organization that exists and all previous personas and storylines never happened.  

* I guess this ties in with the ""smarky"" note from earlier, but I have to go back and expand. The crowd completely obliterated that Eva Marie girl. Apparently she's not a wrestler and her use is mostly on the Divas reality show. I could feel the heat coming from my computer speakers. Not, ""you're a heel and deplorable"" heat. Like, ""get this shit off of my tv"" heat. I wonder what the producers are thinking when they hear that, or if they care. I wonder what she thinks when she hears that, or if she cares. Tying also to the previous note, Bayley acknowledging the crowd thanking her for kayfabe-pinning someone they legitimately dislike was really funny to me for some reason. She was just like, ""no really, it was nothing. Any time.""  

* Sami Zayn's theme. Is the chanting at the beginning a reference to his old Bouncing Souls theme? Also, again, the fans chanting ""ole."" So surreal, so cool.  

* Prince Albert on commentary what  

* At some point someone (Rich Brennan?) referred to Alex Riley (Kevin Kiley) as ""Kiley"" and he had to correct them. Oh man.  

* The crowd sings SO MUCH.  

* Dat helluva kick tho  

* Production truck botched the tournament bracket. It shows Sami and Adam's named dimmed in the 8-team part of the bracket. Oh well.  

* Sin Cara still wrestles? Wait, apparently they did a bit where Mistico was Sin Cara and Incognito was fake Sin Cara, but then Mistico left so now Incognito is Sin Cara and he also wrestle(s/d) without his mask? Weird.  

* Okay whatever. I'm watching Smackdown now. Also let me get this straight: WWE has a show for each weekday now? They tape Superstars on Monday and air it Thursday. They do Raw live on Monday. They do Main Event live on Tuesdays and air Smackdown on Friday. Wait, no, they don't have anything for Wednesday. NXT is on Thursday as well, along with Superstars, and it's taped on Fridays? Like, before Raw is aired but it airs after Raw? Right? I'm mostly typing this to get it straight in my own head. Anyway.  

__________________  

**SmackDown (8/8/14)**  

* Man, what a campy name for a show in this day and age. ""SmackDown.""

* I actually haven't watched SmackDown in more than five years, because as I got older I stopped being willing to stay in and watch wrestling on Friday night. Now that I'm even older I *totally* am, though.

* I'm glad they put Ryback and Axel out before Big Show and Mark Henry. If they came out in reversed order I probably would've turned on my stream thinking I mistakenly found one from 2007. I'm also glad that they didn't give Axel and Ryback a televised entrance, so I know I don't have to watch this and I can focus on this.  

* I like Mark Henry. I like Big Show. But seeing huge dudes from the 90's squash ""the next generation of superstars"" is a big difference from what I just watched on NXT.  

* I'm really excited to see more from everyone who used to be in the Shield. I'm sad that I missed their rise, bromance, and fall. Everyone describes it as being legitimately great. 

* You know what I always found funny? ""This guy's talking shit about me in the ring. Play my entrance theme I'm on my way out.""  

* I never thought I'd hear Tyler Black say the words, ""That makes me the future of the company,"" at the top of a WWE stage.  

* ""Raw Exclusive"" lmao what. Dude SmackDown is such a B show. Also I couldn't tell who was the heel announcer and who was the face for a second during Bo/R-Truth.  

* Man the Ziggler/Rollins segment was actually funny. Rollins taking legit shots at Ziggler's career vs. Ziggler saying Rollins looked like Catwoman did crossfit. I don't remember midcarders being this hilarious when I watched.  

* Oh my god the Sandow border patrol segment. Pretty funny, some laughter mixed into the boos. That one hispanic guy clapping. Do racist gimmicks still get heat in 2014? People seemed really amused.  

* John Cena/Brock Lesner? Oh my god it's 2005.  

* I should record how much of this show is flashbacks and promo packages.  

* I've never heard Brock Lesnar really speak before. He sounds like if you took Donna from That 70's Show and slowed her voice down to sound like a dude.  

* Cena is a FIFTEEN-TIME CHAMPION HOLY SHIT WHAT  

* Seems like the SummerSlam theme song is a trapstyle song. That sucks because I love trapstyle and the WWE is known for embracing shitty genres, and I don't want to think of it as being this decade's post-grunge. Then again I used to like post-grunge too. I don't know man.  

* Lilian Garcia was kinda checking out Dolph Ziggler right before Seth Rollins came out.  

* ""Did you say, 'lost to Heath Slater?'"" ""Yes, Seth Rollins lost to Heath Slater. You called the match."" ""...Heath Slater? HASHTAG Heath Slater?"" Amazing.  

* Seeing Ziggler hit a Fame-Ass-er made me mark out. Didn't know he used it. Never before realized just how much he reminds me Billy Gunn.  

* This AJ/Paige program is great. Is it? I read a thread about it earlier and it seems pretty cool.  

* Seriously is the ""he's evil because he's foreign"" thing still happening? So lazy. Also does Jerry Lawler still refer to black wrestlers as ""thugs""? Haha.  

* I'm also excited to see Bray Wyatt. Apparently his best work is behind him and people are getting bored? Sorry that I missed that. The Wyatt Family angle sounded really fascinating.

* They just did a flashback to the previous week. What's up with Stephanie McMahon in the Raw main event? With the weird main segment scheduling + the fact that we're doing the ""people who are super over (D Bry, and by extension, Brie, Ambrose, etc.) versus 'the establishment' really highlights the fact that the more things change, the more things stay the same. Also this Brie Bella girl really shouldn't, like, talk. It's real bad. 

* 9.99!  

* The Twitter stuff reeks of old guys asking their interns how they can ""utilize social media."" Feels forced. Like when television shows teenagers texting and it's always something like ""how r u babe lol :)""  

* Just noticed this recording is from SyFy. What. Okay anyway that's over. Watching last night's Raw now. Wow this post is super long.  

__________________  

**Raw (8/11/14)**  

* This better be better than fucking SmackDown.  

* Turns out I could've skipped all of the above and just watched the Raw... pre-show...? And Booker T's on it?

* Looks like I picked a good week for this. It's Hulk Hogan's birthday so they gave him his own episode. I wonder if they'll do this every year. I wonder if they'll celebrate every wrestler, past and present, who gave their life to entertain Vince's target demo. Owen Hart, maybe?  

* The Mike Lient jokes make so much sense now.  

* 9.99!

* The Longest-Running Weekly Episodic Television Show in History is a comically specific accolade, if you really think about it.  

* I don't get the Kane thing. Oh he referred to himself in third person and said beating Kane is like beating ""two men."" That actually kinda clears things up, in a dumb way. It's oddly comforting that they're still shitting on him with idiotic storylines and retcons. But do they really call him ""Corporate Kane"" and ""Demon Kane""? Please tell me they don't.

* Again, really stoked to see everyone who used to be in The Shield and where they end up. They're cool characters. But this Roman Reigns dude really shouldn't, like, talk. It's real bad.  

* Ha, they're reusing RVD's old theme music. Oh shit it's actually RVD.  

* You really don't realize how much Michael Cole says ""Live on Monday Night Raw"" until you watch the show with the commercials edited out.  

* Wtf that Dean Ambrose gift thing was so campy haha.  

* Wtf that Dean Ambrose 9.99 shill was ridiculous.  

* Stephanie's old theme was way better.  

* This is gonna sound weird, but I've seen this physical therapist girl before. She's a wrestler and I've seen her Twitter page for some reason, but I can't remember why. I have friends in the business, so maybe they did a show with her or something. She's on tv, good for her.  

* The ""yes"" thing was pretty funny. And her putting her in what I'm assuming is D Bry's finisher is pretty cool.  

* The crowd doing the ""yes"" thing, jesus christ. I really wish I was around the see this evolve.  

* Wow it looks like Jack Swagger swallowed himself. Are they just gonna book him against foreign dudes? The gimmick feels less like Hulk Hogan Americana and more like a xenophobe thing. I think Thwagger and Zeb are really likable. Just feels weird. Like he says a bunch of super intolerant stuff and then Jack swings the flag and everyone cheers. 

* Is Claudio a heel? He didn't have an entrance. Do people care about Claudio? 

* Just did my research. Apparently Claudio used to be a ""real American"" too. Ignore my previous questions. 

* Bray Wyatt 2spooky4me. Husky Harris is killing it.

* They keep panning out of video packages to show the package playing on the Titantron. It's weird. Right? Is it weird?  

* WOAH THE SEGMENT JUST ENDED BRAY WYATT 3SPOOKY5ME. Does that bunny mask screamer thing happen in all of his segments?  

*  Things are looking up when the Diva's champ walks out and I'm stoked for the next ten minutes of television. Back in my day, I'd really be dreading the next two-three.  

* Okay Eva Marie is here this won't last long. Wait wtf was she selling after that ""match""? Does anyone have live footage of how she transitioned from blowing kisses to intense pain?  

*  Skimmed the Cena segment. Holy shit that lasted 12 and a half minutes that's impressive dedication to nothing. I maintain that one hour of Raw is wrestling and promos, and the other other is dedicated to commercials, recaps, promo packages.  

* It's pretty funny that they got Florida-Georgia Line to do a promo. I remember people used to say Jericho and Heath Slater looked like them. 

* ""Brie... IF YOU MAKE BAIL"" lmfao both her and her husband are television stars. Also, I feel like Daniel Bryan would send a text like, ""yo I'm watching at home because Raw is live and stuff. I didn't actually cheat on you."" Or even, ""yeah I did it."" If they carry this to/past SummerSlam with her still being like, ""Did it happen, Daniel? Did it?"" I'm gonna be so mad.  

* Dolph Ziggler and Heath Slater are both fantastic. ""That's for you, brother!"" The Slater chant. The post-match fight. I hope all these guys are friends irl. 

* I want Sheamus and Paige to have children so that science can discover a color lighter than white.  

* Orton's mannerisms have gotten better. He actually moves like a snake now. He writhes and slithers.  

* The camera zooms in during impacts to make actiony parts feel more actiony. The show is better produced, but feels more on the entertainment spectrum.  

* Sick ending to Orton/Sheamus. These guys could be franchise players. Are they well-received in the IWC these days? The crowd lost it during the last spot and the build-up was great.  

* Am I fucked up for watching Hulk Hogan's birthday celebration and thinking about how weird it's going to be when he dies? Watching the evolution from Americana Hulkster to Hollywood Hogan all the way up until now. Seeing everyone he outlived. The careers that his has spanned. Idk, I couldn't imagine.  

* Cena/Lesnar? Now? I like how they played Brock's music after he bailed like he has the upper hand going into Sunday.

2de79v,20,2014-08-12,Are there any web dev ladies out there in the LA area looking for a job?,JordanLeDoux,girlsgonewired,https://www.reddit.com/r/girlsgonewired/comments/2de79v/are_there_any_web_dev_ladies_out_there_in_the_la/,"A while back I messaged the mods about this sort of post and they told me it would be alright to post. Well, the company I work at is now expanding our teams, and I'll be hiring several mid level, junior and intern PHP devs for our team.

Really PHP proficiency isn't required in the strictest sense, it's more important to us that we get the right type of minds and the right type of people.

**Additionally, there are SEVERAL front-end dev positions that are available, but I'm not the person in charge of hiring those positions. If you're interested in those positions, you can contact me and I'll put you in contact with the appropriate person.**

So why am I posting here?

Well, as I'm sure many of you know, tech is in lots of ways a boys club. I'm a guy myself, but one thing I've learned quite definitively in my years in this field is that the product is ALWAYS better when the team creating it has as many perspectives as possible.

Hiring the most qualified people is our biggest priority. It isn't fair to the company, the product, or to the person being hired if they are a ""diversity hire"". 

But I also know that there are many supremely qualified techies out there that aren't middle-class white males, and I'd like to at least talk to some people from different backgrounds before making any hiring decisions.

So, all that said, here's a bit about the position(s).

The first position is a junior/mid level back-end web developer. Ideally this person knows PHP already, and is pretty familiar with some best practices, using git, and working with databases (ideally more than just MySQL, but that definitely counts too).

It's important that the person in this position *wants* to continue improving. No matter who we hire, I want to help them get better at what they do, and generally people that *want* to make themselves better are also able to teach me new things. And there's few things I enjoy more than learning something new.

This position would also have to be willing to provide their own perspective and insight on the product itself. I can't be expected to be able to represent all of our users... I'll need my team to provide their perspectives as well, as it will help our product better serve a wider variety of users.

I'm not interested in trick questions, gotchas, and ""magic answer"" interviews. That doesn't help me put together a good team, that just makes me stroke my ego. Instead, we will be trying to really figure out what you're like as a developer, and what sorts of qualities you will bring to the team. 

Good devs can be taught skills, but skilled devs can't always be taught to be good. 

The other position is for a more intern role. You *will* be doing real development work. It's not going to be fetching coffee and cleaning floors (well, maybe just a *bit*). But the last intern we hired became a Senior Dev on our team within a year and a half because of his dedication and skill. It will also be a *paid* intern position.

The reason we're calling this an intern position is because:

- Strictly speaking, *no* experience is required.
- While it would be awesome, *no* well developed PHP development skills are needed (you'll be taught).
- Depending on the situation and your skill/experience, the position might begin as a part-time gig.

All of these are in-house, on site, full employment. Not contracted.

The company is located in Studio City, near the Laurel Canyon 101 off-ramp.

If you're interested, or know someone who might be, please PM me. It seems, unless I *specifically* look for it, I never get responses from any of the skilled women out there in the field. Even recruiters seem to send me an endless stream of the same person with a different resume. :/

This isn't the only place I'm looking for potential recruits, but I feel it's important to make sure you're looking in a variety of places.

Anyway, thanks for your time!"

2dehdi,1,2014-08-12,(21M) Advice on current situation with gf (21F),[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2dehdi/21m_advice_on_current_situation_with_gf_21f/,"TL;DR gf's parents seem two-face, and I am the loser in this all and the villian.

EDIT: still not completely independent as I am a full time college student working internships and hopes for law school.  Same goes for my SO

So me and my girlfriend have been dating for almost four years now since high school. We have our ups and downs like any other couple, but stuff recently makes me want to post to reddit. I come from a fairly loose family in terms of my parents having allowed us to do what we want to an extent while on their own dimes.  Curfews have never really been in effect for me since I was young, and as I do not come from an all-male sibling family, my sisters have had somewhat tighter rules than me, but not by much.  

Onto my situation, my girlfriend has an older brother that has always had similar freedoms as me.  Despite this, her father tracks everyone's phone using whatever tool their provider has.  This was, as she put it, for ""their protection"", yet her dad has turned it on before if we have been on dates etc.  She also has always had a curfew for 11 o clock while living in their house {we ditched the curfew in college since she was not living at home), and I have respected it since day 1, though sometimes getting out of movies late etc.  She comes from a very conservative and religious family, while my own family is not religious for the most part, and we respect one another's family.  The problem I have is that sometimes if I want to do something, such as invite her to go along with my family on a weekend road trip or something, they are not okay with that.  But, this also tends to be what she says.  Most of the time I don't even bother asking her parents, and we have done secretive trips and excursions together by circumventing the tracking on her phone.  

This week, a vacation with her grandmother that lives in another part of the country was planned.  They were to go on a cruise for one week, and then she would spend another week with her grandmother, leaving me without her for two weeks.  On the first day of the cruise, her grandmother has a terrible fall, must be rushed to the ER, and I assume their plans are kaput.  However, I find out the next morning, her parents gave an OKAY, whether it be with a lot of hesitation or not I do not know ( she says they were not okay with it and she apparently has to lie and tell people that her grandma stays in the cabin, and a female security guard helps to keep an eye on her on the ship), for her to go on the cruise BY HERSELF.  She buys a plane ticket to catch up to the first stop on the cruise (it is a US territory), and goes on it by herself.  

My own observations about this event have me ticked off, because her parents have given me an impression through this whole curfew and tracking thing that they do not trust me, or her in the presence of me (as she puts it).  We fought via text since she really cannot call or use WiFi on the ship, and I told her I felt untrusted by her family since letting her go by herself did not make any sense when I see how controlling they have been.  I tell her that even my less strict parents would have never let that happen.  My parents find out about this, and my dad calls me at work one morning telling me ""so you got a fucking curfew for this girl, which you respect, and then he okays her going on a fucking cruise all on her own? Give me a fucking break."" And you know what? I agree with this: give me a fucking break.  And that was essentially my attitude when speaking to her.  I tell her something along the lines of ""you don't put a dollar sign on your daughter's safety"" and that this makes me mad because it feels like ""random people on cruise ships have more trust from your father than I do.""  She becomes pissed, saying I am insulting their parenting, yada, yada, yada, and I clear it up for the most part I think.  To be honest I really don't believe she would ever be unfaithful to me.  Hell, I trust myself less to be faithful to her than she to me.  But nonetheless I always have been. But I feel bothered because I feel I am not in a good position with her parents.  Last summer, before we were both 21, her mother invited me to go with the two of them to a bar that her friends were at, and they let both of them in, my gf because she is a girl, but did not let me in since I am not 21 and am a guy (fuck the system right?) My girlfriend comes out as much as she can to stay with me, but the mom stays in, leaving me outside to kill time.  I was calling up some friends to pick me up to.  At the end of the night, my gf was mad at me, as was her mom, because I had a poor attitude, apparently.  Well how the fuck am I supposed to react in that situation? But that's besides the point.  So, reddit, I don't really know how to move forward from here since I laid these cards out on the table in my argument with my gf, so I wanted some advice for the future. Sorry that this is so long, it just seemed relevant."

2devds,4,2014-08-13,(25F) I'm scared that I've almost reached my breaking point.,BreakingPoint1,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2devds/25f_im_scared_that_ive_almost_reached_my_breaking/,"Ok, here's the gist of it: 

1) I'm currently unemployed and have been struggling to land a full time job in my field since graduating college a few years ago. I had internships in my field for a year after graduation, then it's just been temporary jobs since then, trying to get by. 

2) I'm living in a new city. Moved across the country from my family almost a year ago because I needed a change.

3) What is likely the trigger of my depression: I was sexually abused by my brother growing up and my family doesn't know. I worked up the courage in 8th grade to tell my parents because I was scared and they ended up doing nothing. Never even spoke about it again. I would just have to go with my Mom everywhere after school if my brother was home until he moved away. 

In college I was in counseling, even started on some depression meds for awhile and the counseling was very helpful. I felt like I was making progress in the first few years. I transferred schools and starting seeing a therapist in that city. Ended up trying out a few but never felt comfortable. Then I finally thought I found a therapist that I liked except she neglected to tell me that for 5 months she had been submitting to my insurance and there were problems so I ended up getting a hefty bill that could have been avoided had she just told me, and it ended up crashing and burning because she made it all about money. Haven't been back to a T since then and it's been about 3 years. 

I've battled depression for such a long time it's basically all I've ever known. I don't know how to BE happy or just BE. I can't help but think that many of the problems in my life are tied to the depression and the abuse such as having a persistent problem with my weight. It's always fluctuated and now I'm at the heaviest I've ever been. I'm a female, 5'2"" and weigh 180 lbs. I hate the way I look now but haven't been able to get motivated to change it. 

BREAKING POINT: 

A few months ago I found out the brother that abused me is going to have a baby. His girlfriend is pregnant and due in September. I've really been struggling with this internally for months. Blocking it out for some time and then crying hysterically at others. This weekend is a family wedding and I'm traveling back to the other coast. It's not my home but my entire family will be there, including the brother that abused me and his now pregnant girlfriend. On top of that my only sister and I have been fighting for months. I haven't talked to her in a long time and haven't seen her since I moved almost a year ago and she will also be a the wedding. She feels like I don't love her and don't want to be close, I feel as though no matter what I will never be able to be close to her because I can't tell her about my brother. It would destroy her and destroy my family. I know it's my responsibility to protect that child from my brother, but I'm not sure how. 

I feel like I'm on the verge of a breakdown. There are too many things going wrong and for the first time in a long time I've been considering suicide again. I've always been too afraid to consider it for long, but I just don't know how to continue existing this way. I feel like a failure in so many ways: overweight, no job, feel as though I'm not good enough or worthy enough to be loved. I've been trying to put on a brave face and get through things, but, I'm tired of being strong. Just...help?

Thoughts and advice welcome."

Climbing the corporate ladder: I have just started a new job at a big law firm. I am only just above the interns and i'm getting paid a pittance. With tens of thousands of dollars in student loans i will do anything to work my way up. I am slaving away on a case one night, i'm pretty much the last one in the office when you, my boss walks past and comments on m hard work. i say 'i'll do anything to get ahead. Anything? you question. You tell me to come to your office. When i walk in the door you pull me to the floor with my tie and put you foot on my face. ""welcome to the quickest way up this company office bitch""

Who's a good boy?: You have been moaning at me for weeks, begging to get a pet, a kitten a puppy anything. Every time i turn you down saying i don't want one and we can't afford one. Eventually you have had enough, you are going to get your pet even if you have to turn me into one.

Locked up: My car broke down, i had to walk home in the pouring rain only to get home and realize i have lost my key. Luckily i left a spare key with my neighbor. I knock at your door soaking wet. Unfortunately you have lost the key so you call a locksmith. In the meantime you tell me to go have a shower. After my shower i leave the bathroom in my towel, i am looking for the laundry to put my wet clothes but can't find it. I call out but there is no answer, after the third door i try i walk into a room that i was not meant to be in. The walls are soundproofed and covered will all manner of BDSM toys and whips and there are some devices in the center of the room. I am about to turn and leave but i hear the door click behind me. I turn to see you. ""oh i'm so sorry you had to see this, i'm afraid i can't let you leave now""
-------------------------------------------------------
There are just a few ideas, and i'm happy to try any you might have. I'm a sub as you can see, my kinks include humiliation, bondage, edging, orgasm denial, pegging, pet play and just about anything else. We can include as many or as few of those you want. My only limits are gore, scat and vomit. As you can see i put a bit of effort into my roleplays so i hope i can find someone who will to."
2df239,3,2014-08-13,"My story if you wish to read, and those damn porta-john bombers.",SupraHighPanda,trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/2df239/my_story_if_you_wish_to_read_and_those_damn/,"Hello ents, I have been wanting to post something about my time with trees for a while but never really got around to it.  I love reading your posts and funny stuff for the last year or so and really enjoy this community.  Anyways a little background.  I have been smoking for only about a year or two now and still consider myself an amateur.  I really started getting into it last year at college and was having a blast.  Beer, bud, and books.  No internship this summer for me, so I decided to take some summer classes online and caddy.  

One of my good buddies from home is an avid smoker and just started smoking with me in college when he would visit.  I knew we would have a ball this summer.  We didn't really have a place to smoke and some of our other buddies that smoked would just rock it in the car and cruise around.  So hey, why not we can too.  We loved that shit.  I do not condone smoking while driving that much, but hey we had to deal with what we had, and we made sure to obey ever other law in the book.  We had a grand ole time this summer.  Every other week or so we would cruise around at night and listen to some good tunes.  Tonight was no other night.  We knew we would be leaving our separate ways back to school soon, so we told each other we would meet up at my house after we left my other good buddies' house.  We had a great time there just playing some NHL 14 and playing cards and decided with a lot of our close friends.  I dropped my car off at home, snuck out of the basement window and hopped into his car.  

I told him to go into one of the usual neighborhoods that we usually smoke in and we lit up my Black Betty.  We both got a couple of rips off her and then all of a sudden there was a cop in the middle of the street talking to two adults.  I immediately put the piece down and tell my buddy to just play it cool and to use your turn signal at the stop sign just past them.  Sweet they didn't see anything.  Not 10 seconds after that turn another cop car drives past us and immediately turns around and puts the lights on.  I tell my buddy, its okay stay calm and we will get through this. 

Luckily Black Betty is a vapor bowl so it didn't smell in the car at all.  Anyways the officer goes on to tell us that the scene we just drove by just had a bomb go off.  What the shit?  This is not going to be good.  The two adults that we saw talking to the cop said a type of bomb just went off in a porta john we just drove by.  The cop is immediately suspicious of why we are driving around in this neighborhood at this late.  We tell her we just left our buddies place and are going home.  Of course home was in no direction in that area so the cops were thinking that we were the porta john bombers coming back to look at their work.  Me and my buddy both know this is not going to end well for us.  Sure enough another cop comes to join the scene and is convinced we are up to no good and asks for us to leave and to search the vehicle for more possible bombs.

Now, I have learned some fun stuff from this website that can be helpful and hurtful. I then tell the officer politely that we have the right to refuse a search unless their is a suspicion.  Nice man we did it!  Hahaha no idiot they clearly have a suspicion to search the car, a damn porta-john bomb just went off, and we are the only two people near the whole neighborhood.  We both got out of the car, and I shoved trustful Black Betty in her back under the seat when they weren't looking.  They know there is something in the car.

While the search is going on, the other cop is telling us to just tell them if we did the bomb to save a lot of trouble.  We both told them that it was really just the wrong place at the wrong time.  They then tell us that they know that we have been smoking a little and just want to get to the bottom of this stupid port-john explosion.  They find my piece and some of the ABV i kept in a pill bottle.  We tell them thats everything and continue to plea for our innocence in the bombing.  They were very cool with the whole smoking thing, but were still positive we are the bombers.  They then have the idea of bringing us two to the other two adults that apparently saw this shit bombing.  Hey we are innocent, but I had a good feeling that the two adults would tell the cops that anyone is the bombers just to get a little closure.  I knew that this would be horrible if they put this shit on us. (Pun intended) 
The third cop that is also there suggests they can do a test for explosion/gunpowder and other boom boom stuff on our hands.  I immediately jump to this and say we would rather have that.  We all know that this would take forever and would be a big waste of time.  I think the one cop regretted saying that so he then says, but cannabis might effect the test.

Meanwhile, my brain is still trying to process this whole event.  I could already see the trouble I would get in with my parents, and it did not look good.  Then all of a sudden, music came to my ears.  It was one of the best sounds I have ever heard.  BOOM!  Another explosion.  My friend immediately goes, well I think that might have been another port-john explosion.  One of the other cops immediately agrees and even gives a distinct location of another construction sight.  I think in my head and realized that it is pretty far away.  At least .5 to a mile away.  The cops tell us it is our lucky day and confiscated my Black Betty and bag I had it in.  Now I don't know if there are any golfers out there, but it was a tee bag from a really awesome course.  I tell the officer very politely if I can have the bag back, it means a lot to me.  He gives it to me and tells us to drive safe home.

We walk back to the car and slowly drive off as the cops turn their lights on and head towards the explosion.  I look at my buddy after he swears and curses about how crazy that was, and I said ""at least I am a little high.""  We laugh and drive back to my place.  Sure enough not a minute after leaving the neighborhood, lights flashing.  They are pulling us over again!  I started freaking out, what the hell is going to happen now.  The officer comes to the car, I forgot to give you your license, have a nice night.  I kid you not when I say this was the best sigh of relief I have ever had.  We drive home, tell each other to keep it on the DL for a while and we shall tell our buddies one time in the future. Easily the scariest moment of my life.  I get home, shower and then tell myself I am going to take a break from smoking for a while. 

I need to do well this semester, so I really am going to try to focus so I can get good grades and get that internship somewhere next summer.  So I just wanted to tell you all thank you for reading my story and for being a great community of people.  And if I have to leave anything for you guys, just remember to be polite and sometimes even honesty is your best option.  The cops aren't out to get us, they are just trying to keep the roads and people safe, and I greatly generally appreciate what they do for us.  Toke on fellow ents, and a special thanks to my buddy for having such a great time with me on our trips and this adventure I will never forget.  Lastly, don't blow up porta-johns thats not cool.

RIP Black Betty"
2dfir2,1,2014-08-13,What would be a good place to learn Spanish and become a SCUBA instructor?,[deleted],travel,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/2dfir2/what_would_be_a_good_place_to_learn_spanish_and/,"Hi! I have about 6-8 months starting this fall to go to a Spanish-speaking country, learn to be proficient in Spanish, and possibly become a certified SCUBA divemaster. 

My current Spanish is pretty basic. I could get by. I am currently a certified rescue SCUBA diver, so I would just have to take the divemaster course and do a month long internship to become a divemaster/instructor. I am not sure about my budget. I can rough it and would like to keep it on the lower end without compromising my safety and health.

I've been to 4 Spanish-speaking countries:

* **Costa Rica:** I hiked Chirripo mountain and went south to the Osa peninsula to see animals (very fun), scuba dive (a-ok), and relax (great). I loved the food and people there. I avoided the touristy areas, but I imagine they are REALLY touristy. I don't know if Costa Rica has great diving spots.

* **Honduras**: I went to Roatan Island mainly to scuba dive. It was fantastic! The food was meh, and the place seemed either really touristy or really local. So I'm not sure if this would be a good place to learn Spanish.

* **Mexico**: I've been to Cancun and Cozumel. Cozumel had great diving of course! I can't remember exactly, but I think it was pretty expensive compared to the other countries.

* **Argentina**: I absolutely loved the culture, nightlife, food, and people here. Many great opportunities for day trips. Would love, LOVE to learn Spanish here despite their weird accents. The only thing is they don't have scuba diving in Buenos Aires or Mendoza, which is where I'd want to go.

I am very open to going to a new country. I would like a place that is not TOO touristy, offers good day trip/backpacking opportunities, and has good food and SCUBA diving spots. Heck, I might even look into Spain! Thanks in advance!"
2dfsn8,15,2014-08-13,[21M] does not feel he is in a good position with gf's [21F] parents and somewhat her,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2dfsn8/21m_does_not_feel_he_is_in_a_good_position_with/,"TL;DR gf's parents seem two-face with more trust to random strangers than to me, and I am the loser in this all and the villain.

EDIT: still not completely independent as I am a full time college student working internships and hopes for law school. Same goes for my SO

So me and my girlfriend have been dating for almost four years now since high school. We have our ups and downs like any other couple, but stuff recently makes me want to post to reddit. I come from a fairly loose family in terms of my parents having allowed us to do what we want to an extent while on their own dimes. Curfews have never really been in effect for me since I was young, and as I do not come from an all-male sibling family, my sisters have had somewhat tighter rules than me, but not by much.

Onto my situation, my girlfriend has an older brother that has always had similar freedoms as me. Despite this, her father tracks everyone's phone using whatever tool their provider has. This was, as she put it, for ""their protection"", yet her dad has turned it on before if we have been on dates etc. She also has always had a curfew for 11 o clock while living in their house {we ditched the curfew in college since she was not living at home), and I have respected it since day 1, though sometimes getting out of movies late etc. She comes from a very conservative and religious family, while my own family is not religious for the most part, and we respect one another's family. The problem I have is that sometimes if I want to do something, such as invite her to go along with my family on a weekend road trip or something, they are not okay with that. But, this also tends to be what she says. Most of the time I don't even bother asking her parents, and we have done secretive trips and excursions together by circumventing the tracking on her phone.

This week, a vacation with her grandmother that lives in another part of the country was planned. They were to go on a cruise for one week, and then she would spend another week with her grandmother, leaving me without her for two weeks. On the first day of the cruise, her grandmother has a terrible fall, must be rushed to the ER, and I assume their plans are kaput. However, I find out the next morning, her parents gave an OKAY, whether it be with a lot of hesitation or not I do not know ( she says they were not okay with it and she apparently has to lie and tell people that her grandma stays in the cabin, and a female security guard helps to keep an eye on her on the ship), for her to go on the cruise BY HERSELF. She buys a plane ticket to catch up to the first stop 
on the cruise (it is a US territory), and goes on it by herself.

My own observations about this event have me ticked off, because her parents have given me an impression through this whole curfew and tracking thing that they do not trust me, or her in the presence of me (as she puts it). We fought via text since she really cannot call or use WiFi on the ship, and I told her I felt untrusted by her family since letting her go by herself did not make any sense when I see how controlling they have been. I tell her that even my less strict parents would have never let that happen. My parents find out about this, and my dad calls me at work one morning telling me ""so you got a fucking curfew for this girl, which you respect, and then he okays her going on a fucking cruise all on her own? Give me a fucking break."" And you know what? I agree with this: give me a fucking break. And that was essentially my attitude when speaking to her. I tell her something along the lines of ""you don't put a dollar sign on your daughter's safety"" and that this makes me mad because it feels like ""random people on cruise ships have more trust from your father than I do."" She becomes pissed, saying I am insulting their parenting, yada, yada, yada, and I clear it up for the most part I think. To be honest I really don't believe she would ever be unfaithful to me. Hell, I trust myself less to be faithful to her than she to me. But nonetheless I always have been. But I feel bothered because I feel I am not in a good position with her parents. Last summer, before we were both 21, her mother invited me to go with the two of them to a bar that her friends were at, and they let both of them in, my gf because she is a girl, but did not let me in since I am not 21 and am a guy (fuck the system right?) My girlfriend comes out as much as she can to stay with me, but the mom stays in, leaving me outside to kill time. I was calling up some friends to pick me up to.

 At the end of the night, my gf was mad at me, as was her mom, because I had a poor attitude, apparently. Well how the fuck am I supposed to react in that situation? But that's besides the point. So, reddit, I don't really know how to move forward from here since I laid these cards out on the table in my argument with my gf, so I wanted some advice for the future. Sorry that this is so long, it just seemed relevant."

In addition to racists thinking its open season on black boys again, everyone and anyone is probably still dealing with all of their annoying life crap too. I went from not knowing whether or not I would have a job at all, to having back to back to back interviews. I'm not complaining about that, but I have an interview tomorrow with a really good company on paper (one of the rare birds that does over a billion dollars in revenue, but is completely unbeholden to shareholders) but I'm not sure its right for me. I *just* moved to Colorado, I don't want to turn around and move to Cincinnati.  I also am not interested in working in the area I got my internships in. I'm just afraid that if I act lukewarm on this job, I'll lose the best opportunity I've had to date from a financial point of view and I'll be back to square one, combing through linkedin again.

•	How much should we be hoping to put down?
•	Is it wise to buy a place if we are only going to be staying in the states for 5 years or should we rent?

by Christie Aschwanden

As an undergraduate student in biology, I spent several weeks in Costa Rica one summer with an older graduate student on a research project deep in the cloud forest. It was just the two of us, and upon arriving at our site, I discovered that he had arranged a single room for us, one bed.

Mortified but afraid of being labeled prudish or difficult, I made no fuss. I took the lodge owner aside the next day and requested my own bed. The problem ended there, and my graduate student boss never made any physical advances.

Reflecting back, I’m struck by how ill equipped I was to deal with this kind of situation, especially at 19. My university undoubtedly had a harassment policy, but such resources were thousands of miles away. I was alone in a foreign country and had never received any training on my rights and resources in the field.

I’d forgotten about this experience from two decades ago until I read a report published July 16 in the journal PLOS One. Kathryn Clancy, an anthropologist at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and three colleagues used email and social media to invite scientists to fill out an online questionnaire about their experiences with harassment and assault at field sites; they received 666 responses, three quarters of them from women, from 32 disciplines, including anthropology, archaeology, biology and geology.

African wild dogs hunt in selfless packs to take down big game; a survey finds that female scientists still face sexism in the workplace; researchers use blue light to turn off hunger in mice. David Corcoran, Michael Mason and Joshua A. Krisch

Almost two-thirds of the respondents said they had been sexually harassed in the field. More than 20 percent reported being sexually assaulted. Students or postdoctoral scholars, and women were most likely to report being victimized by superiors. Very few respondents said their field site had a code of conduct or sexual harassment policy, and of the 78 who had dared to report incidents, fewer than 20 percent were satisfied with the outcome.

The findings are depressingly similar to the data some colleagues and I collected this year from an online questionnaire sent to science writers. We received responses from 502 writers, mostly women, and presented our results at M.I.T. in June during Solutions Summit 2014: Women in Science Writing, a conference funded by the National Association of Science Writers.

More than half of the female respondents said they weren’t taken seriously because of their gender, one in three had experienced delayed career advancement, and nearly half said they had not received credit for their ideas. Almost half said they had encountered flirtatious or sexual remarks, and one in five had experienced uninvited physical contact.

Given their voluntary nature, neither report can be expected to tell us the true incidence of sexual discrimination and harassment among scientists and science writers. Still, the volume of responses sends an unmistakable message: Four decades after Title IX outlawed sex-based discrimination in public education and 23 years after Anita Hill pushed sexual harassment into the limelight, bias and harassment continue to hinder women’s progress.

Dr. Clancy says she decided to collect data after being overwhelmed with responses to a post she published on her blog at Scientific American in 2012. A female student, “Hazed,” recounted life in her graduate program:

“My body and my sexuality were openly discussed by my professor and the male students,” the woman wrote. “Comments ensued about the large size of my breasts, and there was speculation about my sexual history.” Her professor, she said, “often joked that only pretty women were allowed to work for him, which led me to wonder if my intellect and skills had ever mattered.”

Comments and emails poured in, Dr. Clancy said: “One story quickly became two stories, and quickly became what felt like 100.”

Similarly, our survey of writers grew out of well-publicized harassment accusations against a prominent male editor who was a mentor to many female writers. Those incidents led women to come forward with their stories of discrimination throughout the profession.

In academia, accusations of sexual harassment or assault are usually handled internally, Dr. Clancy says, and this can create powerful incentives to cover up bad behavior, especially among perpetrators with tenure and power. “I’ve heard too many stories about the professor who isn’t allowed to be in a room with X, Y and Z anymore,” she said. Sometimes perpetrators even benefit by getting out of dreaded teaching assignments while keeping their jobs.

Harassment among science writers spawned a hashtag, #ripplesofdoubt, to describe how harassment undermines women. Some women who had been passed over for jobs wondered if they had been rejected for their looks rather than their work. Others worried that they might not have attained their positions on merit.

Indeed, data suggest bias in mentoring decisions. In a study published this year, a team of researchers led by Katherine L. Milkman at the University of Pennsylvania sent identical letters, purportedly from students, to more than 6,500 professors at 259 universities asking to discuss research opportunities. Professors were more likely to respond to email from “Brad Anderson” than from fictitious aspirants with names like Claire Smith or Juan Gonzalez. Such bias perpetuates discrimination.

“Our world is small and our resources are scarce,” said another author of the PLOS One report, Julienne Rutherford, a biological anthropologist at the University of Illinois at Chicago. If women are dissuaded or excluded from even a handful of opportunities, she continued, the loss to science is enormous.

Last year, at the annual conference of the National Association of Science Writers, I joined five leading female science writers to present data we had collected on gender disparities in bylines, top-level jobs, awards and salaries, and to recount personal stories of times when our gender had stood in the way of our careers.

Afterward, long lines formed at the microphones as people in the audience stood up to share their stories. Young women told of being harassed by sources. Seasoned journalists recalled male bosses with wandering hands.

Men rose to offer support. The director of a prominent science writing program said that the next time one of his students confided she was being harassed in an internship, he was going to intervene. (Apparently it had not occurred to him before.)

Most men are not creeps, and they have a powerful role to play here. During a field trip at a journalism conference a few years ago, I had an engaging conversation with a keynote speaker. As we parted, he told me, in front of two other men, “Your husband shouldn’t let you out of the house.”

The two bystanders brushed off this insulting attempt at a compliment. It was easier for them to let it go than to call out a friend, and their behavior said it was all right to treat me like that.

Whether harassment or discrimination takes place at a field site in Costa Rica or in a conference room, the problem will not be solved with new rules archived on unread websites. The responsibility for pushing back should not rest solely with the victims. Solutions require a change of culture that can happen only from within.

It will take chief executives, department heads, laboratory directors, professors, publishers and editors in chief to take a stand and say: Not on my watch. I don’t care if you’re my friend or my favorite colleague; we don’t treat women like that.

2di4yd,1,2014-08-13,Complicated financial aid situation. How much should I take out in student loans?,loansorbust,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2di4yd/complicated_financial_aid_situation_how_much/,"I was kicked out of my home and disowned by my parents during my final year of high school. A month or so before that, I was accepted to an Ivy League college that meets 100% of the financial need of its students, which is dependent on the income of parents. When applying before I was kicked out, I used my parents' financial information, and my federal aid (Stafford/Perkins loan/grant qualification) and institutional aid (a need-based grant) for my first year were based on these numbers. Under my father's $100k+ income, I had to come up with about $20,000 out-of-pocket and qualified for $5,500 in federal Stafford loans to help cover that. Of course, I didn't have his support at this point, so I worked hard my last year of high school and and that summer and came up with the money for my first year.

However, my father's income increased substantially and I no longer qualified for financial aid, which meant I could no longer come up with the money for school. After a year-long back-and-forth with the financial aid office about my situation, they would not consider my income independent of my father's for institutional aid purposes, but I was ruled federally homeless and therefore qualify for more federal loans this year. Also, they agreed to cap my institutional need-based cost at what it was the first year, with a small increase each year after, so now it's no longer dependent on my father's income.

Because of those rulings, my cost this year is again $20,000. I should also point out that when Cost of Attendance budgets are calculated (used to determine financial need in the eyes of the college), things like personal expenses and a meal plan and a books/supplies are factored in, which add about $7,000 to the 'expected cost'. The meal plan was mandatory my first year, but this year it won't be, and I've learned to live frugally enough that I don't actually use much of the money allotted for those categories. In reality, I'll likely have to come up with about $12-13,000 for the year's tuition+room+fees bill. I also need to cover food and personal expenses, but again, I live on very little.

I am going to finish my summer internship with about $9-10,000 in savings -- about as much as I had this time last year. I spent the entirety on it to cover first-year costs last year (plus the $5,500 Stafford loan and some work during the school year).

However, this year I qualify for much more in federal loans. I can take out up to $10,500 in Stafford loans and $5,500 in Perkins loans. I was also offered loans by the college itself (at the same rate as the Perkins loan) if I needed them.

My current plan is to take out the Stafford and Perkins loans (total $16,000), use them to cover the entirety of my costs this year, and just keep my personal savings in my checking account. I know I can cover the costs with just a few thousand in loans and all my savings, but I'm worried I won't qualify for the loans again next year. The financial aid office told me I have to prove my federal homeless/self-supporting status again each year on the FAFSA, and it was a huge pain to get them to make the homeless ruling this year. I'm making solid money and am living in my own apartment and therefore am not homeless, so I don't know if they will continue to make that decision in my favor, and I can't say for sure if I will qualify for any more than $5,500 in federal loans next year.

I think it is best to take out these loans while I can, in case I can't next year. From what I can tell, if I take out loans now instead of using my savings, the worst that happens is I can pay the loans down upon graduation using the savings that I didn't put towards school. Also, if I continue to work at what I'm doing (instead of doing unpaid research, which I would prefer), I will likely be making significantly more at my internship next year (about $17-20,000 for the summer), which means I might not have to take out this much in loans at all in future years.

**tl;dr: I need to come up with $13-15k/year for school for the next three years. I have ~$10k in savings and can potentially make much more each summer. However, I qualify for $16k in Federal Loans this year that I might not qualify for in future years. Do I take out the loans now and keep my savings (and use them to pay off the loans upon graduation?) or take out a small amount in loans and use the entirety of my personal savings to pay for school?**"

2dif0s,0,2014-08-14,I [20 M] have repeatedly broken up with gf [23 F]. Not sure if my mindset/view on relationships is correct.,how_to_relationship,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2dif0s/i_20_m_have_repeatedly_broken_up_with_gf_23_f_not/,"Hello reddit! This one's a bit of a long story, but this issue has been sapping my time and energy for roughly 5 months now, and I have nowhere else to turn. This is about my (20 M) relationship with a girl (23 F).

A bit about me: I'm in college studying a technical major at a large university. Before this relationship, I had no experience whatsoever.

The girl in question: Graduated from college, unemployed (she had a temporary job for a bit it was more of an internship) and living at her father's apartment. Had a few boyfriends before, but never too serious. Let's call her Lucy.

It all started when we stayed the night at a friend's house. Lucy and I ended up sleeping in the same bed, and things got heated. A few days later, we met at my dorm and sex ensued. Before this, I wasn't all that attracted to her: in fact, I thought she was one of the least attractive girls (at least face-wise) out of all my friends. So, during this time we were sort of ""together.""

At some point, I realized that I was also attracted to one of my other friends, say Katy. This soon became apparent to Lucy, who didn't handle it super well. In fact, a lot of drama ensued, involving a lot ""she said this,"" and ""she said that"" amongst our friend group. It's a lot more complicated than that, but I don't want to write a novel, haha. In short, it was not the greatest situation. It took up a lot of my time and energy.

All this time, I was internally wrestling with the fact that I was attracted to Katy, but was sort of in a relationship with Lucy. Lucy and I had a lot of long talks about this to try and figure it out. My reasoning was essentially along the lines of ""you can look at the buffet, but you have to eat at home."" This issue drained a lot out of me, and it contributed to my doing poorly in school.

Near the end of the semester, I decided that Lucy's bad parts outweighed the good. She was 23, unemployed, and lived at home with her dad. She seemed to loaf around all day and didn't try to better herself. This worried me because I want to be in a relationship with someone who has work or a hobby that they are passionate about and engaged in, whether that be a job, taking care of kids, dancing, volunteering, whatever. I also felt like she wasn't the most attractive person, and that I could do better (read: Katy.) The grass was greener on the other side. I also want to experience dating more than one person in my life, and I don't want to end it having only been romantically involved with one person. 

This was a hard decision to make, because despite the long, draining discussions about Lucy's jealousy over Katy, there was nothing super wrong with the actual relationship. I enjoyed spending time with Lucy. We clicked, and sex was good! I found Lucy more attractive now, and she had a nice body. We played video games together, laughed, cooked, gave each other massages, watched movies, and cuddled. When I told Lucy that I wanted to break up with her, there was a lot of crying on both sides, and I felt pretty down for awhile.

A couple of weeks later, I told Katy I liked her, but was rejected. 

Fast forward another few weeks, and Lucy and I found ourselves at the same social gathering. All at once, everything that I missed about her hit me, and I desperately wanted to go home with her. I asked to, and Lucy said yes. However, it felt like a really bad idea, and I quickly consulted a very wise friend who knew about the situation. The friend advised me that this was probably a bad idea, because she felt that I was just lonely. Also, it didn't help that I had been drinking a little that night. So, in the end, I didn't go.

Later on, I gave in to my feelings and told Lucy that I'd like to try again with her. She accepted, and we did some things together again. Soon though, we were having a discussion and she explained to me why she was unemployed: she felt discouraged because many people were better than her at everything, so she thought the solution was just not to try. I was extremely appalled at her mindset, and in the heat of the moment I told her that I wanted to stop seeing her. Again, tears.

Then, Lucy got her temporary job/internship. I came back to her. Then, we stopped again, again at my behest because I felt like I didn't value her enough. I still felt that I could do better in terms of attractiveness, and that she wasn't ""good enough"" in terms of future and financial stability. Essentially, I didn't want to be tied down to this one person who I couldn't see myself marrying due to negative traits (lack of effort with everything.) I felt like if this was my mindset, this would be unfair to Lucy, and the relationship would not go anywhere.

Here's where the bad part happens: I completely crumble and lose my self control, several times. I repeatedly visit Lucy at her apartment despite having told her that I wanted to break up. The problem was that I kept on seeing her at events we both had to go to, and every time I saw her I would just go home with her and stay the night. We have sex during these times, but my intentions are unclear and I'm very confused about how I feel. I don't know if I want to pursue a relationship with Lucy.

Eventually, Lucy becomes upset with me (who wouldn't?) However, she acknowledges that I am very inexperienced, and that I'm displaying a ""grass is greener"" tendency that's present in a lot of 20-year-old males (according to her.) So, she's upset with my wishy-washiness, but at the same time she says she understands. However, her anger was sort of a wake-up call for me, and I tried to put my foot down and stop seeing her. I didn't want to keep on hurting her by coming to her for comfort but not taking her seriously.

So, we stopped for a week or so. I soon saw Lucy becoming familiar with other guys. One of our mutual friends fed me some misinformation that she was ""all over"" another and was going clubbing with him. I felt ridiculous jealousy, and every time I thought about Lucy with another guy I felt really bad. Those few days were some of the worst I've ever experienced, emotionally. I could barely sleep because I was so jealous thinking about Lucy being cuddly with another guy or (worst of all!) having sex with him.

I eventually reasoned that I was just being super possessive, and that my feelings weren't as much missing Lucy as they were wanting to ""possess"" her (not sexist, I just mean being in a relationship. :P) Anyway, we randomly talked again, and she explained that she hadn't even been interested in the guy, and that our mutual friend had been mistaken.

We talked some more, and Lucy invited me over to her apartment again. She said she knew she was being dumb, but she just really liked talking to me, playing games with me, being held by me, etc. I refused because I felt it would be a bad idea given my mindset about the relationship. She persisted for a few days, but I kept on refusing, even though I was sorely tempted by the thoughts of the fun, cuddles, and sex we would have. 

Then today, I actually broke and asked Lucy if I could stay the night at her place. This time, she was the one who refused me. I was sad, but I'm proud of her for being clear-headed.

So, this is where I asked your guys' opinions on what I should do. Am I actually just a huge dick? I feel like I've handled this situation quite poorly, and when I reflect on it I'm not proud of my actions. 

And what about Lucy? Are her perceived inadequacies worth ending an otherwise enjoyable relationship over? Are my possessive feelings indicative that I really like her, or just that I'm a possessive person? Is my ""wanting to date more than one person"" desire completely dumb and a result of me being very inexperienced? Is the grass actually greener on the other side, or should I try and water this side and work on my relationship with Lucy?

**tl;dr**: Not sure if girlfriend's flaws are worth breaking up over, or if it will get better if I put time into the relationship. Don't know if ""wanting to date more than one person in my life"" is valid."

2dj290,0,2014-08-14,"M, 26 left and broke me (f, 23) in two, I made a lot of mistakes too but never gave up and believed in our love. Looooong story",beingwallflower,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2dj290/m_26_left_and_broke_me_f_23_in_two_i_made_a_lot/,"I just want the opinion of people who can view this objective.

I come from a broken home, fighting divorced parents, always needed to care for myself and for my brothers. My mom spend her days at bars, had a depression and a drinking problem so I took the household on me, cleaned up every week, often cooked, ironing, but my brothers messed the house up a day after I cleaned, was a waist of time to keep the house tidy and cosy.  I was bullied at school and my eldest brother terrorized me at home. Calling out the worst names, fucking my room up, the door of my room had a lot of bumps from his fists. 

Then I went to college, things started to change, I had the chance to go and live above my moms bar and have my own place.(I know it's ironic since her drinking problem, but she is so accustomed to it that she functions while drinking) . I was of course still close to my mom and her guilt trips.  I had to work in her bar because she paid so much for me and stuff. While on college, I got to know new people, my self confidence improved. I started to take care of myself and I changed, I got more beautiful on the outside

A friend at College took me to a party where I met my ex he was my first love. We started talking and there was an instant click, a few days later we already set a date up in his village and a week later we were already a couple.

I will start at the beginning of our relationship. In the beginning everything went very well as usual in relationships, we were really best buddies and we had so much common hobbies, music, etc. we were exactly ying and yang. I was very happy that finally someone had an eye for me and that appreciated me and really listened to me.
It struck me that he regularly dropped the name of his ex. They had been together six month and three month apart before he met me. She had hurt him a lot and he still had to ventilate that occasionally. When I had heard the name just a little too often, I asked him if he was really over her, which he said he really was completely. I had seen a picture of her and I thought it was really a beautiful girl, so I started to feel jealous. 

When we were together 6 months I was sitting alone at his appartment and his computer was on, I know it's very wrong of me but I went on it and opened his facebook. There I saw that when we were together for three months he had sexual conversations with five girls. I  confronted him and he said to me: Yes I was your very first bf and I didn't know if you would stay with me, you said in the beginning of the relationship also ' I don't know if two people can stay together for the rest of their lives ' and that was his excuse for the conversations?! He said it was a big mistake and that  I was everything what he needed. I forgave him. Since then he always plugged out his computer. I then told him that I find it very strange and even doubt him more because of it. He answered that he doesnt like it if I would tresspass his privacy again. Then we had a long talk aout mistrust and talked everything out. It was hard for me to trust him at first but then his behaviour proved that I could trust him again.

8 months in the relationship:
I left for 3 months to do internship in Bolivia to work with streetchildren, He wanted to come also after one month because he said he couldnt miss me that long.  Just before the trip I got derealisation and depersonalization, Depersonalization is a term used in Psychiatry (which could be translated as self alienation. It is the feeling to stand outside the reality. For someone who suffers, it seems to he a depersonalization or other role plays in the world, vaguely, as in a dream, insignificant. A patient experiences a separation between themselves and the world, his identity or physicality. People who have experienced this state of mind, often describe life as if it were a movie, unreal or hazy. Awareness of their own personality is less (hence the name). Whose symptoms and looks in the mirror, to see an unknown, but is at the same time seems aware of his identity. The cause of depersonalization is often in a psychological trauma.)

I think that striked me because of the fear that I had for the trip, and pent up fears and experiences from my past that suddenly came up. That whole trip and internship was an emotional low point in my life and very weird experience. 

He tended to have agressive verbal outbursts. He has some anger problems. Something really stupid happened and he just jelled and and called names to the person he was attacking verbally. That happened 3 times during the trip and everytime I was baffled and had no clue what just happened.
For example, we entered the bus and had to go through a terminal. I had his ticket and I was already through the gate and he came up behind but the man who received the tickets didnt want to let him through. He began yelling and screaming like a maniac at that man who had to receive the tickets. Everyone was really surprised watching him like' dude what is your problem '. I immediately shut myself down and didn't know how to react. 

A month later we were travelling and he took me to a mountain. He has asked me to marry him. Of course I had derealization and with his anger problems I couldnt say yes to him. But I also didnt say no, I told him it was bad timing.

After the trip my derealisation still was present. We made plans that he would come to live with me because we lived 150 km apart. He did and everthing changed, we really got so attached and our relationship went better. He did go to a psychologist for his anger problems.  
I needed a car because I worked for a few months and he gave me half of the money because otherwise I couldnt afford it. When he did that I was so thankfull for that. He always supported me and did everthing he could to help me out. He loved me so much, the way he looked at me, was like I was magic.

After a year living above my moms bar he wanted to go and live in the city because he did not always feel well above that café, he wanted some more privacy, I could also really understand but I studied and financially it was super hard for me. Against my gut feeling I moved to the city. He said that he was going to pay the rent and that I just needed to pay the grocerys and stuff. Everything actually worsened there. We lived in a small studio where I totally not felt at home. I started to push him away often and got a lot of doubts about the relationship, I think because we lived so small. But I just wanted some space and he could not give me that. I went back regularly to the café to take a breath. He took my need for space very personal and thought I fled from him. 

However, I have always been very honest with him about my feelings. But he could not believe me. I also started to get doubts about our relationship, but began to fight against those doubts because I realized that we were not in the most pleasant conditions. I have told him about the doubts, but said that I really just want to be with him. And asked If we could move to something bigger, I was going to work and study to help finance it, he agreed. 

Then there were problems coming back again and again, discussiong who kept repeating and repeating. I said to him that maybe its better if we went our separate ways, but then we talked the whole night trough and decided everything could be different if we would move to a bigger place where we both have our own space. 

Also it was hard for me to be in the relationship because I didnt know who I was, but I knew deep down inside that I couldnt live without him.I started to go to a talking group about depression and that helped me alot. 

A few weeks later I discover that he has cheated on me with a girl he had met after his first band show. He also had conversations on facebook about the problems in our relationship with her. I have confronted him and sent him out, that I would get all my stuff the next day. He knew very well that cheating for me was like putting glass in my eyes and twisting it.

The first days that followed I was very angry with him, but then I started to read a book about attachment styles and how that can affect a relationship and my eyes were opened. I sent him text messages directly about my revelation. And that I could change, I would make every effort if we were to give the relationship another chance. 

He didnt want to proceed the relationship, he said that he needed more attention from his girlfriend and that I didnt give him that. And its true the last year I pushed him away, he always wanted to cuddle and kiss and a lot of times I was just not feeling like it. He also said it would be better for me, maybe I could heal now. He said that love is sometimes also letting go. He said that I would be in his heart forever and he would carry me with him everywhere, that he was going to miss me but that we'll get used to that feeling.

When I think about it, twee weeks before we broke up he said to me: I cant live without you. And now he suddenly can haha ...


I've already admitted errors and told him what could change. The only thing I wish was that he would give the relationship another chance.  He has given me so much and I could not always return the same amount.  He was always there and would've  done everything for me.  He thought I would not change despite all those insights that I had gotten the last days. The core of my problem is that I'm not confident enough and that radiated itself out on the relationship.

We were together for 3 years.

When I type this out I see a lot of shitty stuff in the relationship, but I cant help that I love him so fucking much. It's unbelievable. 

It was a hard time for me after the break up, I hadnt experienced it before, I felt like I lost it all, life had no more meaning for me. The first weeks I couldnt eat, I lived on coke light and cigarettes. Now it's getting better with me, but I still miss him like hell. We are apart for 2 and a half months now.

3 weeks apart and he was already in a relationship with his ex that he talked about in the beginning of our relationship. LIke wtf. He said that he ran into her while going out with friends and that there was a click. 

I thought things couldnt go any worse but they did. He just tore me apart and why the fuck do I feel like he is my soulmate after all the shit he put me through.

After the break he also told me that I have been the most important women in his life. I made him into the person he is today, i refined him he said.

He wants to keep me in his life, but Im doing NC right now because I dont need this shit, but I still love him. 

Last week I saw him visiting my neighbour, which he was friends with but it was weird that he visited him so fast, I had the feeling that he was checking me up or something? 

Then I got a message from him that he was sick, and something was off with his bloodcells and he is afraid to have cancer and he hasnt told anyone about it. I just said that Im here if I could help him with something. That was the last I heard of him. In two weeks he will have the bloodresults so then Im going to check up on him, but thats it.

I just needed to pour my heart out and need some advice...

My story is very similar to you all. I started smoking with friends in college, then it progressed. Now it's been 18 months straight that I've been smoking.  I would smoke 4 bowls a day and opposite of most smokers,I made a ton of friends while smoking. A lot of them still don't know that I'm a toker. Smoking just relaxes me and I can start a conversation with anybody about anything.  It's been really amazing making new friends but I really need to, have to stop.
I am getting closer to graduating college and before we graduate I have to do a internship.  The internship will be hair follicled tested.  I'm allowing myself at least 7 months smoke free for the test. Once the internship starts, I basically have to stay smoke free. After the internship,  we still have to do some course work with the company. So here I am on day 1 and it's very hard. I am already wanting a bowl. Any advice to help my craving?  
I am really feeling the struggle right now."

What do I do?",imawfulthrowaway,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2dk49d/me_21f_with_my_boyfriend_26m_of_3_years_i_just/,"Okay. This is probably going to turn into a wall of text, so please bear with me. I'm frazzled, a mess, and bawling my eyes out at the realization of what just happened.

Last year I started at a new school. I earned my AAS and transferred to a state university about an hour away from home. I got an internship at an insurance firm that is headquartered in town here. This summer, I rented an apartment to live closer to work and then school so I could get out of the dorm. 

While working this internship I met a guy. We'll call him Chad. Chad was everything I look for in a guy. He was super intelligent, charming, sweet, cute, romantic, and quite handsome. I was a new girl in a new town so when he invited me to lunch with some fellow coworkers, I jumped on the opportunity. About once a week for 3 months we would go to lunch with a group. Then he asked me to go on a different day. It was just the two of us. Then it turned into lunch 3 or 4 times a week just the two of us. Then we would go check out movies and other things to do as well.

I was crushing on him, but dismissed my feelings. I have a boyfriend. I love him very much. He means the world to me. He was the one who helped me get into school. He helped me study. He fixes my car. He takes care of me. He does anything and everything I need without ever even being asked.

My boyfriend is a single dad. He has his son all the time, no mom in the picture at all. He has a great job with a great career ahead of him. He has his own house. He is very responsible and down to earth and goal focused... But he hardly has a romantic side to him. 

Chad on the other hand is a very free spirit. I loved being around him. He has a charisma to him that I've never seen before. He's the life of the room every time he walks into a room. He's cool, calm, calculating. He can captivate an audience and knows all the right things to say at all the right times. He goes on week long vacations to Europe or the Caribbean or Hong Kong. 

Today was the last day of my internship with the company. They took me out for lunch and we had a good time. They told me that I could take the rest of the day off and call it a full day. Chad came to lunch too, but it was his day off. He asked if I wanted to go grab a drink or something, but I said I'd rather just go home and I had to catch the bus to make it there quickly. He offered me a ride. When we got there I asked him if he wanted to come in and watch some netflix or something and he agreed. 

We got inside and picked out a scary movie. At one scene I jumped, and being used to watching these with my boyfriend, grabbed onto Chad. I immediately apologized and said I shouldn't be doing that kind of thing, especially having a boyfriend. He said its okay, he didn't mind at all. Then our eyes met. He kissed me, then I kissed back. We were like two teenagers making out in a car for the first time. Clothes were coming off. I said we shouldn't, I have a boyfriend. But I couldn't stop myself. I went down on him. He went down on me. We started having sex.. I didn't even put a condom on him. We finished and made out some more. Then he left. 

As soon as he left I screamed WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING at myself. I can't believe I let that happen. Part of me wants to tell my boyfriend. Part of me wants to keep it a secret and move on.

What do I do?

TL;DR - I'm an awful human who can't keep her legs shut."
2dk654,5,2014-08-14,"Me [23 M] with my ex GF [23 F] &gt;5 years, recovering slowly after a breakup",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2dk654/me_23_m_with_my_ex_gf_23_f_5_years_recovering/,"[Update here](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2fwsjc/me_23_m_with_my_ex_gf_23_f5_years_recovering/)

I'm anticipating this to be long. To be fully honest, this is mostly just an outlet for me to rant, but I would appreciate if anyone has any useful feedback for the way I've been interpreting and handling things.

I began dating my (ex)girlfriend ""Alice"" about 5 and a half years ago, near the end of my senior year of high school. She was my first serious relationship. She had just gotten out of a 2 year thing with another guy. She told me that they broke up because ""there was no spark left, and things were dying down"" (This will become important later). I loved everything about her. We got in to different universities which were about a 3 hours drive separated, but we both wanted to give it a shot. I'd say that we were very good at long distance. We would talk virtually every night for like an hour, text throughout the day, and I would visit her whenever I could. It was during the first 5 or so months of the long distance part that we started really committing to each other and planning our next steps. I ended up landing a couple really sweet summer jobs, and was lucky enough to afford a Caribbean vacation for both of us. We helped each other through personal problems, and we always made an effort to keep things fresh. I'd send her flowers randomly, surprise her with last minute visits, and there was never an indication that anything serious was wrong. Obviously, like any relationship, there was the occasional fight or misunderstanding, but we always both worked hard to get through it.

By the end of 4th year, we were coming up with concrete plans to move in together. I graduated with a professional degree, so I was in a position to start looking for full time work, directly related to my field. After school, she went through a series of internships, and began some freelance consulting work with hopes on becoming full time with one of her clients. Her work wasn't as steady, but we sat down and figured out that we could afford to move out. Something we were both extremely excited for. I'd say that she was even more eager than I was. Her only concern was that we might become complacent, which would prevent us from progressing the relationship in to marriage. She wanted to be engaged within about a year after we moved in. I thought this was a perfect opportunity to start saving for a ring. It's what we both wanted.

We moved in together this past May. Our spending agreement was based proportionally off our respective incomes. I thought this was a good way to share the expenses while keeping in mind that we were making different amounts of money. I couldn't have afforded to support both of us on just what I made. However, it left me paying significantly more than her. We created a spreadsheet to help us plan our expenses, and savings plan. My family recently started a business to which she began to get herself very involved in. She started to think about maybe becoming a doctor, so I began helping her learn some science courses which she would need to take the MCATs. I say these things to show you how committed to each others futures we were. She even planned out a day where we had our parents over so they could meet and talk.

In our culture, it's almost a rite of passage to take an organized free trip to a specific country. I did something similar before ""Alice"" and I started dating, but she never had the opportunity to do that. It was fantastic news for both of us when we found out that she had been accepted to go. Since we were used to long distance, this was nothing new for us, and it was only 10 days, so it was not a big deal. 

First couple days she was there was almost just like at school. Lots of ""I love you"" and ""Miss you"" texts. There was a day less than a week in to the trip, where her responses to me were suddenly cold. No ""I love you,"" no ""I miss you."" Maybe she wanted space to have a great time on vacation. I swallowed my insecurities, and only messaged her with the occasional ""hey, hope youre having fun!"" A couple more days passed, and I get an email from her telling me that she would be extending her trip for another week. I was very happy that she had the opportunity to do that, but also kind of annoyed since it would go past my birthday. We always make a big deal out of birthdays. She hadn't even acknowledged that it was my birthday, and when I brought it up, she gave me some half-assed reply about forgetting about it. This made me very upset. However, I recognized that I needed to give her space until she came back, or else she probably would have resented me for putting a damper on her chance to be independent. I said ""okay, can't wait till you get back!"" And that was the end of that. She didn't make any effort to message me for the rest of the trip, and didn't even tell me her return flight info until hours before she took off. 

When she got back from vacation, she spent the day at her parents house. I came home after work and waited for her. She walked in the door, and told me we needed to talk in the way that every person in a relationship kind of dreads. I asked her if she had cheated on me or met anyone else, she reassured me that she didn't.

Before I continue, I should mention that our relationship was especially ""cutesy,"" and this kind of helped us develop a closeness that I felt was very unique. We were very affectionate.

I've never seen this person I thought I knew so well, be so cold. The conversation that followed was almost nightmarish for me. With a complete poker face on, she told me how the ""spark had been gone for a while,"" (complete lie) and how she found that she wanted to explore the independence she found on vacation. As she was telling me these things, I couldn't help but look back on all the times she told me that I was the only person she truly liked in the world, and that she couldn't imagine life without me. She told me about how she met a girl on vacation ""Beth"" who she quickly became friends with, and who helped with this decision. Alice said that Beth told her that she was ""on team Alice."" This hurt me, because it somehow implies that I was not. Furthermore, I think that a true friend would never encourage their friend to walk out on a 5 year committed relationship. I asked Alice why she didn't tell me any of this before she left. Why had she only brought this up now, after she made this huge decision? She told me that she didn't know until she was on the trip. Interesting, considering that she had just finish saying that the ""spark had been gone for a while."" I got sick of looking at her emotionless face, and walked out. I couldn't take it anymore.

The immediate aftermath for me was pretty much the cliche post-breakup story. I ended up keeping the apartment and taking on the full lease, and we settled our finances. Blocked her on Facebook, started a more defined workout routine, playing more ultimate frisbee, spending a whole lot more time with friends, took a trip to visit my old roommates, and just saying yes to absolutely everything I can.

About a month has gone by now, and just last week I hear that she is seeing someone who was on her trip. All the painful sinking feelings I spent a month beating the shit out of, have come right back. There's no way that this relationship didn't at least start to develop while she was there. She let the adoration of some cute guy completely demolish all the feelings she had for me, and all the work we both had put in to us. And she lied to me when she said she didn't meet anyone. Coward. What a weak, superficial person. I feel so much anger now, and I know she isn't worth my anger, but I can't keep myself from feeling it. She once told me how generous I was for paying for so much throughout our relationship, and investing so much time to help her learn science courses. I don't think I was being ""generous,"" per se. I believe that real love is a two way street, and I was willing to invest everything to make it the best it could be. The fact that she interpreted my efforts as generosity tells me that she had little understanding of what true love really is. She never saw it that way. I think she saw it as two people getting enjoyment out of one another. She didn't understand that it took work, and that's what made it valuable. When she saw another person come along and imagined that life could perhaps be funner with them, she felt no qualms in tossing me aside to pursue it. 

I still feel like shit, but people keep telling me that it will get better. I believe them, but I am impatient. I'm frustrated that she apparently finds it so easy to move on and start something with someone else. I shouldn't care, but I do. It just makes no sense. One day she's swearing that she could never be with anyone else, and the next I'm meaningless. 

Again, I'm not sure what any of this is for, but maybe someone will read this and find solace in the fact that they're not alone. It sucks, but I keep telling myself that I'll be better for it eventually. Whatever.

2dkplk,5,2014-08-14,28 year old scientist with a checkered past now looking to medicine - What are my chances?,nucleosome,premed,https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/2dkplk/28_year_old_scientist_with_a_checkered_past_now/,"Hello everyone.  I wanted to see if anyone has any idea what kind of chances I might have getting into a medical school if I apply this year and if not, what I need to improve.  Here's a bit about me:

I'm 28 with a BS in Biochemistry (Undergraduate GPA 2.97, SciGPA 3.4.) I matriculated in a PhD program in biochemistry/biophysics and received a 3.4 GPA after 4 years.  As an alternative to taking the semi-annual molecular biology focused GRE, I took the MCAT and received a 36S (that score is now expired so I'll have to retake)

During my 4th year of grad school it became clear to me that I did not have a passion for the research I was performing and that my lab was about to run out of funding (it did.)  Having been involved in research all throughout undergrad, I was able to receive a job offer from the PI I performed a summer internship with.  I moved across the country and have been a full time researcher at a very well known children's hospital for 2 years now.  The lab I work in is translational in nature and we have medical fellows and surgeons in and out all the time. 

I find myself extremely attracted to a career in medicine after all the exposure I have had to MDs, residents, and to a lesser extent, patients. Both my PI (ped. surgeon) and my department head (a very well known fetal/thoracoscopic surgeon) are supportive of my intent and have offered to write letters of recommendation.   I am doing a bit of shadowing  to get a more full exposure to the clinical side of things and starting this semester, I am taking a couple of graduate level biomedical courses at the ivy league we are connected to.

So I have a bit of a checkered past.  My grades were not the best and I left a PhD program without a degree.  Since then, things have admittedly improved.  However, I know that MD programs are extremely competitive and I am afraid that I don't have a competitive edge compared to all the 21 year olds with 4.0 GPAs and 40 MCATs out there. 

Thank you for your time.

Halp!",Bluenose42,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2dkqm6/me_30f_with_my_boyfriend_34_m_of_six_months_know/,"Hello, r/relationships!  I have a bit of a dilemma...  Throwaway to protect the innocent and the guilty.

TL;DR: Learned some information (BF is still sleeping with his ex), but can't reveal my source (mutual friend, friend of BF's since childhood) because they swore me to secrecy.  What do I do?!

Apologies for length, and any unneccessary details.

So, about six months ago, I started seeing a long-time friend (friends for about 7 years).  We've had hook-ups in the past, but never anything consistent/serious/long term.  

I figured we were just hooking up again.  I had just gotten my heart ripped out by the guy I thought I was going to marry, so I needed someone to be kind, and flattering, and attentive.  He was all of those things.  At one point he told me he was in love with someone else, and it felt like cheating on her to be with me, so we stopped.  He apologized for ""using [me] for affection.""  

About a month or so later, we ran into each other at a party.  The other girl had a new boyfriend now, I found out.  He and I slept together again that night.  After that, he began telling me how much he loved and admired me, how he wanted to be with me, how he's wanted to be with me for a long time, etc.  I had misgivings, but decided to let them go.

Anyway, to make a VERY long story short, things have been rocky between us lately.  He lives about an hour away from me and doesn't have a car, so we haven't seen each other in a few weeks.  The last two days he has been threatening to end things if I don't come see him.  He says when I tell him I'm too busy to go out there I'm making excuses.  And, to a certain extent, he's right.  I'm stressed out (I work, attend grad school, and am doing an internship), and he can be overwhelming in his need for emotional support, amount of sex he wants to have, and just general personality.  

So, last night, a mutual friend of ours (who knows what's been going on with me and the BF because I've been venting to him) called to give me some interesting news.

BF is still sleeping with his ex-girlfriend (NOT the girl he said he was in love with before).  Never stopped, not the entire time we've been together, not the entire time he was going after Other Girl.  According to what she told Friend (and what she's been saying all along, without knowing he and I were sleeping together) they fuck about once a week.  I had my suspicions about this (they were still living together until about two months ago, despite having been broken up for a few years at this point.  She is also madly in love with him, and tells everyone, although he insists he has no feelings for her, and refuses to date her.).  Interestingly enough, she invited people over for dinner at his house tonight, which he claims to know nothing about but I found out through Friend.  I don't doubt her story, I don't see why she would lie.

So, obviously it's time to end things.  That's some bullshit.  So, you would be justified in asking, what's the problem?

Friend swore me to secrecy.  I can't tell BF I know this, because it will be obvious HOW I found this out (Friend and Ex-girlfriend are good friends), and Friend made me promise not to tell BF he told me (Friend and BF have been friends since childhood).

How do I bring this up?

I tried to end things with a vague ""this isn't working out, I'm sorry, I can't handle this right now.""

It took every ounce of self control not to tell him what I knew as he was berating me for not giving this relationship a chance to work and throwing everything away.  He's not really accepting that I'm done.

Is there a way to let him know I know he's been cheating on me that anyone can think of?  What else do I do?"

Be part of community through art and action!  The underpass is located at the corner of Hiawatha and Lehigh in Chicago's Edgebrook neighborhood.  

Upon completion, NCP will be the largest outdoor public art bricolage mural on Chicago's Northwest side.  

For more information about the Neighborhood Connection Project, contact Jac Charlier at jac.charlier@gmail.com or Gina Metelica at gina.metelica@gmail.com

Started in Spring of 2010, the Neighborhood Connection Project (NCP) is a citizen-led initiative to build community by repairing and beautifying the Metra railroad underpass located at Kinzua, Hiawatha and Lehigh.  After securing the input and support of a diverse cross section of the citizens, civics, businesses and the wider community, as well as the support of the 41st Ward Aldermanic Office for required pre-beautification repairs to the underpass, we were joined by our ongoing partners, Green Star Movement (GSM) and After School Matters (ASM).  Phase I underpass beautification efforts were ready to begin and indeed started finally in Spring 2013.  GSM worked with ASM's teen interns and our local artists and community volunteers to produce the mural on the East side of the underpass, which was completed in Summer 2013. We continued together on Phase II completing the West wall work in summer 2014.  During summer 2015 we will finish the project by joining the two bricolage murals together in the center.  The joining of the East and West sides of the mosaic will be done in the same way our American railroads were completed...by meeting in the middle with a golden stake.  In the case of NCP, we will use golden tiles.  The themes of the mural were decided by the community and the actual art reflects both our neighborhood's history, as well as the greenery and vegetation of the area. Special homage is paid to our Native American predecessors and the famous Hiawatha train that ran on these very tracks.  

So far, the NCP community includes:

	* 300+ citizens
	* 60 teen apprentices
	* 23 businesses
	* 7 artists
	* 4 local civics
	* 2 government agencies

2dlbuu,1,2014-08-14,I'm [21 F] moving to a different country and my boyfriend [21 M] of six months wants to break up sometime before I go.,movingaway1111,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2dlbuu/im_21_f_moving_to_a_different_country_and_my/,"This might get a little wordy and I'm sorry for that.

So I've been dating Dan for about six months now, three of them long-distance over summer (I just graduated, he has a year left) since he was in an internship program in another state. I have a job in China teaching and will be leaving for a year at the beginning of October. Dan wants to visit me.

I explained to Dan that I really didn't want what I call an 'expiration date' (ie 'We're going to break up when you leave'). I told him I don't like to think of relationships as set amounts of time and just like to go until it ends naturally. Which might be when I leave, who knows, but I don't want to plan on it in advance.

So talking with Dan today, I made a joke (I'm also kind of crazy and a little insecure, but in therapy and seriously trying to work on it because I've been in abusive relationships before) about him breaking up with me on the plane or something and he was like ""No way, I'm not going to break up with you over the phone."" and that lead to a conversation where he divulged that he was planning on breaking up with me sometime before I left for China. I said, ""What, like the week before?"" and he shrugged and kind of painfully said, ""Maybe.""

So this lead to an argument where I told him that I had previously told him I was not going to do an expiration date, and how I didn't understand the difference between breaking up then and just breaking up now (if we both know the relationship is going to end in x amount of time). 

We ended up fighting and he ended up explaining that a year is a long time and he was going to want to have more time apart when the semester started (in about two weeks) anyway to focus on school (so now instead of a month and a half we have two weeks?). I asked him what that meant and he said he didn't know, that he had enjoyed spending time with me so much last semester but that it did impact his school work, which is something he wants to focus on since he still has grad school ahead and senior year is hard.

I don't know what to do. I don't know if I should break up with him now because I hate the thought of an expiration date and feeling like it's completely my fault (ie the relationship wouldn't have ended if I didn't go to China to teach and had instead stayed in the US and done something else). I also hate the thought of breaking up with him because I love him and he loves me.

It's also complicated by the fact that I've had one relationship that ended when I went abroad before and it went horribly. My ex and I hate each other now and it was painful and long and drawn out. The week before leaving was one of the most painful and worst weeks of my life, just knowing it was going to end but knowing how much I loved my ex. And I'm terrified of that feeling again.

I know he presents a good point, that he doesn't want to break up in any way but in person and doesn't think he could. And if I go to China then it will be a long time before he sees me in person and he might feel trapped or be forced to do something he really doesn't want to do. But if we put an expiration date on our relationship, then I'm forced to do something I really don't want to do. I don't see a good compromise without breaking up now, and that hurts me and confuses me.

Any advice is greatly appreciated.



---   
**tl;dr**: My boyfriend has put an expiration date on our relationship because I'm moving to a different country, something I swore to myself I wouldn't do again after it failed and ended terribly in a different relationship. He doesn't want to break up in any way other than in person. This leaves us in sort of a pickle. Is there a way we could compromise? Or should I just end it now, even though other than the fact that I'm leaving it's a wonderful, fulfilling relationship?"
2dlefa,14,2014-08-14,Network Administrator,Adobes,ITdept,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITdept/comments/2dlefa/network_administrator/,"Hello everyone! I have chosen my career field to be a Network Administrator. Now, I am extremely computer literate, and know how to solve most general issues. I am currently a Junior in Highschool, and want to get a head start on my career, and education. I have a few questions to ask. 
Will I need any certain programming languages?
Will I need any specific certifications that may be possible to attain before college?
What can I do to better my chances of getting a good job? I know employers love to see outstanding things I did before college. Now, take into account that I live in a very shitty rural small town in the deep deep South US. I am soon going to try to intern with my school IT guys. If anyone has any recommendations, that would be great. Thank you."
2dlf01,13,2014-08-14,[Serious] Should I take high school Physics?,TheJewishOlympics,makemychoice,https://www.reddit.com/r/makemychoice/comments/2dlf01/serious_should_i_take_high_school_physics/,"So I just entered my senior year with not the best GPA (2.5, this is from taking too many difficult classes that I could not handle) and my First Trimester is not that difficult. I tried not to make my First tri difficult because it would be on my transcript when I would be applying to College, but it still has some challenging classes. Computer Science AP is difficult, and English is not that difficult but it could be challenging sometimes. I believe that I could at least get an 3.9 (all A's with maybe an exception of a B) and this my last Trimest that colleges will actually look at  with the classes I have (Into into Physc, Applied Spirituality - Required, Sports Medicine - Also comes with internship, Computer Science AP, English 4). I have done the required Science classes(Required amount for College), some of them were Honor Classes (didn't do to well in them). I honestly think if I take Honors Physics I'll end up with a C, maybe a B. If I take regular physics I can attain a B. This will be stressful, especially because of my AP class and sometimes English could be a pain in the ass, but if it makes that much of a difference, I would be willing to take the class. If I stay with my current schedule, I would be able to raise my current cumulative GPA to a 2.8-2.9. I would also be taking Physics without any pre calc or calculus experience (i have trig and pre calc latter on in 2nd and 3rd tri). I want to go to a nice university like Colorado university or CU at Denver, I believe I could get in because I have a good ACT score, but I am really scared about my GPA. I dont want to take physics and end up getting a bad grade. What should I do? Stick to my current schedule which is somewhat difficult? Or should I make room for Physics and end up not getting a better overall GPA?

EDIT: I will be going into to university majoring in either Computer Science or Business, or even undeclared."
2dlgwg,4,2014-08-14,Dealer stories (Cee lo Green and Beaver Bay),[deleted],trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/2dlgwg/dealer_stories_cee_lo_green_and_beaver_bay/,"Here is the story of my adventure of moving to a town in one of the most beautiful areas in the U.S. which filled with a bunch of strange people, and my search for some trees. It is pretty long but definitely worth the read. Please post your stories of interesting dealers and strange mishaps in the comments as well. I would love to read them.
Enjoy.

So I just moved to my new apartment for my summer internship. This is my first job away from home and first time living on my own. 
First, I should probably fingerpaint you a picture of the town I'm in. Probably unnecessary but gonna give it to you anyway. I'm about half way up the North Shore (1 hr north of Dultuth MN) along Lake Superior which has quite a few small towns (&lt;500 ppl) with gift shops and restaurants for tourists. Beautiful drive and awesome rivers with tons of waterfalls, cliffs, swimming areas, and places to hike. The town I was staying in was called Beaver Bay. I expected this to be a nice little area with a bunch of nice old people who would bring me freshly baked muffins or something after I helped carry their groceries. So wrong. I arrived at my apartment after two weeks of calling and leaving messages to their ""office"" hoping they still had the room available for me that they mentioned on the phone about a month ago. I show up and the thankfully the landlord (with 3 screaming kids and one taking his pants off while making cat sounds) has a room open for me. Doesn't ask my name or have me sign a single paper, just gives me a key and takes a check for $375. K bye. Walking to my apartment I see a kid, maybe 8 years old, with no shoes on walking in the street with his maybe 4 year old brother toward the dumpsters with a half filled bottle of vodka and a bucket of paint. 
Ok.
10 a.m., not a single adult outside, wondering if that was his parents vodka, water in a vodka bottle that his parents gave him, or maybe he was just a tiny alcoholic. Bet the landlord didn't ask for his name either when she gave him a key. During the first two weeks the sheriffs pulled up next to my apartment four times for domestic abuse. Not sure why, but everyone in the complex seemed to decide to start their fights on the curb literally right in front of my door. So I quite often had a cop standing in front of my door while I just put my headphones on and blew my smoke out the back window. I even got to see a full out street brawl on a Tuesday evening. I should also mention I am 6ft 8 (lanky) but not worried about my safety while living here. I usually just left early enough in the morning and came  back to my apartment at sundown after hiking. I pretty much kept to myself and had no problems with the Jerry Springer crew outside. However there were a couple seemingly nice people I would say hi to when I walked to and from my car. 
So, I brought about an 1/8 of tree with me from college thinking that should hold me till I find a new hookup since I'd be working all day. So wrong. I smoked it all by the end of the week and really wanted to get some more since I was all by my self in a beautiful area with forests and waterfalls everywhere around me. After work I saw a guy I met a few day's back named Ben. I talked to him a couple times passing and figured what the hell, he probably knows a guy. I asked him if he knew anywhere I could get some bud and just gets quiet and looks around. He whispers ""John will know"". And then turns around and starts to walk away. Ok. I tell him to hold on and ask who ""John"" is and he just points to the apartment above mine and says ""don't tell him I told you"". 

What? Why? I'm bit more nervous and weirded out at this point. I just came from college where you could probably just shout that you need some green in the middle of campus between classes and have a bag in your hand before class starts. I'd been there about two weeks but never saw the guy that lived above me. Most of the screaming and stabbing sounds came from right across the street or next door but I never heard much upstairs. So a bit later I figured what the hell. At least I could introduce myself as the lower unit, maybe get a chuckle and apologize for any loud music or something. If he didn't seem cool just don't mention it and be on my way. I knock on the door and hear ""who is it?"". 

I tell him my stupid joke and hear him laugh and say ""what?"". 

He opens the door and I just stared at him for a few seconds before I regained my composure. The man looked almost exactly like Cee lo Green. Same height, same belly, bald, little earring. Could have been his twin brother. I actually googled it later just to be sure. He opened the door and was wearing a pair of shorts, no shirt, and suspenders with Malcolm in the Middle on in the back (great show btw). I caught my self and told him i just moved in and thought I should introduce myself. I mentioned I loved that show and he laughed a really funny laugh which I will never forget  (kinda sounded like a squeaking guinea pig which made me laugh) and said it was his favorite. He seemed pretty cool, so I kinda casually (probably not at all) asked him if he knew where I could get some bud. He said sure he knew a guy, asked if I had a car, and told me to meet him at 4:00 the next day. I left and was a bit less nervous. He was pretty different but nice enough and seemed harmless, especially considering I was about a foot and a half taller than him. The next day we met up and got in my jeep and he told me where to start driving. It was a bit weird but mostly because I just met Cee-lo and now he's in my car. Then he says, word for word: ""so how much you looking for? 40-50 lbs?""

 My heart almost stopped. I could have driven off a cliff and killed us both. Oh shit. 40-50 lbs? I've never even seen more than an couple ounces at one time. 40-50lbs? Who does this guy think I am? Al Capone? Willy Nelson? How much would that even cost? I didn't exactly bring duffle bags of money with me. How much did he expect I could fit in my pocket? Oh god, did he tell his guy I had the money for 50 lbs of marijuana? What's gonna happen when he finds out I have like 50 bucks on me. I manage to form something comparable to a sentence and say something like ""bluh blah I was um luh looking looking for something more uh kinda like uh 4-5 grams"". I think he understood what I said but was completely calm and said ""cool cool"". 
A little bit of silence and I asked if that was alright and he just said ""sure man"".

 Ok. 

Maybe I'm not gonna get my legs broken or my finger nails ripped out. This could work out. A bit more silence. He then says ""yo man you ever heard of DQ?"".

 DQ? what the fuck kinda drug is that? DQ?
""What like dairy queen? Sure man"".

""Man that place is the shit""

""Yeah bitchin chicken strips""

Ok.

I felt a bit better after he called his guy and asked him if he had some green. We keep driving and I turned on some music. Then he says ""yo man, you ever heard of Philadelphia?""

Philadelphia? What is even happening right now? Is this guy real? Did I drive off that cliff?
""Like the city? In Pennsylvania? Sure man.""

""Philadelphia is the shit man. You'd like it there.""

Ok.

The ride was about 10 min total and we eventually pulled up to a house. Looked normal enough. Nice lawn. Mini Van in the driveway. A hell of lot cleaner that our apartment complex. John, or Cee lo (I prefer), asks me for some cash and I give him 40 bucks. He tells me to wait in the car. Ok. Bit unusual, I usually like to meet the guy supplying me with such a wonderful gift. Maybe share a bowl, get to know each other. Apparently he wants some privacy or has some trust issues. It's alright. There are some strange people in the world. Clearly. So I wait for about 5 minutes and decide to google the mini van's license plate on my phone to see if anything came up. Nothing did. Whats taking so long? 5 more minutes and Cee lo comes out with my 40 bucks. He gets in the car and says he didn't have any change and wanted to know if i could break a twenty and just give him thirty. I told him not to worry about it, the guy could just keep the extra ten. I didn't mind over paying and wanted to start on good terms with this mystery dealer. So he goes back in with the 40 and comes back out 5 min later. ""Hey man, he says he doesn't want to do that. Can we go to an atm or something?"". 
What? Why wouldn't he take it? I grab a ten out of my wallet to split the 20. Cee lo goes in a third time and then comes out a minute later. He get's in and says we are good so I drive. He hands me the tinniest plastic baggie with approximately .5 grams in it. Not even enough for a joint. I was a bit confused why it was so expensive but was gonna be making some good money and was clean so I said ""Thanks man this is great. But I was kinda hoping for something like an 1/8th.""

""Sure man. definitely"" he says as he nods his head.

Ok.

A bit of silence, and it came to me. This guys must have no idea what a pound or a gram or an ounce is. It made sense that he asked if I was looking for 40-50lbs, was't upset when I said 4-5 grams, gave me 1/2 a gram, and didn't say much about the 1/8. This guy must have no idea. Alrighty then. So as I pondered how crazy and unexpected life is and how many strange and interesting people you can meet on the journey, I turned on ""play that funky music"" and drove Cee lo back to Beaver Bay.

They had some troubles dealing with me and my younger sister, but they always seemed to come out really well on the other side. 

Then I went to college.

Now, when I come back to the house, no one ever interacts. My dad sits on Facebook all day after work. My mom makes a thankless dinner every night. My sister, a senior in high school, will just spend the night in her room or out with friends. She does not seem to have any issues with drugs or alcohol, thankfully. My mom is a teacher, so she has the summers off. I was at an internship all summer, so this marks about a year since I've been home regularly. She seems markedly more downbeat, and she has started having wine every night. Now that I'm home, she seems a bit happier and has stopped drinking wine.

My dad spends his entire day on Facebook.  He works as a CFO of a small company, and may have the easiest executive gig ever. His boss let him wear whatever he wants, come in whenever he wants,  and do as little work as possible. Now the owner is leaving, and the new director is on to his shenanigans. She is much tougher on him, so he's quitting. At 55, he's not exactly super employable. I'm afraid he is putting me and my mom's financial life in danger. He is overweight, but not too much so. Lord knows he is trying to get bigger though. His diet is piss poor. He spends his day on Facebook talking to tons of people. He spends his nights out playing shows with his band, leaving my mom at home. When they are out together, he is always making lewd comments about women right in front of my mom. He always jokes about having girlfriends and wanting to talk to ""beautiful women"". I also suspect he is emotionally cheating on her,  with his ex from college. I believe they talk pretty often. He is ruining my trust in other human beings.

I think when I return, things get a bit easier.  My mom seems happier, because she has someone to talk to. I haven't been around much because of my internship and my girlfriend. I feel so responsible for my mom's happiness, but I need to live my own life too. My sister will head off to college soon, and this will be the first time it was just them in 22 years. I'm worried they will ruin their lives with divorce, or even worse,  live the remainder of their lives miserably.

What do I do for them? Do I propose therapy? Am I overreacting? Will they have a chance patch it up once all the babies have left the nest? 

**TL; DR:** My parents are so out of love. I don't think they get along when I'm not there,  and I'm worried a horrible life lies in store for them."

I have tried r4r several times and have had some good luck on here, enough to make me hopeful to try again. 

I'm 20, live in Dallas, work as a Pre-K teacher at a school, a Pre-k teacher at my church, and I'm an intern at a magazine. I am a photographer, I love most sports (i've been surfing since I was 11.) Camping and hiking are amazing!  At the same time I'm really into fashion. 

Anyways, heres the honesty stuff I was talking about. I am a very sensitive person. I want to meet a guy who will tell cute things daily, texts me all the time, ext. Basically really romantic. I tend to always do things like that for my S/Os and end up feeling like it's not reciprocated. I'm a very loving person. When I like someone I want them to know! 

I don't really care where you live, if things work out i'd probably move anywhere for someone I really like. I'd prefer you live in the US though. (I think I could make an exception for an adorable British guy though haha.) I'm into super thin tall guys, like Adrienne Brody or Jesse Eisenburg. I love a nice smile! I tend to like older guys (28-29) although you can be closer to my age as well. 


Hope to hear from you! :)"
2dlvp4,1,2014-08-15,Do I have anxiety?,[deleted],Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/2dlvp4/do_i_have_anxiety/,"Hi everyone, 

I just want to describe some of my symptoms I've been experiencing. Yes, I am going to the doctor soon to get checked out.

So I've been experiencing some of these symptoms for the past year or so...
-Rapid hearbeat (for no reason): I've experienced about four episodes of a very rapid heartbeat in the past year. These episodes all have lasted about 5 minutes. There was no chest pain or dizziness with these episodes. It just scared me and shook me up because of how fast my heart was beating. During these episodes, If I talked to someone my heart would slow down almost instantly. I called my mom during two of them, and talking to her instantly helped. I felt stupid after because of how freaked out I was!

-Problems going to sleep: Now this I have had for as long as I can remember. It takes me about an hour to fall asleep, even after a long day. Once I'm asleep, however, I stay asleep. I also operate fine during the day. Some nights I have not even slept. My mind seems to race at night too.

-Minor digestive problems: Not as concerning to me as the heart and sleep. Over the past year, I haven't had really ""satisfying"" bowel movements. I seem very gassy when I do try to have one. I've started taking probiotics and fiber tablets and those have seemed to help.

-Slight lightheadedness: Again, not terribly concerning. Every now and then, I get somewhat dizzy/lightheaded. I think this is related to my sleep problems. Usually walking or getting distracted helps this.

-With all of this, I just to tend to think a lot and occasionally worry about random things. I don't think I'm depressed, I'm just a little bit of a worryer and overthinker.

Those are most of the symptoms I've been experiencing for about the past year. I don't smoke or do drugs, I'm not overweight (115lbs) and keep a good diet, and I'm generally a pretty healthy person.

I'm about to enter my last semester of college, so of course I worry about things like securing an internship, post-graduation jobs, moving, and finances (but who doesn't?). I'm very excited about my future and everything, but I just tend to think a lot.

I'm a happy and healthy person, but could I have anxiety? I am going to seek a doctor's opinion, but was just seeing what you all thought. Thanks!"
2dm06v,5,2014-08-15,"Calling in the big guns, how to deal with this female AMOG?",[deleted],seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/2dm06v/calling_in_the_big_guns_how_to_deal_with_this/,"**BACKGROUND**

There is a girl who recently got hired as an intern at a company I'm leaving in a few days. I initially thought she was cool, she had a great sense of humour and we got along really well. I joke around a lot, and I can usually give as good as I get.

However she's been saying some really mean sh*t recently. I'm leaving around the same time as 2 other interns and she'll say something to them like ""I'm really going to miss you two.. but I'm not going to miss punchinglines"" or she'll say ""I'm so glad you're leaving"" or ""no! don't leave me alone with him"" etc.  

**BREAKING POINT** (reddit post point)

This evening we all went out to a farewell dinner and at some point while we were standing waiting for our table, she was standing next to me i jokingly threw my arm around her shoulder and pulled her in, and she took my arm off and I shrugged because it was no big deal and carried on with life. 

She then walks behind me to go stand on the other side of the group (which is already an overreaction, but whatever) and bumps into a girl whom I assume is a mutual friend of hers, and her friends, and when the girl asks her if she's okay, she says ""no, I'm just trying to get away from him"" and she then proceeds to point at me. Causing them to turn to me and look at me like I'm a fucking weirdo.

It was so dramatic, and so unnecessary.

**CONCLUSION**

It's annoying because even though I might know she's not serious, others don't, and they always entertain her by saying ""ouch"" to me or by laughing.. 

I don't know what the goal of her aggressive 'negging' is. To be honest, I don't really care because she is not remotely attractive to me. But it's really damaging to my 'image' so how do I put a stop to her crap without showing the extent to which it offends/annoys me?


**EDIT: Thank you for all the solid advice. For those that misunderstand, I don't care about her opinion of me at all. If it was just the two of us when she has said anything like that it would be so easy to ignore. The problem is that it's always around other people.. so remaining speechless makes me look bad, and giving her an emotional reaction (e.g. getting angry) makes me look bad too. Lose-lose situation.**

I have an issue. I am dating an older person. I will spare you the details but he's about twenty years older than me, has a great career, and I'm going to marry him. Please, keep your age-gap judgement out of this. I really get enough of that shitty judgement in my life. You can spare me. Thanks kindly.

I am so happy in my relationship, but I am afraid it hurts my ability to make friends. I am always ALWAYS having so much trouble ""coming out"" to friends about this topic. I don't know how to tell them he's older. I'm afraid that

a) they find out when we are getting to know each other, in which case they will walk away and think it's ""creepy"" or ""gross"", never giving me a chance

b) they will find out when we are friends and not like me for it.

I know, I know -- good friends will NOT care. but I really want to make new friends and I don't want to lose any opportunites over this. I am so depressed because a lot of my friendships have failed.

Last summer I made the decision to better my life by choosing a healthier lifestyle. I had been struggling with control over my health since I was 7 years old but I had only truly attempted to lose weight a few times prior to this. Previously, the largest effort I had made in the past was when I was 12, but it resulted in me regaining everything I lost and more within a few months. To be frank, I don't really know what motivated me to start losing weight. I was working a summer internship so I didn't have very much free time. In addition to that, my sleeping schedule was very abnormal; I would sleep at 8 PM and wake up at 4 AM. Regardless, some part of me decided that it was time to take control of my physical health. Hopefully, some of the things that I share here will end up being useful to one of you. I know that sticking with this can be extremely difficult but knowing that you are able to self-disclipine yourself is one of the most liberating feelings in the world. Do not cheat yourself out of that.

For me, the mindset that accompanied my decision to lose weight was very important. **The realization that self-indulgence through food is merely granting yourself temporary satisfaction in exchange for long term harm** made my new lifestyle choice much easier to adhere to. I think the reason that I failed to lose weight in the past is because I was too young to fully grasp the concept of our actions having consequences. Now, each time I consume something, I think about the impact it will have on my body. This new mindset forces me to think critically before I eat. *Do I really want to eat this? Am I actually hungry right now?* In the past, these considerations never crossed my mind but now thinking my food through before I eat is just as instinctive as washing my hands before I sit down at the dinner table.

I'll be the first to admit that my workout regiment was a bit extreme. There was a point in time where I was classified as ""obese"" (according to my 30+ BMI) but forced myself to run 5 miles a day on a treadmill at a medium inclination and 1 mile a day on a treadmill at the highest inclination. Yes, exercising to burn calories will rarely make a huge difference in terms of weight loss. However, exercising for calories does put such calories into perspective. You force yourself to evaluate how much you value each calorie (which is obviously different for everyone). These workouts were extremely difficult for me and thus, made me realize that overeating was simply not worth it. In addition to this, work outs tend to naturally decrease my appetite as well. I also infrequently planked, did sit-ups and basic lifting although that was much less consistent than the 6 miles per day I forced myself to run each morning.

On the other hand, my diet was fairly standard. I started off most days with a smoothie that consisted of 2 tablespoons of Oat Bran, plain yogurt, and a variety of fruits (never the same fruits two days in a row). I know people on Keto can't adhere to this because this smoothie is very rich in carbohydrates and fairly calorie dense but you have to keep in mind that my end goal was not to lose as much weight as possible as quickly as possible. Rather, I simply wanted to improve the overall health of my body; weight loss was just a part of that. I knew that drinking the smoothie every day would impede my weight loss efforts to a certain extent but it would also provide my body with healthier resources to work with. That was very important to me. I wanted to lose weight the *right* way. Along with the morning smoothie, my meals tended to consist of either Chicken Breasts, Fish, Tofu, Egg Whites, Salmon, or even grain-free Crab Cakes. While I don't think I was ever in ketosis, most of what I consumed was primarily protein. It was difficult for me to count calories precisely but I was able to estimate it based off the approximate weights (around 1700 calories a day). If I was ever hungry in between meals, I'd usually eat some Egg Whites, a Pickle, or Greek Yogurt. Besides the smoothie, my diet was very standard. However, I do want to point out the fact that I never ""cheated"" on my diet until I reached my target weight. This was more of a self-discipline thing. I did not want to indulge myself until I felt like I truly deserved it and was in a position to ease up a little bit.

Dealing with plateaus was irritating but not overwhelmingly so. Instead of consuming less, I decided to ramp up my exercise routine instead.

I really hope someone finds my experiences helpful. I know this can be a very difficult process but it is truly worth it. There is so much satisfaction in knowing that you set out a goal for yourself and achieved it through hard work. Good luck! Feel free to ask me with any questions or PM me whenever if you need help!

2dmp95,1,2014-08-15,Need real help with corporate career guidance!! (AU),[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2dmp95/need_real_help_with_corporate_career_guidance_au/,"Currently I am an cadet at one of the Big 4 accounting firms (EY, KPMG,PWC etc. ) which essentially means I work full time (paid a decent enough salary considering I'm still barely out of high-school) and get a day off during the week to go to university so basically working through uni. Obviously I am very fortunate to have received this chance but I'm well into it by now and have been coping well despite times when it's hard to balance work, studies and a social life. At the end of the cadetship/degree you're transitioned back into the firm so it's a guaranteed job straight after your degree (unless you are bad). 

Up until recently I was quite happy knowing I would return back to a Big 4 firm after university and essentially get a significant boost career wise over other fresh graduates both in level and experience but recently stuff has made me think. A lot people at uni have been going on about banking and investment etc. and they are going insane over applying for banks and investment firms citing all the huge pay packages just for graduates being in the ball-park of $100k. Even friends of mine who are cadets have applied hoping to be accepted by a bank/investment firm for temporary INTERNSHIPS and just drop their accounting cadetships. 

I feel torn now as to whether I stick through my cadetship and stay an accountant or look towards investment and banking. It's kind of hard to summarise succinctly but essentially if I were to stay at the Big 4 I would rise quite quickly due to being a cadet BUT that being said a manager/senior manager at any of the Big 4 earns nothing close to what one at an investment/bank might earn. Do you guys think I should stick out my cadetship and then apply for other jobs? Apply/query now for graduate positions at investment/banks? Wait till I'm higher at the Big 4 and have more qualifications and then move or just stay!?  

I'm perfectly aware of the hours that these types of jobs come with but sometimes at the Big 4 we work till midnight for weeks so maybe it won't be too hard to adapt to. My marks are pretty good considering I work full-time and I play team sports etc. so I'm pretty well rounded. Also I don't mind accounting at all so the argument of do what you love is really indifferent here as I'm sure banking/investment will also be the same to me. It's been plaguing my mind a lot these past few days so any advice or help is really appreciated! 

tl:dr - stay and finish accounting cadetship at Big 4 or try get into banking/investment"
2dna4z,10,2014-08-15,Feeling useless. In need of advice,aznphailureguy,AskRedditTeenagers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskRedditTeenagers/comments/2dna4z/feeling_useless_in_need_of_advice/,"I'm a 17 year old guy who just graduated high school, just barely. I've basically slacked through all my life. School was just something I had to go through because it was more trouble to get caught cutting. During middle school, I already started feeling the monotony sink into my heart. Thus, began the teen doldrums. My parents are Asian and the Asian expectations are real. My older sister went to prestigious schools and went off to a college upstate. I was to follow in her footsteps. My dad was a farm boy in China. He never got a real education and when my parents had just immigrated over here, he worked twice add hard so that my mom could. He works from 11am to night. On school days, I might not even see him. On his days off, he tries to talk to me even though I have broken Chinese and he doesn't understand English. He just wants his kids to have a bright future. Originally my mom was a ""tiger mom"" meaning she'd force me to work and study and essentially turn me into some studying robot. Unfortunately, I was a rebellious soul and whenever she'd try to take the reigns, I fought back. By high school, nearly every conversation with my mom was an argument. I knew she cared though. She sought out help at a local parenting class, this weird little thing where parents would meet up to talk about how to communicate with their children. The whole idea, I thought, was corny and inherently embarrassing. But she would go at any length to talk to me, to get to know me. As a result, she became more docile in her approaches. Which helped us get along but the differences between her traditional mindset and my more liberal mindset still led to problems. Despite her efforts, I still slacked. I got into one of the top high schools in the city but I never studied. I slept in class everyday. Stayed up all night playing games but more importantly I found my best friends. They got me through tough times. Once when no one was home my mom feel and hit her head and immediately my friend appeared with his uncle to bring her to the ER. And for 4 long hours, he waited with me. So although I regret screwing up my grades I can't say I hated school nor would I go back and change it. Living in NYC, meant I could apply for a CUNY, basically a city college, which was what I planned to do. I had no direction and terrible grades. An SAT score of 1800 can only get you so far. Around December when everyone thought about achieving their dreams and studying at great universities, I thought maybe I'd go to a CUNY maybe get into an art major. I'm not bad at drawing. Probably not going to use the degree and work at some office doing the same monotonous thing everyday. March came around and I forgot about college. I played games everyday. Everyone had already finished applying for colleges and some even committed. I didn't even start. So one night I called for my sister's help to apply for colleges. I might have been late but better than never. Together we adopted for SUNYs (state colleges) and private ones. I was caught up in the hope that maybe I'd be miraculously accepted by one of these colleges. I worked on the essays, praying to any divine being to strike down some random applicant and maybe let me take his/her place. But fate doesn't help those who don't help themselves. I received 5 rejection letters. Some schools didn't even respond. I wasn't surprised. I didn't cry but it hurt alot more than I thought it would. I had no one to blame but my fucking self. By May, everyone knew where they were going. Short-term or long-term, everyone else had some kind of future. I checked with the CUNY  just to make sure I'd at least go to a community college. Those take in literally anyone. When I called, I found that when I was signing up for colleges I didn't even submit an application for CUNY schools. I was furious. I was going to kill my sister. But once again I realized this was my job. It was my responsibility but I the it up someone's else's shoulders. I truly despised myself. I was a hypocrite. I was familiar with the phrase ""Don't be so pussy"". I used it all the time and I never really thought about taking my own advice. I'm a fucking asshole. Anyways, I talked to my guidance counselor. He helped me create an account and signed me up for some colleges  before school ended. It would only work if I graduated on time however. So the next week I begged and burned midnight oil to finish make-up exams and projects. I passed high school with a 65 average. I thought everything was going great. One CUNY called and congratulated me. I was happy but I told them I was waiting on another school,  a CUNY that was a little closer to my house and also more well known. I never got a response from that college. Later on, I was told to take a CUNY placement exam. Little did I know that I was committed to that school. Maybe there was some error but I was committed to a school that I didn't want to go to. If anything I prefer to go to the community college that's a 20 minute walk from my house rather than a lesser known community college  that's a 50 minute subway ride away. So I made some calls apparently it's too late to change schools and sign up for classes in the school that I ""committed"" to. Once again, my stupid self ruined it again by waiting for a college that never responded. I spent weeks of my summer lounging around playing games essentially wasting my life away when I could've resolved my stupid college problem if I called a week earlier. I can't start college until the spring semester, I don't have a job or internship that at least will help me during the fall. I've looked for countless job opportunities but they all require experience. My friends are all going to school. I'm leeching off my mom who already worked for my life harder than I did. I'm drawing pictures on a computer tablet she bought for me that won't pay for food in my mouth. I feel extremely useless. I don't want to burden my parents anymore. What can I do?

2dnkee,0,2014-08-15,"I [20 M] worked with a girl [19 F] this summer and fell for her during an 8 hour adeventure, right before I go back to college.",whitecastleaddict,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2dnkee/i_20_m_worked_with_a_girl_19_f_this_summer_and/,"**I've been a longtime reader so I appreciate any advice. Also, I apologize for any grammar mistakes.**

The beginning of May, I obtained an internship with a company I've worked for in the past. I had the opportunity to train new associates and help open a new store location. Through this process I've met plenty of awesome people.

This one girl -- let us call her Jane -- stood out all summer who kept to herself but when you talked to her the conversation was so fun to have. During my last week at work (~End of July) I mentioned to Jane that one of my friends and I were planning to go hiking at a nearby area. Her face just lit up and she asked if she could join us because that was her backyard (metaphorically). I said absolutely and exchanged numbers with her.

Fast forward to this past Monday, I met with her at an agreed location by 8:30pm. I got into her car and the first thing I did was hug her. I was so excited to see her after not working for a little bit. She reciprocated really well. One of our coworkers came along with Jane and I to meet my friend at his house near the hiking area. So in total there were four of us.

We made it up to my friend's house by 11pm. We all sat around a table and talked till 1am. The more I learned about her, the more I started to fall for her. We all got up at 7am and decided to split cars because it helped us be more efficient for our trip. 

I had to get some things from Jane's car so I ended up riding with her up to the mountains. During that time I found out so much about how she thinks and just the genuine person she is.

We arrived to our destination and spent 8 wonderful hours exploring. For the most of the hike I spent talking to her alone while our other 2 friends trailed a short distance behind. 

After we finished our hike, we found a restaurant to have dinner. We headed to Jane's family condo 5 minutes away when we finished dinner. Once we got there I had the opportunity to hold my hand out to her and we held hands for a split second. We hung out and had some tea for a little bit. Jane had a crumb of a cracker on her lips and she caught me staring after I pointed it out to her. 

Jane decided to stay at her condo while my other 2 friends and I left for the origin house. When I said goodbye to Jane that night I extended out my hand for a high five but she said ""No, wait"" and initiated a hug instead.

So here's my dilemma, I go back to school this upcoming Monday and she's going to a school 2-3 hours away. Should I find a way to pursue her while we're both at school or should I just be happy with the interest we've built and try to reconnect with her on later occasions? 

I know the attraction is there, so if I do decide to keep in contact with her while we're both at school how would I do that?

---   
**tl;dr**: Worked all summer with an interesting girl, once I quit we went on a hike. Developed an interest for her right before I go back to school this Monday. Should I pursue her or wait to reconnect with her during holidays and breaks?"
2dof3l,1,2014-08-15,Laid Off,AbsoluteTravesty,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2dof3l/laid_off/,"To put things into perspective, I'm a college student(going to be a senior), from a poor family of five, going to school at one of the most expensive schools in the US, in a pipe dream major(but hey, I've lived the dream already, and had a blast, so it's no longer a pipe dream for me).  I've never had a lot of money, but I've worked for all of the things I have, and I've paid for rent, bills, and food on my own for the past several years.  I've had several steady jobs for the past 7 years, and even went on from being an intern to a hired full employee at my previous job.  I feel like I'm a relatively decent person, and a good worker, and, though I suffer from a depressive disorder, I've been fairly happy for a while.

But last week, the place I worked for, closed down, for good.  I'm out of a job, and low on cash.  I've got rent for the next month, but that's about it, and getting unemployment is difficult as a student.  I personally, can't afford to purchase more food than is already in the house, though my girlfriend(who lives with me) and her family are very helpful when it comes to necessities.  Lost a lot of my drive, as we were working towards a fantastic product, nearing release, and now that's just gone.  It's a chapter of my life, pretty much over.  Working with the team there was just fantastic.  I loved being at work.  I got to do what I love, and have a lot of fun doing it.  I'm incredibly nervous for my next job, because I get anxious with any new experience, and meeting new people, and a new job will absolutely have both.

On top of all that, it's my favorite time of year: Student Loan time.  Gotta make sure I can get the money I need to pay for my last year of college.


Anyway, just really needed to get that off my chest.  Thanks to anyone that took the time to read this."

Armed with will, dedication, and a prescription for adderall, I am determined to finish my remaining two years with excellent grades so I can deport myself to a good pharmacy school, preferably out-of-state and with a scholarship.

Most/all of my gen-eds are out of the way and I could graduate with a degree in Neuroscience and a minor in Biology by only taking a few extra classes in total. However, I'm concerned about my schedule for each semester for the next two years. I'm slated to take ~15 credits each semester of pharmacy school prerequisites, all hard sciences/math with maybe a psych/neuro class thrown in.

For this upcoming fall semester, I'm taking Calculus with recitation, College physics with lab (based on algebra), genetics with lab, and some psychology class. Total is 4 classes/14 credits. Also, I have a data mining internship with requires at least six hours a week. Is this doable in your opinion? I have always struggled in math/science courses but I'm sure if I just willed myself to do it, I can get straight A's like I plan to do.

TLDR I'm taking some hard classes packed into one this semester, will I be okay?"
2don3u,7,2014-08-15,I feel like a 15 year old. I just want to tell someone about him!,[deleted],Crushes,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/2don3u/i_feel_like_a_15_year_old_i_just_want_to_tell/,"Warning: this is going to be long. You don't have to read my long story, but I would love to hear some of your stories!

I am sure a lot of you can relate, you have a huge crush on someone and you just want to talk about them all the time. Even if no one reads this post, I will still be satisfied by simply putting it out there. It makes me feel like a high schooler again (even though that was only 2 years ago for me) and I don't know if I love the high that this feeling brings or if I hate the uncertainty and lack of control over the situation.

So now to my story (names may or may not be real, you will never know). I met Daniel our freshman year at school. We were both in this selective honors college program that works with social and environmental issues in our state. There were only about 20 people in the whole program so we were a pretty tight-knit group. We all lived in the same dorm, had a class together three days a week and occasionally took weekend trips to various locations to do volunteer work and research. I don't really know when Daniel and I became good friends, but at some point in the semester he started sitting next to me in class and coming with me to lunch in the cafeteria after. We studied together a few times and he started inviting me to dinner off campus at least once every other week. I always offered to pay but he would always argue that since he invited me he should pay. He only called it a date once but he said in a way that made me think it was just a ""friend date"", so I assumed he did this with all his girl friends. I thought he would take our mutual friend Aryanna out just as often.

He is in a frat on campus and during our sophomore year he lived in the house, only two blocks from my apartment. He continued to take me out all the time. I started dating this guy, Kevin, at the beginning of the year. At first Kevin seemed like one of the sweetest people ever, but he slowly introduced emotional abuse and cycled it with apologies and that old sweetness. It was a textbook cycle of abuse, but when you are in a situation like that it is really hard to see. Well, Daniel did not like Kevin from the get-go. He ran into Kevin and I one day when Kevin and I had just started dating, and even though Daniel was really polite throughout the conversation I could tell he really didn't like Kevin. Kevin saw it too and would start arguments with me every time I brought up Daniel, saying that I was a slut for being friends with a guy that was attracted to me. I had no clue that Daniel felt anything other than friendship towards me at that time so I didn't understand why Kevin was so upset about my friend. But Daniel was intuitive, and I am pretty sure he knew what Kevin was like even before I knew. He would text me all the time, just asking how I was, and if I mentioned that Kevin and I had been fighting (which was a lot) Daniel would invite me to hang out, either going to a bar, a restaurant, or just go hang out at the frat house. I really needed someone to just be a friend during that time, and he never made a move on me.

I had no clue, this entire time that Daniel had any feelings for me other than friendship. I don't even know when my feelings for him developed. It just started some time during freshman year and looking back it's almost as if they were always there. I pushed them to the back of my mind for a while when I was dating Kevin and then dealing with the aftermath of that relationship, but they were always there.

This summer Daniel got an internship at a major investment banking firm on Wall Street. He texted me every few days, just talking about different things. They were short conversations, but I much prefer that to text conversations that last hours (even though you wouldn't be able to tell by the length of this post). One message that stands out in my mind was ""Message me if you ever think of me ;)"". It's significant because he isn't really one to send emoticons. I got coffee with our mutual friend, Aryanna, and mentioned it to her. She thought it was hilarious that I had no clue that Daniel has a thing for me. She said that he has been crushing on me since freshman year and it was a pretty well established fact among our friends. I am pretty clueless when it comes to stuff like that, but she still found it amusing that I was the last one to know.

He got back in town a week ago, but I was out of town at that time. He called me as soon as he had moved into his new apartment asking me what I was doing and if I could hang out. I told him that I would tell him as soon as I was in town. He called me again the night before I was supposed to drive back, inviting me to this political talk on campus, the kind of thing we both love to go to. Then, while I was in the car driving back he texted me a few times asking about my ETA and when I wanted him to pick me up.

I got home and got ready in record time. I looked pretty hot if I do say so myself. I dressed really nice and used the excuse that I was going to be meeting some state representatives at the talk. He picked me up and we went to the talk. He said he really hoped that there would be food there and I joked that of course food was his top priority for the night. He said ""Well, no, seeing you was my top priority."" During the talk we were mostly quiet aside from a few comments or silent communication of exasperation through sidelong glances. After I introduced myself to a few of the representatives and made some connections, with Daniel at my side, following me around the whole time. When I was done Daniel asked me if I wanted to go to the diner right off campus, our usual dinner place.

There we shared an order of these amazing cheese, sour cream, onion and mushroom hashbrowns that I always order and talked. This wouldn't be all that significant except one little detail. Most of the talk was playful, slightly flirty banter mixed around serious political discussion, which is normal for us. But I noticed he kept looking at my lips. It was just quick little glances from my eyes to my lips, but they were often enough that I noticed.

When he was driving me home he started talking about how we both look very ""southern"". It came out of nowhere, we had been talking about nothing even similar to that topic. But he said that he dresses like a frat boy (meaning nice shirts and kahkis, I don't think I have ever seen him in chubbies) and I dress *kind of* like a sorority girl. He said the two of us have a very ""southern"" facial and body structure. It was him complimenting me in his own kind of weird way.

Now here is where I am a complete idiot. We get to my house and he pulls up in the driveway, unbuckles his seat belt, turns off the car and looks at me. I had expected him to actually get out of the car but since he didn't it kind of caught me off guard. I talked to him for a little bit and then said ""good luck with studying!"" and got out of the car. When I got to the door I turned around and he was looking at me. I waved and opened my door. He didnt pull out of the driveway until I was inside. I feel like the biggest idiot ever. I should have asked him to walk me to the door or something. It was obvious that he had been looking for an invite when he turned off the car and unbuckled his seatbelt. And I had completely missed it. I really suck at this.

Well today I was at training for something on campus and we had an unplanned break in the middle of the day. I knew Daniel had been on campus earlier so I texted him asking if he was still on campus. He responded saying yes 12 minutes later, about the time it takes to drive from his apartment to campus. When he met me in the library he was still carrying his keys, so I am pretty sure he drove to campus after getting my text. He told me that he was coming to the library anyways to change his major, but when we sat down he didnt pull out his laptop. I asked him if he was going to work on it and he said no, he wanted to give me his attention. We talked for a bit, joking, being a little flirty. When I said I had to go back to training he asked me when I would be done. He didn't follow that with an invite to do anything, but we will see, he has a tendency to sometimes invite me out 10 minutes before he wants to go.

It is so nice to get all of that out!

I have been trying to figure out how to make the first move. I had a great opportunity the other night before I got out of his car, but I obviously did not take it. I really don't want to just come out and say it because that isn't really how either of us work. We both have been called cold by people before if that explains anything. I already texted him last night saying that I had fun hanging out with him and that we should do it again soon. He said ""Of course!"". I think I am just going to slowly work my way up to it, touching him more while walking or talking, complimenting him more, inviting him out more. I will figure out based on his reaction to those things if I want to kiss him or not. I guess I will just take it day by day.

If you read this far, I appreciate that! If you have any advice on anything, I will take it.

**TL;DR I have have had a major crush on my guy friend who has apparently liked me the whole time as well. Things between us are starting to escalate, but it's very slow.**

Edit- Thinking about inviting him tomorrow night to see this band that I made friends with when they came through on a tour last year. Hopefully that goes well and maybe once I get a few beers in me I'll make a move!"

The Neighborhood Connection Project Summer 2014 Community Celebration,CitizenJac,greatNWside,https://www.reddit.com/r/greatNWside/comments/2dorb4/its_finally_here_and_you_are_invited_the/,"Please join with your neighbors as we gather to celebrate the unveiling of the Western wall of the Neighborhood Connection Project (NCP) summer 2014 bricolage mural.   We will meet on Saturday, August 16 @10am at the Metra underpass located at the intersection of Hiawatha and Lehigh in the Edgebrook neighborhood.  When completed, NCP will be the largest outdoor public art bricolage mural on Chicago's NW side.  

For more information, contact Jac Charlier, jac.charlier@gmail.com or Gina Metelica, gina.metelica@gmail.com.  You can also find us on Facebook and YouTube.

Started in Spring of 2010, the Neighborhood Connection Project (NCP) is a citizen-led initiative to build community by repairing and beautifying the Metra railroad underpass located at Kinzua, Hiawatha and Lehigh.  After securing the input and support of a diverse cross section of the citizens, civics, businesses and the wider community, as well as the support of the 41st Ward Aldermanic Office for required pre-beautification repairs to the underpass, we were joined by our ongoing partners, Green Star Movement (GSM) and After School Matters (ASM).  Phase I underpass beautification efforts were ready to begin and indeed started finally in Spring 2013.  GSM worked with ASM's teen interns and our local artists and community volunteers to produce the mural on the East side of the underpass, which was completed in Summer 2013. We continued together on Phase II completing the West wall work in summer 2014.  During summer 2015 we will finish the project by joining the two bricolage murals together in the center.  The joining of the East and West sides of the mosaic will be done in the same way our American railroads were completed...by meeting in the middle with a golden stake.  In the case of NCP, we will use golden tiles.  The themes of the mural were decided by the community and the actual art reflects both our neighborhood's history, as well as the greenery and vegetation of the area. Special homage is paid to our Native American predecessors and the famous Hiawatha train that ran on these very tracks.  Upon completion, NCP will be the largest outdoor public art bricolage mural on Chicago's Northwest side.  

So far, the NCP community includes:

	* 300+ citizens
	* 60 teen apprentices
	* 23 businesses
	* 7 artists
	* 4 local civics
	* 2 government agencies
	* 1 Alderwoman
	* 1 Chamber of Commerce
	* 1 Public Library
	* 1 Railroad Historical Society
	* Green Star Movement
	* After School Matters

We will meet on Saturday, August 16 @10am at the Metra underpass located at the intersection of Hiawatha and Lehigh in the Edgebrook neighborhood.  When completed, NCP will be the largest outdoor public art bricolage mural on Chicago's NW side.  

For more information, contact Jac Charlier, jac.charlier@gmail.com or Gina Metelica, gina.metelica@gmail.com.  You can also find us on Facebook and YouTube.

Started in Spring of 2010, the Neighborhood Connection Project (NCP) is a citizen-led initiative to build community by repairing and beautifying the Metra railroad underpass located at Kinzua, Hiawatha and Lehigh.  After securing the input and support of a diverse cross section of the citizens, civics, businesses and the wider community, as well as the support of the 41st Ward Aldermanic Office for required pre-beautification repairs to the underpass, we were joined by our ongoing partners, Green Star Movement (GSM) and After School Matters (ASM).  Phase I underpass beautification efforts were ready to begin and indeed started finally in Spring 2013.  GSM worked with ASM's teen interns and our local artists and community volunteers to produce the mural on the East side of the underpass, which was completed in Summer 2013. We continued together on Phase II completing the West wall work in summer 2014.  During summer 2015 we will finish the project by joining the two bricolage murals together in the center.  The joining of the East and West sides of the mosaic will be done in the same way our American railroads were completed...by meeting in the middle with a golden stake.  In the case of NCP, we will use golden tiles.  The themes of the mural were decided by the community and the actual art reflects both our neighborhood's history, as well as the greenery and vegetation of the area. Special homage is paid to our Native American predecessors and the famous Hiawatha train that ran on these very tracks.  Upon completion, NCP will be the largest outdoor public art bricolage mural on Chicago's Northwest side.  

So far, the NCP community includes:

	* 300+ citizens
	* 60 teen apprentices
	* 23 businesses
	* 7 artists
	* 4 local civics
	* 2 government agencies
	* 1 Alderwoman
	* 1 Chamber of Commerce
	* 1 Public Library
	* 1 Railroad Historical Society
	* Green Star Movement
	* After School Matters

Then I went on one of our normal friend dates and noticed the hints myself. He asks me to have dinner with him somewhere almost every week, then he pays. He keeps glancing at my lips when I talk. He hints at it all the time, but I was oblivious until recently.

And now I'm drunk and thinking about him and how much I want to just kiss him. I'm inviting him to come to this concert for this band who I met last year and the members of the band agreed to help me out with getting him! This will be fun.

So, whoever has any feelings for their friend/ has a crush on someone/ is with or in love with someone, this next beer is for you!

And if you want, tell me your story! I would love to hear it.

**Edit: Someone asked me about this so I will give a brief drunk overview. We became friends freshman year in a tight-knit honors volunteer organization we were in. He developed obvious feelings or me (according to others in our organization). We started going on weekly dates but I was oblivious to him having any feelings for me other than friendship. He helped me through an emotionally abusive relationship I was in without ever becoming too intrusive, he would just ask me to dinner/ go out every time I would respond to his ""how are you"" messages saying my boyfriend and I were fighting again (which was at least once every other week). Now that crazy ex and I aren't a thing, best-friend-crush guy came home from a Wall Street internship and has gone waaaayyyy above and beyond to hang out these past few days. And he can do a keg stand, which is cool.**"

From the intern to the most senior in the team knows, Sunday's lunch was the most anticipated by everyone. Plates were so clean after the lunch that, looking at it you would say was it not at all used during the lunch. So good was the appetite for the lunch.

It has been a 5 days past, navy seal has landed on this tropical island. The team was returning homeland after a 6 months war on the far eastern country. True testing time for the soldier is on the war lands. Every other day soldiers would be scavenging on the land they dwell. As the war was over it was a relaxing time. The resources were few, unless they find some; it would be hard to sustain till they get back home. 

Every one from the team would relax and take a nap on Sunday afternoon. While few stayed awake and alert, scanning the surrounding for the to check for the slightest trace of the appending danger. 

Martin Maverick was a young, muscular, flair complexion soldier of the 15th Wing under the Commander general Steve. This was the Martin's first overseas mission. And it ain't fun for the Martin. Not just him alone, it ain't fun for anyone who are out on their first mission. Apart from the gory ever ending war, the sickness of dead sea, numerous contractual viral diseases; away from home is alone will keep a soldier for longings to go back home.The war has tested Maverick to his limits and he begin to learn his highest limits is the standard of life. 

Snoring was not usual, as it was trained to every seal to be quite when they are awake, when asleep or when dismantling their guns. Except for the tweeting sound of the birds and the roar of the ocean, it was indeed a clam afternoon. Martin patrolled on the west of the camp and other three on the other extreme of the camp.

Attention span of Martin was very less if you compare with other soldiers. He would get easily bored. His general knowing it would different task every other day. Patrolling is the first time he is ever doing it. It's not past 5 minutes, he is already felt apathetic. 15th Wing soldier sat down under the shadow of the chestnut tree, began looking at the ocean waves, another minute at the flying birds in the sky, then at the faces of those asleep; started to feel the drowsiness. He suddenly rigorously blinking his eyes as to not sleep. Maverick realized some strong metal object in his left pant pockets. It was an old rusty video game console he had found a fortnight before, scavenging on the broken ship.

Video game was the one which gave the young Navy seals motivation to join the Navy. An avid gamer, he would play more than 5 hours in his teen days. Monkey island was his favorite game. He has completed all the sequel that has ever released in all the console. So soldier Martin took out to play. From many days his purpose was to be the high scores. Except for the high score, every other name in the score card was Martin's name. By the time anyone wake up, I would finish this; thought Martin Maverick. From the score 0 Martin began to play. Scores start to accelerate as he completed one level after the other. 

It is the monkeys that gives the competition to the humans in scavenging. The team had a tough time 2 hours back, getting rid of all the monkeys from the area. With monkeys it was difficult to enjoy the lunch. The dogs been great help. Seeing the dogs, monkeys went away with out a trace of coming back.

Three monkeys had returned as they could not resist the aroma of the food. Dogs were asleep now. If any would have noticed the advances of these monkey, that would be the Martin the navy seal of the 15th Wing or the other three soldiers patrolling. Martin has gone past the third highest score and he had still two lives left, that means he had better chance of being the highest scorer than ever before. 

Martin looked in front to see as he could hear the noise of movements of the leaves and the rocks. It was the three monkeys in front. He went back to his usual chores, now he has crossed past the second score. Then Martin realized to his amazement that three monkeys are in front, and his team is asleep with a soundless snores and he is playing a game on a console about to beat the high score. 

Martin would be in deep trouble, if he is caught under a chestnut tree, in-front of a monkey playing a Monkey island game. And these monkeys cannot be trusted either. He chased them and made sure they are quite far and began continuing to play. Again the sound of the leaves and stones, when he looked it was the monkeys in-front. This time he ignored as he was so near to be number one on the scoring list. The small monkey abruptly put his hands on the soldier pocket and gripped it tightly and pulled back. It was a candy, a finest candy that was found on the Mediterranean. 

Martin second purpose in life was to earn as much money as he could and go back to Mediterranean again, buy as much as he could of this candy and enjoy every moment eating the candy.  Martin could not control his anger, he got up and started chasing the monkey. Monkey began to run as fast as he could. Martin Maverick was in a stick in shoe situation, the last candy of the Mediterranean and the last moment of reaching the top scorer. He chased the monkey to get back the candy and playing a video game not to lose the game and start all over again.

On a calm Sunday after noon after the big lunch, when the Navy seal team slept with the sound of the roaring ocean and the tweeting birds. Martin Maverick a young and muscular Navy seal in the 15th Wing division, chased the monkey having his last Mediterranean candy and with the game where he would be the highest scorer. His moment of the top two purposes of life is at stake whilst chasing a jumping monkey, playing a video game."
2dpusa,2,2014-08-16,My computer problem,nopcthrowaway,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2dpusa/my_computer_problem/,"This might seem selfish, or not. I don't know. I just need to get it off my chest. This is my first time posting here so I'm not sure how to write these. Oh well, here goes.

I study in an distance education program of a university. Almost everything I have to do requires a computer and internet connection. The former of which I do not have. 

My dad said that he'd provide me with my own computer months before the term starts. And now I sit here, a year later, still without a computer. You have no idea how hard it is going through an online education without a computer. I had assignments, and projects every week. My mom, dad, sister's laptops are used all day. They have jobs and schoolwork to do, respectively. The only time I get to use their laptops are 11 pm until I realized I read a module without anything actually registering in my brain. I actually failed two of my subjects in the last term because I couldn't do everything with the time I've been given on their laptops. I haven't told them yet because I don't want to blame it on them not being able to buy me a computer.

I try to be understanding about this. Dad loaned money that he said he was partly going to use for buying me a computer, but then the family van needed repairs. No problem, we needed the van more, I told myself. My sister needed money because she was getting an internship in a far away place. She needs it more since she's graduating this year, I said. Dad asked me if it's okay if he got me a secondhand computer because it's cheaper. I told him it was okay. Still nothing.

Last month, my mom stepped in and said that she'll start to save money for a computer for my sister (her classes just started and her laptop is broken) and I to use. She wasn't able to save up last month, and told us she'll save up this month.

During dinner, mom told us that she won't be able to save up until October. My term starts this September. I told her to at least get my sister's laptop repaired so that she'll be able to use something.

I know I'm not in the place to be mad. It's just a damn computer anyway. But they're the ones who put me in this distance education bullshit because it's cheaper than sending me to the university campus where I was accepted. 

Reddit, can you tell me if I'm in the wrong in this? I just don't want to pass my assignments late again."
2dq4hx,16,2014-08-16,"""My time is just as important as yours. Thanks doc.""",asshatforyourass,ChronicPain,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicPain/comments/2dq4hx/my_time_is_just_as_important_as_yours_thanks_doc/,"I am extremely upset over this and am ready to just pack it in and give up.  I can't believe a Pain Management clinic at Penn State Hershey Medical Center can treat someone this way and will never be going back to them.  

My appointment was for 11am yesterday morning (Friday, Aug 15th).  I arrived at exactly 11am, checked in and waited about 5 minutes to be called back to the exam room.  The nurse took my blood pressure, asked the normal questions of medications, pain levels, reason for my visit and then left saying the doc will be a few minutes.  I waited...  and waited...  and waited.  By the time it was 12 noon, I stuck my head out and asked the nurse at the nurse's station if the doctor was ever going to come see me.  She stated, ""I'll go find him and send him in right away.""  Another 25 minutes goes by and an intern comes in.  I express my displeasure of having to wait an hour and a half at this time and I asked where the doctor was.  She stated, ""I will do a quick exam and relay that to the doctor and he will be here in a few minutes.""  She did her exam, asked a few questions, and within 10 minutes was on her way out the door, saying the doc will be just a few minutes and said, ""I will try to speed things along for you.""  By this time it was 12:35pm.  I waited...  and waited...  and waited...  At 1pm, I walked out of the exam room, said to the nurse, ""Tell the doctor I said Thanks for wasting my time"" and left.  

After having to drive one and a half hours just to see this doctor, waiting 2 hours in the exam room, with no one telling me why it was taking so long, I was extremely upset.  I saw a hospital employee, a door greater I think, as I left and asked who I could talk to in order to complain about my ordeal and she put me in contact with the hospital paitent relations office.  I explained what happened in detail and was told she would find out what had occured from the Pain Management office and get back to me with a follow-up call.  I had been going to this office for the past 5 months with hopes that this would finally be a place where I could get some relief from my chronic pain and it had been highly recommended by many people because they really seemed like they cared about the paitents.  Well from this experience, I really don't think they gave 2 shits about me.  I have been to two other pain management clinics over the past few years, both tried the usual steroid injections and physical therapy, none of which helped the pain that I have, and I refuse all pain meds they tried to give me because I don't want to mask the pain, I want it treated.  After being told they could do no more for me, I reached out to Penn State Hershey Medical Center because of their reputation of being one of the best hospitals in the area.  

At this point I am so pissed off and after wasting 5 hours of my time, (2.5 hours driving + gas, 2 hours in office, half hour talking with paitent reps) and still haven't been given any form of relief, I give up.  I can't take the pain any more and have been waiting on disability for 4 years now, all the while, having to live in a terribly hurtful environment with my alcoholic mother.  This house is a total wreck, with ill repair everywhere, no heat for the past 2 years due to broken furnace that she won't pay someone to come fix, flea infested, junk everywhere because she is a hoarder and won't clean up or throw anything out, constant arguing because she expects me to be able to fix everything that is wrong here, while she buys a second house a year ago and goes there every other weekend, leaving me to take care of her 4 dogs and bird, and just this past week, expected me to go clean an office building where she works, taking out the trash and such, because she wanted to go away (I absolutely refused that one and now she is pissed off at me).  I can't live like this anymore.  I get food stamps for groceries, which I buy myself, but half of it disappears because my mother is stealing my food because she is too lazy to cook her own food.  She comes home from work and eats my food that I cooked because she is ""starving"" and couldn't be bothered to make her own food, mine is already prepared.  She never cooks for me to replace anything or even appologize for stealing my food.

I have no where else to go and now have probably lost my only remaining friend because she wanted me to be honest and open with her, so I told her that her actions had made me feel uncomfortable and I didn't appreciate it, so now I haven't spoken to her in over a week, when we used to talk at least 3-4 days of the week when she would call me while driving home from work.  My own therapist had me pissed off this past week as well, trying to push pills on me after I have explicity told her that I will never take any anti-depressants ever again after having terrible side effects from them years ago.  She basically said that if I am not willing to take any pills, she can't do anything else for me because if I'm not willing to work on my problems then it's just a waste of time seeing her every week (work on my problems does not include me taking pills).  I have never said I was not willing to work on my issues, just that I didn't know what else to do with everything else going on with my living situation and until that changes I'll never be happy again.  

I really don't know how I can continue this terrible existence called my life, with no relief in sight for my pain and now having to try and find a new pain management doc, my living situation that is absolutely disgusting and totally unacceptable for anyone but I have no choice other than being homeless which is looking so much better than this lately, and to top it all off, I have no friends left and am about to lose my therapist because I won't accept the pills she is pushing...  what do I have left to live for?"
2dq7ts,2,2014-08-16,"Dad is fighting me trying to go LC [TW] abuse, need advice how to deal with the situation, but also really need to vent (sorry, long)",Bonnie_1989,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/2dq7ts/dad_is_fighting_me_trying_to_go_lc_tw_abuse_need/,"Just a small problem, but I don't know how to deal with this situation.

Desperately trying to go LC with family but it is extremely difficult, especially since they still support me financially. 
Recently my dad suddenly stopped giving me money without telling me, I asked my mum if she could take up a loan to cover the costs and told him very rationally that I'd rather get money from her, because even though she has less, she's more reliable. 

After a while my dad did transfer the money but not without complaining that I don't tell him enough about my life. I'm struggling with mental health, but managed to successfully continue an internship for many weeks. There is now the opportunity that I might get fully employed in a months time. I told him that, saying that since any conversations about money don't seem to work between the two of us, that once I got a full-time job, we wouldn't have to deal with this any longer.
His response was that he'd rather I quit my internship and rely on him financially, so that I can work on my mental health and also tell him more about my life, than to get a full-time job and be independent. He said, word by word, that I 'owe him' answers about my life and my fears and plans... I don't fucking owe you anything, dad! 

What can I do? Since trying to go LC he's done many stupid things, that let me to believe he's trying to control me. 
For example, half a year ago I started limiting contact. He randomly calls me while masturbating (of course I can't be 100% about this, since I didn't see him, but I know what he sounds like....). Then I gave some stupid excuse as to why they can't call me any longer (I live abroad and said I had to switch my network plan, making it too expensive for them to call). I find out he's gone to hospital for three weeks, but nothing could be found. He hates doctors and never goes, unless it seems life threatening. 

The next thing he did was break up with his gf of 11 years, who he knows I like, and was seeing someone else after only a week. I sent an email saying that I'm sorry to hear the news with his ex, but didn't react otherwise. 
He tried telling me a couple of times how much of a scandal it would be if his work found out he was seeing that one lady and had broken up with the other and for me not to tell anyone. My reaction: ok, don't worry, why would I tell anyone.
Next day they're back together. 

Next email: his friend, who sexually harassed me in front of my dad when I was about 12, which my dad thought was funny, has moved back to the town my dad lives in. He gave me all sorts of updates on his friend, which I didn't want to hear and then said 'see, he doesn't have his life figured out either, and he's an adult. so you're fine.' my response: 'I don't see him as an adult and I couldn't care less about his life.' 
When i had to visit my dad I found out he supports his friend avoiding taxes by letting him use my dad's address for official things, which means I couldn't escape that dude's mail or even stuff that's lying around everywhere. If I have to go back again and his friend decides to show up, there's legally nothing I can do about it.

And now this thing with the money...
How doI get out of this?"
2dqadn,6,2014-08-16,[Housing] 22F Queer Canadian Amazon Intern seeks place to stay September through December.,RussetWolf,SeaList,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeaList/comments/2dqadn/housing_22f_queer_canadian_amazon_intern_seeks/,"**A little about me**

I'm a queer Canadian woman, studying computer science at the University of Waterloo in Ontario. I will be in Seattle for September through December on an internship at Amazon. I love a clean space and find the act of cleaning relaxing (unless it's vacuuming, I don't love that, but I don't mind it either). I'm rather quiet, though I do love board games and spend my Saturdays playing Dungeons and Dragons rather than going clubbing. I enjoy spending time with people, but I expect most of my socializing will centre around work-related events. 

I'm looking for a place to stay. Ideally a private room, but if the price is right, I may be willing to give up a little privacy. The place should be within a 20 minute bike ride of the Amazon Campus at 440 Terry Ave. I'd like to have access to a full kitchen, but again if the price is right, I can eat out more often. I'm allergic to cats and dogs, but I love the latter, so as long as your furry friend doesn't have access to my bed, I'm alright. Cats, not so much.

Let me know if I sound like a potential roommate!"

I found that I really like the python workflow but it gave me limited access to a lot of the features I was used to in opencv and the dlib/opencv interface was much more difficult in python. 
Am I missing something, or is this generally the case? I felt handcuffed when using python which may just be my lack of familiarity. Should I trudge through learning it more fully when I'm already experienced with c++, or just stick to what I know?
What other machine learning libraries play well with opencv in python?"
2dqnod,1,2014-08-16,"Three year relationship with my (M23) girlfriend (F23) has been on its last legs for the past two months, and after agreeing to work on communicating better, I find out that she lied to me to avoid confrontation over weekend plans. What happens next?",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2dqnod/three_year_relationship_with_my_m23_girlfriend/,"Started dating in undergrad. Both of us struggle with communication and assertiveness in our own way and it has put stress on the relationship and caused problems in the past. In general she is very non confrontational. I can be sometimes as well. 

She graduated last year and has since been working on her masters which keeps her very stressed and busy. She arrives home from work tired. She doesn't have a lot of time and is admittedly bad at managing her time between work, family, friends, me, etc. Not an uncommon problem. She lives with her family who can be a little old fashioned and she chooses to lie and deceive them in order to do what she wants eg staying out late with me. This is quite obviously learned behavior because I've seen her family pull the same shit between each other. I see a lot of red flags from her family but she is not entirely like them and has been a great source of support in my life. 

I have one more year of undergrad. This summer I am working 10 hour days as an intern. I don't have a great deal of friends but don't get me wrong, when I'm not with her, I'm usually doing something. I go out with coworkers often and I see my other friends when they have time - they have girlfriends, jobs, or other stuff going on. And I play video games and reddit and watch TV if I got nothing else to do. I also live at home with family but they treat me like an adult and I am able to do my own thing for the most part. 

In general, I have more free time than her, and have repeatedly expressed to her that I don't get to see her often enough. There are times when I feel as if I'm in a long distance relationship. I simply don't want this type of relationship. I want to see my SO in person at least 3 times a week and sex 2 times per week. This isn't a firm rule for me just a guide and I've told her the same. Getting privacy can be tough since we both live at home but not impossible. There are clear opportunities that come up almost weekly. We also agreed to do things like Tuesday movie night and at least one weekend night or day together. It's not 3 days and not 2 fucks but I can be happy with this.

The problem is the plan rarely happens. The past two months the arrangement has fully worked for two weeks. The other 6 being seeing each other once, maybe having sex once, or nothing at all. It feels like we are in a relationship only by appearances rather than reality sometimes. She takes it very personally when I express to her that I'm unhappy with how things are going and often plays the victim. 

Three weeks ago, I tried to break up with her after she ditched me for a night out with her girlfriends but she admitted she was wrong and she convinced me to give us another chance. She said she had trouble telling me that she wanted a girls night out and that's why she agreed to hang out with me that night even though she had plans. And btw I have no issue with her wanting friend time but I simply don't want to go a full week without seeing her in person or having sex and I certainly don't want to be deceived or ditched if she has other plans . Talking on the phone with her is just her bitching about her day, me offering my support then talking about my day a bit. It doesn't do much for me. 

We rediscussed the plan and re-committed to it. We talked about improving communication and assertiveness and we agreed to be open and honest if the plan wasn't working so we could reevaluate and maybe try something else. I was happy and confident with this and the makeup sex was amazing. 

Week 1 - we go to a cottage together for 3 days and sex three times. We have a great time. I miss this 

Week 2 - we don't see a movie on Tuesday and her little step brother visits on the weekend so no sex but she invited me to join them for two days on the weekend and we had fun

Week 3 - we don't see a movie on Tuesday, and I made plans to go away for Saturday and Sunday. Friday (yesterday) was up in the air and I didn't communicate until Thursday morning that I'd be in the city Friday night. She gets upset when I ask her to go out Friday night. Says that her step brother is visiting again. I say that she would see him 2 days and me 1 night. She got upset and I backed off. I texted her a bit Friday night but she was unusually unresponsive. I am suspicious of her now and more critical of her claim that her step brother is visiting two weekends in a row. This morning I decide to stop by her house to pick up something I had been meaning to retrieve from her. I called her a few times but no answer. Her family answers the door and tell me she slept at a friend's. So she lied. And her excuse to her family may also be a lie because it's her go to lie when she's with me. I act like nothings wrong and leave. 

Now I am just furious and trying to cool down and enjoy my weekend before I confront her. I plan to end things but my sister doesn't think I should be so quick. Should I try to talk with her or is this a huge red flag on top of our other issues that should be the end of our relationship? Anyone been in a similar situation? How did you handle it? I still love her but I'm interested in having a relationship with an adult and not put up with this bullshit.

**tl;dr Girlfriend lied to me about weekend plans in order to avoid confrontation. I am feeling very hurt. Almost broke up three weeks ago over similar issue. Other issues not getting better. I have little hope for a future with her but I still do love her. How should I handle this? Is this worth discussion with her or should I just end it?**"

&gt;**Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location?** 

US: California. Not near a Microcenter location but I could order online from there.

&gt;**If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated.** 

None, I believe.

&gt;**Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?** 

I am very new to high powered PC's so I assume down the line but again I haven't had any experience with overclocking yet.

&gt;**Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)**

SSD would be nice. I dont need too much. 256 GB would probably be more than plenty even less than that might work.
My biggest concern is that I don't know which kind of graphics card to get and if it will make a difference:  workstation card or desktop card?

&gt;**Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?**

No preference, but I like the ones you can see into. As well as this style caught my eye: the Bitfenix Prodigy line of cases, preferrably the black or white one

&gt;**Do you need a copy of Windows 7 or 8.1 included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference for one or the other?**

Yes, I think so.

&gt;**Extra info or particulars:**

As stated above, I am worried about how a workstation card would work for gaming or how a gaming card would work for CAD and etc.?"
2dqp1c,13,2014-08-16,[Support] I don't know how to deal with my family anymore,olivekhakis,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/2dqp1c/support_i_dont_know_how_to_deal_with_my_family/,"Okay so first of all, I'm a 16 year old girl. I've talked to a few friends about this, but I'm just really lost as to what to do. My parents have been divorced for 8 years, and I get to go to my dad's maybe once a month, which is actually violating the custody settlement. My dad is remarried and I love my stepmom, even if she can be a little lacking in understanding the whole child-of-divorced-parents thing. 

My mom is the problem. My little sister (12) is the golden child; I'm the scapegoat, to use your terms. I have a 21 year old brother who's working on getting his life together and stands up to our mom, and sometimes helps me out, but he can be useless sometimes. 

I'm your classic straight-edged kid. I get A's in Honors/AP (college-level) courses. I sit first chair in my school's orchestra, I do a lot of volunteer work, I don't stay out past 10 and I have a job lifeguarding. Just to give an idea of what I'm like.

None of that seems to be good enough for Nmom. I'm getting my permit soon, and she is constantly holding that over my head as ""You're so irresponsible, you'll never get to drive"". My dad and stepmom strongly disagree with that, but NM is such a bully that their protests are useless. My dad and stepmom and I get along amazingly. There's never any problems between us. Oh, did I mention that my siblings hate them and will never come to their house with me? (He lives in the city, mom is in suburbs)

We went on vacation a few days ago, and of course my sister was allowed to bring a friend and I wasn't. On the last day, we went biking on the boardwalk and NM made me leave my phone behind ""so I wouldn't be texting or listening to music"". The usual. It was around 10PM. My sister and NM got left behind and my sister's friend and I were together, ahead of them. We had no idea where they were, and assumed they went back into the hotel. They saw us on the way back to the hotel and NM was screaming at me for being irresponsible, stupid etc. Told me I should've been more wary of catcalls and such. Made me apologize at least 5 times for not having my phone, getting ahead, not waiting for them. Later that night, she repeated the whole tirade and I apologized more. **She asked me why I was crying and then said ""It's because you're getting yelled at, not because you're genuinely sorry"".** By the way, she didn't have her phone either.

One of the shittier parts of dealing with her is that I'm a very empathetic and emotional person by nature. I used to cry a lot, but she's really fucked up my emotions, to the point where when big emotional events happen (like a break up), I get completely numb to my emotions. However, as soon as she yells at me, I always burst into tears, and usually end up full-out sobbing, complete with hyperventilating and all that jazz. **Every time I cry, she always, without fail, says ""Oh stop the waterworks. You're just doing it for attention"".** I'm constantly told to be more compassionate and more empathetic. I honestly don't understand how I could be. I'm the denmom, advice-giver, whatever you want to call it, of all my friends. Even people I don't know well ask me for advice.

Another example that I will always remember happened a few months ago. We were talking to a friend who runs a charity involving a disease her sons have. They planned a karaoke night and asked if I could sing at it. It was on the same night as a concert I had for orchestra. I said I could pop in briefly but then had to leave for the concert. NM spent the 15 minute car ride to the store calling me ""self-centered, arrogant, vain"". **When we got to the store, she parked the car and called me a nasty bitch, slapped me hard on the thigh, then told me to go buy dog food.** Obviously, I was crying really hard by then and was a general mess. Once we got home, she yelled at me for a good 3 hours, most notably calling me a **""bad person, horrible sister, telling me she was ashamed to be my mom, that she want to know where she went wrong with me""**.

I'm not allowed to go to my friends' houses, except a select few that she likes. I don't get to go places without her chaperoning (she came with on an orchestra trip that parents weren't supposed to be at, since it was an all day competition, and then yelled at me for not making time to be with her). She has my dad pay for every expense in my life, but my little sister can have anything. 

My patrons at work compliment my ambition and work ethic (I aspire to be an oncologist and already have an internship lined up for next summer). My dad treats me with respect, and I often feel like an equal to him rather than a stupid teenager. My teachers love me. As a freshman, I hung out with seniors and juniors and they assumed I was a junior based on how I acted. Not to be arrogant, but I think I'm a mature and competent young lady. 

(I probably sounded really bitchy here, but I'm just really frustrated with the whole situation)

Now to end the wall of text. I don't really know what questions to ask, but I would love some advice or comfort.

2dqunc,11,2014-08-16,[support] So far behind everyone else &amp; hating it,messedup2014,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/2dqunc/support_so_far_behind_everyone_else_hating_it/,"I'm almost 30 &amp; am only just going to graduate college this year. I'm so far behind everyone else, but it isn't because I'm stupid or anything. I've just never known what I wanted to do &amp; did what I thought would make my Nparents happy. I regret so much. My Nparents have always discouraged me. I'm doubting that I'll ever get a job offer in the area I want to live in. I've been here three months and have been so afraid of getting lost that I haven't even left my apartment besides to go to places I already know how to get to. I just went to someplace new yesterday and I feel like I've wasted so much time here the past few months being afraid. 

The only network I have is at my internship and I have no idea how to use it or LinkedIn to try getting a job here. I'm afraid to even ask people to be my reference or ask them if they know of any jobs opening up around here that I could apply for. Most entry level jobs want between 2 &amp; 5 years of experience, that I don't have even though I've been working since I was 16. I've done a lot of different stuff, I've never done one kind of job for more than probably a year. 

My Nparents want to see me when I get back and I don't want to see them but I feel like I don't have a choice since they support me. I'm feeling pretty down about everything. I just want to graduate with a job offer here and move far away but I don't know how to get to that point. I'm afraid no one will even want to take a chance on me if I'm several states away and don't know how to overcome that or figure out what I'd be good at doing. I've thought about marketing/PR because that's what a lot of people with my degree go into. I know the name of someone at a marketing company here but I'm afraid to ask them for help getting a job there - I've never met this person &amp; I'm afraid the job would be too stressful (I deal with depression &amp; anxiety). I'm also afraid that even if I got a professional job and moved back here, I'd end up sucking at it and would get fired &amp; then would really be screwed. 

I just want so badly to escape my Nparents right after college is done. I don't live with them, at least that's something. Whenever I've tried to be an adult, they've fought me tooth and nail. I don't know what a good plan is to get out from under them after graduation. Hope someone can help me."
2dquzn,5,2014-08-16,"[20/M] My first love broke up with me, and over a month later I'm still heartbroken and want nothing more than her to come back.",[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2dquzn/20m_my_first_love_broke_up_with_me_and_over_a/,"Last year I was a sophomore in college, she was a freshman. She had just gotten out of a 2 year relationship but knew it would never amount to anything. I had never been in a relationship before.

We met at a party and hit it off, we texted each other back and forth for a week or two, and by text I mean essays, we'd send each other 30-40 lines worth of text, from song lyrics to movies to food etc. We could always find more similarities between us. I had never felt better in my life, meeting a girl not only beautiful, but introspective and funny, who shared the same awe of life as I did. 

We slept in the same bed whenever we could, we had lunch/dinners together as much as we could, our spare time was dominated by our time together. Admittedly it got serious rather fast, we talked about marriage and the future together, we saw it as true love, and I had never believed in such, but meeting her made me think otherwise, I found the one, and she said she did as well.

We returned from a month long break, agreeing that it was a ""test"" of whether distance would harm us. The distance only made us miss each other more and on returning that day, I asked her out. We dated and things only got better from there. I visited and slept over at her house and met her family the next break, everything went well and we had an amazing time.

We had had some issues here and there but always managed to work them out, we had breakups that lasted a day at most, but I went to a close friend for advice and he had done the same thing with his gf and it's natural to have hesitation with things so serious.

Summer came and I got an internship in DC, I was interning in a place where I could follow my true passion, insects. My gf wasn't a huge fan of them but she didn't mind, and even liked how passionate I was about something. Before I left she visited and met my family, sleeping over too, and we had the best time together we had ever had. She left saying it reassured her of everything between us.

A few weeks later she sent me a scrapbook with so much love and effort put into it, that I broke into tears over how much she loved me and I loved her.

4th of July came around and I visited her family again. It was nice to see her, and we enjoyed being together again, but it wasn't as perfect as last visits. We had a bit of a fight before I came down, she gets a little jealous of me with other girls (I'm the same way about her and guys, it's not a big deal, just something we have to check ourselves for once in a while). I was going out collecting with some of my fellow interns and lied saying it was just me and a few guys going, when in reality one of the girls was coming along. I thought such a thing was such an insignificant white lie that it wouldn't matter, I didn't feel like going through having to explain that I felt nothing for the girl, just that she was coming along, we were friends!

Regardless, at the visit I came clean and my gf got mad with me, saying such a lie really ruined the trust she had in me. On top of this, as someone who really loves whatever they're passionate about, when we went for walks or spent time in her backyard, I was distracted a bit looking for insects (yes I'm pretty strange!).

The last night I was there though we were laying together in her basement and I told her how much she meant to me and all that good stuff, and after that I told her that I noticed she wasn't acting the same and returning the same affection for me she once did, and that I still had for her. 

She said she was having doubts lately and rather rashly agreed we should break up. I left single, thinking, this has happened before, maybe she just needs her space to realize what we have, and that in the end we'll come back to each other.

Sure enough a few days later she messaged me saying she wanted me back, I don't know why, maybe out of pride or that we've gone through this before, but I said I didn't think that was best, and that we should have a full summer apart to really know we stand, just because I didn't want this to be a repeat thing. 

We ended it at that and 2 weeks later I was breaking into tears daily, I lost my appetite, I wasn't enjoying my internship, nothing could distract me from the pain I felt not having her in my life.

I tried messaging her and she said she didn't feel the same anymore and got over me, that she no longer loved me and wanted me to move on. I was devastated, the girl that I loved and who loved me back so much just a few weeks ago had moved on and completely forgot about all the time we shared and how amazing it was.

She said that she was feeling doubts for a while and that I changed over the summer, that I had to stop contacting her and forget about it all. I dwelt on this, I looked back through the scrapbook she sent, I went through the photos of us together and happy, I just couldn't believe that she could just forget everything we had. 

I needed a release so I put it all on paper, I just sat there and wrote out as much as I could remember, from the moment I met her to the moment we broke up. Every memory and feeling I had of her and I. Thinking maybe if I sent her that and showed her how much I still cared about her, she'd realize what a mistake this was and return.

Needless to say I sent it, she unfriended me on facebook, and never read it. I tried contacting her a few times again later but to no avail. I moved on, had weeks of happiness, I knew it had to be over, that if I tried THAT hard, and she didn't budge, she really was done with us.

I started to enjoy life again and was optimistic about the future. This went on for weeks. Last week though she crept back into my mind and I started to remember how much I missed her, that I still loved her more than anything, and that after all that had happened, I would take her back in a heartbeat. 

The last few days I texted her some small poems I wrote, as exchanging poems that we wrote for and about each other was common when we were together. She was an english major who wrote poems in her spare time, and I a bio major, I have no literary ability, but the love we shared was more than inspiration enough for me to write for her.

I texted her Thursday, nothing. I texted her another Friday, I got a response. It was from her mother saying to stop texting her or she'll get in touch with my parents. 

I can tell myself over and over that such a response alone should warrant me to say fuck it all and forget about her. But I've done that before and in the back of my mind I knew I really loved her. 

I'll be seeing her again no doubt when I move back into college, where our mutual friend groups have massive overlap and I'll no doubt have to be in the same room as her regularly at parties etc. 

What should I do here? I'm honestly lost. Sorry for the long wall of text... needed to rant and get it all out there. I'm heartbroken without her as I genuinely believed she was the love of my life."
2drc89,4,2014-08-16,"Confused... glad I found this forum, need advice",redactedtitle,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/2drc89/confused_glad_i_found_this_forum_need_advice/,"I have a dilemma that's been bothering me for a while. I've been lurking and mulling things over and still don't know what to do, so wanted to get an opinion from you all. 

I have an N mother. I have spent the past few years building a life based on not needing money or support from her. She has a two bedroom apartment. After college, I lived there for a while, and it was horrible - she was belittling and difficult. She unscrewed the doorknob off my door so I could never close it, screamed at me, banged on my door, and made sure I could never sleep before my job interviews by picking hours long fights. She is massively emotional, and incredibly cruel. She has said some horrible shit to me and gaslighted me. For example when I was a child, she'd picked on my weight to the point that I had to get treatment for an eating disorder. All through my teen years, she undermined my getting better, saying she'd refuse to pay for college if I tried to use the college health services for therapy. The watchword was ""don't air our family's dirty laundry."" She would also guilt trip me all the time, trying to say that I was crazy and a burden on the family. During summers at college, I would be locked out of the family home, which made getting an internship tricky at times. So living space has been a pawn in this relationship. I know it's not as bad as what some people have dealt with here - which is precisely why it's so hard to leave. 

Luckily, I got a full ride to college because of scholarships. In college, as I got more work experience, I tried to frame her less as a mom and more as a source of money, like a boss. As long as she was paying for my dorm fees, I was happy to be compliant. Yes, there were lots of tears. But I stuck it out - I was trying to appease her on the surface while keeping the money rolling in. 

Since college, I've managed to become financially independent and even saved. I've earned a very modest amount doing a job I love (and a few that I don't). When I was younger, everyone thought I would do great, but most of my friends earn far more than me. Physical pain issues (sometimes mild, sometimes severe) keep me from working more than 40-45 hours a week, but it's been mostly ok. I'm recovering from depression and my ED is gone, and I have my partner, and I'm happy. Thanks go going to school part time since graduation, I've also been admitted to a PhD program, which will give me a small stipend. That was kind of the plan, so I'm kind of thrilled. 

My boyfriend has been hugely supportive in all this. He is the real deal, caring, kind, and a beautiful person. He is also very intelligent, super fun, and hilarious. If I could, I would just marry him right now - we've lived together for three years, and this just feels - right. His family is also awesome. They have paid his way for the past three years and that has allowed us to live together. 

Here's the problem (and sorry if I buried the lede). He has no job and his parents are cutting off as he finishes college, which he has this month. He says that if I keep our apartment, he can pay a tiny amount of it (aka I would support him, using my savings). He'll pay for the rest once he gets a job. 

What if I end up penniless and need to ask my family for money? What if I fail in school? What if my pain issues get worse and I have to withdraw? This has led to panic attacks and restrictive eating. Having dealt with living on a tiny budget for ramen &amp; eggs, the idea of living on an even tinier budget (several thousand dollars below the poverty line) is making me toy with the idea of giving up on food or trying to starve myself again. I know it's irrational, but I can feel these issues rearing their heads again. 

There have also been fights - he is very defensive about the idea of saying WHEN he would get a job. I know he wants to live with me but he won't DO anything about it. Honestly, I think he's willing to move back home and just live off his parents for a while. Shame - about money, about my relationship with my family - keeps me from being able to talk about this with friends. 

The people on here are so tough and so resourceful and have dealt with so much more than this. So - tell me - what should I do? Should I move back home until my boyfriend comes to his senses? (Which might be the push he needs to get his life on track...). Should I try to find roommates, even though it'll take more time and money to move in with him once he comes to his senses? Should I take an apartment and let him live with me? - the small amount he could contribute to a studio apartment would be an EQUIVALENT deal to living with roommates... but somehow it scares me, taking on a lease I can't afford if he left me.  

Thanks for any ideas you might have....

tldr; not enough money - boyfriend has no job, do I dare moving back home...."
2drklg,7,2014-08-16,Girlfriend lied to avoid confrontation over weekend plans. How would TRP handle this?,[deleted],asktrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/2drklg/girlfriend_lied_to_avoid_confrontation_over/,"Broad background info:

Started dating in undergrad. Both of us struggle with communication and assertiveness in our own way and it has put stress on the relationship and caused problems in the past. In general she is very non confrontational. I can be sometimes as well. 

She graduated last year and has since been working on her masters which keeps her very stressed and busy. She arrives home from work tired. She doesn't have a lot of time and is admittedly bad at managing her time between work, family, friends, me, etc. Not an uncommon problem. She lives with her family who can be a little old fashioned and she chooses to lie and deceive them in order to do what she wants eg staying out late with me. This is quite obviously learned behavior because I've seen her family pull the same shit between each other. I see a lot of red flags from her family but she is not entirely like them and has been a great source of support in my life. 

I have one more year of undergrad. This summer I am working 10 hour days as an intern. I don't have a great deal of friends but don't get me wrong, when I'm not with her, I'm usually doing something. I go out with coworkers often and I see my other friends when they have time - they have girlfriends, jobs, or other stuff going on. And I play video games and reddit and watch TV if I got nothing else to do. I also live at home with family but they treat me like an adult and I am able to do my own thing for the most part. 

In general, I have more free time than her, and have repeatedly expressed to her that I don't get to see her often enough. There are times when I feel as if I'm in a long distance relationship. I simply don't want this type of relationship. I want to see my SO in person at least 3 times a week and sex 2 times per week. This isn't a firm rule for me just a guide and I've told her the same. Getting privacy can be tough since we both live at home but not impossible. There are clear opportunities that come up almost weekly. We also agreed to do things like Tuesday movie night and at least one weekend night or day together. It's not 3 days and not 2 fucks but I can be happy with this.

The problem is the plan rarely happens. The past two months the arrangement has fully worked for two weeks. The other 6 being seeing each other once, maybe having sex once, or nothing at all. It feels like we are in a relationship only by appearances rather than reality sometimes. She takes it very personally when I express to her that I'm unhappy with how things are going and often plays the victim. 

Specific background info:

Three weeks ago, I tried to break up with her after she ditched me for a night out with her girlfriends but she admitted she was wrong and she convinced me to give us another chance. She said she had trouble telling me that she wanted a girls night out and that's why she agreed to hang out with me that night even though she had plans. And btw I have no issue with her wanting friend time but I simply don't want to go a full week without seeing her in person or having sex and I certainly don't want to be deceived or ditched if she has other plans . Talking on the phone with her is just her bitching about her day, me offering my support then talking about my day a bit. It doesn't do much for me. 

We rediscussed the plan and re-committed to it. We talked about improving communication and assertiveness and we agreed to be open and honest if the plan wasn't working so we could reevaluate and maybe try something else. I was happy and confident with this and the makeup sex was amazing. 

Week 1 - we go to a cottage together for 3 days and sex three times. We have a great time. I miss this 

Week 2 - we don't see a movie on Tuesday and her little step brother visits on the weekend so no sex but she invited me to join them for two days on the weekend and we had fun

The main reason I'm posting:

Week 3 - we don't see a movie on Tuesday, and I made plans to go away for Saturday and Sunday. Friday (yesterday) was up in the air and I didn't communicate until Thursday morning that I'd be in the city Friday night. She gets upset when I ask her to go out Friday night. Says that her step brother is visiting again. I say that she would see him 2 days and me 1 night. She got upset and I backed off. I texted her a bit Friday night but she was unusually unresponsive. I am suspicious of her now and more critical of her claim that her step brother is visiting two weekends in a row. This morning I decide to stop by her house to pick up something I had been meaning to retrieve from her. I called her a few times but no answer. Her family answers the door and tell me she slept at a friend's. So she lied. And her excuse to her family may also be a lie because it's her go to lie when she's with me. I act like nothings wrong and leave. 

Now I am just furious and trying to cool down and enjoy my weekend before I confront her. I plan to end things but my sister doesn't think I should be so quick. Should I try to talk with her or is this a huge red flag on top of our other issues that should be the end of our relationship? Anyone been in a similar situation? How did you handle it? I still love her but I'm interested in having a relationship with an adult and not put up with this bullshit.

tl;dr Girlfriend lied to me about weekend plans in order to avoid confrontation. I am feeling very hurt. Almost broke up three weeks ago over similar issue. Other issues not getting better. I have little hope for a future with her but I still do love her. How should I handle this? Is this worth discussion with her or should I just end it?"
2drzg6,9,2014-08-17,Normalcy is relative and to find 'your' normal feels so good.,daveedgamboa,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2drzg6/normalcy_is_relative_and_to_find_your_normal/,"As some backstory I haven't really been happy for nearly 7 years. I've battled extreme bouts of depression and suicidal thoughts since almost freshman year of high school. My family is very religious. My dad is Mexican and my mom is Irish so to not be catholic is worthy of being kicked out of the house. 

Anyways, since I was a kid in elementary school I had never felt as though I fit in. I always felt different or special. Couldn't distinguish the two for many years. It was a blurred line of ""Am I just really special in my own way"" or ""Am I just that weird kid that loves reptiles and a bowl cut."" This only heightened when in middle school I realized how much of a difference a change in hair style and shirt can make. I was all of a sudden a 'cool' kid. Inside though I still very much felt like the weird bowl cut kid and I couldn't relate to the cool kids or the 'weird' kids so I just took it in stride. Into 7th grade relationships, emotion and intimacy were hard for me. Not because the opportunities didn't present themselves but rather I just felt very uncomfortable, in a way I in no way could explain. Starting in 7th grade I was bullied for two years in band class. They'd make fun of my innocence (oddly enough never cared much for the emotional insults). The fucked up thing they did was to force me to watch porn and masturbate everyday. If I didn't they'd do it themselves to me and they'd also mock what turned me on in videos. So in a way it felt like they raped me of my innocence. At the time though masturbation was the only thing that really brought me joy, other than soccer. 

Fast forward to high school and immediately a really cute girl starts talking to me. We're basically in a relationship but my head never grasps the concept. It's literally impossible for me to accept that I'm in a relationship. No matter how much she showed me that she cared I couldn't give any love back. I felt almost like an emotionless stone. I brushed it off as being nervous and not having experience. In Sophomore year I got caught up with the wrong crowd (Never did anything wrong but I picked up a few of their attitudes and resulted in awful grades). I also sustained an injury that forced me out of the only thing that brought me joy. After 14 years of playing soccer I was done and my chances at a good school were also shot. To add on to that my parents were on my case about religion, not having many relationships and friendships. I fell into a really deep hole. Depression took over and my parents never understood mental illness so they refused to believe I could sink that low. Even my suicidal thoughts were simply brushed off as over-exaggeration. Junior year was no different until I had an idea for a business. I started my own non-profit and it was like finding jesus (I'm not actually religious but this is a good analogy due to the mindset I was in). I was in utter bliss and in my element. I had never felt more alive than when I was working and making rationally based decisions all the time and reading/expecting the consumers thoughts. My family is all sporty though. I decided to go down a more artsy path and there are absolutely zero artists in my immediate and extended family so everybody assumed I was a complete failure (Even though I had my own non-profit). They also assumed I was gay because I never had relationships while my brother was getting girls all the time while in only 7th grade. I brushed it off for a while but it gets to you eventually. 

Now onto college. The first year is normal, I sit down and study my ass off. Get great grades and I have accomplished a lot of things. Became an IG sensation, worked at a top tier tech company, met celebs, etc. Just a great year and I focused on myself which was awesome. Very few depressive episodes. My work became my pillar of stability. Kept my life in check. Of course though, my family and few friends continued giving me shit for no relationships, friends and lack of an extensive social life. To please them, I sought out to make more friends and broaden my social life in my second year. What a mistake that was. I started partying more (Not a lot but a lot for my usual). I started hanging out with these frat guys. Talking to some girls, even though I never really dated any of them. I simply found each one intriguing. Then I start applying to internships and I don't get any. I again did a fair amount of impressive work in my field (Social/Digital Media) but nothing. I'm always ""Too young"", ""Ideas are too bold for us"" and other things. Again my pillar came tumbling down and unlike most people I find no comfort in being consoled by friends. None. I fell into one of the worst moments of my life. ""Again in my second year,"" I'd think to myself. I failed 3 classes. Barely passed one and got a B in another. It was high school sophomore year all over again. 

So now onto the reason for this whole post. I decided to finally go to a therapist. No matter what my parents said. I simply told them, ""I'm going. Maybe you're right and I have nothing but I'm 99.99% sure you're wrong."" The first sessions were interesting. I realized many subtle things I had never noticed. As a kid I didn't like being held. I'd make my mom cry because I'd run out of her arms to be alone with my books or toys. I hated affection. My best friend for 6 years was an autistic kid who I didn't realize was autistic until I asked my mom about it a few weeks before. To me he had always seemed normal. There was a lot of searching. A lot of talking about me, which I typically don't like to do if it's personal. I discovered that relationships, sex and social life held absolutely zero importance to me. The only times they mattered to me were because I wanted to please/impress my family. In doing something that felt morally wrong, being emotionally vulnerable and having to show some fake emotion, I got whipped into a weird depressive state. I realized that I always spoke with a very keen filter and never said what I actually thought/meant. In the end I was diagnosed with Narcissistic Personality Disorder. Since then I've been just, *me*. I've never just allowed my thoughts to flow freely and it feels so good. I always thought I was a hopeless depressive who would never figure it out but it ended up being a side effect of other things. I've now started a new business and I'm so fucking happy. I've never been in such a good place. It made me realize how relative ""important"" things are and how impacting it can be to a person when you impose your values on people that you assume have similar basic values as yourself.

I just found out that in October I am moving to Tokyo for a 10 week internship at an advertising agency. First thing is of course to find a place to live - the agency did not offer this. Their office is located near Ebisu station so anywhere as close as possible to that would be great. It's only 10 weeks but I do not want to share bathrooms or live in a guest house so I'm looking for a furnished studio - I know it's going to be very tiny compared to US standards, but I really appreciate my privacy. I've found a couple of small apartments in Gotanda that seemed OK but any advice is appreciated.

I am willing to pay 100 000-120 000 for housing depending on what's included. Price negotiable.

Then of course is everything else I need to find out about. If anyone would like to take me on and be my contact/guide when I get there you are more than welcome to!

Thanks for your help~ "
2dsdtn,6,2014-08-17,My [19F] best friends of 6 years also [19F] are so difficult to plan outings with,joan2468,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2dsdtn/my_19f_best_friends_of_6_years_also_19f_are_so/,"There are these 3 girls whom I've technically known since primary school, but we only became closer when we were 14. Now, back in school, these girls were great. I loved them more than I did any other friend and we felt the most comfortable when we were around each other. I had depression when I was 14 and my previous group had ditched me. It was a rough patch, they took me in and I got through it great. We've all had rough patches we helped each other throughout. I appreciate them so much.

But here's the kicker. After we graduated from school, it became so, so difficult to get them all together for an outing. They're still great friends but ironically I probably see them the least now out of all the friends I have. We still talk a lot online (chat, not Skype, because they feel awkward when video chatting) but I value real-life interaction a lot more so it frustrates me that if we're lucky we have like one or two outings a month. It's a combination of apathy and factors not quite within their control. One of them has a crazy restrictive family who hardly ever lets her go out for fun, and because we almost never have outings unless there's at least 3 of us, this alone makes the others more reluctant to go out. 

Otherwise it's not that they're actually super busy or anything. It's summer break now and they've mainly just been sitting around at home while I've been having internships and volunteer work but I still make time for my friends.

I feel like I'm the one usually trying to initiate the plans, but most of the time I get ignored - if I ask 'When are we going to meet up?' it's usually just waved off with a 'I don't know'. But if someone else suggests something they all usually jump on the bandwagon immediately. 

I'm not quite sure what kind of advice I'm looking for. I just feel incredibly frustrated at how rarely I get to see my friends. I study abroad so I only come home for 3 months max every year. I've been home for 2 months now and only seen them twice.

Currently out on an internship ending at the end of Aug. Started at ~225lbs. So progressing, slowly, but it's something at least.

Currently work a 7:30-3:30 job, mon-fri. I get in 5 days a week for the gym, days 1,3,5 doing SL 5x5 and cardio 2,4. Gym was in the basement of my work, about 1 1/2 hours away from home in the first palce.

At the end of the month I'm going back to school 4 days a week, Mon-Thurs. School is over an hour away and I take public transit ($5 each way). There is a gym that I have access though tuition fees at my school.

I'm currently planning on adjusting my workout days to SL 5x5 Mon/Wed, cardio Tues/Thurs.

From my understanding SL 5x5 recommends 3 times a week, 1 day rest between days 1 and 2, and days 2 and 3.

Not sure what I should do with not having ""easy"" access to a gym for the Friday.

Should I stick to doing cardio on Friday and adjust workout mon/wed/thurs, or should I bite the bullet and still go into my school on the Friday to get my workout in?

Also, not going to have a job during the year, so limited money so can't get a local gym membership and I'd rather not have to spend extra money on transit if I don't have to. Also do not have any equipment at home to do a home gym thing.

Any advice is appreciated, thank you.

TL;DR Currently doing 5 days, 1/3/5 SL 5x5 soon only going to have 4 days with easy access to gym, advice on what i can do."

Rant/ Update?",whatdafuckhappened,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2dsscr/my_my_my_how_things_change_rant_update/,"Made this throwaway to get a deep secret of mine off my chest earlier this year. I would link the previous post but I'm on mobile, so I'll do it when I get the chance. If you want the story it's the only other thing posted on my account. I also sound rather teenagey, but I suppose that's what love does right?

Original story TL;DR started fucking my best friend and thought we were falling for each other but life timing was shitty. Or so I thought...

Five months have passed since then. I ended up getting failing the one class I needed to graduate, so I'm pushed back another year. On the bright side, I was awarded a very prestigious internship in France for six months, which I am currently halfway through. I'm volunteering with a non-profit in the field that I want to do my PhD in. At this point, I could care less about repeating the class because I know the future is wide open. He's still on the med school track. 

About the time he learned I was officially going to France, he started pulling away from me. At first, it was gradual and I chalked it up to his course load. [I also was fooling around with a guy in tinder (which he was fully aware of the situation and it hadn't stopped is before. For god sakes he's been on dates with me as a wingman!!) but that started way before the France offer].  When I mentioned he was kind of being a dick to me, he apologized and stopped it briefly. But I still noticed he was sharing less with me than he used to. 

Then a bunch of our friend and I went on spring break together. We had some people cancel at the last minute, so of course I tell him to find some people to fill the spot. He brings one of the girls he was hooking up with at the time and her friend. I didn't know they were hooking up at the time, but when I saw the massive hickey on her neck and the way he was acting around her, I put two and two together. He also continued to be a dick to me. I was not happy with him, and neither were the rest of our friends. My best friend bitched slapped him over his treatment of me, and he still didn't really get the message. We didn't hook up or anything during this week. 

After spring break, I went over to his house like normal times. It was normal. We cuddled, hooked up, I spend the night, and he treated me like a princess. Like he always had in the past. 

A week after spring break I went out of town for a conference. Prior to all this weirdness, we constantly texted/ talked. I could call him out the blue for no reason (like normal friends do), and now I can barely get a full sentence out of him. Fucking aggravating. But finals were coming up. 

When I got back from the conference, I didn't see or hear from him at all that week. When I came back in town, I asked very nicely for birthday sex, and he turned me down. That's the first time that's happened, and I was not happy.  I know it was finals week, but it hasn't stopped us before for doing things we should be. It turns out he was off studying with another girl in the church library (he is very much an atheist). As I've iterated before, I'm not mad that he talks/ hooks up with other girls, I get mad that he ignores me when I've been his friend for so long. The kicker was when he brought her to a post-finals party and basically refused to a knowledge my presence.  I was beyond pissed about this and everything else; it just snowballed together. After leaving the party on the verge of tears, I was to the point where I didn't want to see him or talk to him again. 

When I found out I wasn't graduating, I texted him and went off about everything. I was hurt. I wanted to try to fix things with him. I didn't care about him seeing other people, I just wanted my friendship back.  Believe it or not I actually like the girl. I had class with her a year before and she's genuinely sweet. I came over and basically collapsed in him (metaphorically). He (metaphorically) caught me. He was sorry and I could tell me meant it. In order to prove it to me, he took me out to the nicest restaurant in the city: little black dress, suit, the whole nine yards. It was just like old times, and strictly platonic. And that was fine. We planned out European backpacking trip and discussed everything under the sun. 

The times I saw him after that dinner and before I left for France were also platonic, but the sexual tension was still there. I also know he was starting to really like the other girl, despite what he told me. The day before I left I went over to say goodbye. It took us a solid five minutes to say a wordless goodbye, with us just standing in the driveway not wanting to let each other go.

As planned, I went off. I absolutely love France, and I feel more at home there than I ever have been. But I miss him terribly. I thought he would miss me and make some sort of effort to contact me: there has been zero effort on his part. The few times I've spoken to him have all been my doing. He hasn't even gotten his passport yet! Which I've been telling him to do since February. I see more and more pictures of him and the ""girl"" traveling, at the beach, etc., and have come to the conclusion that they're dating. He made her his profile picture, which he only does for girls he dates. It's been a fucking stab in the chest. Every. Damn. Time. 

I told him I had feelings for him a few weeks before I found out about about France. He said he knew and didn't reciprocate but it didn't change how he acted around me.  I told him that I didn't want to date him at the time because we are on such different paths. He agreed and said our time is ""down the road"", which I've known all along.

I have no idea what's real and what's not anymore. He's changed so much in the past few months that I barley recognize the person I met all those years ago. I've also come to realize he's the only man I've ever truly loved. Everyone I've told the story to says it's a defense mechanism on his part and that he'll come around. That I still have a chance. The hope I held on to so strongly at the beginning of the summer fades with each passing day. I suppose all I can do is chalk it up to the pain of unrequited love. But I can't make myself fully let go, not yet. 

Due to some visa issues, I had to come home for a whole to get it sorted out. He knows I'm in town, and neither of us has talked. If he wanted to see me, he has my number. But I doubt that'll happen, and I almost don't want it to so I can move on with my life. 

This whole thing has hurt me more than I ever thought it would. I know we both share the blame, but I feel like a punching bag. I'm tired of being pissy and depressed from this. I just want him back. Not even to kiss. Just to have what we had before - pure and simple friendship.

2dt0ok,3,2014-08-17,Not buying my arguments for alcohol anymore.,yes_its_that_bad,stopdrinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2dt0ok/not_buying_my_arguments_for_alcohol_anymore/,"I've always been interested in drugs and being some kind of intoxicated, since the age of 12-13. I managed to restrain myself until I was almost 17 before I tried weed one night, followed by alcohol the next. My opinion was that alcohol was much stupider, and that was my reason for smoking weed first. This opinion was only strengthened after my first night with alcohol. I carried on some years afterwards smoking weed occasionally, then regularly, then wanting something a little more powerful. The easiest option was adding alcohol. My habit of alcohol also began as an occasional thing, however it stayed that way for years.

Eight years later, I am going to college as a Senior in the US, although I am from Canada. I am extremely fortunate to be doing this. However, once I moved down here three years ago, alcohol really took over as I was scared to smoke weed here, due to not knowing anyone and potentially getting a job here. I believe it's best to do neither regularly, but I seemed to ""need"" to have something.

My habit had some ups and downs over the past three years, but clearly was headed in a bad direction. Due to it I have performed less well than I could have in school, and basically put no effort into finding an internship or job. All I really did was skip as many assignments and classes as possible while still having a chance at an A, so I could be drunk as much as possible. All of the B's I now have were absolutely alcohol related. My GPA is pretty good, but my resume is basically shit otherwise, and I don't like that feeling. I would just go home in the summer each year to a comfortable easy job, and wait until 5 PM to start drinking 6-12 beers each day.

I found an opportunity for some sort of change in my final week at home (last week) when my old friend told me he had shrooms and I could have some. I have always been a big fan of eating them and had a couple good experiences a few years ago. I was ready to eat a good amount and try to change my mind about life and alcohol. Unfortunately, he was not able to get very much, but it was enough for me to have some significant thoughts about my situation. What was I doing literally pouring poison into the only living organism I had control over?

For the past while it's really felt like there's been an argument between my conscious self and my subconscious. I've always, always been conscious of the fact that alcohol has been messing things up. I would always have a feeling that I needed it, and I would always find a way to make an argument in favor of this feeling. I would almost always lose this argument and drink.

After the shrooms, I was still aware of the thoughts I had about alcohol, but I still had to fight my feelings for wanting it. Of course I gave in a few days later (After being proud of those few days). The beer tasted horrible. I was extremely surprised. It took forever just to get one down. There wasn't enjoyment, and instead of a constant pressure to drink as much as possible as fast as possible, it just sat there beside me.

Since then I have moved south again, into a new apartment. My determined subconscious came along and figured out to just buy beer that tastes better. Unfortunately I did, but it wasn't much better. I only drank three of them two nights in a row, and it just seemed to be a waste of money and time. It didn't seem to add any enjoyment like I was convinced it would.

Of course, my subconscious concluded it wasn't enjoyable because I wasn't drinking enough. Even though I'm a lightweight and my tolerance to it was now quite low, it apparently wasn't good enough. Last night I was determined to at least have a six pack. I managed to put the 12 pack back on the shelf after picking it up, and leave with six.

I drank and drank, waiting to enjoy things more. I was enjoying myself before I started drinking, so why not enjoy myself more? It didn't happen. As the sixth drink was almost gone, I somehow managed to spill it. Now, I am usually well coordinated when drunk, and spilling something happens once a year, if that. I flipped out. I wasn't enjoying anything and I went and spilled beer on the carpet. I wanted to punch a hole in the wall and throw things. Fortunately I didn't. I directed all my anger at how I tried to convince myself to start the habit up again, after being given a chance to change my mind.

I think my attempts to get back into it have done nothing but convince me of how stupid and pointless it is to do. While I certainly know how stupid it is, I really think I'm starting to feel that way now. I've subscribed here for two years and haven't posted because of the rule of only posting while sober. I think it's about time now."

Long time reader of r/childfree on my main, though!

Sorry if this is a bit disjointed. I just have a lot of feelings and things on my mind, and I don't really have an outlet to let them free. This has been bottled for awhile.

I feel awful feeling this way, but I can't stand my oldest sister, J, especially now that she has a 1.5 year old son (who is shaping up to be quite the brat). I feel like she's taking my parents away from me, taking any thunder I have, and in general just uses me as a way to get attention or get an ego boost.

Funny thing is, she used to be my sun and stars when I was a kid.

We were all raised in a Catholic household, but none of us kids really took it seriously. In college, she drank, she partied, she marched in the Pride parade. She danced on tables and had dreams of teaching kids about the importance of art, music, and all around creativity. She supported my interest in creative work and wanted me to flourish.

Then she met her then-boyfriend, now husband, who converted her into being part of the LDS church, and she took a total 180 flip. She preached about the importance of godliness, began a hate crusade on gay people, removed all her piercings and tried to get her tattoos lasered off, and went so far as to criticize her own family and steal from us. My mom had enough and kicked her out of the house, and we thought it would be the last of it all.

This past Christmas, my mom allowed her back into the family since she had ~her precious Grandson~. Turns out, J moved away only about 10 minutes from my parents' house! Now everything is under the bridge, which is great - but she hasn't changed, other than to become the stereotypical mombie type. Everything is about her son, Cal, and every conversation turns into something about Cal.

My other older sister, Christina, flew in from California with her husband for my college graduation this past June; my dad was there too, and he flew in from work in Dubai. I was excited to celebrate Father's Day together with my graduation, because i love my dad very much, and I was excited for my other sister and brother in law, because they're AWESOME people.

Well. Everything became about J and her baby, because her birthday was also coming up, and everyone would have had to leave by that time. My dad had little to no say in what he wanted to do, but went along with it because he loves babies and is glad J is back in the family. I also didn't get to pick where I wanted to eat to celebrate my bachelor's degree. I didn't get to choose my own dessert. People came to my ceremony, but in the end, only my California-Sister/brother in law and my boyfriend truly congratulated me.

Everything else was cooing and being excited for the baby. If I ever tried to mention the internship i was taking across the country that I had to leave for with my boyfriend the day after, J would just change it back to baby talk, and show off the baby. I didn't feel like I made much of an accomplishment at all, or that I mattered. Most of all, I felt angry that she was taking my dad's day away from him, after all he's done for us.

I'm currently serving an internship across the country, and I'm homesick. Or at least, I thought I was - I don't know where I want to go or what I want to do now.

On my birthday last week, J asked for my address. I know that money is tight with her, and I knew that answering her texts meant bombardments of baby photos (EVERY TIME), but I responded because it was heartwarming that it seemd she cared. Instead, she said ""I don't have money, so here's your gift: I'M PREGNANT AGAIN! [ultrasound photo] Don't tell mom and dad, I'm going to tell them on their wedding anniversary in a few weeks! Oh and btw happy birthday"".

Yeah. Thanks. I just told her congratulations.

I felt pretty disrespected, but who could I talk to about that? I can't breach her trust and tell my parents, even though she's apparently planning to mommyjack their anniversary too.

I've been trying to get in contact with my dad, who has finished his tour in Dubai; he JUST moved home this past weekend. Every weekend, regardless of where he is, he normally calls me to see how I am. Every weekend for the past two and a half years, same time, same day. It always makes me feel great because I truly love and respect my dad, and I miss him very much.

He's promised he would fly out to where I am to help roadtrip me back home when we can figure out a time. Originally, that time was going to be around now. Then it got pushed to the start of September. Then the middle, then the end. Now I don't know when I'm going home.

I wanted to talk to him this weekend about it because I haven't been feeling great and I wanted to know when I can go home - otherwise, I may just take the 12 hour drive alone with my bird. He told he was going to call me at 10 AM yesterday.

10 AM passes, then 11. Then 12. I texted him that I'd be busy around 2 because I would be at a tea tasting with my boyfriend. He called at 1:45 when I was driving to leave a chipper message that he and my mom are spending time with Calvin and they'd try again later. Later meant calling at 2:00 when the tasting began, after I had sent a text much earlier that I'd be busy. He left a second voicemail stating he'd just call me back when I'd text him when I was free.

After the tasting, I DID text him - to no response. I tried calling, no response. I haven't heard from him at all since, other than my oldest sister sending me texts of them all having a great time together.

Also, in general, if I try to contact my mom when she's not at work, she's been coerced into watching Cal or she doesn't respond to my texts because she's busy with something about him. For the record, she's going blind from cataracts and has severe arthritis to the point that it takes her 20 minutes to get out of bed in the morning.

I feel kind of heartbroken for some reason. Granted, I am type II bipolar, maybe that's a part of it - and I have been in a depressive state. But all of this hits me so hard.

I don't know if I should bother going home at this point. I wanted to go home to take care of my mom, since her health is starting to go south; I wanted to go home to see my friends; I wanted to go home because living in this strange place with my boyfriend and his family is stressful. But maybe it's worth it to be away from J and her bratty kid and misogynist husband.

I don't know what to do. I'm sorry this is so disjointed. I just needed somewhere to scream. There were other moments, like Easter, when it was also really bad - but I won't get into that (long story short, making it all about her and shutting me out had me ready to just end it all).

tl;dr - My oldest sister uses the fact she has the only grandson and loves babies/plans to have lots of babies to get attention, especially from my parents, and to get an ego boost. It's tearing me apart little by little, and I'm at my wits end because I can't even contact my own parents because of her."

I enjoy programming a lot so I think an intersection of statistics and computer science in private industry is where I want to be.  I'm not really interested in medical or government research.

With regard to background, I'm about to enter my fourth year of a five-year combined BS/MS program at a large state school where I'll come out with an MS in Statistics.  Our department tends to be heavily on the theory and frequentist side with very little computational statistics and zero classes on Bayesian methodology.  I have a math major finished and intend to take more computer science.  I am reasonably comfortable with Matlab, R, SQL, and Python and took an MBA-level class on data mining.  This summer I did a tiny bit of research as part of an internship.  It seems like my background is decent but I don't have much experience with programming.

Will the lack of a computer science degree hinder my job hunt if I'm looking to get more involved in ""big data""?  Outside of that MBA class I probably won't have much formal education on data mining and machine learning.  Additionally, since my MS will be from a large state school, will my job search be hindered if I want to move outside where I currently live?  What other concerns should I worry about, and how should I differentiate myself from the crowd?  Thanks so much!"
2dto3o,1,2014-08-17,These last 5 months,goawaythrowawaypls,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2dto3o/these_last_5_months/,"Hi guys, haven't posted here in a while, guess it's time to, maybe it'll help. Please don't judge any of my decisions, advice and discussion is appreciated.

About 5 months ago, I quit my job. I had 2k€ in the bank, no debts, no expenses, living at my parents' with free food and all, summer season was just starting (I was sure I'd get a job at a bar, which is what I was working previously) and I was sick to the stomach of that job and low payment. So I quit, about time, to be honest.

3 months passed and after delivering a lot of CVs, a job was nowhere to be found. I still had all dem moniez and gainzzzz, so I wasn't worried, I was living life while I was still young (playing dota 2 all day). So I decided to go to Norway on an internship in my area. I was HYPED. Everyone kept telling me: ""No, don't go, that's bullshit, they'll rip you off"". I never listen to anyone, I live my own experiences. So I sent the e-mail, was ready to make the 800€ payment, was ready to pay the trip to Norway, was ready to live half a year in a paid internship with food and housing. 

Some days before I was going to take care of the papers for the internship, someone proposed me a ""job"" offer. I didn't know what it was but went to a group session with their collaborators and I loved it. I still do. It's a MLM company that focuses on nutrition and fitness. My life changed completely from that day, I'm much healthier, fitter and feel much better about everything in life. The people are also amazing, best group of people I've met, everyone is so active and uplifting all the time. It's seriously amazing. After I got into the MLM, I got 2 job offers which I refused because I wanted to focus on it.

So I started the business, a kind of internship to know the ins and outs, went to a lot of trainings and group sessions to learn how to do the business, spend a lot of money on gas, outside food and the trainings themselves. My family started eating our food, which meant a lot of the food in the house was paid by me, which never happened before. So that's another debit.

Everything was going normal, I hadn't seen much income yet but I was just in the beginning (still am, by the way), when all of a sudden: BAM, phone breaks. ""Ok, shit happens, I'll just buy a new one, I have money""

More trainings, more gas spent, some bad decisions with lending money/products to ""friends"", then BAM: I get a ticket. ""Ok, shit happens, I have money, no prob."".

2 weeks ago, business is still normal, still with low income but the problem was that people kept disappointing me with: ""Oh yeah, that sounds awesome, I'll come back later and buy X and Y and N"", this happened with a lot of people and I got really angry about it. I needed money, I had very little money left, I was still unemployed and the MLM was still not covering the money I had spent. Motivation drops and I stopped working because of it, which means I wasn't making money.

Which brings me to today.

I lose my fucking phone. The phone two fucking weeks after I bought it (I was using an old one until then). My contacts are there, my fucking phone number is there, it was a great phone that allowed for great pictures and important things for the business. And I lost it because I decided to go to the beach for the 2nd time this year.

Now I can't tell any of this to anyone because I know how my family is, they'll judge me. And my friends aren't really my friends when I ask them for a favor and they fuck me over. I can turn to my organization, they'll listen and help me, but that's it.


TL;DR: I spent all my money (I could've saved more on meals and by being more careful); I have no stable job; the business isn't going as good as I expected at this early stage and I'm too proud to tell anyone for fear of judgement.

I guess I'm gonna start looking for a part-time, work my ass off on it and my business and recover my phone number (at least that)...

2dttsh,1,2014-08-17,I don't know what my parents want from me!!,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2dttsh/i_dont_know_what_my_parents_want_from_me/,"I honestly don't know anymore.  It seems like nothing I do is right.  I don't know when I'll ever get to a point in my life where I'll be enough for them. This honestly is just a rant post but I'd to hear if anyone has similar experiences and how they've dealt with them.

For example, just last week my friend was coming to stay over for a week for holiday.  My parents were totally cool with it and were even giving me suggestions to where I should take her.  They showed no sign of having any problem with her coming over.  My friend comes over and we just chill go places, etc.  We'd be gone for most days from morning to about midnight.  Usually my parents want me home by dark and rarely ever let me out but they told me that this week was okay because I had a friend over (she's not from the U.S and is one of my closest friends from uni).  
My father just gave me a whole lecture today how I'm so quick to hang out with my friends and spend the whole day out with them but not with my parents.  He started talking about how they're getting older and I'm going to realize it because I'm always out with my friends.  I felt like crap because I love my parents more than anyone in this world!  I just felt so confused because first off, I'm never allowed to go out.  I have to secretly go out in order to hang out with friends.  This was my first week ever in my life outside of school trips to be able to freely go out with my friends with my parents knowing.  Other than that, I've had to go out while my parents were out of town which is often.  Like, every week.  And even then so, they call me to make sure I'm at home.  Anyways, it's like they complain that I spend too much time with my friends and not enough time with them when I don't get to go out like others are (and for the record, i'm 20 years old), and when I do want to spend time with them, they're too busy.  Like I said, my parents go out of town regularly and when I plan trips to the museum for example, they're too tired and seem like they have to gather enough energy to go.  Like my dad will complain on how much he's tired and will nitpick at all the things going wrong on the trip like how I didn't bring his water or something like that. 

And it's not like I don't want to spend time with them!  I pray to Allah regularly asking that we become more of a family and do family things such as go on outings or just be a family at home.  I go to my friends' homes and they watch television with their parents and just chill at home.  That is rare in my household.  If I'm at home, I better be either cleaning, practicing my musical instruments, exercising, or studying.  This is my first summer where I'm not spending it all doing summer courses.  I did one this summer instead of two which is giving me free time but I am not allowed free time.  While all of my friends are watching tv, hanging out with friends, sleeping in, I am still expected to keep busy.  Even after I have cleaned the house, practiced by instruments, and exercised, I get crap for not doing anything.  My dad tells me that I'm not progressing and am staying at a standstill and that if it continues, I'll never get anywhere in life.  I've had internships already and was planning on getting one this summer in place of my second summer course but my dad said we were traveling overseas.  Now while getting mad at me for not doing anything, he says he does not want me to come anymore.  I am constantly looking for better internships but he thinks I'm just wasting my time on the internet.  He doesn't know how getting internships work!!  My parents grew up in wealthy well known families in our home country where they went to boarding schools and were cared for by school administration.  Despite being successful, my father was a jokester in school and had things easy growing up.  I'm proud of him getting the American dream though and can't dismiss his accomplishments of making it out the America on his own and copping a crib in Beverly Hills and owning all these cars and blah blah blah blah blah.  He made it for himself.  My mother went to a top school and got her degrees despite her mother saying she didn't have too.  I'm happy they showed me what hard work is but to be honest, I'm just so tired of everything revolving around success and progressing etc.  I just want a family.  A consistent family.  I want to be able to come home and know that I can relax and be comfortable IN MY OWN HOME.  When my parents are out of town, I go over to my friend's home to feel happy and hang out with her family.  How sad is that???  

Another example is with extracurriculars.  I've been a good kid.  I went to private school my whole life.  I've been religious my whole life.  I've had a great childhood.  They were the best years of my life.  But I was constantly pushed to be something.  In elementary school, I had to wake up at 4:00am at the earliest to go to the figure skating rink to practice before school started at 7:00am.  After school, I had to go straight to swim team practice for two hours.  After swim, I had to straight home to finish my studies.  I enjoyed all this but I feel my parents pushed me to the point that it all became a burden.  For high school, my parents sent me to a school in another city and I stopped figure skating for a while (or so it seemed at the time).  I swam every once in a while.  My parents constantly give me crap for spending their money on lessons and equipment and stuff.  It's been years but I still get all the crap.  I was pushed to do these things!  I was pushed into not enjoying these activities!  I still love those skating and swimming though.  I stopped competitive figure skating definitely but took up swimming again at uni.  I don't know if I'll ever get into the Olympics, but as of now, I enjoy swimming and I'm just scared of getting too into that my parents will get involved again and start pushing me.  Thankfully I'm in uni now so I have more control, but the thought still lingers.

Same goes for music.  I took piano in elementary and am pretty darn good at it.  I played the flute since junior high and played all though high school and went on tours every year, both in the US and abroad.  I played first two years of uni and am planning on playing for my last two years as well.  I got into the one of the world's top youth philharmonics.  I was also in Glee Club where I had many solos.  I enjoy music.  Music is a big part of my life.  I can't go one day without my parents reminding me to play my flute or comments on how I'm going to lose my talents and how my cousins or their friends' kids are doing well and playing concerts.  When I'm done practicing, they don't give me any encouragement.  They just keep quiet.  It may seem bratty and selfish for me to want encouragement, but I want acknowledgment at least.

As for academics, I got into a top university with Nobel prize winners other famous people as alumni and placed above 50 in Shanghai world uni ranking.  It isn't Oxford or Yale or the like, but it's good enough...  For me.  My parents realize they can't do anything about it anymore, so they've reverted their criticism to my major choice.  They want me to be a doctor and to get a health-related undergrad degree.  I had other plans.  My parents are allowing me to major in my choice as long as I go on to medical school after.  There's a reason I'm majoring in a specific field.  TO GET A SPECIFIC JOB!  What will I do with the degree if I go to medical school?  I want to work in my field for a while at least!!!  Okay, now I just sound selfish.  

Physically, my parents think I'm too fat.  My BMI is normal.  I'm 5'5 and 145 lbs.  I admit, I should be more toned and I'm working on it.  But it hurst to hear them say I'm obese and that I'm going to have a hard time getting a job if I'm fat.  They say I'm not active enough.  I used to go running and hiking in the mornings, but they say it is too dangerous especially during summer because of snakes.  Every time I ask if I can go out surfing, they say it too is too dangerous unless they go and watch me (again, I'm 20).  I workout in my room with weights and jog in place but my father says it isn't enough to just sweat?  I don't even know...

Also, I'm about to back to uni and need to find a new apartment.  I want to get one before we leave for holiday (which I'm not sure I'm still invited to) to avoid being stressed and rushed when coming back.  My father today, after seeing me spending time on my laptop looking for apartments, asked why I even need an apartment and criticized me for spending too much time looking.  Maybe I was spending too much time, but I need somewhere to stay.  The uni moved all upperclassmen to another residential hall outside of campus and is more expensive so we figured that I might as well stay at an apartment which is cheaper and right next to the residential hall.

Point is, I never feel good enough for my parents.  I mean, I don't do drugs or drink.  I'm refraining from  being in a relationship so I can focus on my future.  But I'm still not good enough.  It's getting to the point where I'm always sad to be home and around them.  To the point I'd rather be out by myself.  I love my parents, but I can't stand being near them sometimes.  I just want there to be a time when we can all just be happy together.  Like genuinely happy.  Doesn't have to be consistenly happy because I know families have their share of problems.  But I want to feel like I have parents that will love me whether or not I become successful.

2du7cd,4,2014-08-17,Need help deciding between Navali stowaway weekender or messenger bags,DavidBellamy,frugalmalefashion,https://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/comments/2du7cd/need_help_deciding_between_navali_stowaway/,"Hi FMF, this is my first post here and I'm fairly new to Reddit as well. I'm starting an internship in Boston in September and I wanted to upgrade from my current backpack to a shoulder-type bag (i.e. messenger/weekend). After a lot of searching, it seems like Navali is the best company to go with (price-, looks-, and quality-wise), but I can't decide between the messengers (boatswain/mainstay) and the weekender (stowaway). 

I'll be carrying this bag every day to work and would be carrying a 13"" Macbook, 2-3 notebooks, a lunch (efficiently packed space-wise), a water bottle, and potentially a ring binder (2-3"") among other small items (pens, chargers, etc.). 

Do you think the stowaway weekender would be too big to carry every day? From these pictures it seems to look alright: http://www.navali.com/waxed-stowaway-weekender.html

If it's not too excessive to carry daily, I could see myself also using the stowaway weekender for actual weekend/short trips; giving it a potential double purpose.

Otherwise, do you think either of the Navali messengers could hold this much stuff without excessive strain on the bag?"

My resume is bad and I haven't any good or relevant work experience since high school. I have had one job and that was as a production operator at the national post office. Also I have had a week experience at an insurance company during high school and various short-time jobs (a week) at the local grocery store and train factory. 


The reason why I don't have any other jobs besides at the post office, is that the salary was higher than most jobs I could get at my age and the shifts fit well with my studies. Now that I am studying at the university, I don't have time or need to get a part-time job because my student loan covers everything I need. 



Another question: Is it just as difficult to land a job at a mid-to-big sized company as at the Big 4?

2dumu5,0,2014-08-17,If I have to work 8 hours a day how can I work out?,dherec,Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2dumu5/if_i_have_to_work_8_hours_a_day_how_can_i_work_out/,"Right now I try to get in the gym 5 days a week. It takes me a good 3 hours timing from the time I leave my house to the time I get all the way back. I do weightlifting (different muscle group each day), then a full half hour of cardio, 15 minutes of the sauna and then shower and leave. The walking to and fro takes time too which is why it's a full 3 hours. I've been able to do this because I've been a student all this time, and have recently had time off for the summer. But I might be able to get a paid internship but the guy needs 8 hours a day to devote to a project. It's a programming/app development project. My 3-hour commitment to the gym is usually around 4-7pm, the afternoon-evening gym time. That's really the way I like it, since I've had enough to eat so far for the day and have enough energy for the gym. But now how can I put in a full 8 hours and still have all that time for the gym? I don't know if I can. No wonder people stop working out when they start working full-time jobs. But I can't lose the gym, it's the only thing that keeps me sane and it's a major source of escapism for me. Plus I don't want to lose the physical benefits. Can I manage this, and how? Right now I wake up some time between 11 and 12, so waking up earlier is definitely one option, but what else?"
2duoed,3,2014-08-17,After three years on again off again with my girlfriend (20 F) of three years I (20 M) am probably going to break up with her tomorrow. Talk me through it or out of it?,Hoeftybag,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2duoed/after_three_years_on_again_off_again_with_my/,"I just thought to come here and I have never read a post here so forgive me if I breach some unwritten rules or guidelines.

I have been with my current girlfriend since the summer before our senior year of high school. throughout that year we made leaps and bounds in our relationship and became a very close couple, hands down the best relationship I've been a part of. We took a 5 day trip to Chicago the summer before we went off to school and I think that was the real peak in our relationship.    
        
       
I left for university about 45 minutes from our hometown and she went to the local community college. There was a little bit of fear of being so far apart as we had previously lived about 3 minutes away from each other.       
She was wonderful about coming down to see me as I didn't have a car and didn't have a ton of time to come back home on the weekends because of school work and to be honest I love being at school with intellectual peers. So about 2 or 3 times a month she came to spend the day in town we'd go see a movie get dinner or simply hang out and watch Netflix.

Then on Valentines day (ironic but to be honest we don't much care for the holiday) she came over with a teddy bear and chocolates but almost immediately got really cuddly but didn't say a word. I didn't think much of it and actually thought it was kind of cute. She then suggested we take a break and I was floored. Her reasoning was that she was unsure about what she wanted out of a relationship and was getting attracted to a guy at work. I understood to an extent because besides me she had only had one other relationship ever, I made her actually break up with me she cried a little we got dinner and she went home. I thought it was over and started to get over her, the very next weekend though she asked to come over and I let her because we wanted to stay friends. It was like nothing had happened and after a couple more weeks we just got back together.       
        
This sort of thing then happened multiple more times, She brought it up again that April and I actually broke up with her that time. We were together again by the time I finished finals in May. I took summer classes and had an internship that year so despite being home I had very little time to devote to friends. We broke up sometime that summer and were back together before school started. 

Then at school I met a girl who's boyfriend knew Kim through work. I studied with this girl a few times and then they revealed to us that they wanted to have a foursome, I was indifferent to the idea, I found her to be attractive and I have always been interested in trying group things. My girlfriend however was opposed and I respected that decision. I continued to hang out with the girl though and she didn't get the message. I invited her over later in the evening for the legitimate reason that we were going to study for the class we had together. After a couple hours she managed to turn me on and we came very close to doing relationship destroying things. I stopped it and she left shortly there after. I wasn't going to tell my girlfriend because while what I did was wrong I didn't think it was worth getting in a fight over, lesson learned move on. the girl however told he boyfriend who told my girlfriend.       
       
We worked it out or so I thought. In January she broke up with me again and we got back together in Feburary, Then last month she broke up with me and but this time stuff actually changed. We tried to stay apart a little bit and text less. We didn't have any sex or even kiss during this time which was also a first. So I accepted that this was actually it and that we were actually friends now, and that I really had to get over her. She then decided to take me back but I resisted, then I decided to take her back and she resisted for a few days until about a month ago we got back together again. 

We had been doing well for the past month until this past week. her friend from work that had originally asked about the foursome (and was in an open relationship forgot to mention) texted her asking for my number to give to the girl from my class. She refused and told me what had happened, I connected the dots and realized she probably had wanted to sleep with me. My immediate reaction should have been a mix of disgust and anger but instead I thought about being with her and if that would be worth it. I dismissed it at the time but that brings us to the present. I went on a camping trip with six of my guy friends about 250 miles away. I went off a couple times alone or with my most trusted friend and talked about the possibilities. Among other things these are my reasons for choosing to end it; I am done getting my heart broken, I enjoy time with my guy friends way more to the extent that after a whole weekend with 6 of them I would rather go hang with them for another day then see my girlfriend and most importantly looking forward a year I see myself being happier as a single man than with her not even counting any other relationships or flings I may have.                   
         
          

                
I am very apprehensive about tomorrow, she knows why we are talking and simply telling her that made me feel like crap. I am deathly afraid that I could be breaking up with a women that I would marry. I'm doing it for real this time, cutting off almost all contact for months time while I go off to school which starts in two weeks. Am I being petty or short sighted? Is this a good call to make? I am especially interested in anyone who stayed in a relationship that felt like it was failing, I can't tell if I am suffering from [sunk cost fallacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_costs#Loss_aversion_and_the_sunk_cost_fallacy) or if I simply don't want to lose the woman I love.        
         
I'll be up for a little bit more tonight and will check back during the day tomorrow, I won't be reading much after 4 PM EST as I'll be seeing her after her work to talk. I'll answer as many questions as I can.

**tl;dr** I am in an off again on again relationship that has been off five times in a year and a half while we've been together for nearly three years. I was informed that a girl had the intention of trying to sleep with me and my mind didn't instantly reject the idea. I talked with my friends and spent some time away from her and realized our relationship has been weakening for at least the past year. the questions are in the above paragraph.

I know it's not that long ago but I had been affected by it way before then. I've worked since March and make roughly $400 or $300 a month, though it used to be a little more. Right now I'm making literally nothing until next month. Even though I can choose my own hours I often end up calling in sick ~3 out of 5 times a week. My job is just a part-time internship and I can't even make that work.

Even with this great job I can't work, at the moment my boss is giving me ""extended vacation"" but really he told me it's just a way for him to let me hold my job out of sympathy (because I haven't been making minimum hours for several weeks and could've been fired ages ago).

Past few days and weeks I've been getting worse even on my meds, my mood swings have stabilized somewhat and same with hearing voices, but I recently started hallucinating at night. I'm gonna call my psychiatrist about that tomorrow as well as asking about disability.

Anyways, my parents were the ones who wanted me to look into disability. I live with them and wouldn't be able to live on my own at all. So if any of you know how the process goes or if I qualify, that would be greatly appreciated. If I lose my job soon we won't be able to make rent anymore and honestly it's been stressing me out so much that I think I'm on my way to being fired. I do have all my times of calling in sick documented, my meds are obviously documented, and my psychiatrist should have documented when I've self-harmed, other symptoms of mania and depression, and how I responded to meds (I'm currently trying my 5th one!)

I don't want to be a freeloader to the system or find an easy way out of work, I just want to get better and function (at least somewhat) normally. At the moment I feel absolutely awful and paranoid because of the hallucinations. Any comments or help is very very appreciated.

tl;dr Can I apply for disability and can you tell me about it

2dwhfy,5,2014-08-18,"Me [21 F] with my 2.5 year boyfriend [21 M], can't handle this temporary long distance, think I've ruined it.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2dwhfy/me_21_f_with_my_25_year_boyfriend_21_m_cant/,"My boyfriend and I both go to the same university. He's from America, I'm from Canada, and we are entering our fourth year. Since neither of us live in the Canadian city we go to school, we have had to do long-distance for the last two summer vacations--It's been hard, especially on me, but we've always gotten through.

When he and I are together, we really honestly do have a wonderful relationship. We have been each other's first everythings (kiss, SO, et) and have been together for almost our entire university experience. Keeping that in mind, it seems totally reasonable, healthy, and good for the both of us that he is going on a study abroad this Fall. In addition to this, while this last summer I stayed and worked in our university town, he took an internship based in a tiny research centre in the midwest, nowhere near anything or anyone he knows. Basically, beginning in May we've started a period of 8 month separation, punctuated by a couple visits.

I know that I should have been a supportive girlfriend as he takes these opportunities. But instead, I've been ruining our relationship over them. I've taken it incredibly personally that he didn't try to get a job in our university town, so we could be together for at least part of the 8 month stretch. Since we started long distsance I've been resentful, mean, nasty, clingy, and dependent over text message and skype--and despite my behaviour this guy called me almost every day. He told me during the summer that he was going to try and cancel his exchange (he was super homesick and didn't want to be that far away from his hometown family and friends--and I guess, me), and I kind of got my hopes up when it turns out he's still going. (Which he should! He'd regret it if he didn't). 

He was so sweet when he left in may. He said he would write me letters, but instead he's sent postcards; he talked about how he'd send me flowers, which he never did. Not living up to his word, I've complained, which is the worst thing to do. He didn't send me a birthday present, which I kept bringing up and took incredibly personally (turned out he bought me diamond earrings, but was waiting until we were together (2 months later) to give them to me in person). I've basically just been the worst girlfriend. We have had such a good relationship, but this extended time apart has just awakened this negative, nasty, clingy part of me that I really can't seem to shake. I've gotten upset with him when he hasn't been able to talk if it's not for a good reason (like if he's watching a movie with friends that he's seen before, can't he step out and call me goodnight?). But I understand that he wouldn't want to do step out of the movie because I've made it feel like a chore to him, rather than something he wants to do.

Its just a bad cycle, because the worse I feel the more I need to hear from him that everything's okay; at the same time, the worse I feel, the worse I act, and the less he wants to talk to me. We were talking every night, but now he says that during his exchange doesn't want to talk everyday anymore. I was going to go visit him for a week where he's doing an exchange, but I'm not sure he'd still want me to come. It just breaks my heart because he's been so patient and understanding about all of this, but I haven't been able to stop with my negativity. I've talked about breaking up several times when I've been upset--he's always been the rock in this relationship. It has to be incredibly frustrating, thankless and exhausting.

I dont know what to do, I guess, is what I'm getting at. Changing your attitude is so much easier said than done. I was always hoping that we would try and end up in the same place after university ends--but I dont even know if we'll get through the 8 months at the rate this is going! Anyone ever had a similar situation? How did it turn out for you? I'd just like to hear from other people.

Tl;dr: Boyfriend is leaving for 8 months, I've taken it incredibly personally that he's leaving. I'm becoming resentful, nasty, and clingy, and dont know how to turn my attitude around. "
2dwkv7,18,2014-08-18,[23/F]; My sister/roommate [25F] got slightly abusive and my family thinks I am overreacting. I would love advice on how to handle this situation. (long see TL;DR at bottom),crazyprincess,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2dwkv7/23f_my_sisterroommate_25f_got_slightly_abusive/,"****Background****
I am a 23/F close to 24, extremely small (90lbs on a good day and 5'3"") and have been living on my own since I was 18 and went to college. I went through what I now believe is stimulant psychosis ( I was prescribed a very high dose of an ADHD medicine when I am under 100lbs and had been suffering from unexplained medical issues). I also was in an extremely emotionally, physically, and sexually abusive relationship.  I stopped going to school with a year left and have been doing a great job of rebuilding my life.  I just finished an internship at the corporate office of a very large company, payed off some debt, got off depression medicine and was taking very little of my anxiety medicine. I have helped K through many situations in her life and wind up getting screwed in some way.  I told my mother that I did not think living together was a good idea (my sister and I have never had a great relationship; I don't tolerate her non-managed mental issues well, for certain reasons). She begged me to do it to get K out of a situation and to help her, she asked me to do it for her. 



My sister (K) is 25, short and fat (130-150lbs and 4'7"") and has aspergers as well Bi-polar and is not taking medicine or seeing someone.  She also has hypothyroidism (I have hyperthyroidism) and does not take her prescribed medicine for that.  K has a job at the local YMCA in the childcare center and has been there for about 4 years now.  She makes under $10 an hour and in the summer her hours get cut from 35 to about 20.  She also has a 2 year old daughter (CG) that is cared for by my parents and that K has no relationship with except at holidays when she wants to look like a good ""mother"".  K does not know who the father of CG is.  She has gotten violent throughout her lifetime. 

Mother [50sF] is narcissistic and controlling, manipulative and hurtful. She has previously let my stepfather shove me into a table and said that it was ok and that things happen in tense situations and I need to move on; he was angry and anger makes you do things.

Stepfather [50sM] used to be really close to, now we hardly talk.  Anger problems.  


**Situation**  
K and I live together, in my apartment (I paid all deposits, found the place, qualified etc) after I helped her out of a bad situation.  K has gotten increasingly more upset and angry about things in the past month.  Things like locking the deadbolt late at night not knowing that she wasn't home, made at me for asking her to pay for cable and internet that she uses, not emptying the dishwasher right after its done, leaving a light on when I go upstairs to my room to grab something, various small things things.  She also screams, slams doors and calls names during any conversation.  

The past 2 weeks had been getting worse with her shoving me 2 times in 2 weeks and then not a week later slapping me for not turing the TV down fast enough.  

My resolution is to have her pay me for the deposits that I paid or help pay her portion to break the lease.  I do not care to live with someone who could hit or shove me just because they are angry.  I have no tolerance for abusive, since it triggers flashbacks of an abusive relationship I was in.  I have told her that; I also told her that if she continues to be violent I will be forced to move or have her move.  I told my parents this multiple times.

Now that it has happened with her slapping me and leaving a mark, I want out.  I have had to go on depression meds again and taking my anxiety meds so much that I might have to up my dose that I was trying to lower.  The stress from it all has affected all of my relationships with people, all of the progress that I have made and I just want it to end so I can move on with my life.

Yesterday night my mother called a meeting in which she informed me that I need to ""forgive and forget because she is family"" and that it is worse of me to not honor the lease agreement than it was for K to have slapped me.  That I am being unreasonable and that though the right thing to do is to remove myself from a toxic situation that I would get no help, K would not have to pay a thing, and she would be disappointed that I did the right thing instead of just letting it go.  My stepfather called me stupid and said that I should be willing to do anything for family no matter what they do.  I disagree.  My mother also decided that she was going to make a list of rules and was mad when I said that it was my apartment and since K and I are the only ones paying for it, it is no longer ""her house, her rules""; she did not like that.  She is forcing us to go to dinner together tonight to work on our relationship (one that I do not have any desire to have). 

I finally relented (not happily) that I would up my meds and write up a contract for us to sign and that way nothing should happen.  I am also not to keep any of my things in the common areas and not really hang out in them.  

**Advice**
Am I doing the right thing?  
What should I put in this ""contract""?
How can I save fast for an unexpected move (fairly positive that the contract won't work)?
How can I still have a relationship with people that think that just because someone is blood that I have to put up with whatever they do?
How can I not see myself as either a hypocrite (I swore I would never let anyone have control over my emotions, manipulate me or hit me) or a bad person (for not ""forgiving and forgetting that my sister slapped and shoved me"")?

**TL;DR**
I live with my sister in my apartment.  She likes to get verbally and physically abusive when things don't go her way. She left a mark on my ribs after slapping me.  I want to move out or have her move out.  Parents are making it seem like I am a bad person for wanting that and not being willing to compromise with my sister.  


This may not all make sense in this order but I am not taking my ADHD meds or anything else today so my thoughts are a bit jumbled.   "

I got into a few master's programs, but can't afford them, and also really just want to get into a PhD program but I only could afford to apply to two and they both turned me down.  That's my life-time goal right now.  

I just ended a summer internship that was research based, so although it wasn't exactly related to Political Science (It was legal-based), it was close and gave me the research experience I needed. 

However I am also a technician, and I spent 4 years of my undergrad as a student tech.  So now that my internship has ended, I've been looking for jobs, and I got a call from an old co-worker that wanted to me come and essentially work at school again as  a temporary employee (double the pay, but still shitty) but for only 6 weeks.

I was going to do it seeing that I had nothign else, and I have student loans, however this past weekend I got a job interview lined up with a really awesome computer manufacturing company building computers for them.  I'm trying to get my own computer building business started, so this is an awesome job.

However I don't have it in the bag, just an interview, but the temp job wanted me to start tomorrow, and I *HAD* to work the 6 weeks due to the contract, so this job interview would have been null.

I had to turn down my school's job, and I'm freaking out that I'm not going to get the other job, and end up not having a job at all.


I also feel like I'm getting too far from my PhD goal and it's seriously causing me a lot of anxiety.


Just venting I guess."

Before we get into the question, here is my backstory:
  
I am a student still in college for Graphic Design and was able to get an internship with a company that does book production my freshman year of college. Originally I just worked on fixing up assets and scanning items in etc etc. 4 years later I am still here and have been promoted to a Team leader for a newly created team of 8 that works on taking the assets (that I once used to fix) and putting them into a product. My work moved a bit from mostly design to managing a team of designers - who are also interns, some of which have no formal design training. I am in an interesting position being that at a younger age, I am receiving a fair amount of freedom to shape this area in the company. The season just ended and I have a few months to work on ways to change my system around to better manage the work load etc. One problem I ran into was content tracking. I used a chart I created to list who had what and so on however I felt that sometimes I had to pass work from someone to another and eventually the ""owner"" of the work was lost in the system.  
  
My question - Has anyone had problems such as these and how did you manage? What system(s) did you use to keep track and were you the tracker for the work or did you have that fall on the designers to handle their work?  
  As I said, these are mostly college students like myself so it's tough to have a system where they handle all the work.  
  Hopefully that makes sense! Thanks!"
2dx1vc,17,2014-08-18,Help.,ShouniAishaKuma,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/2dx1vc/help/,"I've reached a breaking point, and I just don't know what to do anymore.

For all my life my Nmom has been abusing me emotionally, belittling me and constantly reminding me that I ""am shit."" She has been doing this for as long as I can remember; nothing is good enough for her. In middle/high school it was my grades - she loved to tell me how my grades were terrible compared to my sister's (GC, 9 years older than me), and how I would never amount to anything in life because of how ""lazy and stupid"" I was. Every day was a day lived in fear, with her parading the achievements of her friends' kids in front of me. ""Did you know [blah]'s son got a 2370 on the SAT? How come you only got a 2080? You're lazy and stupid that's why."" ""Oh [blah]'s daughter got into Princeton, why can't you be like her?"" ""[Blah] was just telling me about how his son recently got an internship at IBM, isn't that nice?""

I've grown up with daily reminders that I am inferior. It hurts so much. When I was applying for colleges, she was the first to tell me that I wouldn't get into any good colleges because my college application essays were shit, my grades were shit, and my work ethic was nonexistent. When I got into UCSD, my Nmom immediately said something like ""at least you'll have somewhere to go now; I thought you were going to get rejected from all the schools you applied for."" I eventually ended up attending NYU; I think I chose it because it was far away from her and I would be able to maintain NC pretty well.

I was wrong. She would constantly call me and yell at me. My grades were never good enough, I would never find an attractive girlfriend, I probably wouldn't have any friends, etc. She loves to hold the fact that she is paying for my tuition over my head, reminding me that I should be grateful that she and my father were even gracious enough to allow me to go there. I couldn't get away. It ate away at me inside. I started smoking and drinking heavily to try and take the edge off of the pain, but there was the ever present and looming reminder that I would have to return home every summer. My grades suffered, and she jumped on the opportunity to abuse me because of it. She said that she would pull me out of NYU and enroll me in community college if I continued to ""fuck around"" in New York, and reminded me once again that I was a ""fat and lazy kid."" Eventually my grades dropped to the point where I was put on academic probation, and she used that knowledge to belittle me further. I came home to the welcoming arms of insecurity and depression. Constantly overhearing her talk about to my father about how I ""deserved to get kicked out of school,"" and that I was ""probably lucky to have even been accepted to NYU.""

I returned to college a broken kid. My depression worsened and I hid it under a thin veneer of cheerfulness. My friends probably sensed something was up, but my insecurity kept me from sharing my problems with them. I was afraid they would criticize me just like my Nmom did.

This summer I came home from school to try and relax a bit, clear my head and gain some confidence. At my Nmom's request (she called me a ""dumb freeloader""), I found a summer job in retail, working 40 hours a week. Of course it wouldn't be good enough for her. I was dumb, stupid, idiotic to not have applied for internships, how dare I assume that I could even relax a little bit during the summer.

Today I've reached my breaking point. I brought up my housing situation in NY to her (I looked around in order to try and find cheaper housing than the college dorms), and she proceeded to tear into me. ""Why couldn't you just stay in the dorms,"" ""why do you always have to make trouble for me,"" ""do you even know how much I pay to keep you in school?"" She called me an useless, saying that because I didn't even know the exact amount she was paying for me to attend college, I would never be a productive or responsible member of society. She said that I shouldn't feel like I was ""hot shit"" because I finally got a job (which she doubted I could do). Then she told me to set the table and help prepare the food, and to stop being ungrateful.

I just don't know what to do anymore. I smoked my first cigarette since starting my new job 2 months ago and I've been craving more to take the edge off of the pain. I'm heavily considering committing suicide, because I just can't take the pain anymore. Even as I'm typing this on my phone outside of work I'm trying to convince myself that suicide is wrong and that my death would harm the lives of others but my resolve is slipping. I don't want to do this anymore."

So I met my ex over a year ago on omegle, we really hit it off, we exchanged FB and kept on talking for 9 months. I decided to go visit her and after that we had a relationship.

It went good until 10 months into the relationship, she had plans to come and study in my country. But she had more ""plans"" in which she didn't follow trough.

Also her being that young and staying that young until February 2015 and yet 2 years of LDR I decided to put an end to it.

We kept contact, but I noticed that our communication went downhill, I later found out she was seeing some guy.
I panicked and wanted her back, we got back together, but I didn't trust her as much anymore. I asked her several times when we weren't together if she was seeing anyone. She said no, but she was (that's all okay we weren't dating, but she lied about it??)

Things were going good again for like 3 months (we dated a year in total) but then again the same problems came up. Different country, she is that young, not sure if she is going to study here? the lying.

I did had however a very strong connection with her, on many levels and she was exactly my type. But I'd think that it was wiser for me to let her go in stead of putting a lot of time and money in a young girl. Help her build a life in my country and she would eventually say: ""thanks yeahimdutch for your help, but I've been only with you I want to experience college now"".

3 weeks after we broke up, she had a relationship with the guy she met before. Not even 3 weeks, it fucked me up. Now 5 months later and I still think about her every day.

I can't get back to her and I don't want to (yet) but I think I still love this girl. I did the right thing right? reddit? please tell me I did the right thing.

Also I will be leaving for an internship to south Africa in one week, the break up motivated me very much.

To graduate we are required to complete a minimum 800 hours of practical work in the industry. I'm looking at a number of internships I could try to get but they aren't related to structural engineering. What are your opinions on the importance of finding an internship related to my major area of focus? I understand that internships could lead onto future employment opportunities so it would probably be good to get something related but then again, being the indecisive kid I am, I'm thinking it could be a good opportunity to experience different things.

TL;DR - Those of you who have done internships, did you end up working in the same field? Is it worth putting a lot of effort into finding an internship/job related to my area of study or should I just find whatever I can to graduate and then focus on finding something related?

2dxqf7,21,2014-08-18,7 year relationship over in 2 days,loveblindfool,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2dxqf7/7_year_relationship_over_in_2_days/,"Two days ago, I watched The Road with my boyfriend at his parents house and thought that I was going to spend the rest of my life with him. Today our relationship is over and I'm probably never going to speak to him again. 

I've had issues, sex issues relating to my birth control. I forgot my implant was supposed to come out in May, and we had sex then so I was unprotected. I booked an appointment to get it removed in July so had to go on bc pills until I got it replaced. I don't want children, so I was so freaked out that I would get pregnant, I knew I missed my implant because I missed my period in May and June. I withheld from sex and I explained the reasons why. I've also had a long running history of depression. So when my boyfriend tells me yesterday that he wants to break up because I have no passion in the bedroom and I bring him down, part of me understands. I go semi crazy with sadness and hatred for myself, I cry all night and all morning. I try to have a reasonable conversation with him, asking if there's been anyone else, perhaps we should have a break to cool off from our long relationship. He says he doesn't want to talk. I finally get him to promise to speak to me this evening.

I cook his favourite meal - salmon tacos with crispy salmon skin and avocado. I spoke to all my close friends so I could prepare for a logical conversation. I just didn't understand why it was a fast break up. 

While at work I have multiple gmail accounts, I try to use the ADD account function and low and behold there was my boyfriend's account. He doesn't speak to me anymore, the past few weeks he spends all his time on his mobile phone chatting to friends in south africa. Even on Friday, he told me at 9pm he was going to a friend's leaving do, I said ok. I called him at midnight with no reply. He calls me at 1am and says he drank too much so he's going to stay there, I asked if there was a girl there, and he said ""no just boys"". One peek, I just want to understand him... I focus on work for the rest of the day, give him to benefit of the doubt and wait until we get home. Part of me thinks he's going to come home and tell me what an awful decision he's reached.

I get home early, play some COD. 7pm comes along (his usual home time), he's not here. So I wait a bit, 8pm ticks by and I'm hungry so I make the tacos but I don't have an appetite so I throw it away. 9pm. I try calling but he doesn't answer the phone, I don't want to seem like a desperate crazy person, I send him messaging asking if we're still going to talk as we've discussed.

At 10pm I get sick of waiting and resist the tempation. I find a chat with his friend in South Africa, a picture of a young girl, an intern he wants to fuck. I scroll upwards, ""oh man how did maya not know?"" he fucked her. He fucked at lunchtime at her house, he fucked her on Friday at his parents house while they're out of town, he's fucking her right now when he promised to talk to me. ""I wouldn't leave maya for her"" he says. Is that supposed to console me? 

I am furious, so I call a cab and pay £60 to go to his parents house. There's no one home, no car, no nothing. The dog is inside the house and she's usually outside, and the bedroom window is open. Maybe he went to drop her home, it was 11pm after all... I speak to more friends on the cab ride back to my house and devise a plan to pack all my things up the next morning. 

I get home and lock the windows and the doors. I live in a ground floor flat and the previous tenant was a single female so its well protected. It takes me 10 minutes, so I brush my teeth and go to bed. Literally 5 minutes of being in bed, I hear noise at the door. And then my boyfriend calls, he wants me to let him in so I tell him no and I let him know everything I've learnt. He comes round to the windows (which I've luckily closed) and tries to climb in through one of the top windows. He wants some clothes for the next day, I tell him to fuck off. He's been calling me every 5 minutes since then and it's now 1am. 

I feel like an idiot. I feel like I should have seen the signs which are so obvious in hindsight. I trusted him, we'd been together for 7 years, why would he lie to me? I feel like a fool for trusting him, I should have trusted my instincts instead. I'm most pissed off that he tried to blame my depression for making him feel down and calling me a prude for not having sex with him in 5 weeks. 

He's telling me it's my fault for not having sex with him. He's telling me ""things just happened"" with the intern. Is it really my fault, did I really cause this? Is one fling enough to destroy a whole relationship? I'm upset because he lied, that's what makes it so I can't trust him again. Is it wrong that I looked at his messages? I probably would have cried myself to sleep and spent the rest of my life thinking no one would take me because of my depression. 

I'm so angry but part of me still loves him and I know that will take time to go away. I'm just so unbelievably disappointed in myself and in him. I feel like a love blind fool.

EDIT: TL;DR boyfriend of 7 years blames depression for break up then I find out he has been cheating on me."

I do have an internship lined up in NJ, but mainly I am moving to be with my boyfriend. I could get an internship in Portland, but I really want to be with him and end this LDR shit. I am finishing up my degree in Community/Public Health.

Any advice for a newcomer?? I am used to a temperate rainforest climate (no weather extremes, barely any snow, lots of rain) and lots of trees and hiking and nature super close by, and friendly, easy going people. I know NJ will be a lot different.

How did you adjust to living in NJ if you came from somewhere else? I am planning on getting my 200-hour yoga certification as well; I have been waiting until after college to get it, and I figure it would be a great way to meet people that I would have common interests with.

Where are some of the best places for health/fitness nut to have fun and or meet people? Anyone who moved to NJ who has some wisdom to impart would be greatly appreciated. Even those native to the city- I welcome any and all advice!!

Thanks :)"
2dykk3,1,2014-08-19,Roger Bassin MD Reviews: Revolutionary Natural Cosmetic Procedures,tajuana38taj,UpliftingNews,https://www.reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews/comments/2dykk3/roger_bassin_md_reviews_revolutionary_natural/,"Dr. Roger Bassin Ushers in a New Wave of Natural Cosmetic Procedures that Promise to be Quick, Painless &amp; Life Changing.

The idea of transforming your figure easily, painlessly, safely, and with little downtime and no general anesthetic may seem too good to be true. And until recently, it was.

Things have changed, however, thanks to forward-thinking cosmetic surgeons like Dr. Roger Bassin of The Bassin Center for Plastic Surgery, who has developed revolutionary fat removal and filler processes and techniques.

“There is no longer a need to put your face and body through the negative effects of traditional and unnatural cosmetic surgery anymore,” says Dr. Bassin.

Dr. Bassin got his start in the medical field at George Washington’s School of Medicine, and, upon graduating magna cum laude, he completed his internship and residency at Lenox Hill and Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. He then moved to Chicago to receive specialized training in eyelid and facial plastic and reconstructive surgery by experts at the University of Illinois, as well as advanced liposuction training by prominent cosmetic surgeons.

Dr. Bassin has appeared on the Doctor's TV show as well as Good Morning America. Roger Bassin MD is well respected for his passion and expertise in cosmetic surgery. He is also known for his kind demeanor when treating patients. Much of his client base comes from word of mouth, friends and relatives of former patients. Roger Bassin MD Reviews are available on the website cited in the author resource box of this article. 

Today, nearly a decade later, he focuses exclusively on these specific areas of cosmetic surgery, which has allowed for him to produce cutting-edge procedures, including two of his most sought after – AquaLipo® and NaturalFill®.

AquaLipo, a gentler and safer version of traditional liposuction, is essentially a two-part combination of SmartLipo™, a laser technology which essentially melts away fat cells and helps to tighten skin, and Body-Jet® water-assisted liposuction (WAL), which then flushes out the fat cells. “The beauty of AquaLipo is that it is so much gentler than any other lipo procedures,” says Dr. Bassin.

Three years ago, Dr. Bassin decided to take AquaLipo another step further and developed a revolutionary fat-transferring procedure known as NaturalFill. In a nutshell, NaturalFill works by using the undamaged fat that is removed from one area of the body – (such as hips, thighs, arms and abdomen) via AquaLipo to fill in lines and wrinkles on the face, as well as enhance breasts and buttocks.

“The beauty of NaturalFill is that we have taken the patient demand of ‘natural, long-term filler’ and made it a reality. Patients who get NaturalFill may never need to return for another treatment…Patients also love that the filler is 100 percent natural,” says Dr. Bassin.

Like many of Dr. Bassin’s procedures, NaturalFill is virtually quick and painless. “Patients can expect semi-permanent results after up to about a week of minor swelling,” says Dr. Bassin.

2dyrkr,9,2014-08-19,Leaky Pipes [mf],Birdie19,Erotica,https://www.reddit.com/r/Erotica/comments/2dyrkr/leaky_pipes_mf/,"Kate had moved into my apartment complex just over three weeks ago and I hadn’t been able to stop thinking about her since.

She was fresh out of college and had just started her internship at the hospital three blocks away. As far as I knew her parents were paying to put her up here until she got some money together to take over the rent herself. I’d seen them visiting a couple of times and they seemed like a nice family. But outside of her parents visiting, Kate seemed like kind of a loner. She worked long hours, sure, but never seemed to go out to meet friends for coffee and didn’t seem to have people over. Especially men, not that I had been looking out for that.

I wasn’t exactly sure how we had started talking the other day but we ended up at a local coffee shop getting to know each other. The conversation ended with me agreeing to come by and take a look at the pipes under the sink. My dad was a registered plumber and had taught me the trade before I decided to join the police academy. 

So here I was, lying on my back in her kitchen and attempting to replace a worn pipe for the first time in seven years. It was a slow process and I could sense her getting agitated from across the kitchen. She was perched at the high counter in the centre of the room wearing nothing but a white camisole and an indecently small pair of cotton shorts. Her legs were crossed at the ankle and she jiggled her leg quickly, the flesh at the top of her thigh wiggling enthusiastically with the movement and making a stark contrast against the rest of her toned legs. 

My eyes were drawn to that small piece of wobbling skin and my cock twitched at the thought of running my tongue along it and sucking it into my mouth. I quickly chased the thought away. She was a nice girl and I didn’t want to scare her away by lying on her floor with a boner.

“Is this going to take much longer, Sam?” She asked suddenly and my eyes flew away from the top of her thighs quickly. 

I carefully sat up to get a better look at her as I spoke. “Hopefully not too much longer, just need to fit the washers properly and then tighten it up.”

She nodded and then returned to the newspaper in front of her, her leg taking up the quick movements from before.

I finished up as quickly as possible and moved out from under the sink. As I was packing up my tools I heard Kate sigh loudly and I looked towards her with a frown.

“You ok?” I asked.

She shrugged. “Just been really stressed lately. Not entirely sure what I’m doing with myself.”

“Well if you ever need anyone to talk to…”

“I don’t need someone to talk to.” She said, throwing the newspaper closed. She sighed again and uncrossed her legs slowly, swivelling in her seat to face me fully. I stood up and leant against the counter behind me. “We had a good time the other day, right? At the coffee place?”

“Yeah sure.” I replied with a smile.

“And you like me, right?”

“You seem like a nice woman.” I said carefully.

She nodded again. “And unless I’m reading you entirely wrong you think I’m attractive, right?”

My mouth dropped open in shock and I closed it dumbly before nodding quickly. 

“Well like I said…I’ve been feeling really stressed lately and nothing I do by myself seems to be working.”

“By yourself?” I interrupt quickly. I could feel my heart thundering in my chest as I took in the meaning of her words. The thought of Kate touching herself, of fucking herself with her own fingers behind the wall that separated our bedrooms made my cock twitch again but this time I didn’t fight it.

“Yeah.” She said lowly, her tone dropping significantly and becoming almost breathless. I noticed the way her fingers were playing the edge of her shorts and my eyes were trapped to the slow movement. 

“It doesn’t matter what I think about or how hard I come…I just can’t seem to snap out of this funk I’m in.”

“Are you asking me to…do you want me to help you?” I asked, frowning as I stumbled over my words.

I couldn’t believe my luck. I wasn’t the type of guy that got propositioned like this, especially not by girls as attractive as Kate. It’s not that I was unattractive, I kept in shape and took care of myself but outside of a couple of serious girlfriends I never seemed to get much attention from women.

“I like you Sam.” She said simply. “And you like me. I’m pretty sure we both want this…”

I nodded quickly again and she smiled. Kate rose to her feet and walked towards me, her hips swaying with her movement. The shorts had slipped lower on her and I could see the pale skin of her hipbone peeking out from beneath her camisole. She stopped in front of me and smiled shyly. 

Her bright blue eyes were clear as they dropped from my eyes to my lips and I watched in amazement as she rose up on her toes and pressed her lips to mine softly. The kiss was gently and chaste and when it ended I opened my eyes to find Kate biting her lower lip. For some reason this was what got to me the most and I leant down to capture her lips once again.

There was nothing gentle or chaste about this kiss. 

I grabbed her hips and pulled her firmly against me, moaning low in my throat when her stomach pressed against the growing bulge of my erection. She moaned in return and her lips opened beneath mine, her tongue running along the length of mine before she sucked it gently between her lips. Her hands wound around my neck and her fingers threaded through my hair as she pulled me as close to her as possible.

I don’t know how long we stood there kissing but soon Kate’s fingers were running down my back and up beneath my t-shirt, pushing the fabric out of her way as she clutched at the skin of my back. I pulled back to separate our lips and she quickly pushed my shirt up and over my head, letting it drop carelessly to the floor next to us. Her eyes dropped to my chest and her fingers ran through the dark hair on my chest.

“I’ve missed this.” She muttered before reaching down to pull her camisole off too. “I’ve missed being with someone else.” 

Her breasts were perky and her nipples were straining outwards, showcasing her obvious arousal. She pressed a quick kiss to my chest before bringing her hand back up around the back of my neck and forcing my head to her chest. My mouth closed around one pink peak as I brought a hand to squeeze the other mound. She sighed happily as I sucked hard before letting her nipple go with a loud pop. My cock was getting painful as it was constrained in the heavy denim of my jeans and I brought my free hand to undo my belt, pushing the fabric apart and fishing my cock out of the top of my boxers. 

My mouth continued to work over Kate’s tits as I started to run my hand up and down my dick, gathering the precum on my palm before wrapping it around the shaft and pumping it slowly. She seemed to notice the movement and circled her hand around my own before removing it altogether and taking over the motion herself. Her palm was softer than my own and she certainly had a good technique as she varied the speed and motion of her hand as she played with my cock. Her other hand found its way into my underwear and cupped my balls, her thumbs rolled across them playfully and I grunted loudly around her tit.

“I want you to fuck me.” She said against the top of my head and I looked up at her. Her cheeks were flushed and sweat was beginning to dot her hairline.

She took a step away from me and shoved her shorts down her legs, baring her naked body to me. Her crotch was neatly trimmed and the short brown hairs looked like they would be soft to touch. As I stared at her pussy I pushed my jeans and boxers down and stood in front of her, my cock straining upwards and resting against my abdomen. Kate grinned as she took in my erection for the first time and she stepped towards me again, her hand reaching out to cup my shaft again. Her tongue shot out and wet her bottom lip slowly as she watched her hand pumping up and down my dick. I couldn’t stop the loud groan that escaped me and she grinned up at me again. 

“Let’s go to my room.” Kate said suddenly, her hand briefly dropping and cupping my balls again before she turned and walked quickly to her bedroom. I followed dutifully behind her, my eyes fixed to the curve of her ass.

Her room was fairly bare and I noticed several unpacked boxes shoved into the corner near the door to her ensuite.

She dropped onto the comforter and held a hand out to me. I took it quickly and was pulled to sit next to her at the foot of the bed. She cupped my jaw briefly and brought our lips back together. I could feel desire coursing thick through my veins and brought a hand to rest on her bare hipbone before trailing my fingers down between her thighs. I added a small amount of pressure and ran my fingers through her slit, testing the wetness that had gathered there. I brought my middle finger to circle her clit and she pulled away from our kiss with a gasp. Her hips started to thrust against my hand and I slipped my fingers down to press two inside her. 

She was tight and hot around my fingers and my cock started throbbing as I thought about entering her for the first time. Her hand circled my wrist suddenly and she pulled my hand away from her. I opened my mouth to protest but then she was scooting back further up the bed and reaching into her bedside drawer. She grabbed a condom and opened it quickly before leaning down to where I still sat at the end of the bed. Her hand pumped my erection a couple of times before rolling the latex circle down to the base of my shaft.

“How do you want me?” I asked quietly and she laughed softly as she considered my question. 

“I want to be on top.” She answered quickly. “I’ll come faster.”

“Fuck.” I muttered as she pushed me onto my back. 

She threw her leg over my hips and I grabbed my cock, lining it up with her entrance before she pushed down and enveloped me to the hilt. Her hands were resting on my stomach and mine moved to grip her thighs as she began to move on top of me. I couldn’t believe how confidently she moved above me. Her back was arched and her head was thrown back as she let pleasure consume her. 

Her movements were steadily gaining speed as she bounced on my dick and I could hear her breathing becoming more shallow. The feel of her sliding up and down my cock was pulling me closer to my orgasm and I groaned loudly as she raised herself until only the head of my cock was inside her and squeezed her muscles around me before lowering herself down onto me again.

“I’m close.” She said suddenly, her fingers digging in my stomach harder. She brought one hand to rub her clit as her movements became jerkier and she altered her movement to rock back and forth instead of bouncing quickly on top of me.

“So am I.” I said, watching her fingers as she manipulated her clit perfectly, my eyes then falling to watch as my cock entered her over and over. 

I knew she was coming when she gasped loudly and threw her head back and it was confirmed as her internal muscles started to milk my cock. I forced myself to look away from her pussy and her fingers playing against it and moved my hands to grip her hips tightly. I rolled the two of us over and grabbed her knee, looping it over my elbow before pushing it up towards her shoulders. My thrusts into her were lacking finesse and I didn’t last much longer before my orgasm was ripping through me and I was emptying myself into the condom.

We stayed like that for a few minutes as we both caught our breath and then I moved off of her and disposed of the condom before rolling onto my back and lying next to her. She was lying with her eyes closed and had a small smile on her face.

“Do you feel better now?” I asked quietly, bringing my hand to stroke the soft skin of her stomach.

“Much better.” She replied lazily, grabbing my hand in her own and running her thumb over the back of her hand.

“Please tell me we can do that again.” I said.

“Oh definitely. It was exactly what I needed.”

“I’m glad I could be of service.” I muttered, leaning over and pressing a kiss to the skin between her breasts. 

“I’m not looking for anything serious.” She said suddenly.

“But we can keep doing this?” I asked and she nodded quickly in reply.

“I can cope with that.” I said quietly, already thinking about the next time I could be inside her.

2dys3r,17,2014-08-19,Leaky Pipes - The beginning of a fwb relationship [mf],Birdie19,eroticliterature,https://www.reddit.com/r/eroticliterature/comments/2dys3r/leaky_pipes_the_beginning_of_a_fwb_relationship_mf/,"Kate had moved into my apartment complex just over three weeks ago and I hadn’t been able to stop thinking about her since.

She was fresh out of college and had just started her internship at the hospital three blocks away. As far as I knew her parents were paying to put her up here until she got some money together to take over the rent herself. I’d seen them visiting a couple of times and they seemed like a nice family. But outside of her parents visiting, Kate seemed like kind of a loner. She worked long hours, sure, but never seemed to go out to meet friends for coffee and didn’t seem to have people over. Especially men, not that I had been looking out for that.

I wasn’t exactly sure how we had started talking the other day but we ended up at a local coffee shop getting to know each other. The conversation ended with me agreeing to come by and take a look at the pipes under the sink. My dad was a registered plumber and had taught me the trade before I decided to join the police academy. 

So here I was, lying on my back in her kitchen and attempting to replace a worn pipe for the first time in seven years. It was a slow process and I could sense her getting agitated from across the kitchen. She was perched at the high counter in the centre of the room wearing nothing but a white camisole and an indecently small pair of cotton shorts. Her legs were crossed at the ankle and she jiggled her leg quickly, the flesh at the top of her thigh wiggling enthusiastically with the movement and making a stark contrast against the rest of her toned legs. 

My eyes were drawn to that small piece of wobbling skin and my cock twitched at the thought of running my tongue along it and sucking it into my mouth. I quickly chased the thought away. She was a nice girl and I didn’t want to scare her away by lying on her floor with a boner.

“Is this going to take much longer, Sam?” She asked suddenly and my eyes flew away from the top of her thighs quickly. 

I carefully sat up to get a better look at her as I spoke. “Hopefully not too much longer, just need to fit the washers properly and then tighten it up.”

She nodded and then returned to the newspaper in front of her, her leg taking up the quick movements from before.

I finished up as quickly as possible and moved out from under the sink. As I was packing up my tools I heard Kate sigh loudly and I looked towards her with a frown.

“You ok?” I asked.

She shrugged. “Just been really stressed lately. Not entirely sure what I’m doing with myself.”

“Well if you ever need anyone to talk to…”

“I don’t need someone to talk to.” She said, throwing the newspaper closed. She sighed again and uncrossed her legs slowly, swivelling in her seat to face me fully. I stood up and leant against the counter behind me. “We had a good time the other day, right? At the coffee place?”

“Yeah sure.” I replied with a smile.

“And you like me, right?”

“You seem like a nice woman.” I said carefully.

She nodded again. “And unless I’m reading you entirely wrong you think I’m attractive, right?”

My mouth dropped open in shock and I closed it dumbly before nodding quickly. 

“Well like I said…I’ve been feeling really stressed lately and nothing I do by myself seems to be working.”

“By yourself?” I interrupt quickly. I could feel my heart thundering in my chest as I took in the meaning of her words. The thought of Kate touching herself, of fucking herself with her own fingers behind the wall that separated our bedrooms made my cock twitch again but this time I didn’t fight it.

“Yeah.” She said lowly, her tone dropping significantly and becoming almost breathless. I noticed the way her fingers were playing the edge of her shorts and my eyes were trapped to the slow movement.

The idea was that I wasn't sure if I wanted to go into actuarial science, quantitative finance, or be a college professor, so this would buy me time to figure that out. 

 I know that any major can be an actuary and it's typical to just have a bachelors. 

1. When applying for internships for next summer, will working on a MS in math give me an edge over students in undergraduate? I will probably only have 1 exam by the time I actually apply, but perhaps 2.

2. Similarly, when applying for a job, will having the MS push me to the head of the HR list over similarly qualified candidates?

2dzf33,8,2014-08-19,How difficult is it to enter a QA field as a beginner/ recent grad ?,sbiswas3,QualityAssurance,https://www.reddit.com/r/QualityAssurance/comments/2dzf33/how_difficult_is_it_to_enter_a_qa_field_as_a/,"Hello all, I have recently decided to try my hand at QA (and interesed mostly in Testing). I have an Information Systems Bachelors degree which covered a couple of programming courses and languages like Java and some C-Sharp and Python. 

I focused most of my courses on Networking and Linux material, and, the only real-life IT job experience I have was as a 6-month internship as a Help Desk/ Computer Technician with some small time System Admin stuff thrown in.  


With this kind of background, how difficult will it be to get into an entry level QA position ? 


I talked with a QA person I met through a friend, and he said the only things I need to know are QTP and Quality Center, as they are widely used, so, I stopped looking at Selenium and the other tools for now ...but I realize that different companies may use different tools. But he also said it is usually tough to get into entry level positions for QA/Testing.


Anyway, that is my educational/ IT job experience background; and this is where I am at right now in terms of QA knowledge. I am mostly teaching myself through Google and Youtube - - - and my main target is to land a job in QA as soon as possible...preferably somewhere near the DC/Northern Virginia Area.



I researched a little bit on QA and know some of the basics of the field, such as the testing part of the field, have some idea of tools used such as QTP etc. 
I also have some basic idea on QA theories due to one QA class I took back in college, and am currently looking at QTP and Quality Center so I can grasp their concepts. 


I hope someone can help answer my questions. Thanks for any help I get. 


Edit : I am not looking for anything too high-level, I will be glad with anything that helps get my foot in the door. And also, at this point, how much I get paid is not important as I am mostly looking to gain work experience.

While that was great and all, I'm 15 credits behind if I plan to graduate in 4 years while taking 15 credits per semester. I'm transferring in from a private out-of-state engineering school. The workload/difficulty should be relatively similar. 

I'm currently a sophomore, but after the fall semester I'll be a junior, sitting at just over 60 credits. From there, I'm pretty sure I'd be able to handle 3 20 credit semesters - but it sounds like hell tbh. In the past I've done 16 credit semester while working an internship 15-20 hours a week, so I figure 20 credits would be similar to that (it sucked, but I made it work). Also, I know I have the option to cut this load down by taking summer classes. How many credits is it possible to earn in a summer? Is it going to be possible to catch back up at this point?"
2dzreg,2,2014-08-19,I [19/M] am concerned about my mom [55/F] when I leave for university tomorrow,somewhereinsingapore,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2dzreg/i_19m_am_concerned_about_my_mom_55f_when_i_leave/,"A little background: My family has moved around quite often, a lot more recently than in the first half of my life (3 countries in past 4 years). This is due to my father getting promoted, this promotion also requires him to travel quite a bit more.

So I visited Singapore, where I currently live for the past 6 weeks. The first half of my summer was spent seeing family in Scandinavia and having an internship. I've always been close with my mom because I was the ""man of the house"" since my dad's job makes him travel for weeks to months on end. 

I don't have any friends in Singapore because I never lived here, my parents moved when I was in my first year of university. Because of this I have spent quite a bit of time with my mom.

Now to where the concern comes in.

I think partially because of the time she's spent with me, the fact that my younger brother is going to uni, and the recent news that my parents are moving to London has caused her a lot of stress, and along iwth that depression.

I know what depression is because I suffered through it the first time we moved. 

I've confronted her about it, but she denies it. Yet at the same time she's always joking about how lonely she's going to be when I go off to college (my younger brother tends to keep his distance from my parents), and my father will be in the UK finding a house and working.

To make matters worse my parents marriage has been on the rocks of recently, although I think it's been progressively getting worse for awhile, and now that both children are out of the house it's only going to get worse.



I'm excited to go back to university, but because I'm so close with my mom I'm extremely concerned with how she's going to handle moving to a country without her children there. We were a huge part of how she met people as the international school communities are extremely welcoming. 



---   
**tl;dr: I'm concerned about my mom's well-being due to the news that my parents are moving again, this time without me or my brother. My mom is very close to me and appears to be depressed, although she denies it.**"
2dzxvu,2,2014-08-19,Coworkers Out of Office Message. (long read),MrSelfdizstruct75,funny,https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/2dzxvu/coworkers_out_of_office_message_long_read/,"But if you absolutely must contact me, there is a way…

You will need:
1 green laser
1 bag of M&amp;Ms (peanut)
2 cats (house cats will do)
1 paperclip (big one)
1 bottle of tequila (top shelf)
APL Employee Manual
Cameraphone

Around 10:00am take all your materials and get to an area where you have an unobstructed view of the eastern horizon.  With one hand, point the green laser east, about 25 degrees above the horizon and trace small figure 8’s.  With the other hand bring up the photo application on your phone and point it at the spot where you’re drawing with the green laser and begin recording video.  The Iridium satellite you’re contacting will get a fix on your position and respond with a series of very bright infrared flashes.  You won’t see it but the cameraphone will record it.  Keep this video, the flashes are separated by pauses and are actually a series of numbers you’ll need to open the gate to the car yard in…not Panama.  

Anyway, after you record the flashes you can put the laser in your pocket.  In about a half an hour (depending on the wind speed and direction) a helicopter will approach and hover over your position.  A ladder will be tossed down and the pilot will descend.  Give him the tequila and he should leave.  If he doesn’t I’d suggest keeping any conversation to a minimum, he’s kinda’ moody and he can be unpredictable at times.  Once he leaves climb up the ladder, put on a helmet, and belt yourself in.  You can fly a helicopter right?  Probably not.  Thankfully, it doesn’t matter, the helicopter flies itself.  Very slowly and clearly say “I've just picked up a fault in the AE35 unit”.  The helicopter will begin climbing and accelerating toward the south.  Note: a few minutes into the flight an automated recording will begin playing through the headphones.  It’s for an old mission, we don’t know how to turn it off, just ignore it.  Also, don’t talk about it with anyone.  Bad scene.  That Maracaibo op was a disaster, we were supposed to be in Caracas.  But it made it that much easier to overwhelm the local police force, since they had no idea we were coming.  What do you want, the pre-gps days were always like that “OMG guys, they deployed us in the wrong town again!”  Whatever, we still got the wholesale price of bananas to drop 20% that year, mission accomplished.  So ignore the brief and don’t freak out when the windows go black, you’re not supposed to know where you’re going (not Panama).  It’s a long flight and there’s some turbulence during the inflight refueling(s).  You should use this time to read the APL Employee manual.

Eventually you’ll feel yourself descending.  The windows will go clear, the door will open, and the ladder will drop.  External speakers on the helicopter will play The Lincolnshire Poacher really loudly.  I have no idea what that’s about.  Climb down the ladder and you’ll be met by your transfer liaison.  Her name is Sarah.  Don’t let her small frame and fake eyelashes fool you, she’s a very powerful person.  Try to find Czechoslovakia on a modern map.  You can’t.  Know why?  Her.  She did that.  All by herself.  In the merc world there’s a fine line between “works well independently” and “loose cannon”.  Sarah’s more the latter.  It all worked out though.  Give Sarah the cats, she likes cats.  At least that’s what everyone thinks.  I’ve heard rumors that she has a country estate where she raises herds of cats.  I’ve heard other rumors that she owns a couple komodo dragons.  After you give Sarah the cats she’ll take you on a hike through the mountains and lead you to the car yard.  She probably won’t initiate conversation but if she does I’d keep it short, she scares me.  If Sarah seems to just disappear when you get to the car yard that’s normal, she does that.  Like I said, she scares me.  
Approach the silver keypad next to the gate to the car yard.  DON’T CLIMB THE FENCE.  I think it’s electrified.  That’s what they told me.  Get out your phone and replay your video of the Iridium satellite flashes.  You’ll see a series of flashes, pause, more flashes, pause, etc.  It’s a 15 digit pin (thank you DSS) and there’s a consequence for three bad entries.  I don’t know what that consequence is but the whole area is really unforgiving.  Enter your 15 digit pin and hit #.  The gate will open, step quickly because it closes really fast.  The car yard is guarded by jaguars, I think there’s four of them.  They’ll probably find you before you find them.  Distract them with the laser pointer (jaguars are basically just big cats).  Find car #14 and get in the passenger seat.  Slowly and clearly say “all other priorities rescinded”.  The car will begin moving (it’s an electric car so you won’t hear it start or anything).  The gate will open and car #14 will leave the car yard.  The windows will dim and a recording will play.  Again, ignore it, old operation, we don’t know how to turn it off.  You may also hear explosions occasionally, Don’t worry, they’re not shooting at you.  At least they shouldn’t be.  There’s a QR code painted on the roof of the car that identifies you as friendly to the drones.  It’s a long ride so if you still have your APL Employee manual you can try to finish reading it.

Eventually car #14 will stop.  You’ll get out and find yourself in a remote village full of very friendly people.  Uh, so it’s gets a little uncanny-valleyish here.  These aren’t real people, they are all androids and while we put a lot of work into the AI we had an intern do the facial artwork.  Be nice to them but watch what you say, emotionally they’re really delicate.  We were on a tight budget when we deployed these droids and flash drives were really expensive at the time so their volatile memory is really small.  They basically can’t remember anything that happened before they get up each morning.  So if you ask them what they did yesterday they’ll probably kernel panic and drop like a sack of wet grapefruits.  They’re also wirelessly linked, all of them.  And since they’re using distributed processing to tackle the giant AI algorithms we wrote (we had a deadline, there was no optimization) if one goes down they all go down.  The whole town-THUD THUD THUD.  It’s really hilarious until you have to drag all 50 of them back to their beds, tuck them in, and reboot them.  We’ve done a much better job on the newer models.  We bought more memory and we splurged on facial artwork.  You totally can’t even tell.  Heck, 30% of APL management are androids.  Didn’t know that did you?  There’s a few aliens among upper management too.  Oops, I mean, “non-native-terra lifeforms”.  They don’t like to be called aliens.

Anyway, look for a droid named Frank.  You’re going to have to pop open his cranial access panel and you probably don’t want to do this in front of the other droids.  Oh, they don’t know they’re droids, did I mention that?  Don’t let on that they’re not people.  That would be bad.  If you do: kernel panic, thud, hilarity, bedtime, etc.  So ask to see his kitchen or something, doesn’t matter, just get him alone.  Uncurl your paperclip poke the access panel latch hidden under his hair on the back of his head.  He’ll go into standby as soon as it opens so you can relax.  Inside Frank’s head you’ll find a keypad, a speaker and a microphone.  Enter 443, 778, 9999 into the keypad and tell whoever answers what your problem is because I won’t be answering my phone while I’m on vacation.

Unfortunately, this experiment has been drastically different for us. 

I've loved it. Nothing has felt different, and I haven't let the seriousness of the label get in the way of casually having fun with her. I'm continuing to fall for her every time we see each other. Conversely, she's felt high levels of pressure, stress, and anxiety. She's also been falling for me, but the label does put her on edge.

Last week, she brought this up to me, and she eventually asked if we could go back to just dating. I asked if there was anything I've been doing to add to the anxiety, but she said no. In fact, she said she wanted to remain exclusive and even see/talk to each other with the same frequency - she just wanted to remove the label.

I took it pretty hard. It was an emotional blow to me, and I compared it to going from an intern to a full-time employee (you get the initial perks of a raise and benefits, but it ultimately feels the same) back to an intern (I think anyone would feel devastated after that).

I told her I'd revert back to ""just dating"", but I'm honestly afraid of what this will do to me. I get pretty anxious, myself, and I can talk myself into thinking that she's just using me or is treating me like a chump. I know that's not her intention - she's just running at a difference pace than I am. I guess I'm just having difficulty seeing the positive side of this all.

I'd love to get some advice. I've contemplated completely ending things with her, but I don't see that as the best solution. We both express how much we care for one another, and that should be enough reason to stay together. It's only been 4.5 months, but I've developed strong feelings for her. I don't want to not see her, but I also don't want to feel like a chump for investing myself emotionally while she is unsure about how she feels and what she wants.

tl;dr: We went from dating to boyfriend-girlfriend, and now she wants to go back to dating. She wants everything to remain the same, but she doesn't want the label. I'm just confused."

However, I never contend his opinion because I haven't really felt like there was something I could say since he probably hasn't even heard of WP.... *until today*. 

Moreover, he recently got a new iPhone after having either a iPhone 3G or 4 and we were talking about ""small man syndrome"" (random conversation ik, dont judge lol) and we were wondering how tall Floyd Mayweather was. So he was like ""oooh I get to use Siri..."" and I was thinking to myself ""Lol go ahead Siri tell him"". After about 5 seconds of searching with no verbal reply and no answer. I was just like... maybe i should use this moment to show him how much more *superior* Cortana is! So as I am pulling into McDonalds I ask Cortana, ""How tall is Floyd Mayweather?"" and **[the answer](http://i.imgur.com/pirTc3z.png)** is up in under 3 seconds I swear no long searching needed, all I had to do was ask.

Interesting enough, last night I was curious to how Cortana would answer my questions about Siri and **[this is what she said](http://imgur.com/a/5VhBf).**

**TL:DR - My Cortana outperformed the Siri of an Apple fanboy on our daily lunch break by *directly* answering the question, ""how tall is Floyd Mayweather"" while Siri was taking her precious time. This only reaffirmed what I have read/seen on how much better she is over Siri** "

They definitely seem to have helped me get through some difficult courses and my memory seems to be quite sharp (even with using cannabis often...). This semester will be my last semester, however it will also be one of my most difficult semesters. I will need to take ~16 upper division credit hours to graduate and I am also working 20 hours a week at a very demanding dev internship. What can I add to my current stack that will help with logic, endurance/ focus, information retention, motivation...?

Current Stack:
NOW Adam multivitamin 1x daily,
800 - 1200mg piracetam 1x daily,
1000mg Fish Oil 2x daily,
500mg ALCAR 1-3 times a week (taken with piracetam),
// occasionally use &lt;10mg noopept when i want to bust out a project however i feel like it doesnt work much past a few weeks for me...

Currently looking into using (for when i need an extra push...):
* Oxiracetam
* Pramiracetam

Also considering:
* swapping out the piracetam for aniracetam?


In addition to my current stack, I would say I have a fairly healthy diet (for a college student), usually do not drink much if any, and excercise about 4-5 days per week. The only thing lacking in this area is sleep, which unfortunately is around ~5-7 hrs per night."

I graduated from college in 2007, moved to live closer to my then-partner/now-spouse. I had a hard time finding a job, then found something I really loved, in my field, that paid well. One year later, he started grad school in his dream program in another state. I quit my job and moved in with him.

Early 2009, I'm having a hard time finding a job (not much in my field in our new state), so I take something part-time in a related field. I'm basically underemployed. My partner was incredibly supportive, but the wheels came off - hard - and I sort of collapsed. I was able to keep functioning at work, but I didn't want to be alive anymore. I got into therapy (2009), worked really hard to turn my life around (2010), made friends and build a support network (2011), applied to and completed a master's program in another field (2012), got an awesome job in that field (2013), and...

He got his dream job, 1500 miles away. It didn't make any sense, financially or otherwise, for us to stay. I quit my job (after just over a year), and we moved. Again.

I feel like I'm starting from zero. I was able to pump myself up with some confidence before I left (I've learned so much from therapy! I should be able to find a job in my new field anywhere!). I was even able to make some contacts with local employers and arrange for some informational meetings once I arrived.

But now I'm here. The meetings I arranged evaporated (I emailed my contacts to let them know I'm in town, and no one is replying, it's been two weeks). My keep-in-touch friends ""back home"" are busy with their own jobs and families. My spouse is busy with his new job. I'm ""hitting the street"" and trying to get involved with volunteer gigs, neighborhood association, etc., but it'll take time to build support.

Meanwhile, there's a very good chance that we will need to move to another state - again - for my spouse's job - in about a year.

I feel like such a fuckup. I'm well-educated, I've done well at all of my jobs and internships (I even got to present at a national conference... two weeks before I left my last job), and I feel like I could really be a success if I had the chance to stay in one place for a while. 

But I love my spouse, and our life is together. He's a wonderful person, and he's been very supportive of my current job-search and networking. He's told me again and again that I can work/not work/volunteer/whatever I want. We're lucky that we don't *need* a second income to survive.

I can feel the old ""wheels-come-off"" starting up again. Last time, it took me 2.5 years to crawl out of the hole. From 2009-2012, I injured myself, starved myself, and thought constantly about killing myself. What's it going to be this time? I thought I was strong enough to do this again (again, and possibly again and again), but I don't know if I am. 

**tl;dr**: I'm following my spouse around the country for his career, at the expense of my own (and my sanity). I just need a little cheerleading right now."

I made the decision to leave my job and life here in New York and I'm moving on, not 100% sure of the place just yet as some things still have to be figured out. I've told people here before that when I was a kid I used to bounce from city to city every few months and spending as long as I have here in New York was a welcome change. 

But as you can imagine moving my entire life is a bit hectic(especially as I'm not 100% sure of where I'm going) and I won't really have any time free for the foreseeable future which means I'm going to be gone from here for the next while and depending on how things go I might not be coming back for a few months so I wanted to say something before I did go, in the off chance I don't ever make it back. 

I first came to reddit to on the advice of an intern saying there was a football subreddit where I could hopefully find some other Juve fans. I'm very happy he was right about it as I found an excellent community here. I've been here nearly 2 years now and I've been very grateful to all of you for making it what it was and giving me an opportunity to talk about the team I love and well football in general. I've come to know quite a lot you well over the time, and I'm glad I had that opportunity because I have become very fond of what a diverse and entertaining group we have here on /r/juve.

2e1d9x,81,2014-08-19,"Post-College Experience: The New Office HR Girl(Part 1) M/F/F, F/F",CollegeExp,gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/2e1d9x/postcollege_experience_the_new_office_hr_girlpart/,"
I'm back from my summer work travels. Time for another story! Let me start by saying that this is going to be a long one…I might have to break it into parts. Additionally, I’m fast approaching the point of diminishing stories (I only have 1 or 2 I know you guys will like) but a few great things happened this summer you all might like to hear about.  

It all started with an age old tale…guy meets beautiful girl in college …guy falls for beautiful girl…beautiful girl falls for guy…guy and beautiful girl start dating…beautiful girl “experiments” with another beautiful girl… beautiful girl decides she’s a lesbian and dumps guy. Haley had everything my only just out of adolescent self-wanted…gorgeous blond hair, a sexy and incredible brain, legs that went all the way to the floor and back, an adorable heart shaped face, a gravity defying  large C cup, and her incredible desire to screw me anytime and anyplace. We hit it off almost immediately. We met each other’s parents…and generally acted like two peas in a pod for a year and six months. Our friends were already calling us Ericksons (this was slang based on a TV show which means a couple who meet early in college and never dates anybody else.) Haley had always been bi-curious…which was something I had heavily encouraged;  because well....who doesn’t want to watch their girlfriend screw other women…

At first, she just told me about her experience with other girls…then, (as detailed here: http://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/1yvw92/college_experience_three_or_four_of_a_kind_mff_ff/) , I watched her get fucked by one. Finally, the two of us seduced another woman named Cassie and made her ""our bitch."" (as detailed here: http://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/1zg6zc/college_experience_busty_beach_bunny_in_the/) 

The three of us stayed together until I graduated, went to grad school, and got a job. Haley and Cassie broke up with me a month later…preferring to continue their relationship without me. The three of us stopped dating, and I stopped living the dream of having two smoking hot girlfriends...for a bit.  

So I threw myself into my job, which required a great deal of travel. After a while, I managed to actually become pretty essential to where I was working. As anyone who has ever seriously worked knows…the reward for work well done is ALWAYS more work. By luck, my old High-School girlfriend, Kristin, happened to live in the same city I was based in, and we started going out again (as detailed here: http://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/272lrz/postcollege_experience_back_from_the_alaskan_bush/)  Kristin was a massive nerd (like me.) She was also a pint sized bombshell. The girl was 5 feet and nothing tall, more than a foot below me. She had that ""short and busty"" combo which I've always loved, as you can probably tell, I have a serious fetish for boobs.

Kristin was busty enough for my liking (I'd estimate somewhere in the DD range in high school...she's now a 38DD.) Her skin was pale white, the kind which gets sunburned if you look at it intensely. She had beautiful short and straight dark reddish brown hair and hazel green eyes. Overall, she was very ""cute"" in a very sexy way, rather than drop dead gorgeous. She was (and is) the kind of girl you take home to your mother, but wouldn't mind calling up for a quick fuck. I'd give her body an 8 out of 10 with a few extra points for a great personality and similar interests to mine.

Then, the company I work for went on a hiring spree. The vast majority were men (geology as a field tends to be VERY male-dominated), but they hired a new HR girl who looked promising. She was named Michelle. She was a beautiful Asian girl with a gorgeous face, a pair of very perky B cups, and one of the best asses I’ve ever seen. She was smart and funny…but before I even started putting the moves on her…she notified me that she had a boyfriend…which was very sad for obvious reasons. I really liked Kristin, but I wanted to get around some, and I’d never slept with an Asian girl. I’d heard good things about them, but I was more than a little hesitant about fooling around with the new hires…especially if they work for Human Resources (companies tend not to appreciate that sort of thing.) 

The Friday after I met Michelle my ""bathroom-mate"" (the two of us shared a common bathroom which linked our apartments, yes, my first apartment was a pit) let me know that he was hosting a party. He hadn’t gotten laid in over a year, and thus was desperate to get some chicks to come. I liked my bathroom-mate, so I asked my boss if I could take the various new hires out to the party. He approved, on the condition that I not drink anything and act as a ""chaperon"" (which was hilarious, because I was maybe a year older than them.)   Ultimately, Michelle, seven new male hires, three new female hires, and Kristin agreed to go (I asked Kristin specifically to get more chicks at the party). The party was in a rather small room which was PACKED with people. It went on for a while, but I stayed sober…after all, I couldn't have the new hires see me drinking! The room was so small and crowded that I quickly lost track of Michelle and Kristin. 

 Ultimately, the two male interns found ""partners"" and let me know they were leaving, as did a few of the females. Pretty soon it was just me and my still single ""bathroom mate."" However, Michelle and Kristin were nowhere to be found. Well, that was disturbing…since I was supposed to be chaperoning Michelle and was getting somewhat protective of Kristin…My bathroom-mate, utterly indifferent to this problem, handed me the last bottle of wine and told me to get out so he could drown his sorrows in internet porn. I left in a hurry. 

I was frantic about ""losing"" two people who I had been ""supervising,"" especially as they were female. Thinking quickly, I realized that I had both of their numbers in my phone… So, I ran back to my room to grab my cellphone. As soon as I entered I saw Kristin, kneeling between Michelle’s legs and obviously going down on her…ON MY BED. If this was a porno, I’d have boldly dropped my pants and wadded in spouting a cheesy one-liner. In fact, I'd love it if you all pretended that's what occurred and all think that I'm that much of a baddass. Sadly, that’s not what happened.  Surprised, I panicked, grabbed my phone and bolted. Yes, I got sex-exiled from my own apartment.  I ended up spending the rest of the night awake sitting in a McDonalds cursing my own stupidity and thinking about what could have been. A few hours later, I got a text from Kristin saying “We’re done, you can have your room back.” 


That next week things were awkward, but the company was springing for a party that Friday, which was sure to be fun.  Again, I volunteer to get everybody in the office home and stayed relatively sober as I had a scheduled date with Kristin the next day.  

As the party wound down I, and two coworkers, accounted for everybody (including my boss) except for Michelle (again). Obviously, this had me a little riled up as I remembered what happened last time. Eventually, I found her…drunk to the point of talking like Yoda…sitting in the company conference room.  “I’m…fine,” Michelle slurred a bit... “Though…not driving…probably a smart move…” I looked at my co-workers “You two have a good night, I’ll make sure Michelle is fine.” They immediately left. 

 I had no idea where she lived (and she was in no condition to tell me) and the subway had long since stopped running so I decided to simply keep her at the office until she sobered up a bit. 

She soon began to sober up a bit…and was right at that super talkative level of drunk.  To get her on a subject I actually cared about, I asked her why she had decided to get quite this drunk. I was answered with a very longwinded tirade. Apparently Michelle’s boyfriend had been dating and sleeping with another man without her knowledge. He had decided to “come out” publicly, and no longer needed the “cover” their relationship had provided him. Michelle had no idea he was gay. To put it mildly, she was furious. I, being a (debatably) good person (and seeing an opportunity) listened to her sob story in the middle of the conference room, making sure to ask for more details at polite times. 

After nearly an hour of ex-bashing, she eventually concluded that she should have known he was gay when he turned down watching her without another girl. I merely smiled and said “From what I saw, any guy who would turn down a show like that is insane. You and Kristin were drop dead gorgeous together.” 

 She quieted down for a second, and informed me that she and Kristin had gone “pretty far” that evening. I smiled and said “Well, Kristin is into that sort of thing.” 

Michelle cocked her head to the side and inquired if I thought Kristin would be “up for it” again as she “really needed to forget that bastard.”  I was pretty confident Kristin would be, and told her so. Michelle smiled and asked “So what about you?” I responded by saying I’d dated Haley and Cassie, and at her request, pulled up their photos on Facebook.  Michelle glanced through the photos and said “Damn…she’s stacked.  Congrats on tapping that ass though…were they as good as they look?” 

I nodded. She continued by saying “So, do you and Kristin have a thing then?”   I nodded and said “We used to date in High School…we’re kinda in a weird place now though.” 
Michelle looked at me drunkenly and said “So, you’re ok with me fucking your ex?” I chuckled, and replied “Certainly, but I think she’ll be fucking you.” She laughed, and then burst into tears. Needless to say this was a rather unexpected reaction.

 I put her head on my shoulder and let her cry herself out and, in between sobs, learned more about her situation. Apparently, she had truly been in love with her ex-boyfriend and they’d been just about to consummate their 2 year long relationship when he broke it off. I then said: “Wait a minute…you went two years without having sex?” She then tearfully admitted that she hadn’t been with a man in two years (her boyfriend hadn't minded her being with other girls.) Though she was far from a virgin to men, she claimed to never have had an orgasm with one…and only ever really enjoyed sex with women.  I immediately saw that the opportunity was just too good to miss. 

 I tentatively picked up her head, starred into her eyes, and uttered perhaps the lamest line I’ve ever said in my life “If you like, I’d be happy to help you with that.” She was still quite drunk…so to her it apparently sounded like poetry. She grabbed my head and locked her lips around mine. We been exploring each other mouths  for a bit when I felt her hand slide down my leg towards my groin. I pulled away for a second only to have her pull me back while saying “I want this.” I lifted her off the ground, flipped her over, so her magnificent ass was in the air, and tossed her onto the desk. I reached down, pulled her panties aside, and slid my finger into her.  She was dripping wet. 

I got down on my knees, hiked her skirt up, and pressed my tongue inside of her, lightly tonguing her clit as she gasped.  Pretty soon, it was obvious she wanted more.  Sensing this, I stopped licking and simply asked her “Do you want something a little larger inside you?” She immediately responded by saying “There’s a condom in my purse.” 

I smiled and said “Then get your cute little ass on the desk.” 

I kicked off my pants and boxers and started putting on a condom. Then, I shoved my cock into her. This resulted in a yelp of “HOLY SHIT!” as her tight little Asian pussy, which hadn’t seen any action for quite some time, suddenly had a rather large intruder inside it.  

Now Michelle was (and still is) one of the tightest woman I’ve ever been with… but after a lot of swearing and some serious pushing on my part I managed to get myself fully inside her. I smiled, and began to slowly pump my cock into her…pretty soon she was doing nothing but moaning. I started out pretty slowly at first until we reached a good tempo. She simply couldn't take that for long, and I felt her entire body convulse around my cock as she screamed “FUCK!”  As soon as she was done she tried to slide off the desk, only for me to grab her ample behind and put her back on it. 

She looked back at me and said “You didn’t just get off?” I shook my head and said “Nope.” I then bent her back over, and started frantically thrusting into her, using her tight little pussy for my pleasure. Fucking it was amazing, as she was remarkably tight. Eventually this was just too much, and I felt the unmistakable tension in my balls that always preceded their eruption. I continued thrusting into her and simply informed her that I’d be getting off soon and asked where she liked me to cum. She screamed “Don’t care…don’t stop.” Thus encouraged, I again amped up the tempo until I felt her body start to convulse again…then I just couldn’t hold it anymore. I came inside her….hard. 

After the spasms in my cock stopped, I pulled out of her and tossed the condom. I smiled and said “I’m pretty sure you just had your first orgasm with a guy.” She nodded. I then asked how she intended to get back to her apartment (at this point it was  pretty late.) She frowned, and then asked if she could hang with me until morning. I smiled to let her know I might be joking, and then informed her that my place had a 2 blowjob minimum for any overnight female guests (Seriously, that's a great line if you say it with some sarcasm.) 

She smiled back and said “I’m willing to make a down payment; I’ve had a lot of practice.” I gestured to my still nude lower body, and she got down between my legs and got to work. It took her a bit to get me hard again. She wasn’t Haley, but as a cocksucker she was a pretty talented practitioner of the “wrap the hand around and bob the head” school even if her tits weren't anything special to look at. (Yes, I am a tit man, but I’ve been known to make the occasional exception.) 

Before long, I was ready to fill her mouth up. I notified her of the inevitable explosion. She then pulled back, taking me out of her talented mouth, and started giving me a handjob. As her hand pulled on my cock she looked up and asked me “Tits or mouth?” I responded by pushing myself back towards her wonderful mouth. However, I didn’t quite make it in time and blew my load all over Michelle’s beautiful face. She took that remarkably well…laughing and making a visit to the bathroom to clean it off. 

We chatted for a bit, and then made the walk back to my place. Now, I have always been a very light sleeper so I was jolted awake at 11 by my cellphone, which wanted to remind me to meet Kristin for coffee in about an hour. I hurriedly dressed myself while gazing at Michelle’s naked body, still asleep in my bed. I thought about waking her up, but decided against it. So, instead of waking her, I dressed myself and texted her saying:

Michelle, 
I’m off to have coffee with Kristin. We’ll be back here around 3ish. You still owe me the ‘rent’ ;) I have a few extra shirts if you’d like to change, though I reserve the right to ask for them back. ;) 

When I got to the Starbucks I was almost immediately greeted with the sight of Kristin’s busty-bombshell of a body.  She ran over to me and we kissed passionately. After we separated she pulled back and whispered “You just got laid didn’t you?” 

I immediately reminded her that I was in fact allowed to do that under our arrangement…but she smiled her beautiful smile and said “So spill…I want the gory details. “


 I did so, Kristin immediately announced that if Michelle was still in my room…she couldn't be held responsible for her actions. We walked the rest of the way to my apartment in complete silence. As we entered my apartment I glanced around and failed to spot Michelle…causing me to let out a sigh of relief I didn’t know I’d been holding in. Then, I realized that the water was running…Michelle was apparently taking a shower. When she came out, Kristin and I were waiting for her. 

Michelle exited the shower, wearing only a towel, and gasped in surprise when she saw the two of us. Kristin sat up and  said “So, I heard you fucked my boyfriend last night.” 

Michelle took a step back, and then nodded warily. Kristin continued “It’s ok…how was he?” 

She and Michelle then had a very long, roughly 15 minutes, and very…detailed…discussion about sex with me…all while Michelle wore nothing but a towel. After about 15 minutes, Kristin asked Michelle: “How were you able to seduce him anyway, he’s really into big tits” while running her hands down her ample bosom. 

Michelle obviously resented the insult to her assets saying they were “great.” Kristin laughed and replied “Bullshit, let me see them again.” Obviously, that comment caused me to withdraw from my sulk and start paying attention. 

Michelle was reluctant at first…but then Kristin fell back on her favorite seduction line “I’ll show you mine if you show me yours.” Soon both their shirts were off and the comparisons began. Now, I’ll be the first to admit that I’m into tits and both of the girls had nice pairs. Kristin, the larger of the two, had a remarkable pair of incredibly perky and large 38DDs while Michelle had a nice pair of Bs. As soon as both girl’s chests were fully exposed Kristin reached out and began feeling up Michelle’s rack while I watched the two of them intently from the sidelines, unwilling to do anything which might disturb this beautiful sight. As soon as Kristin began toying with Michelle’s rather large nipples I knew that was in for a treat. 
After a fair amount of groping, and some light kissing between the two of them, Krsitin pulled Michelle’s half naked body towards her and said “So, you know we're gonna fuck your brains out right?” 

Michelle simply nodded. Kristin patted her on the head, said “Good girl…now have you decided if you like cocks after CollegeExp… or do you want to do it the old fashioned way?” 

Michelle quietly replied “Cock please.” Kristin smiled and asked me to “get her ready” while she “suited down.” I told Michelle to get down on all fours on the bed, and reintroduced her to my tongue. After eating Michelle out for a bit, I heard Kristin exit the bathroom. I extracted my tongue from Michelle, then leaned back and took a good look at her.  Michelle, a girl who until very recently I had barely spoken to, was currently face down, ass up, and obviously feeling extremely nervous. I rubbed the folds of her pussy and asked “So are you enjoying this?” 

“Yes,” she sighed. I replied to that by asking her why she looked so nervous. Michelle let out a moan and tighten her pussy around my finger before saying “Because I know what’s about to happen…” I gave her pussy a playful lick and asked “And what’s that?” She responded “I’m pretty sure you two are going to fuck me…” Then I heard Kristin’s voice say “I’m pretty sure you’re right…” 

I glanced over my shoulder and saw Kristin, in all her naked glory. She smiled at me and walked towards Michelle, her amazing tits bouncing up and down as she walked. She pulled my head away from Michelle’s pussy began fingering the Asian girl’s tight cunt. After hardly any time, Michelle was moaning and grinding her cute little ass onto Kristin’s hand.  As Michelle got herself closer and closer to getting off Kristin looked back, gave me a distinctive wink, and pulled her hand away from Michelle’s now dripping pussy with the exception of one finger. 

I quickly grabbed a condom, rolled it on, and then lined myself up to penetrate Michelle again. As soon as Kristin pulled the finger out of Michelle I slid myself into the girl, grasping her incredible ass with both hands and using it as a lever to shove my cock deeper into her. Michelle let out another gasp, and immediately began pressing against me while we fucked doggy style. Kristin watched this with obvious interest for a few minutes, and then laid down on the bed, directly in front of Michelle. Kristin lowered her right hand to her obviously soaking wet pussy while massaging her massive tits with her free hand. She smiled up at Michelle and I, then said “I believe you owe me one.” 

I nodded, freed a hand from groping Michelle’s incredible Asian ass. I used said hand to gently press Michelle’s head down towards Kristin. Michelle took the hint, and soon had her tongue teasing Kristin’s pussy and while arching her own incredible ass and pussy into the air, just begging for a good ole’ fashion fucking. 

Before long, I felt Michelle become more and more excited…soon, she started to tense up and attempted to pull her mouth away from Kristin’s pussy. Kristin wasn’t having any of that, and grabbed Michelle’s head, forcing the Asian woman’s tongue deeper into her, stifling Michelle’s moans in her cunt. The sight was incredible…and the entire situation only got better when I felt Michelle start to orgasm around my cock. That, and the sight below me, pushed me over the edge. Again, I came forcefully in Michelle, and then slowly extracted my cock from Michelle’s incredibly tight pussy realizing that  it is true what they say about Asian women. They're darn tight. 

I darted to the bathroom to clean myself off, dispose of the used condom, and grab another one. I was pretty confident I’d need it before too long. 
When I got back to the bedroom Michelle was on top of Kristin, and the two women were 69ing. I took a few minutes to appreciate the beautiful sight and get nice and hard again, rolling on the second condom.

Then, I grabbed Kristin’s spread legs and dragged her to the edge of the bed. Kristin barely got a peep out before Michelle adjusted, climbing on top to sit on Kristin’s face as I slid my cock into the busty redhead. Kristin’s hair, which had been held back by a rubber band, was quickly let loose, the amber strands cascading around her face and tits. Surprisingly, the complicated position actually worked relatively well Kristin let go of Michelle’s ass in order to further spread her legs for my waiting shaft.  We both groaned when I shoved myself completely into her slick walls. 

Kristin sat there for a moment, taking her lips off of Michelle just long enough to suck in a deep breath before moving. Her hips began to rise and fall in a slow rhythm before they started to swivel and rotate, taking me in deeper with each thrust. Her muscles tightened around my cock with each dip forcing me to suck in another breath. When the pleasure became too intense, I reached out, my fingers wrapping around the nipples of her ample tits, pinching and caressing them. 

Our speed increased, and the sound of skin slapping against skin echoed through my bedroom. I was already teetering on the edge of cumming, and getting ready to fall. ""Fuck!"" I cried out, my hips now rising and falling with each of her thrusts, meeting her halfway. I closed my eyes and tried to do times tables in my head, anything to stop myself from cumming early. Surprisingly, it somewhat worked and I felt the boiling in my balls begin to recede. It wasn't long before I heard Kristin, muffled by Michelle, cry out ""FUCK CollegeExp...don't cum inside me"" as she came. My fingers dug into her tits, holding her down as I fucked her through the orgasm. I was still painfully hard.

Kristin slapped Michelle’s thighs asking for release. Then, the redhead took a few moments to catch her breath, whipping the beads of sweat and Michelle’s cum off her brow before sitting up, my cock still nestled deep between her thighs. Even as her legs quivered, she rolled off, her body pooling on the bed beside mine. I was about to roll on top of her when she held up her hand and shook her head. ""Not done yet,"" Kristin simply said, a languid smile appearing on her lips. 

In response, Michelle and I just stared at her.

""You actually think I'm done?"" Kristin replied, incredulously. When I nodded, her hand came up to stroke my shaft. ""I'm still horny, she’s still wet…and you’re still hard. Besides, I think you'll like the next position.""

Then, Kristin gently commanded, ""Sit up.""

I did as she told me. As I seated himself beside her, she rolled onto her left side to face me  and continued, ""I want you to take my right ankle and lift my leg until it's at about the height of your shoulder. Then get between my legs and stuff your cock in me.""

""Getting right to the point, huh?"" Michelle scoffed, stifling a snort. But I did what she wanted, grabbing Kristin’s ankle and lifting it then nestling myself between her spread legs, one knee pressed against her stomach with the other resting against her ass. I paused for a moment, taking hold of my cock and brushing it along the seam of her dripping folds. The moan that escaped Kristin’s throat had him doing it a couple more times until her fingers dug into my knee stopping it.

""Quit teasing,"" the busty redhead growled as our eyes met.

""Patience is a virtue,"" I replied. Before she was even able to formulate a witty comeback, I thrust into her waiting entrance, causing her to cry out. 

""Fuck!"" Kristin moaned. Her ankle somehow came to rest against my shoulder as she scooted further down my cock. I waited until she had herself situated just right before pulling out and thrusting back in sharply. She cried out again, ""Oh, yeah! That feels so good!""

""What do you want me to do now?"" Michelle asked, her voice low, pressing kisses along Kristin’s exposed legs. I felt the shivers go down Kristin’s spine as she squeezed her eyes shut and moaned “Help him fuck me!” 

Deep, powerful thrusts rocked Kristin’s body as I began to move between her thighs. One of my hands remained near her ankle, keeping it braced against my shoulder with the help of Michelle as the other grabbed hold of her breast, kneading it in time with my thrusts. I smiled when she placed her hand over mine, lacing our fingers together. The three of us rocked slowly at first, building upon our momentum as Kristin’s back arched and her free hand reached between their legs to stroke her clit. Michelle noticed this almost immediately and quickly took that task over. 

Soon I could see that Kristin was biting her lip, her hips grinding harder and harder against mine seeking the release she so desperately needed again. I hiked her ankle up a bit higher, changing the position slightly. ""Oh, my god!"" Kristin wailed, squeezing my hand as her walls clenched around me, so hard it was almost painful. 

""Oh! Oh! Oh!"" she cried with each thrust, her voice slowly rising in pitch. When Michelle’s fingers began to frantically stroke her clit, I knew she was about to fly over the edge. Kristin sucked in a deep breath, and sure enough, she threw her head back, calling out “Fuck CollegeExp” as her orgasm consumed her. Again, I thought of times tables to keep myself from coming along with her, as I dug my fingers into her ankle and ample tit, slowly rocking in time with the rhythmic clench of her muscles around my cock.

When it was all over, I gently let Kristin’s foot fall from my shoulder so it came to rest atop my thigh. Her eyes remained closed as she panted, sweat dripping from her forehead and neck. She was flushed bright pink from head to toe. 

""So good,"" Kristin murmured as her eyes fluttered open. I kissed her, my tongue flicking across her lips until they parted. Michelle made a move towards my cock, but Kristin silenced her. Then, Kristin hopped off the bed to kneel before me on the floor. She smiled up at me and said “The usual rent I expect?” Knowing she meant a blowjob, I nodded. As Kristin’s fingers wrapping around my dick, stroking it softly before her mouth enveloped the tip I nodded to Michelle and said “Why don’t you help her?” The Asian girl smiled and knelt down too. Sadly, I was so desperate to cum at that point I barely appreciated the sight of two beautiful girls knelt down before me…one with my cock buried deeply in her mouth. 

Kristin moaned against my cock, the vibration causing me to nearly lose it right then. When the redhead released my cock, Michelle quickly took over, her  head bobbed along my straining shaft, taking it part of the way down her throat before coming back up for a breath. I looked expectantly at Kristin and simply said “I’m ready.”  

The redhead smiled at me and gently pulled Michelle away and replied “Well, come on then.”  Her head bobbed up and down on my cock at a furious pace. I couldn't hold it for long. Her named flew from my lips as I arched my back, sunk my fingers into her head and came. It was one of the most intense orgasms I’d ever experienced.  My entire body seized as every fiber of it was consumed with pleasure.

Kristin, and to a lesser extent Michelle, was there through it all. Her mouth wrapped around the tip of my cock, sucking it clean until I had nothing left to give. I came for what felt like forever as she swallowed it all. Then, utterly spent, I collapsed on the bed.  The two beautiful women crawled next to me a few moments later. 

The three of us lay in silence for a few minutes. Michelle broke it by saying “Well…that was great, can we meet up again?  

Kristin smiled and said “Yep, and I think you’ll enjoy that too.

2e1j1w,0,2014-08-19,Need some guidance please!,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2e1j1w/need_some_guidance_please/,"Hi Reddit! I need your help (and maybe some anonymous perspective on my situation).. I've (22F) been in a pretty serious, lovely, monogamous relationship for the past year and 9 months, with my boyfriend (23M). I found out this past March that I had been accepted to an internship program in my field in South America (whereas my boyfriend I both live/go to school in NE USA). The internship is for a year, starting in September. When I found out in March, we were both super happy (and him very supportive), as this was really my main goal. We didn't really communicate about the future because I kind of figured we'd get to it when we got there (and I think we were a bit scared to broach the subject of leaving one another).

 Little bit of background: we love each other a lot, we really don't argue (some tiny things), and we have fairly similar family and educational backgrounds and values. 

We have done long distance before (about a six month time span), early on in our relationship, and it was hard, but I think we came out stronger in the end, because we learned a lot more about each other. 

So now, when it came to discussing my soon departure (early September) for my internship, my boyfriend told me that he didn't want to stay together. Not because he doesn't love me, care about me, or want to be together, but that he simply doesn't want the commitment of being this far apart. I asked him if he wanted an open relationship and we could stay together, and he said no (so basically it's not the lack of sex/intimacy from me being gone). So we've been talking this out for a couple days, and he told me that he would be willing for us to pick back up when I get back, but that he really doesn't want to do the long distance. I was pretty blindsided by this, as I kind of thought that we both had been looking at a future together, although it's a pretty uncertain future (with grad schools, jobs, etc.), I wanted to try to figure one out together, and he does not. 

Does anyone have an input/advice/anything on this? We're taking a couple days break from speaking, as we're both really emotional (we're spending some time with our own families and everything). But is it silly of me to expect him to want to build a future with me after almost 2 years? Or should I let it go and try to find someone who is more on my maturity and commitment level? Thanks for all your help in advance :) "
2e1j5f,2,2014-08-19,Working and Going to School Full-Time,ieatliveladies,Frugal,https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/2e1j5f/working_and_going_to_school_fulltime/,"Ever since I graduated high school I've worked full time. I've lived at home, gone to class in the morning, and worked second shift. I got my associates in the spring, debt free because I had worked as a CNC machinist 40+ hours a week while going to school. This summer I got a dream full-time paid internship making less money than my CNC job, but doing what I like (graphic design and video production).

Here's where the good news ends. I'm moving 2 hours away to college that offers my major. My classes are spaced out all day from 8am to 6pm. I won't be about to work second shift and go to school during the morning any more. My tuition is increasing by about 100% and my living expenses are increasing even more. 

I don't know what I'm going to do to make enough money to pay for living and going to school. I made over 13 dollars an hour but only at full time shop positions. There is no such thing as a part time machinist. If I work for minimum wage I'll be able to pay for food and rent not tuition.

The other limiting factor is that I can't work third shift. I've never hated my life more than when I was working third and 12 hour night shifts.

Do you guys have any advice on how to make a living while attending and paying for college?

TL;DR My class schedule means I can't work full time. How can I make enough money to pay for school and living expenses?

2e1uif,2,2014-08-19,"Me [26m] just broke up with my girlfriend [23F] of 5 years, continued issues over last year+, still love her though",Maldonia,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2e1uif/me_26m_just_broke_up_with_my_girlfriend_23f_of_5/,"Hi everyone, i don't have anyone I feel I can really turn to to talk about how I'm feeling. I will generally work through things on my own but after a 5 year relationship came to an end with lots of mixed emotions, I was hoping laying things out could help clear my head.


I met my ex my final year of college, her first, during what I would later learn was a very vulnerable time in her life. We started dating and immediately hit it off, spending tons of time together and really enjoying opening up to one another. She came from a slightly troubled home with some substance and emotional abuse issues with a nasty divorce thrown in for good measure. Needless to say there was lots of listening and pouring ourselves into each other as emotional support. Things were great, she had an edge to her which I couldn't resist.


After I graduated we tried to do the long distance thing, despite all common sense telling you it's unlikely. But dangit I loved the girl and thought it was worth at least trying. Now you should know this was girl was gorgeous and always had men throwing themselves at her. But I would never worry because she would always tell me the next time I saw her about all the passes that people would make at her, it was a running joke. I never found out about any infidelity, and I choose to believe that it never happened because I trusted her and still do, only once in the 5 years did I overhear a girl asking her about a guy that she danced with at a party and my ex mentioned she had thought he was cute and what not. But beyond that I never had any reason to not trust her.



Fast forward to last year, we had gotten through the trials and tribulations of a long distance relationship. We had had a few fights, but never anything serious. Eventually things did start feeling forced, with ""I love you""s being answered with ""thanks"", eventually I stopped saying it. When she got a summer internship in another part of the country last summer, I basically called the question and let her know I thought she should experience the internship free from feeling obligated to us. So we split amicably, and I had asked for space while she was gone (I was still head over heels for her, but thought she would grow to resent me and the expectations and responsibilities I would mean while she was away).


We saw other people for a spell, but when she came back she was all about getting back together to get to know me all over again. I told her how much I had been affected when our relationship had deteriorated in the first place, and that I was tentative to put myself I a position to be hurt again, yet she persisted and we got back together. And it was awesome, we were BACK!! 


However, this time around the sex element was largely missing where it was prevalent before. She eventually stopped saying I love you back to me again and I stopped ending conversations with it because it hurt to not hear it back. We had a BIG fight but ended up talking through it, and tried to fix the issues that led to the fight. (Something that stuck with me was during the big fight, she claimed that I had raped her, we had had sex about a week after she admitted to me that she may be asexual, said I had taken advantage of her because I didn't tell her to stop) she apologized for the fight and we never spoke of that comment again.


It has now been 3 months since any meaningful intimate contact, with our last time together in person being a weekend 3 weeks ago. My effort was to try and make small plans to see her about 3 times a week in the weeks since, with every opportunity turned down for one reason or the other. Basically we're in rough shape all around.


She calls the question last Friday and asks where we are. We then proceed to talk for the rest of the weekend and we are both using the past tense. I still love this girl very much, but I can see that neither of us are happy, and in our discussions both our log term and short term expectations, we are way off. She never ever wants to get married and I do, she just wants us to BE together without a definition, and don't know if that's something I can handle at this point in my life. 


We get to the conversation tonight and we've danced around the subject about every which way without saying ""I think we should break up"", but I know in my heart that long term we just aren't going to be able to reconcile our differences, and the longer we drag it out the worse it's going to be. I still love this girl, but after 5 years and a break in the middle to try and find ourselves, I think I know that this has to end. 


As soon as I say it she turns on me calling me old, dumb, immature, really mean things. I mean I can understand being upset (hell I haven't eaten properly since the weekend) but she's just being mean, saying I just dumped her like a pile of rocks. I try to tell her I think the world of her and will always have a place in my heart for her, but I just don't think either of us can live with what the other wants in the relationship, but the venom pours out. That the last 5 years were a waste and she's going to delete my number as soon as she hangs up.


I don't know if we'll speak again, or what tomorrow will bring, but the pain that last hour caused is intense and I'm not sure how I'm supposed to feel. I know I hurt her by saying we should split, and I wasn't sure if we were going to be able to stay amicable, but I don't know if I quite expected how it ended.


I'm stuck between feeling like I'm doing the right thing for both of us, and like I've made a huge mistake leaving someone who has been very patient with me for 5 years. I've never felt as strongly about someone as I did about her. I hope to god it isn't the last time I feel that way, because it is a scary prospect cutting ties with someone you were so close to for so long. I wonder if I've made the right decision.



If you made it all the way through this potentially nonlinear rambling, thank you. I have a very close circle of buddies, but I've told very few people about the details of my relationship (family included, I don't share those details with my family), and I can't think of anything else to do. I couldn't let it sit or I fear it would eat me up inside.


---   
**tl;dr** ended an on again off again 5 year relationship. Still love the girl I broke up with and the last hour of our relationship was filled with surreal anger from her. Looking for some perspective and a chance to get it off my chest as I don't have anyone else to talk to about it :/ just hope I did the right thing for myself and her over  the long run"

I used to have panic attacks when I had to spend more than a day away from home...this happened until around age 14. Now I am 20, in college, I can handle being away, but I still live close to my family, so I can go home whenever I feel I need to. I have seen a counselor a few times over the past year since it was free at my uni, but stopped when I ran out of sessions. 

Unfortunately, I just got the news that my family is moving across the country, and I am freaking out. I have a hard time connecting with other people, my family are the only people I know will always accept me, and now they are leaving me. The last time they left for a vacation without me (couldn't get off work), I felt so alone and empty. I also just accepted an internship which, though well paying, requires me to postpone a year of college, which means most of my friends will graduate without me. 

I feel alone already, and my family doesn't even move for another month. I am terrified of what will happen when they leave. Would it be selfish of me to get a pet? I just don't want to be alone. How do I get through this?"
2e2nv6,10,2014-08-20,"Me [23F] with my boyfriend [23M] of 3 years, he holds what I see as lax boundaries, keeps hiding messages",throwpineapple,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2e2nv6/me_23f_with_my_boyfriend_23m_of_3_years_he_holds/,"Apologies for the long post, there's a lot of backstory! Thanks in advance for any advice! :)

I've been with my boyfriend, Adam, for 3 years now and things have mostly been pretty swell. He is a great guy, incredibly smart and logical, so very kind with a good heart. It's this good heart and wanting to help out all of his friends which has led to my worries. He also tends to have a lot more female friends than male friends, which I haven't had a problem with till recently. So recent events in our lives have made me discover that we have fairly different boundaries to one another and I don't know how to deal with it. 

We're both in college together and two years ago I went to another country for an internship for 3 months in the break. Adam and I are very close and we struggled through this time. Mostly me though. I have troubles with anxiety and depression and so I was very unhappy and insecure with our relationship, despite not having any reason to feel that way.

Since we are so close, in my absence Adam began making friends with some of our mutual acquaintances in a club we're a part of, and got fairly close to one of them, Mandy. He was going out with the four of them, but often with just her and him as well. I ignored my initial worries because I am very aware that I worry irrationally, but after lots of times he would message me saying he was out late with her doing whatever they were doing, it overwhelmed me and I talked to him about it. He was very understanding and said I have nothing to worry about, and they would back off a bit. He even explained to her and she agreed. Though I still felt uncomfortable with their friendship throughout the rest of that time away, I tried not to let it bug me (but it did).

Now, the year following this was excruciating to me. He was very close to her and would often just sit there messaging her constantly. It made me jealous and upset me that he never had an ongoing conversation with me and seemed so happy to be talking to her. He saw her all the damn time during breaks in class when he wasn't with me since she is also studying at the same place as us. And he would also often enough tilt his phone away when he was talking to her through text and I was next to him. I felt suspicious, but was more feeling like I was intruding, or being nosy (as I realise some people just like privacy for their phone even if not doing anything bad) so I just felt really bad about him being so secretive. It felt like I walked on eggshells around him and his phone all the time. He said that it was personal stuff they were discussing and if it was anything else he would happily tell me what it's about. It made me feel like he was prioritising her happiness over mine. Maybe that is selfish to feel because he was only lending a helping hand/shoulder by listening to her, so I don't know. Sometimes though when we went out as a group, the two of them continued to exclude me in their conversation. She would talk quietly to him about god knows what while I was on his other side, and this would happen often. I felt it extremely rude.

We had many a discussion throughout the year about my dislike for her (I misplaced this feeling I later realised, it was their relationship I hated) and he suggested I get to know her to make myself feel better about their friendship. I didn't get that opportunity until the end of the school year when he left for an internship overseas and I befriended Mandy at a weeklong club event. We bonded, she was cool and nice and even though I liked her I realised I still didn't like the closeness between Adam and her.

When Adam came back from his internship I eventually asked him to just back off from her. I can't continue to deal with the constant unhappiness and worry that came from it, and that it wasn't just befriending her that would make it better, as I had done that. He not so happily agreed.

Now, this whole issue gave me these constant worries about our relationship even though I knows he really loves me and wants a future with me. Sorry for all this info, but the more relevant part of the story follows.

Adam and I have a bunch of friends across the country from us. A couple of times we met up and went on some kind of adventure together to catch up - taking trips like camping and the like. The first time we went camping with these friends, and Penny and Liam, another couple who we're all friends with. They're like the closest, cutest couple I've witnessed (this is relevant later). There was one night where about half of them weren't feeling up to drinking and playing cards and went to sleep in the tents. Adam, myself, Penny and one of the friends from across the country, Liv, instead played and drank. 

We decided to walk to a clearing nearby to not disturb the guys in the tents, and wandered off. Liv was smashed and we wanted her to sober up so she wouldn't disturb the others. Penny and Adam were a bit tipsy, and I was relatively sober. Adam led the way through the trees and since it was narrow and dark we walked in a single file. He held Penny's hand with interlocking fingers, and I held onto Liv's arm, her to mine. The holding hands thing bugged me.

In the clearing Liv was very handsy trying to warm her hands using Penny and my body heat. She fluctuated between falling asleep and walking around acting erratically, wanting to run off. She threw up and I went back to grab her water from the campsite while Penny was absent-mindedly staring off into space in her tipsy stupor. When I got back Adam and Liv were cuddled up in the clearing, holding hands, hands resting on his stomach. It felt like my stomach was ripped out of me, he was so casual about it. I gave the water and, shocked, walked away to process. I was so incredibly hurt and betrayed. She was lying with him like a girlfriend, like I, would. This evening dragged on and eventually we managed to get everyone back to the tents and to bed when she sobered up.

When we got home the next day, having had no sleep and thinking through precisely everything I wanted to say to Adam, I told him that his behaviour was extremely inappropriate, and that I don't know if this has happened in the past, or will again, but if this is normal for him, we have to re-evaluate the relationship. He looked upset and shocked as he processed what I said, and apoligised because he didn't know it hurt me. He was surprised that I didn't see Liv constantly coming onto him and he was trying to calm her down and stop her from running into the woods while she was so drunk and end up getting lost (she did keep trying to run away from us). He said it would never happen again and he was so sorry. I was still very hurt but accepted his apology. He also admitted that she had hit on him before (on a trip I couldn't go to) months ago but he didn't tell me because he didn't want me to worry, he just told her he wasn't interested, and that because it was a drunken mistake and he wants to give people a chance and not judge them based off a drunken error.

The next trip with the group it ended with the same group of us drinking and Penny getting very drunk this time. Adam kept picking her up and trying to take her back to her room with Liam. Seemed inappropriate the way he was walking around holding her, and even ended up falling onto his bum on the couch holding her. He did not succeed taking her up the stairs so she settled on the sofa. We started chatting to Liv about stuff and it was revealed that her and Adam had shared a bed (one time when I couldn't make it to a trip they went on as a group). I shut down from that from then till we went to bed a bit later.

Adam and I ended up talking about all this stuff a couple of times. It just never seems resolved. I don't know what to tell him and I don't want to seem controlling or something by telling him to stop doing things. He said he shared a bed with her in a room that had two other singles besides the double and the other guys they shared the room with didn't have proper pjs so slept in the singles instead of him. Still I didn't feel comfortable with this and told him that they could've arranged it otherwise, he agreed and we let it go. We also discussed the handholding, cuddling and whatnot in this conversation. He said he doesn't feel like it's crossing a line because that's how he expresses friendship with his good friends. To me though, the interlocking fingers is way more intimate, but to him that's fine. Adam however would hold any of their hands in certain situations, or he'd cuddle-hug (I don't even know) them if they're upset, etc. Adam tried to go on to ask me why I don't like holding other people's hands, and all this other stuff, why is it not platonic too? Is it just because society has these standards, but why do we have to conform to what society views? Why can't we just conform to what we view in this respect? And that kind of shit, it made me so angry that he tried to turn it on me or society, trying to question my feelings and trying to 'logic' them into being invalid or something.

I tried to establish where the end of his platonic line was, but I couldn't work it out completely, but what fell within the line bugged me. Like I wouldn't share a bed with anyone else of the opposite sex while in a relationship (I know some people are cool with this, I'm just not), or hold anyone's hand except his or if a friend was smashed and needed help that way... Or cuddle with anyone.

Turns out Liv had tried to kiss Adam that time in the clearing on that trip. I didn't know that before, I don't know why it didn't cross my mind, but it made me lose it a little bit. I got so mad at Adam, asking him why he didn't tell me, etc, etc. He said it made no difference, he stopped her before she could do anything, why does that detail matter? He doesn't like telling of people's mistakes when they're drunk and it's a one time occurrence. But it just makes me feel like he doesn't tell me lots of things. That I should know. Why? he asked. Just because I feel like I should know. I couldn't say it better than that and he didn't seem convinced. He's only agreed to 'try to not do anything that he thinks I may feel uncomfortable with'. 

Even with Penny, apparently she was having troubles with her boyfriend due to Adam and their closeness (which was weird due to their insanely close coupliness), so I'm probably not overanalysing things with how friendly/close Adam is with his female friends.

Penny and Mandy are the main two, but his female friends tend to go to him to talk to him about this problems which leads to him being all ""Sorry, I can't say anything, it's personal"" and hiding his messages from me even if I just glance to see what he's doing. I asked him if he can stop this, being secretive is really bothering me and he says that he can't turn away a friend if they come to him for help. What do I do about this? It seems heartless to turn your back on a friend when they're in need, but it feels like it's acting negatively on our relationship.

We still haven't come to a conclusion about the matter of boundaries and I don't know how to resolve this. How do you suggest I discuss this with him? I don't want to tell him not to do things, but I don't know how I'm going to feel comfortable when I know he's cool doing all of these things with other people that I thought he only shared with me. What should I tell him in regards to all his female friends leaning on him all the time?

I do want to add that he isn't always like this, which is why I never realised he had these boundaries before. It's only when it comes to certain situations. But he's always been good friends with girls, lots of his female friends are mine too now, but sometimes it's just a tad more difficult.

**TL;DR** - My boyfriend has been acting very close with his female friends and while I have discussed my discomfort with him, we cannot come to a complete resolution with how to handle it. What shall I do about his differing boundaries and his female friends all leaning on him all the time?"

We are a well established company (turnover in billions) leading the Internet of things revolution. You will be working in a multi-disciplinary studio with engineers and designers, many of them redditors.

**Intern pay is $17-18 per hour**. If you can't find a place to stay, we sometimes help with accommodation for the first week. Some interns don't have cars, so we help them find a place in close proximity to work, sometimes subsidizing the accommodation. For a big company, it's a fairly flexible workplace.

Each intern is paired with a mentor who is qualified to help and guide the student. In this case it would most likely be a software/ firmware engineer working on IoT.

Every intern is expected to come up with a dream project that will help him/her learn. Some do socially relevant stuff, others work on cool gadgets and concepts. At the end of the 3 months, the intern is expected to present his/ her work to the CEO and upper management.

You should be familiar with: - Javascript - GIT - HTML5/CSS3 - RESTful API's - Node.js - Sql/ No Sql databases - basic graphic design is a bonus
Your education must have included stuff like: - Programming in at least one popular language(C,C++, Java, Python) - Software Engineering Concepts - Data Structures

I am open to self taught candidates as well, as long as you can show examples of your work.

2e2ri7,7,2014-08-20,"Woke up shaking from a confusing dream that felt ""important"". Need help with interpretation...",digglethrow,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/2e2ri7/woke_up_shaking_from_a_confusing_dream_that_felt/,"Preface: I went to sleep feeling a bit depressed/stressed about what's been on the news lately (though I'm a bit of a news wonk, so this isn't the first time I've felt like this).

The dream...

I was in a large complex -- half of it was a film festival (I used to work in the indie film business and attended big film festivals regularly) the other half was a ""pretty standard"" large prison. 

I'm not sure if I was there for the fest or somehow confined in the prison...but it felt like both. I felt stressed, oppressed and generally desperate..until I learned that, though awkward at first, with enough concentration and strain I could float...and then fly.

Once I got the hang of it, I started showing people. On an individual level, once I started around people were curious, startled, a little joyful. They were asking me questions, asking me to show them how. I tried showing a few people, both low-level film industry people (think interns and assistants) as well as prisoners. Some of them were able to float like I was at first. For whatever reason, I either didn't reveal this to powerful people or they weren't interested -- I'm not sure which.

At some point, I decided it was time to ""come out"" and show the world what I could do. I approached one of the two large auditoriums (the smaller of the two) at the film festival section of the complex, where I found a press area. I told them I was ready to talk, and showed them what I could do -- they nonchalantly acknowledged that this was important/newsworthy. Once I entered the auditorium, I found out a film was about 5 minutes from premiering (which is why people were gathered there, including the news crews). The producer of the premiering film was a friend of mine (a real film producer I know) and I showed him -- and the rest of the audience -- that I could float above them and even fly, explaining that I needed to show the world and I would, in essence, be hijacking the premier and auditorium -- the press already agreed to cover the announcement. 

Rather than relenting and/or seeing the importance of a flying person, my friend start flipping out about me messing with his film premier. I was shocked at his ignorance, that he could actually consider his film premier more important than the announcement that someone could fly, and he was enraged -- ENRAGED -- at the prospect that anything could get in the way of his film premier. Rather than reason with him, I hit him in the face several times with an open palm, screaming at him that he was stupid and blind for not understanding the importance of what I was trying to show him, the audience and the rest of the world. 

Seeing what I had done, rather than try and force my way into hijacking his auditorium, I simply went to the next one. The results weren't any better -- the press didn't follow and the packed audience in the larger auditorium didn't seem to care that someone could float/fly; they wouldn't even let me talk, but rather were talking over me, booing me, etc.

There was a single woman, though, who saw how big of a deal this was. After I gave up on the second auditorium, she approached me and acknowledged the world needed to know/see. We agreed to meet outside...

I flew, low level, through the festival and spending a lot of time wending my way through the prison. The prisoners seemed vaguely interested; every so often a prisoner would shout ""wow"" or ask how I was flying. The guards tried, feebly, to keep me trapped -- it wasn't hard to slip out. They couldn't care less that I was flying, and saw nothing special in it.

Finally, I got out. The woman who acknowledged the importance of a flying person announcement was outside; she had gathered a small crowd above a gully right outside of the prison, complete with cameras and a couple of jumbo-sized TVs -- she set up an announcement for me. 

I floated above the gully and in front of the cameras. Before I could speak, though, I looked down at the collection of people who she had wrangled up...they were basically uninterested, looking as if they had been dragged here. I looked at the cameramen and they weren't paying attention, and weren't even pointing and focusing the camera on me. 

I looked down at the woman -- she was upset, as she knew what was coming next: rather than try to rally folks for a third time, I simply gave up--shrugging and giving her a frown before slowly floating up hundreds of feet -- thinking the whole time ""well, I tried. Fuck these people if they won't want to listen"". Once I was well, well, well above the complex and floating above the city, I decided there was only one thing left to do -- I shot off at high speed, leaving it -- and the people I had tried to show this magic -- behind.

*This is a throwaway since I don't really understand this dream and writing it out, I feel...kinda narcissistic?

Any help interpreting would be deeply appreciated! "

We started talking and I asked her to prom and I was her first kiss, we were each other's first time, and we were engaged to be engaged.

We were happy and spent so much time together, going to the same college now, but I should have seen the warning signs a long time ago...it was mostly me; I'd get so grumpy and mad at her and say mean things on such little provocation, and then always regret it and want to cuddle up to her...of course a healthy relationship has that every once in a while, but this was way too frequent to be healthy.

We have very different career interests, and were already stressed about whether or not we'd get jobs in the same city, and then this summer we were apart for internships and she found she was happier without me, and that's that prompted her to breakup with me.

I feel like this is right, and that if we'd gotten married it would have meant more heart-ache down the road. I think I may have been more in love with the idea of love, than had actual perfect compatibility with her like it seemed at the time.

Still, I feel sad, lost, and afraid: sad because that relationship made me so happy and now it's over, lost because she was my best friend and time with her was such a part of my routine and now I don't know what to do with that time, and worst of all afraid: afraid that this first love was so special that nothing else will compare and I won't be able to marry my best friend.

Can second love ever top first? How?

Thanks for any advice. I feel so broken.

---   
tl;dr: My long and first relationship is over, I loved her and now I'm afraid no one else will ever make me as happy: what advice would any of you give about first vs second love? Thank you."

**Z**

We stop for the night to make camp around a bonfire, the trucks pulled around in a circle, caravan style. Tonight, it’s tuna fish sandwiches and potato chips that really leave me wishing for a plate of something warm from Doris. Eon and Danny sit on a felled tree across from me, occupying it like a throne. I get the feeling that Eon is afraid to let me out of his sight.

The big Shrek-looking motherfucker who stabbed Patty, and who I stabbed in the eye outside of /r/nosleep, watches me the whole time I eat. He wears a red bandana slung down for a makeshift eye patch that actually looks kind of cool. I don’t relish the thought of spending a lot of time with him alone.

Eon says, “That’s Bode. Best not stare at him too long. He had dibs on killing you, until you accepted our deal. I don’t think he’s too keen on it.”

Bode finishes his sandwich and casts a mutinous eye on Eon then stands and walks away, presumably to find a good tree to piss on.

“Come to think of it, he’s not too keen on me either.”

My appetite, so sharp while laying in the back of that truck, is diminished by the mediocre food, and part of it is remembering what I did to Bode. How the knife slid into his eye like cottage cheese, the ruined eyeball underneath now, half blind, and the knowledge that I had done that to him. Even to someone like Bode, it’s a disturbing to think how easily it came to me. 

Did my dad ever feel like this? When the chips were down and he was about to get into one of his Violent Altercations which would eventually become my bedtime stories, did he second guess himself in ways that never occurred to me, or did he react on instinct like I did? Did he feel that mingled sense of worry and relief at not having actually killed anyone?

“Jesus, Z,” says Eon. “You look like you just found out you have dick cancer, and it’s only the second worst news you’ve heard today.”

“Well, I’m surrounded by a bunch of rapists and murderers who want to kill me, but can’t because their boss wants to use me to get some kind of weapon that he can use against my friends and destroy the little bit of civilization we still have left. Also, this sandwich needs more mayo. It’s super dry.”

Eon seems to seriously consider this, bent over, elbows on his knees. “We aren’t rapists and murderers. Well, most of us aren’t anyway. Can I ask you something? Why are you so sure that Frontpage and the /r/allguardians are the way to go?”

I shrug. “Because we want to get things back to normal. Safety, security, society. These are good things, worth fighting for.”

“Yes, they are. We want that too. The /r/allguardians and the rest of those goofs at Frontpage—they’re rebuilding the same broken machine we had last time. We’ve been given a *gift* here, Z. Our generation isn’t cursed by this virus. We’re blessed to start over fresh. Create something new that could actually work.”

“Oh, here we go again,” says Danny.

“*Blessed?* How can you possibly say that? So many people died—”

“And that is the price that had to be paid for us to even have a shot at fixing things. The world was fucked before the virus. You must realize this. Consider that our generation inherited debt and turmoil from our predecessors. Our parents’ generation, and their parents before them passed the buck for decades, mortgaging our futures, birthing us into a world where we would have to work harder, longer, and for less just to begin to pay back the loan that they took out for themselves, knowing that the lack of social security and medicare, global warming, the national debt - would be our responsibility, and while we struggled with minimum wage jobs, unpaid internships, and entry-level salaries, we were derided and dismissed as lazy, short attentioned, egotistical, indecent, and ungrateful. And you want to go back to that?”

“But it doesn’t have to be like that,” I say. “There’s got to be a balance between a capitalist society and complete anarchy. We can have a democratic society if we just do it right this time.”

“More politics,” says Eon. He spits the words out like acid. His temper and disgust evident in every syllable. “Our capitalist, pseudo democratic culture was the problem to start with. Can you blame us for being disinterested in politics when that’s what it gave us? When instead of being spoken to like human fucking beings, we’re marketed to with [short youtube videos of vapid hipsters reciting GOP talking points](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9qLYZPAQB8) like we’re a bunch of fucking children ready to accept whatever Daddy tells them. They couldn’t have better shown how disrespectful and out-of-touch they are with us if they tried. Our entire consumerist culture was out of whack. We didn’t have our values in the right place. Everybody was happy to boycott Mel Gibson because he was a bigot and a psychopath, sure, but don't forget that Donald Trump was American royalty, Snookie was a bestselling author, and Sarah Palin almost became *President*. There’s no recovering from that. Somebody hit the reset button, so tell me, Z, why would you want to waste the sacrifice of billions of people just to rebuild it?”

Danny says, “Ethan, you’re doing it again.”

Eon’s frown softens and he shakes his head. “Sorry. I have a monologuing problem.”

“Ethan is always bringing everybody down around here with that kind of talk, newbie,” says Danny. “Don’t take it too personal.”

“Yeah, I’ll try not to.”

Eon rallies, and gets some of his good humor back. “Cheer up, Z. Your old friend is here.”

The rest of the goons share what sounds like an in-joke type of chuckle. 

I look at Eon. “A friend?”

“Yeah, from Silver Spring.”

For a second, I think he must mean Laina or James, or possibly even Patton, but it’s none of them. He’s limping between the trucks, and it’s not until he steps into the firelight that I can see the face. The game leg, a chunk of ear missing, a scowl as he looks at me. 

“Harry?!”

The troglodyte’s gotten some sun since nearly blowing my head off in Silver Spring. During the battle at the metro station, Patton tasked Harry with my execution, under the mistaken but reasonable belief that I had led them into a trap. I was able to attract some gunfire from Eon’s goons right before he shot me though—gunfire which left Harold with a limp in his right leg and an ear that looks like it was gaged by Michael Fox. After, I took his gun and explained to him that I wasn’t with the r&amp;p’s after all. Then he asked me to help him up and I clubbed his ass with his own gun and left him there.

Sometimes, I think I should take a page out of Tywin Lannister’s book. Cruelty isn’t something you want to half-ass.

“What the hell are you doing here?!”

Eon smiles. “We picked him up in Silver Spring after you and your people left. Told us some punk kid in an olive green field jacket knocked him out and left him there to die. The same kid that figured out where /u/Apostolate’s underground hideout was, and was going on and on about finding the ultrapost.”

I stare at him for a long time, asking myself why he was with Eon and why he wasn’t in chains like me. Why he didn’t reach out to Patton or Sarah or James. How he was even still alive. Then it hits me.

“I’ll bet it didn’t take you long to break him, huh?”

“Didn’t even have to shine a bright light in his face,” says Eon. “By the time we got to him, he was ready to give you all up.”

I turn to Harry. “You piece of shit. How did you find us?”

“Got in touch with Patton. Told him I wanted to reconnect with James and Easy. He told me you all went out to Bennett.” 

“You know these thugs kidnapped the OAG? They almost killed James and Sarah too. They *did* kill one of the soldiers that went with us.”

Harry smiles and shrugs. “James and Easy left me there to die too. You all did.”

“From what I can tell,” says Eon, “You were as harsh with him as you were with me. Knocking a guy out with his own pistol and leaving him for dead? That’s cold.”

“Did he tell you about the part where he was about to shoot me in the back of the head?”

“Only cause we thought you’d led us into a trap,” says Harry. He limps up to the fire and stands staring at Eon and me. “And you still left me there to die.”

Eon makes ‘tsk, tsk, tsk’ noises and shakes his head at me. “You know Z, you got a real anger management issue, dude. I mean it. You got a victim complex. If everyone around you is stupid, and everyone’s always letting you down. Maybe you’re the common denominator here. It’s probably why you get on everybody’s bad side all the time.”

“That’s not true,” I say. 

Then I think about hitting the two r&amp;p’s that broke into my command center in /r/washingtondc, punching James in the metro tunnel, pistol-whipping Harry, running over Eon, arguing with Sarah, kicking Patton in the nuts, stabbing Bode in the face. What Eon said about my victim complex rings a little too true not to sting. “Ok, but I always have good reasons.”

“You also have three people in this camp that have good reason to want to kill you.”

I laugh. “That’s it? I’m pretty sure you *all* want to kill me. But you gave me pretty good reason to want to kill you first.”

**Z**

We stop for the night to make camp around a bonfire, the trucks pulled around in a circle, caravan style. Tonight, it’s tuna fish sandwiches and potato chips that really leave me wishing for a plate of something warm from Doris. Eon and Danny sit on a felled tree across from me, occupying it like a throne. I get the feeling that Eon is afraid to let me out of his sight.

The big Shrek-looking motherfucker who stabbed Patty, and who I stabbed in the eye outside of /r/nosleep, watches me the whole time I eat. He wears a red bandana slung down for a makeshift eye patch that actually looks kind of cool. I don’t relish the thought of spending a lot of time with him alone.

Eon says, “That’s Bode. Best not stare at him too long. He had dibs on killing you, until you accepted our deal. I don’t think he’s too keen on it.”

Bode finishes his sandwich and casts a mutinous eye on Eon then stands and walks away, presumably to find a good tree to piss on.

“Come to think of it, he’s not too keen on me either.”

My appetite, so sharp while laying in the back of that truck, is diminished by the mediocre food, and part of it is remembering what I did to Bode. How the knife slid into his eye like cottage cheese, the ruined eyeball underneath now, half blind, and the knowledge that I had done that to him. Even to someone like Bode, it’s a disturbing to think how easily it came to me. 

Did my dad ever feel like this? When the chips were down and he was about to get into one of his Violent Altercations which would eventually become my bedtime stories, did he second guess himself in ways that never occurred to me, or did he react on instinct like I did? Did he feel that mingled sense of worry and relief at not having actually killed anyone?

“Jesus, Z,” says Eon. “You look like you just found out you have dick cancer, and it’s only the second worst news you’ve heard today.”

“Well, I’m surrounded by a bunch of rapists and murderers who want to kill me, but can’t because their boss wants to use me to get some kind of weapon that he can use against my friends and destroy the little bit of civilization we still have left. Also, this sandwich needs more mayo. It’s super dry.”

2e31t6,2,2014-08-20,[Rant] I hate my boss,soporific,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/2e31t6/rant_i_hate_my_boss/,"I'm a 22-year old college dropout that managed to score her dream job after 7 long months of unemployment.  I basically had a roof under my head &amp; food my belly thanks to my boyfriend &amp; 3 roommates, who let me crash at their house for free while I looked for a job.  I woke up everyday to send out 20 resumes.  Sometimes I did more.  Got a few terrible opportunities here &amp; there that didn't last long or were internships with no pay.

Then this design job arrived out of nowhere &amp; it was perfect since that's what I had been studying in my country before dropping out &amp; moving to the US.  It didn't come easy, of course, &amp; I had to undergo 3 very uncomfortable interviews with my boss' husband.  He was initially seeking to hire me for his company but was extremely offensive &amp; condescending during our interviews, calling my porfolio shit &amp; asking me questions about my job experience, only to reply that ""he didn't give a shit about my little craft projects"" when I would start to elaborate.  He's just an asshole narcissist.
Now mind you, I went to all three interviews (he wasn't even in the country for the second one, I had to take 2 buses to be told he wouldn't be interviewing me) because I was *desperate*.  I had to go on food stamps for a little bit, which was really stressful for me.
On the third interview, my soon-to-be boss is actually present.  Her right-hand man had recently passed away &amp; she had an opening so wanted to meet with her husband's scraps to see if I was any good for her.  She needed a graphic designer with social media knowledge, she needed a video editor &amp; someone who knew about bookkeeping.  These are literally all of my fortes, so I was ecstatic to finally feel like the little things I liked doing were actually talents (I'm an extremely independent woman that has grappled with low self-esteem her whole life.  Totally contradictory, I know.).

Long story short, it hasn't been a dream come true.  I've been here for 6 months now &amp; my boss has no concept of personal time (she texts me at all times to remind me to do stuff the next day or to do something that's an emergency (usually because she leaves everything for the last moment).  She travels a lot for her business &amp; only communicates with us through text messaging, ignoring calls when her typo-full texts become confusing &amp; we need clarification.  She gets really offensive &amp; confrontational in these texts too, complete polar opposite of how sweet she is when she's in the office.  Our business is very dependent on our customer service, which we all take very seriously, but sometimes get irrational complaints from customers which she uses against us over &amp; over again.  Her deadlines are irrational &amp; although she had me covering for 3 different people's jobs, she's still unyielding as to why my work progress is so slow.

This dream job has turned into a nightmare very quickly &amp; want out.  It's gotten me sick already (I have a very sensitive tummy &amp; have had to sit out days at the office in days I can't stop puking out of anxiety), I cry at least three times a week &amp; I can't take it anymore.

I've stopped answering texts out of office hours, which she hasn't taken lightly (but she only expresses things in a passive-aggressive manner), &amp; have gotten my Linked In &amp; website up, sending it out to every relevant job ad I see, but I've already been through this path before &amp; know the job market in our city SUCKS.  My boyfriend and I are eager to move to a different state with cities more friendly towards our artistic abilities, but we obviously need money for that &amp; sadly, this job pays well.  We don't have a car at the moment, I'm finishing up paying mine back home so my mom can ship it.  We expect to have it by the end of the year, but I obviously have to keep paying for it.  

I don't know what to do! This job is robbing me off my health &amp; I can't even do without it.  I feel trapped &amp; keep having sporadic panic attacks.

Oh, to top it all off: my healthcare plan doesn't work here.  I've already done all the paperwork but need to wait for November before I'm able to get a plan.  So, I can't even talk to a professional &amp; I've had to just endure the illnesses that have come, sweating on my own bed.

It'd be nice to feel like I have options, but all I have to look forward to in some distant future that doesn't even feel real.

TL;DR: I found my dream job after 7 months of unemployment only to realize that it's terrible &amp; my boundaries are constantly crossed.  Getting a job here is really hard &amp; I just want to leave this state already.  I'm stuck."

There was a press release from the American Psychological Association a few weeks back that shows that marijuana use in adolescence leads to a reduction in IQ later in life - not the first time such findings have been presented. Additionally, it's been known for many years that smoking through adolescence causes permanent changes in the brain in centers that control anxiety and mood.

I have been smoking from 14 up until the present (21). Without a doubt, it has not given me any benefits. Anxiety, depression, irritability, difficulty concentrating, I'm sure you guys already know.

Currently, I am a student intern working in a bioinformatics lab with some very smart people. I don't know how I am possibly going to compete with all of those Chinese dudes who have never even seen weed in their lives. Additionally, I am afraid that the emotional damage that weed has caused me and my reduced self-confidence will cause me to miss out on opportunities.

Of course I will work as hard as I can, but sometimes I think that I just don't have what it takes anymore. In grade school I always pulled good grades, especially considering how little I studied. I have always considered my intelligence to be my strongest suit, and plan on getting a job that requires me to use my brain, like programming or medicine. I just don't know if I will have the mental or emotional chops to compete anymore.

So my question to y'all is, can I still do everything that I want to do? I know a lot of it is just mental, and I'll admit I'm pretty depressed right now so this may seem a bit extreme, but it just saddens me so much that I have done irreversible damage to my brain that may impede me from living the full life I want to live."

How does it work",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2e3rob/socially_oblivious_me_20_m_and_a_20_f/,"So, here is the short pre-spiel that is somewhat necessary for the story:

Coming out of high school I was a socially awkward kid with no friends. Past forward to my sophomore year of college, things turned 180 degrees. I got fit, made a ton friends, some of which are really close to me. Social awkwardness is gone. I get invited to parties and other events constantly. People I didn't know existed know about me solely because people talk about me. I got a high-paying internship, and I work in a research lab for fun. I lost my virginity and have zero problems finding casual hookups. Life is awesome. Except one thing: I never learned how long-term relationships work. I had only one gf prior to this moment, and she was really socially awkward so it was a huge mess.


Here is the case at hand:

There is one girl who I might be interested in long-term. She is smart, attractive, and single. We hung out a few times, I watched movies at her place with her friend once. I really like her company, and we seem to have somewhat similar sense of humor. She is a gf material at its best. I might be overthinking, but it seems like she might be interested in me. She added me to her facebook herself. She went out of her ways to talk to me, like when me and my group of friends were having lunch, she left her table, and came to ours just to talk to me about nothing for a few minutes. When I decided to do the same, she seemed happy, hugged me, and introduced me to people at her table.


The problem:

I never had a real long-term relationship, and I have no idea how to pursue her. With hookups it is easy, you both know the deal, and you just get down to business. But I am interested in more than that with her. Asking her out somewhere is an easy first step, but then what? Where do I go from here? Basically, how does one become in a relationship?



**tl;dr**: How does one into long-term relationships?"

Need to know how much I should be targeting to save/spend.",inkoso,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2e3swi/graduated_have_a_job_but_live_in_a_very_expensive/,"So I graduated school, got an internship in NYC for the summer, and now have it extended another 6 months. 

I get paid the equivalent of 61k annually before taxes at this position. 

However since it's in NYC it's expensive to live out here. 

For the summer my rent is 1400/month everything included (utilities, Internet), and my place is nice. I have the option to move now, or stay, and I'm trying to figure out if I should target less rent. 

Everything I look at is about that same price, sometimes a hundred or two less, but they're shared and not exactly optimal, it's also just easier to stay at this place because it's safe as well.

Other expenses besides rent are food (I really need to start cooking more, I eat out just about every meal because of longer hours and less time to do hobbies), plane tickets home occasionally, and clothing. 

I'm just curious as to what I should be expecting to save out of all this. Everyone knows nyc is insanely expensive to live in, so is this something I could realistically come away with a good chunk of savings from?

2e40fv,5,2014-08-20,What can I do to become a successful Econ major?,ez_g,academiceconomics,https://www.reddit.com/r/academiceconomics/comments/2e40fv/what_can_i_do_to_become_a_successful_econ_major/,"Hey all,
I'm currently beginning to take upper division courses for econ majors at my university. I'm very behind because I'm a senior who switched in very late. However, that means that I have at least a year and a half left of school (possibly two). While the degree offered to me is a B.A., I've decided to take the math-econ route that is available, as well as obtaining an applied statistical modeling certificate (18 hours worth of classes in statistics and a few math-heavy econ classes).

Now, my GPA isn't good at all. But I would like to use these next few years to improve that as well as network and receive an internship so that I am at least employable. I have also heard that learning R, STATA (I believe I will learn a bit of this through my degree) and Python will help me be successful. My goal is to either snag a quantitative/analyst/research position or go to grad school. I'm still deciding between the two.

My questions are: is it worth learning these languages even if I don't go onto grad school, or would it be useless in the job market? What sort of internships should I look for that would improve job prospects to snag an analyst position? Will my degree still be considered ""liberal arts-y"" despite this and thus result in me obtaining a general position that anyone with a degree could pursue?

Thanks!"
2e42y4,2,2014-08-20,I hate my job. (Advice welcome),daisy___cat,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2e42y4/i_hate_my_job_advice_welcome/,"I should preface this with an apology about my grammar/spelling. I just need to get this out.

I guess this starts about 6 years ago when I went away to college. I wanted to major in photography, or sociology. My father said ""NO way am I paying for that, you'll never get a job, you should be an engineer"" So I changed, I ended up transferring from private school to a state university. There I majored in ""Industrial Engineering Technology"" with a specialization in printing and graphic design. I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it. I always half-assed the design on my projects, and scraped by, though I enjoyed the hands on aspect of it. I did my internship at a large sign company, it was hands on, I was creating things. It was not bad.

After graduation I landed a job as a screen technician for a screen printing company. It was HARD work for me physically. I am a scrawny girl, I was in the exclusive company of men who often had to help me lift/move/unscrew things. Over a year I got stronger and more capable. I loved this work. My boss was amazing. My coworkers were cool. It was relaxed and fun and great. The only problem is the pay sucked.

I couldn't get by on the wage they were paying me so I left for ""greener pastures."" Found myself a desk job at a small printing company doing ""typesetting"" as my current boss calls it. Pay raise. Easy stuff. My father is thrilled that I finally have a ""real job."" I fucking hate it here. I am constantly distracted, constantly being interrupted, having shit piled on my desk. I can't focus behind this screen. I don't want to do the work. I've cried at my desk about 4 times in 3 months. This place is NOT for me. 

I am completely rethinking my whole career outlook. I don't want to work at a computer all day long. I don't even think I want to go back to printing because all the promotions land you behind a computer. This is supposed to be a ""good job"" I'm supposed to be happy here. This was supposed to be my goal in life. A kushy desk job. I am miserable. 

I am angry at myself for listening to my father. I am angry at myself for not taking time to explore what it is I WANT to do instead of just going with what he told me to. (My father is a difficult man and it seemed easier at the time to just do what he said than to take risks and piss him off - plus he always held ""cutting me off"" (not paying for school) over my head and I didn't want to be in debt. I realize now how stupid that was. I should have told him to shove it and just left and found what makes me happy.

Now I feel trapped. I can't do this job much longer but I am not sure where to go. I spend a lot of time talking to people, and I have found that people open up to me easily and find me good to talk to. I also volunteer transporting dogs from shelters to new shelters (its like the underground railroad for dogs, the underdog railroad if you will) and I love that. I love dogs and hanging out with them. I have recently considered becoming a counselor or therapist or social worker, or something in the animal world. I love to make people laugh. All of my friends think I'm hilarious and insightful, they come to me for advice and then tell me it's good. They always ask me ""daisy___cat, do you ever have a bad day?"" I do, many of them. 

Maybe I'm the problem. Maybe I just don't know how to be happy. I thought I struggled with depression before (been diagnosed with that, anxiety, and a mood disorder) but sometimes I wonder if I just don't know how to put myself first. I spent a lot of my life not doing things because of my father. He always tells me what I want, or more often what I don't want. I want his love and approval and it seems I can't get it by being myself, so I conformed to what he wanted me to be. God I am so fucked up. I'm 24 fucking years old, I shouldn't need Daddy's love to be happy. I just have no fucking idea who I am anymore. Is this what an existential crisis is? 

So yeah, advice is needed. How to deal with my father? Advice on changing careers? Social work/therapy/doge social work? 

Thanks for listening. I'd proof-read, but then I'd just delete the whole thread. It really feels good to get this out of me. "
2e4gcb,1,2014-08-20,Interesting Dilemma With a Girl I Work With,[deleted],seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/2e4gcb/interesting_dilemma_with_a_girl_i_work_with/,"I started an internship back in June where I worked exclusively with a girl I go to school with. I was immediately attracted to her but I decided since we work in such close quarters for 8 hours a day/40 hours a week, to just friend zone her and come back at it when school starts.

Well now that August is coming to an end I began to develop feelings for this girl. I became really good friends with her roommates and they all love me, and she keeps shit testing me by asking me if I want to hook up with some of her friends (which are always the ugly ones mind you).  It's so painfully obvious she likes me back and I was so reluctant at first to flirt with her, so now I keep seeing that as a huge obstacle I cannot quite get around. 

It's clear I have to make a move now that work is about to be over, but I find it very hard to go from little friendly escalation to making a move that clearly states I want to be more than just friends. Especially considering I am literally with her 8 hours every weekday...no breaks. I've never been the guy who was hesitant to make a move, but for some reason working with her had that effect on me.

In summary:

Worked with a girl...decided it was best to be friends with her for the sake of work...began to like the girl...now I am stuck in a rut where I can't let her know how I actually feel.

**How do I get out of this friend zone I put on myself?**"

Over the summer, I've been cooped in my home trying to figure out what I want to do with the rest of my life. Unfortunately, I didn't do as hot as I wanted because of some pretty heavy issues with chronic depression in my sophomore and junior year.

Some background: I'm a senior completing his degree at UC Berkeley with a 3.0 GPA by the end of December. My intention was to go to law school, but with the shit legal market nowadays, I backed away from that and considered other options. I'm currently doing an internship at this sell-side developing market research firm, and I've seriously been considering a career in finance. I've been mulling over getting some certifications and finding some work in the business/finance (either a Certified Financial Analyst or Certified Public Accountant). Moving out of the Bay Area is a last resort because of my family ties here (parents and little sister).

The stress of making a decision has been seriously getting to me, and in my medically-induced seclusion, I haven't been able to move around as much as I want. I've been trying to tell myself it's OK, everything will be OK, I just need to wait to gain my perspective, but people that have graduated the same year as me already have internships or full-time positions lined up for them. I come from a family of immigrants that expected their first son to be successful, not some loser trying to figure out some kind of direction in his life.

I'm at a loss, and there really aren't that many people I can talk to. If anybody could help or lend some helpful advice, I would love you forever for it (even though I can't see your faces).

Has anybody gone through the same thing I'm going through? What can I do to stay happy and manage the stress?

UPDATE (8/22/2014): After reading all the comments, I started hanging out with some friends to make myself feel a little better. Some of my friends have told me they had no plans after college, people that I regard to be highly intelligent. It's difficult for me to choose what I want to do when everyone else around me has a career or direction in life planned out (completely or marginally). I guess what really worries me is that whatever I choose in life I'll fail at, either because I didn't put my 100%, I didn't have the right education credentials, or because in 20 years, I'm going to wake up and say to myself it was a huge mistake to pursue that to begin with. I don't know what gives my life meaning. Being in the education system for close to 17 years, it's difficult to see my life outside of a classroom. In school, I was always graded for something. Now, I'm grading myself. I'm the master of my own destiny, and I am only accountable to myself. With my grades, I don't even know if I'm qualified to go back to school if I want to develop advancement opportunities. 

I don't know how to quell this internal struggle. After talking about this with my mom, she said I can do anything as long as I'm always there to take care of my baby sister. I guess in a way, she was trying to find something for me to live for. At this moment, I feel empty inside, standing still as the world passes me by."
2e4zjq,1,2014-08-20,Me [24M] feel pressured by my mother [50F] to leave the house.,pinguw0w,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2e4zjq/me_24m_feel_pressured_by_my_mother_50f_to_leave/,"Hey people. I'm sorry for the wall of text and any grammar/spelling mistakes, I'm not from the USA or UK but do live in a country in West-Europe.

**TL;DR: My mom's complaints / attitude make me feel like I'm forced to leave the house, but changing surrounds in the coming months make it almost impossible for me to come out of this positively (mentally and financially) at the moment.**

So to start, I'm kind of a late bloomer. I started college in 2012 (finishing in 2016 hopefully) and still live at home, which is the issue at hands.

Every day (I'm not even exaggerating) there is some sort of friction between me and my mom about something. Whether it is me staying up late talking to friends on Skype, put the dishes next to instead of in the sink, prepare my food 'messy', 'clean' my room in the wrong way(in all fairness, I kind of just get rid of the real mess, but I'm completely fine with an unorganized room) or - I feel - whatever she can comment on.

Especially the talking with friends thing is a big deal. I don't understand why, my room is the furthest away from hers, even the living room - where one of my siblings will be gaming and talking online as well at nights - is closer, yet I am the one getting moaned at. And about 3 or 4 nights a week I'll get a message (since she's in bed) telling me I have to 'shut the fuck up', 'quiet down God damn it' or something along those lines (translated to the English counter parts) or 'she will kick me out'. The next morning she won't (or barely scrape the subject)mention it and continue the cycle above by picking out something else.

At this point I feel that is my time to leave the house. Not so much because I'm ready for it or want to, but because I feel pressured and I literally can't deal with complaint after complaint. Sometimes I think my mom needs therapy for other issues that she's experienced in her life, which makes it hard to have an actual conversation with her, but she'll never do that.

To put this in perspective, I have three 'siblings' (direct family who live with us, but not my actual siblings, all under the age of 16) my mom and me under this roof.

Now as to why I can't leave. I'm starting a full-time internship in two weeks, which basically meant I had to quit my part-time job (I get 1/3 of what I used to earn with this internship) so financially it is not a healthy situation for me, I don't think I would be able to afford it at all, my mom is not in the position to help me out financially (if she even wanted to). That's not the worst thing, because I suppose I could deal with a study loan.

The more significant part is that I'm moving abroad in January for an exchange program. I told myself that I could potentially move out after that, but if January - June goes well, I'll be going abroad for another six months in September 2015. So I've got about 18 weeks till my exchange program starts and I've got very mixed feelings about what to do and how to handle it.

Here are my pros and cons

Pros

* No false threats
* No complaints every day
* No stressed out feeling as soon as I'm talking to her
* No mood swings

Cons

* No money
* Very short time
* Where do I move to and how will I afford the necessary home appliances. Also bearing in mind that I'm going abroad in 18 weeks.
* Never been on my own before (this is why I joined the exchange program).

I don't have any close friends or relatives who would let me live in for the coming 18 weeks and quite frankly I don't think I have the finances to do so. At the same time I really can't deal with the constant moaning.

Honestly, I've tried to change my habits such as cutting off my nights earlier and trying to avoid confrontation, I'm basically a ninja around the house, but there is *ALWAYS* something wrong. I don't know what to do anymore. I've always tried to be as understanding as I can towards my mother as my actual siblings have all (3) left the house after fights, but they were in the position to do so anyway. I feel sorry for my mom, but at the same time I can't deal with it anymore.

Any tips? Would be greatly appreciated... Also, this all just came out in one go so I might have missed out on something and will gladly elaborate if needed. 

EDIT: added some relevant info."

I hope your experience can help me along my way.  I appreciate in advance you taking the time to hear my story.  I hope this is the correct subreddit, I'm new here and /editors seemed to have a good number of video professionals.

**Education**

I have a BS in Mechanical Engineering, while working towards that degree I also went for a BFA in Visual Communication and Design.  I was great at both, but I enjoy the visual communication stuff much more.  I didn't learn much about film making or editing in college, I did learn the basics of Photography and had a single class on Adobe Premiere.  

In my last year of college, I was given an internship as a videographer at a major retailer.  I had little experience but learned shooting and editing very quickly.  Myself and the full time videographer made 600 videos for the company that year (working around 70 man hours a week combined).  Our videos mostly consisted of product overviews and interviews.  To be honest, none of the videos are of high quality, they usually get the job done but we work on a quantity over quality basis.  I wouldn't put those videos in my portfolio without prefacing it with ""I made 1000 of videos like this at my job"".

As an intern, I was also given the responsibility to solely shoot videos for a sports car dealership the company owned.  They had already been making videos, but the videos were terrible.  I was basically told ""get in and out as fast as possible, we would rather you spend your time on our retail stuff.""  I remained time efficient but put A LOT of work into the car videos.  I also spent $10,000 on camera equipment (DSLR) to bring to the shoots because I knew it would get me a much more impressive portfolio.

As time went on, the car videos got better and better.  The company created a position for me as soon as I graduated college; I was extremely time efficient with the retail videos, and my sports car work was the best they had ever seen.


**Employment**

So I was one of the lucky few art students to find a job straight out of college (7 months ago).  The company is fantastic: they are very successful, provide TONS of employee benefits and everyone is awesome to work with.  I get to go home after 40 hours a week, ride around in Lamborghini's every now and then, and shoot interviews with famous people! (I'd be fine without the famous people aspect hehe)

All that is incredible, but there a couple downsides that are really stressing me out.  First, I make very little money.  I am 27 years old and still living in my parents basement.  The cost of living is rather low here but at my current wage I will have to stay in the basement into my 30's.  I also have family I will need to financially care for down the road.  I'm a single guy, no kids, I usually just stay home and put money towards my student loans.

Second, I think I have 'peaked' at my job.  We have gotten so good at making our sports car videos, that our bosses are telling us to spend even less time on them.  It had always been a struggle getting support for the dealership, but we have now hit a turning point where the higher-ups say our videos are ""too good"" and we need to dial them back.  I've also been told to stop using my DSLR and to start using whatever the company will provide, which is nowhere near as time efficient or high quality as a DSLR.

Our video team is also struggling with a lot of stress-inducing politics.  We have needed new equipment for a long time now (working on Macs from 2006, using prosumer cameras, don't have a good video studio environment and rarely making impressive videos)


**The Dilemma**

I've only been working professionally for 7 months and don't know if I have it made at my company or should venture elsewhere.  I highly enjoy working with my team and the company benefits are great.  However, I feel extremely undervalued by my pay and fear I won't grow much more as a videographer due to being suppressed.  In 6 months I should get a raise, but I'm almost positive I will still be making under 30k before taxes.  I don't know what I should be making at my current level of experience.

Here are some examples of my work.  I ran the directing, filming, sound and editing of all these shoots.  They all took around 3-4 hours to shoot (had to cut a lot of corners in every video).  I did have an assistant who got a few shots and helped drive, and content was written by the people on camera, but most everything else was done by me.  *The sports car intro graphic was created externally, I did record the sound though.

**As for my skill sets in video:**

I feel my strengths are:

-shooting

-editing

-being time efficient

-Final Cut 7

-Premiere

-learning new things

-running and editing audio

-being professional

-laid back attitude willing to try different things

-coaching nervous people on camera

-understand graphic design and youtube

I feel my weaknesses are:

-don't know Media Composer

-don't know After Effects

-limited subjects shot (cars and product demos)

-writing a script

-storyboarding (I show up to location, figure out what our content will be, then figure out the path I want to take on the spot)

-want to work in a professional environment with less ""artsy"" types

-desire a lot of free time


**Any Advice**

How much am I worth in the video market?  Should I keep my fun but limiting job or look for something with better pay?  What have you all done professionally and what aspects of your jobs did you enjoy or dislike most?  How many videos do you make that are self-gratifying at your current job, and does that effect your happiness?

2e5gzf,30,2014-08-21,Tailoring Pure Math Ph.D experience for jobs outside of academia after graduation?,TheRedSphinx,math,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/2e5gzf/tailoring_pure_math_phd_experience_for_jobs/,"Hey guys!

Let me throw in who I am before I introduce my question. I finished my year of graduate school last May, figured out an advisor and a field (something related with Brownian motion on manifolds), and I'm overall happy with it all. No plans of dropping out,  I enjoy the company of my peers, and excited to learn more! 


Nevertheless, after much pondering, I think that I probably *don't* want to pursue work in academia, at least in the usual postdoc --&gt; assistant professorship --&gt; tenure. I'm totally okay with only minimally using (if at all) the skills I obtained during my Ph.D . I see the Ph.D as my 'me time' and I'm ready to not use any of it if it comes to that point once I have a career.

Given these facts, what should I do in grad school in order to not be unemployed once I graduate? From reading old threads, I understand learning programming is a good choice. How would I go about that, and most importantly, how do I go about proving that I have the knowledge, all while in grad school? What other things should I do? Where should I look for if I want to find internships? Most math jobs if I find seem to require the Ph.D and they are all academia. If it matters at all, I go Northwestern University. I'm open to any and all jobs. I just want to be ready so once my Ph.D is over, I have a nice job ready once I graduate. 

My hope is that if I ask early enough, the opportunities for the incoming year won't be missed!

Thanks for the help!"
2e64wi,1,2014-08-21,"Concerned that future partners are going to see I (21M) only work part-time, am a skinny runt and recovering from my mental health problems and they're going to (rightfully) dump me for a 'real man'.",TastyPastry686,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2e64wi/concerned_that_future_partners_are_going_to_see_i/,"Currently I don't think I can provide for anyone or make them happy, since I need to look after myself first and foremost. This makes me sad and question my usefulness.

Since most men's self-worth in the dating scene and society is judged by a) their looks, b) if they're earning/how much they're earning, c) how tough they are to handle the 'real world', that is their emotional and financial independence and d) how good they are in bed (all regularly cited as practical necessities). 

In each one of thee categories I fail to live up to the gold standard, miserably in my opinion. 

a) I fail in the looks department because I'm skinny and weak, despite being active, eating well and working out. I would bulk to get some muscle on, but I can't currently afford extra protein on my income. It would be unfair on my dad to have to pay for more food just for my aesthetics goals, since I'm dependent on him. 

I'm trying to accept my body the way it is for the time being, but finding it difficult.  *Why would they date me when they could date a guy who's got their shit together and clearly looks hot like he works out?*

b) I've just graduated with a BA, and although I have managed to pay off all my student debt, I'm still unemployed. In the UK I am a registered Dyspraxic with an anxiety disorder, in practice it's not always managed well and has overlapping symptoms with depression. 

My mum thinks that I should claim for disability benefits (ESA) now that support from the university has been cut off post-graduarion, but in order to do this I might have to make some sacrifices in my career. According to the website Disability Rights UK I wouldn't be allowed to work more than £16 hours a week or earn more than £100 a week. The idea is that this will allow work to have a therapeutic effect and give me a taster of real work. The subtext is that I am too sick and not strong enough to handle a full-time job i.e. 'the real world'. Under this benefit as opposed to JSA (Jobseeker's Allowance) I may be excluded from certain types of work, such as teaching (since I would be working with vulnerable people, yet am a vulnerable person myself according to ESA).  

Despite the fact I would be legally bound to not work full-time on ESA, I think this is a major turn-off for most women. At my age the majority of guys are supposed to have landed a *full-time* job they are secure in (not struggling with) and be looking towards investment in property, buying a house and car etc. Moreover most women have secured full-time jobs at this age and are financially responsible/independent. For example my sister is only 20 and has already settled down with her 30 year old boyfriend and a baby where they are entrepreneurs in their own very successful holiday business. Likewise my 25 year old brother is on track for a phD in Chemical Engineering (i.e. likely to earn mega bucks in the future), and a friend of mine has secured an internship with Rolls Royce. Meanwhile I am working a maximum of 16 hours a week on benefits for my problems. *Why would someone stay with me or even respect me if they don't think I can pull my own weight?* I think it would be enough to put off women as friends too. 

c) My mental health problems and learning disability mean that I am still somewhat financially and emotionally dependent on others which really places me quite horrifically in the pathetic wimp category of dating. Not necessarily because of the anxiety disorder or disability but because of the dependence. I'm in my twenties now (22 this Christmas!), living with my dad having moved here from my mum and it's embarrassing. 

Moreover there is a stigma against these problem, although I have been receiving therapy and counselling to address them, it is enough to turn most people off. Some will see me as crazy, others will see me as being a coward or lacking spine, others again will see me as a needy pitiful child. I was regularly called retarded in school because of the Dyspraxia and even now still have 'butter fingers' or poor motor co-ordination. 

d) I'm a virgin, have some anxieties about sex and intimacy to be honest, and think that I have a relatively small penis. At my age most women want a 'real man' who knows what he's doing in the bedroom department, I think. The majority will have already lost their virginity and slept with better-looking/richer/more successful guys with bigger penises than myself and no mental health problems or learning disabilities.


Despite my being a considerate, intelligent, caring person with a wide variety of interests and a few skills etc., I currently feel I fall into the standard 'nice guy' (read: pushover) category. I have tried to 'man up' however all that did was lead me to being self-abusive and it was counter-productive.

---   
**tl;dr**:I believe I'm at a significant disadvantage dating regardless of my self-esteem and, although I'm taking a break (because I drove my ex away with my problems), consider the above to be rather significant barriers and turn-offs to most dates. Am I over-reacting/putting too much pressure on myself for my age, or do I need to considerably work on myself before I start dating again?

See, it's getting up voted. This is proof that the last statement is TRUTH."

You could say I was that kid in class who just ""understood"" it and somehow graduated in 4 years, granted my grades weren't great but I still got 3.5 GPA. All of my friends had to take one extra year of college (5 yrs total) and they actually tried hard. Through school I applied for 1 internship and got it and when I graduated they offered me a very well paid job.

I come up to him and tell him about even though we haven't seen eye to eye on alot of things , I appreciate everything hes done for me and I know why hes concerned about my ""smoking habits"" (Asian parents). I told my dad lets just have a chat, mano e mano, and take out this nice long joint filled with OG kush. We light up, he takes a few hits like a boss and passes it back. Proceed to spend the next hour talking about life, aspirations, the state of affairs in the world, concerns etc. Tells me he appreciates me taking the effort to bond with him and being honest with him , how it was the best birthday present a father could ask for.

Let me keep this brief as I am aware their are many, many more people on here in much greater need than myself at this moment.

I finished uni a year ago and got myself my dream internship a few months after. Everything was going really well, and there was talk of a possible office move and recruitment. I was getting excited as I have been in practise to be a designer/illustrator for the last 8 years. However my macbook pro has decided to start malfunctioning. I would consider myself to be pretty computer savvy, but after first trying to fix the fan speed, then the heat problem itself, then moving everything to an external hard-drive, completely wiping and reinstalling all the necessary software and about a 100 hours online seeking advice, I have decided that to move any further could harm my mac. At the moment I can barely run chrome for more than a few minutes without it slowing down incredibly easily, I cannot open any design programmes without a complete melt down of my mac and just general unusable-ness.

As I mentioned before, I obviously know this isn't a major issue, and obviously I will survive etc, but right now the only thing that has cost me my dream internship and is stopping me from being able to apply for more design work is the state of my macbook. I have spent all my savings away on travelling to and from the internship and literally have nothing left, still living with parents, and they have no spare income to support me.

I would massively appreciate any offers you may have of help -

I came in as an undergraduate engineer major and had a &gt;3.5 GPA my first year. I then had some personal insecurity issues along with motivation problems and stopped going to class. I actually did skipped half my classes first year but half is infinitely better than nearly nothing. I know I would have pass if I has just even went to class and did all the homework. In highschool, I also had slumps with grades going from F to A between semester. But at least I has a 2000 SAT score and passed 5 AP exams with all 5s to make up for those lackluster grades. I failed nearly all my classes second year and third year was bad. I am not allowed to continue in my engineering major after not getting a C in a class after two tries. I am trying to take mostly math classes this year and apply and hopefully get into the compscience major the semester after. It seems possible to be able to finish it by the end of my 5th year. I already took the first two intro computer science class. I'm trying to learn compscience (html,css, and javascript) to build a portfolio in the meantime but its been hard finding motivation when I can't get into any compscience this semester. I feel like a total failure. People are graduating with engineering majors this year with internships and I feel like I'm starting back from scratch. The worst part is knowing I didn't try.This sucks so much ....I dont know what I'm gonna do if this shit happens again. well at least writing this makes me feel better.

I am a married man, we've been married for 2 years almost and have seen eachother for around 5 years, recently I was medically discharged from the navy which was going to support our small family (my wife and child) and as such I had a bit of a problem. She had agreed to move in with her grandmother while I was away as the house we were renting was ending the lease and wouldn't renew it, and without me in the navy, it still stood. I got my old job back which was a paid internship at the county I live in as an IT (something I'm relatively good at I'd like to think) I was sure I could get the full position when it became available but I don't have a full degree at this point, and someone came along and snagged up the job fresh from silicon valley. So, as such, I was out of the job to no fault of my own. I didn't want to disappoint my wife by telling her I didn't get the job we both thought was a sure fired thing, so I continued to go out 8 hours a day, applying literally everywhere I could to try and find work so as to keep cashflow going in, but before I could, about 3 days after, her grandmother got wind that I had been fired. I apologized when my wife confronted me about this, and explained my reasoning, she's become okay with what I'd done, along with a promise to not lie, but her grandmother is salty about it. She allowed me to help my wife and child move in after renovations, and then after all that work said I wasn't permitted to live there, even went as far as to say she'd shoot me or have her husband shoot me if I came near the house until I had a job for at least 3 months straight, and saw a counselor about my problem. I'm not sure what to do, I am in work now, not nearly as good work but still work, and I haven't really thought what to do about the counselling thing. Any ideas on who I should see or what I should do?
Thanks in advance for all your advice."

She has no family in this country, and mostly hops place to place (we're both poor students). Currently she's staying at my friend's house while he's away, but in two months she'll have no place to go and pretty much no money. The plan for the last few months has been that we'll get a place together, since I'm just starting a new internship that pays enough for a cheap apartment (currently I live at home). I love her dearly, but I'm starting to get cold feet for the following reasons.

We're not exactly the most stable relationship out there. We have very different strategies for dealing with conflict. She retreats within herself and will be quiet and passive aggressive towards for days over what I think are silly things. On the other hand, I like to immediately deal with any problems that arise rather than keeping any bitterness between us. Of course, I can get angry during a fight, but I never forget that I love her and my primary desire is always just for us to cool down and hug it out. When she gets mad, she turns completely cold and it takes hours of working at her to get her to relax and just hug me. Our fights can be pretty dramatic because of this. In fact, we've come close to breaking up three times now. I have some other reservations as well that I won't get into.

The problem is, because I've been all gung ho about the apartment until recently, she's planned her life around it, and depends on it for a place to live. I know it's not my duty to house her, but I've given her the impression that I was 100% into getting a place with her. I understand that no relationships are water tight and you're always taking a chance, but when there is an apartment involved, it raises the stakes. 

I know I know, I should just communicate with her. But we're terrible at having these kinds of conversations. I know she's gonna really pissed off if I bring this up, and that I'll end up feeling guilty. I need some advice on how to handle this and emerge with a clean conscious, having made the best decision.

2e852w,10,2014-08-21,"""Thank you, doc"" were his last words",MDmusings,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2e852w/thank_you_doc_were_his_last_words/,"As I sit in my living room listening to another board review lecture on Diabetic Ketoacidosis, I can't help but remember a patient I had as an intern.  

With diabetes that requires insulin, if you don't have insulin, your body will switch to a different form of metabolism.  If in this state for a prolonged period of time and not treated, it is universally fatal.  Most people who have recurrent DKA episodes go into this state because they did not take their insulin.  But occasionally, something else can push them into it like an infection.

I was pretty late into my intern year, working in the ICU.  I came on in the morning and got sign out from the nighttime intern about a gentlemen who was admitted overnight for DKA and was being treated with an insulin drip as is common.  He was also being treated with antibiotics as it appeared that a pneumonia on his chest x-ray had started this whole event.  Everything good so far...but when I went to check up on him, he didn't look right.  

Some people can look terrible while in DKA, with nausea vomiting and general discomfort...but after treatment, they'll look better.  He did not.  He was still vomiting, his abdomen was tender and distended and very ill-appearing.  His labwork had shown general improvement but this guy looked terrible!

We got a quick xray of his abdomen which showed signs concerning for a bowel obstruction...something was causing his bowels to not move which could explain why he was still vomiting.  A CT scan later showed that yes his bowels weren't moving...but because he had free air in his abdomen and what appeared to be evidence of a cecal perforation.

His bowel...had a hole in it.


What?


Things went into overdrive, Surgery quickly saw him and readied him for surgery to fix the likely hole that caused his bowel to explode which likely pushed him into DKA.

I remember multiple interactions with him throughout the day; with him and with his family.  I remember even telling his family that what was happening was life-threatening, even before we knew about his bowel-hole. I remember telling him what was going on, what was planned and to let me know if he had questions.

Right before he was going off to surgery, I stepped back in his room.  The tv that was once on was off.  His family members had all left to the waiting room.  It was quiet, almost serene, in light of what was happening.  We chatted a bit and he told me he shooed everyone away because he just wanted some time with his thoughts.  I held his hand and wished him luck.  he said, ""Thank you doc"", and I stepped out of the room.  

I went home later that day, slept and woke up unusually a little earlier.  I texted the night intern how my patient was doing and he texted back, ""he didn't make it"".

Coming back the next day, I find out that he had indeed a bowel perforation and what could only be described as mounds of feces inside his abdomen...where it doesn't belong and is usually a sterile environment.

...


And then we're left with a mountain of ""ifs"".  What if we got the ct scan earlier?  What if he just had a couple more hours earlier of surgery.  What if, what if.

Would he still have thanked me if he knew he was never going to wake up the next day?

maybe...maybe not.

But I feel like it doesn't really matters, it's a shitty degree(programmer/IT), and I don't have to put any real work into it.

I'm at a point where I have to think about internships, and my career, and I feel like I could do good in a business environment. However, I would like to work a bit on my skills (programmer), but I can't get myself to do it. Everything I look into, after a couple of hours, I get an idea of what the concept/framework/language is all about, and I get a feeling of: ""yeah, I could do this, I understand most of the abstract stuff, now it's just a matter of sinking some time into it"". But I never really do the last part, and in the end, I don't have anything to show for it. 

I used to call it being plain lazy, but when I have a school project or a job, I really can just lose myself into it, to the point that I forget to eat. Time flies, and I even enjoy myself. I just can't do it on command. It's like I need a lot of pressure to make my kettle steam, but I can't find the pressure, the motive, the endgoal.

It's just a very weird feeling, I have confidence in myself, I know I can be good IF I can put my mind to it. It feels like a barrier, something waiting to be released, but I don't really know how to set it free. This is something that bleeds into other stuff too, like relationships etc.

I know this is a crucial point in my life, but how can I get my shit together? In about a year or so, I'll be hitting the job market, and while I'm lucky to have no debt whatsoever, and have really supportive parents, I really want to make it on my own. And I don't just want to barely make it, I really want it fucking all.

I know reddit's demografic has a lot of young males that work IT, and probably have a bit of the same characteristics as me. How did you guys get everything together? I'm especially interested in people in their late 20's, late 30's with a story similar to mine.

I'm a student, and it's summer. I spent a fair portion of my summer at home, in a city that's far away from any of my friends from university. My group of friends from home has broken up a fair bit, I was one of the few to go to uni and when I'm there and try to organise stuff is pretty much the only time more than a few of my friends from home meet up.

Due to people being busy I only saw some of my friends once over summer. Two guys who, to be honest, I'm starting to dislike spending time with. They come out with a bunch of really racist/homophobic/misogynistic shit and think it's the funniest thing in the world. They used to make offensive jokes for the sake of being offensive, dead baby jokes and the like, and when there were more of my other friends around they weren't so bad. Now they just say ""niggers"" and start laughing while walking down the street.

Then I got a very late internship in a third city. Chances are I'll be here until the end of summer then go home to get my stuff and then head straight back to uni. I'm not likely to see my friends from home until Christmas now. I know one guy here from uni, and I was going to ask if he wanted to do something one day after work. He's not around on weekends.

I've been here for a month now, and the only time I've seen anyone else is when I visited a friend in another city one day.  I've met a couple of other interns, but I only catch them once a week. I feel like I've managed to miss the boat on getting to know most of the other interns, they all speak to each other and I feel too awkward to try and join them.

At the moment its get up-&gt;work-&gt;cook-&gt;clean-&gt;kill an hour or two-&gt;bed. I don't even have video games to play for variety, just some books, youtube and reddit.

I've resolved to make more of an effort with looking after myself, but social stuff is something I'm not good at, especially without a social circle to start with.

TL;DR: New city for a short time, very few friends here. Haven't had much social contact over the last few months and a fair portion of that was with friends I'm not sure I want to be friends with any more. Feeling very lonely. Besides pushing my anxiety to the side and trying to get talking to the other interns (which I *am* going to try) what can I do?"

**I worry about everything all the time.** I have panic attacks and bad anxiety. I'm always stressed, always thinking about stuff, always worrying; my mind just never gets a break from it, no matter how hard I try. It often gets to the point where there are just thoughts flying in and out of my head, and I can't keep up with them. I just lie there for hours worrying, thinking, trying to stop. I'll start crying, because it's too overwhelming. I'll try listening to music, and it won't help. I'll try to watch TV to zone out, and that backfires; I end up tuning the TV out and end up having another panic attack. Even if I'm not stressed about anything in particular, my throat will close up to the point where I can't breathe properly, and it stays like that for months because of my stress.

**In the midst of the worry, I don't actually care about anything.** Nothing triggers a response from me. My parents have pointed it out, my friends have pointed it out. I'm not happy, I'm not sad. Neutral, all the time. I got an amazing internship at an extremely prestigious company, despite my lack of experience and despite not having anywhere near the same qualifications as all the other interns that they hired. And what do I feel about it? Absolutely nothing. It's just ""the internship."" I don't have any feelings about it. I don't hate it. I don't love it. It's just there. If somebody took all my stuff, it wouldn't affect me. If somebody close to me died, I wouldn't ""care."" I can't bring myself to care for anything anymore. Literally nothing excites me, nothing brings out any sort of emotional response anymore. I don't know if it's maturity or depression or I'm just turning into a sociopath without feelings. I don't ""like"" doing anything anymore. I don't have any sort of hobby or talent that I work on. I just don't care about anything to keep at it.

**I'm always tired.** No matter how much or how little I sleep, I'm always sleepy. Always looking for a reason to get back into my bed and go back to sleep. But when I try to sleep, it's difficult, and I can't do it. I try to relax, and I physically can't. And when I need to be doing work, I'm barely able to function because I feel exhausted. I feel lazy and totally lethargic. I can't get myself motivated enough to work. I dread actually getting down to work.

**I can't make up my mind about anything.** Even simple things, like whether or not I should buy a snack, whether I should get a haircut. I can't make any kind of decision and stick with it. I run through all the scenarios, all possibilities, all outcomes. Then I don't know what risk to take. I start second guessing everything I do. I can't even make a single fucking decision without having a mini anxiety attack. I don't know what the fuck I want to do with my life. I don't even know my own sexual orientation, I'm just that unsure about everything.

**I hate myself.** I don't have a personality. If you asked me to describe myself, I would have no idea what to tell you. I don't know what I'm actually like. I'm so used to my parents telling me how to act, what to do, and what to say that I don't know who I am. I don't have a personality, I don't have hobbies, I don't have anything I'm good at. I'm scared I'm turning out to be a narcissist, because my mother is one. I'm scared that I'm a spoiled child. I don't even know if I like what I'm majoring in, or if I'm even any good at it. I'm not physically attractive, not witty, not charming, nothing. I'm short, have a ugly-as-fuck deformation on my face, and I'm skinny to the point of looking anorexic (I'm not). I can't describe myself positively at all. I'm lazy, cold, stupid, ugly, cynical, spoiled, and narcissistic. I don't know what I like, what I don't like, or anything. I just feel like a generic ""human"" in a shell. Eyes, ears, mouth, but no soul or personality.

**I think I have depression.** But I'm not sure. I'm not even sure if I ""believe"" in mental illness, because my parents have stressed that over and over. ""*There's no such thing, those people are just crazy. Anxiety isn't a thing. Panic attacks are just for attention. Depression isn't a real problem.*"" It's been ingrained into my thinking, to the point where I'm utterly conflicted about it. *Do I have depression? Yes, I do. But depression isn't a real thing. No, it isn't; maybe you're just in a bad mood. It's probably just that, stop making a bigger deal out of your problems than what they are.* I think about suicide a lot, every single day. I know I'm too much of a coward to attempt it; I've come extremely close and backed out at the last minute. But I still think about it all the time. Frankly, I can't see anything wrong with it. I know it's bad because we're told so, but if you asked me ""why"" it's bad, I wouldn't be able to explain why. Because I don't get why it is.

**And then I see everyone around me:** good grades, got into top colleges, are super popular and well-liked, nice hair, they're toned and fit, get to travel, buy nice things, have nice clothes that fit well, have loving families, good friends, great college experiences. And I'm here: okay grades, had to settle for state university, I have friends but I don't feel like they actually like me, I'm too short and skinny to fit into anything, my hair is a fucking trainwreck no matter what I do to it, my family is borderline abusive and manipulative, my parents are narcissistic and too traditional for anybody's good, I get into fights with my family all the time, and I hate my college. I feel like I can't amount to anything unless I'm in a great college like everyone else, and making amazing discoveries in the field I'm going into.

... **I used to be smart,** four years ahead of my class. I got moved up to classes for 11- and 12- year olds when I was just 8 and I was excelling there, but I've slipped so much since then. Everyone thought I would get into Stanford, and eventually go to medical school. I started slipping soon after, and by the time I was in high school, I was so far below everyone's expectations. Enrolled in a good public university, but nothing special.

I did great my first semester of college and completely failed my second semester. I couldn't get myself to do any of the work, get out of bed, go to class, study or anything. I just didn't care. I got my grades, D's across the board, and nothing. *Not a single fucking emotion.* I saw the grades, understood it, but it just didn't register. I don't know how. I'm so upset with myself. I feel like a failure. I'm never going to amount to anything. I don't even care if I drop out at this point, I wouldn't feel a thing.

I don't know what's wrong with me. It feels like everything is. I want nothing more than to move out on my own after college, get away from a family I hate, but I'm absolutely certain that if I did, I'd end up committing suicide because I'd literally have nothing to stop me. And I'm okay with that."

I have been lurking around for a few days and this is my 1st reddit post, hope I don't mess it up or posted it in the wrong section.  I'm way beyond this woman, but she has forever impacted my life.  

You will see so many red flags throughout this story you will want to scream ""how is he still with her!?!"". I guess looking back I can only equate to a frog slowly being boiled, it won't jump out of the pot...

I met X. When I was a highschool junior, just before summer break.  I had had a few girlfriends before, even some intimacy, but was still a virign.  X. Gave me her number and told me we should hang out during the summer.  I laughed it off because no girl had ever been so forward with me, and still felt like I was an awkward kid.  At anyrate , I tucked away her number because I was leaving for army basic training and would be back at the start of my senior year in school.  We wrote a few letters back and fourth while I was away and imediatly started dating when I returned.  It was young love to say the least, and it was not long before I lost my virginity in her parents basement.  I was no cassanova but we continued to sneak of for sex when ever we could, like any other young couple would.  We dated all through senior year, experimented sexually with many things.  (She said she was not a virigin when we met, but said she had only ever done it once.). At some point she also joined the army reserve, though in a different unit.  We would both be leaving for training that summer but agreed to stay together.  I was going to college in the fall but were going to do the long distance thing, or at least try too.  The day we were both due to ship to training she found out she was pregnant at the military enlistment facility, I found out the same day, but only by seeing her paperwork on a desk.  She would not tell me she was pregnant at that time until years later.  I left the same day saying a tearful goodbye, to much of a wimp to tell her I knew.  She got an abortion that summer and never tried to return to the military.  

Returning from training I started college in another part of the country, she laimed she was just working   It was not long before I left school because I could not stand to be away from her, and because the school I was at did not live up to its illustrious reputation.  I came home and started working as a night security guard.  She told me  all about the abortion, and when we would fight she said she would tell my parents and friends and ruin my reputation.  She was the Queen of the ultimatium , always holding our relationship hostage. Threatening to leave ""alone and sad"" whenever we had any kind of disagreement,  Despite this I thought I was still a happy person, though we fought almost every day. (Then again so did my parents, I thought that was how a ""real"" relationship was supposed to be.). 

The entire time I was home working we were both living between our two parents homes, she claimed to be ""being paid by a friend"" to take classes for her, pretending to be her friend at the local community coklege.  Thinking this was a bad idea I eventually convinced her to stop going.  Though over the proceeding years she would insist I forced her to drop out of college, becuase I was so needy.

Fast forward a few months and we both decieed to start college together in a different city.  Move into the dorms, just down the hall and basically live together.  I quickly make a large group of friends, and she seems to enjoy them as well.  Though at this point we were ""that"" couple that has no interest  in doing anything without the other half.  My few attempts to o things without her always resulted in fights. To include having her hover around me when I was doing group projects for college.  

Needless to say, I did not really have any concept of emotional or relationship boundaries.  Our relationship continued to deteroriate, and I was always the one to blame.  We would have huge knock down drag out fights over what seemed like utter nonsense. Often times she would become physically abusive as well.  Hitting, pinching, biting hard enough to break skin.  Afterwards she would always apologise but only by 1st saying that ""its really your fault for making me so angry"".   

Yet, I never even considered leaving her.  At this point I had spent years hearing that ""no one will ever love you"". Your useless, ugly, stupid"". Which I internalized for many years to come.

Time marched on and eventually we moved out of the dorms into a large house with several roommates.  Immediately X. Started fighting with every person in the house.  Continually trying to show to me that ""they all hate us."". At the time I believed her.  The 2nd semester we moved out.  But not before the landlord informed me that X was hundreds of dollars behind on her part of the rent (not being married at this point we were still financially independent of one another), sort of.  Mostly I paid for gas, food, and rent in the new apartment.  And she paid for things she wanted,  clothes, etc.  

I continued my studies through the 2nd semester of that year, and it was around then I realised she was not going to classes anymore.  After confronting her about this she insisted she was taking ""online classes"" with lectures once or twice a week.  At this point I was in school, working in town, and still in the army reserve.  I never was able to even work up the courage to call her out on her lies.  I just wanted the ""good"" times back and thought if I worked hard enough, and did all the things she wanted to do, she would love me and be happy to.  This circle of co-dependency only got worse.  

We left that summer to another large city a few hours between school and where we grew up.  I was working as an unpaid intern, and would soon be going overseas with the army.  She claimed she had gotten at a restaurant. But NEVER wanted me to come visit her at work.  At this point I knew she was lying about working, just like she lied about going to school.  Judging by the constant trash I was cleaning up around the house (dirty dishes on the floor, mixed with dirt clothesetc. Etc.) She never seemed to leave or go outside.  Every time I tried to bring it up it turned into a huge fight ""I F***ING hate you, don't touch me I hate you, became as familiar to me as good morning.  Yet even after terrible fights she would apologizes, offer sex, and say she loved me for ever. 

I left for Iraq, she moved in with my parents (she said she was not on speaking terms with her parents anymore at this point in our relationship.). She was provided with a roof over her head, rent free, full access to food and family outings, a car, and even some gas money.  She claimed to my parents she was working as a nanny.  Not long into my deployment, my mom caught her trying to forge checks in my dads name to her.  I was beyond embarrassed and sought out a military chaplain for advice.  This proved to be an unfortante choice for me...

The chaplain said we were both living in sin, and could never truley be happy until we were married in the eyes of god.  Although not particularly religious, this sounded like great advice to me at the time.  Get married and all my problems will be solved.  I can finally prove to her how much I love her and that she loves me...

And so we did get married while I was home on leave.  She insisted we keep it a secret from both our families ""so we can plan a really big wedding"" when I got home. So secret it was, only because I had to ""proove"" how much I loved her.  During this deployment I sent her money every month, but saved some for myself, we did not yet have joint banking.  After many difficult months away I came home, excited to be with my wife, have a real wedding and get busy living.

Only to end up sharing my childhood bedroom with a woman who was such an utter slob that everything she owned (clothes etc.) Simply stayed in a huge pile on the floor, with the dirty things sifting to the bottom, to be only every cleaned up by me when I could not stand it any longer.  While I was gone she claimed to have switched jobs, working as a cash under the table project manager for a contracting company that was building stuff all over town.  She said she was making plenty of money, yet in fits of rage (these were becoming quite common at this point) she always accused me of just leaving her with my terrible, judgmental parents, (they did NOT kick her out over the check thing, even offered to pay for therapy) and not supporting her while I was away.  Then in the same breath always saying ""you're not the same person you were when you left""

With this environment becoming intolerable, I took a fulltime job with the army about 3 hours away from where my parents live.  Somehow it worked.  We saw each other almost every weekend, sex was amazing, often we would not leave the bed for the entire weekend.  It seemed like things were finally on track.  She moved in with some friends of mine back in our home town to save money.  The very next weekend she moved out.  One of my best friends since the 8th grade (the roommate) called saying he ay X. Drive home to the apartment drunk almost every night, and that he heard her talk with some friends she had brought over about all her hookups.  I immediately called X.  She got furious with me for ""not having her back, I would know she would never do those things."". Promptly moved out of the apartment she had just moved into, and insisted I end my 10 year friendship, as well as ""keep my distance"" from my parents and brothers, becuase they ""did not want us to be happy together."". I feel like such an idiot now for all this, buts almost like she had me brainwashed.  I did just that.  Though things (seemed) to be going great for us, at least on the weekends we were together, she continued to trash many of my friendships, leaving me further isolated from the ""outside"" world. 

My current job was coming to the end, I had the opportunity to go overseas again, this time as a higher rank doing a job I had always wanted.  However, I asked X. Again and again what she thought of me going overseas again, she reassured me that even though the last time had been hard, this time she was prepared for it, and we could make it through anything together.  Also, we now had joint banking...

I left again, and a switch was flipped.  She saw me off with a week of great sex, and loving affection, making promises for when I got home.  Within a few weeks of leaving I could hardly get a hold of her on the phone.  Then the money started to drain out of our joint account.  At first she claimed it was for tuition, she had ""gone back to school"". Even ent me e-mail of the text books she had purchased.  Then she said she was ""buying all the things we would need for our home"" so it would be ready for me when I got back.  About halfway through my deployment I got hurt badly.  It was a training accident, so not combat related, but I was in the hospital for a few weeks and had a lot of scars.  

She would not answer my phone calls, or IMs or face book messages while I was in the hospital.  I got one FB message which I kept, part of it said ""you got hurt at a really inconvenient time for me, I have finals right now."". I was devistated, but just bottled everything up and retreated into my shell I had built over the years.  Prepared to weather the storm and await the ""good times."". Once I got out of the hospital I noticed all my money was now being taken out of my account $500 at a time, through ATMs, until it was all gone within a few days of getting paid.

I went on leave for two weeks she met me for a cruise I had bought tickets for months prior.  I had a terrible haircut and bad scars but I was so happy to see her.  The cruise was awesome, our time together was not.  The hot, adventurous woman I knew in the bedroom was replaced by a dead fish that only wanted to have sex with the lights off, and only twice in the two weeks we were together.  

Vaction ended and I went back to the war.  She went back home (she really was working this time; I met her for lunch a lot there before I left).  The money kept flowing away, despite my demands, pleas, and attempts to open other accounts (she had a power of attorney) and would just get access.  Also I did not have a lot of time to do this kind of stuff,  I was busy doing other, things.

2nd deployment ended,  I came home,  we moved back to my parents house, back to my old room, and fell back into the same old habits only worse.  I was looking for work but not having any luck.  She went out EVERY SINGLE NIGHT OF THE WEEK.  I went with a couple of times, but the crowds and loud noises of clubs were never really my scene, and I did not like being a purse and drink holder for her and a crowd of friends I did not know.  Needless to say, eventually I just stopped trying to go out with her, then even when I did ask on occasion it was always ""girls only"". I mostly just sat in my room, cleaned up her pigstye of clothes and food wrappers, and played video games.  I was in a rut, and thought it was because I was home and had some ""issues"" with everything that went on overseas.  

Then, on a whim, I applied to an army program that would teach me an awesome skill set, be full time, pro met me, and allow both of us to live together in the same place.  Lo and behold, I got it!  I left a few months later to do the 1st part of my training, with her planning to join me when I was done a few months later.  We still fought a lot, but I felt like we would finally ""make things work"" and thee good times would be back to stay...

I left for training, did not here from her for 2 months, no answer to phone calls, or emails...it was rough.  She said she had started at a very competitive beauty school and was super busy (paid for with my $.  But I wanted to support her).  Needless to say, she never came to live with me.  I finished the 1st segment of over a year of training and came home for a few days to help her move into her own studio apartment.  

She was in class, and my friends in the area I had not really talked to a whole lot in a long time.  So naturally I moved all of her stuff out of storage and onto a truck, then into an apartment.  I did it with a smile, I wanted everything to be perfect for her when she got home.  All stuff organized, food in the fridge, bed made. Everything perfect.  And it was.  Until she started yelling at me saying I was selfish for making her feel bad for not helping, and how she was just going to do it after I went back to the base I was living at....I left the next day KNOWING I would just have to try harder to show how much I cared.

I got on Facebook one day to see a friend request from her ""best friend"".  Not having much contact with X. I was desperate to ""make things work"".  That's when I found entire photo albums in her friends FB page of my wife making out with the same guy in different clubs and at different places.  One was even from the just past valentines day.  I was heartbrokn.  I knew it had finally happened.  RMy selfish actions had driven her away, so I had to do everything I could to prove I loved her and forgave her, to win her back....(that's what I felt at the time)

I confronted her over the phone, she would not admitt to anything at first, but she finnaly said it had all happened a long time ago (while I was overseas the 2nd time) and it was over.  I said I would forgive her and that I still loved her, and then came home for a few days of vacation to ""work things out."". She could not miss any school so I spent 3 days pacing around town as a nervous wreck while she went to beauty school.  When I got to ""our"" apartment, I noticed all the pictures of us together, and me were stuffed behind a dresser, and (after snooping) found an ""I love you so much card"" in a drawer, it was not from me...

I called her out on this things and said the pictures had fallen while cleaning, and that the card was very old and she did not even know she kept it (it was not there when I moved all her stuff in just a few months before).  I forced myself to believed it all, becuase her explanations made me feel better I guess.  We were not intimate at all, though we did share a bed.  She also instead I not come to her school, which was just down the street.  I brought her flowers anyways a day later, she accepted them in front of her friends, but then quickly went back inside.  Later that night she sxploded at me for Embarrassing her and making a scene (all I did was bring flowers and a card, offering to take her to lunch...

I left a few days later, she promised to call me once a week, and talk to me on FB...it seemed like a victory at the time.  I also started seeing a counselor on a weekley basis to get a better understanding of what was happening in my life.  She offered me amazing advice and is still a friend to this day.  She said my plan to forgive X. Had about a 100 : 1 chance, but was always a willing listener, and ocasionally a soldier to cry on.  

X and I carried on trying to patch things up For  a while, though we were still 1000s of miles apart. I came up with a plan that we should renew our wedding vows, and have a beach ceremony, with her in a dress, rings, pictures, the whole 9 yards.  (She had claimed she lost her 1st engagement ring years prior) well, at least it was no longer being thrown at me with an I F***in hate you, twice a week after it ""got lost"").

So we did just that, had pictures taken, plastered them all over Facebook, framed the, and sent them to mom and dad, grams, and other family.  It was a good week for us togeather, spent in a B&amp;B right near the beach.  However, intimacy never recovered, she only offered the night of the big event, and was a dead fish.  However, I left for a particularly demanding training event, with the promised we would spend another week together once I was finished in a month.

She came down for a visit.  The friends I had made where I was living all wanted to meet her.  We threw a big party and BBQ, she spent most of the time playing video games on her phone, and refused to socialize with anyone.  Later she said she felt like I was forcing her o have fun.  We fought every night, in bed.  I had so many questions about the affair, but every time I asked or tried to talk about it she freaked, saying I was just trying to make her feel bad, and would never ""let it go"" and start loving her again...

It was a crummy week together, I brought her to the airport, and she left, with the promised to come visit in about a month.  She also left her phone in my car.  It was locked, but when I got home and got on my computer, she had left herself logged into her gmail account.  And there, after years of the most co-dependant, one sided awful relationship, which turned me into a shell of a man it finally clicked.   The e-mail between her laptop at the airport, and her boyfriends (same one from the photos) were coming in in real time.  Her saying what a great time she had visiting her grandma (me I guess?) And him describing in all the explicit detail what he would do with her when she got home.  

I dug further, I found out she was making money by being involved in what appeared to be some kind of high end escort service.  It all came crashing down.  I had a lawyer and papers drawn up within a day. I was on a plane home to ""surprise"" her with a visit the very next weekend.  My dad insisted he come with stating, ""son, that crazy B*** is going to start slamming her head in a door just to get you arrested, I'm coming with you."". So at 7 am on a weekday I waited outside the apartment I paid for to get inside (I did not have a key).  Some one was on their way to work and even held the door to open for to my dad and I, figuring an old guy and a young guy in suit and tie at 7am probably have important business to attend too.

I found her apartment, knocked on the door with a manilla folder in my hand detailing that she would be entitled to $900 a month for two months, and then nothing.  She would lose her car, her phone, I would get the 2nd plasma TV (god only knows why she bought two) and she would never get another penny.  All she had to do was sign.

I knocked on the door, nervous as all hell, and a part of me still screaming ""no she loves you, she is your wife!"". The first thing I heard was a mans voice say ""who's at the door baby?"". All doubt melted away in a hear beat.  She saw me, saw my dad, saw my folder, and standing in one of my army t-shirts in a dingy hallway simply said ""I'll sign"". I had the satisfaction of informing her that she had to have it all notarized and then proceeded to read every detail of how she would get nothing more then what was in the paperwork.  I then had the satisfaction of watching a short dumpy looking guy with a few extra pounds on him try not to make I contact with me as he tried to slink out of the doorway between my father and I.  He said not a word.  I glared at him, he hung his head and looked at the floor.  My old man said Loud enough for all to hear ""son, it ain't worth the jail time, let him scurry away.""

She cried the whole way to the nearest bank (had to wait an hour for it to open) she even said she wanted to give her new engagement ring back.  I told her it was not dictated in the paperwork, therefore it was hers to keep,  She signed the paperwork, I dropped her off at her apartment, with her being able to keep all the chairs, tables, 1st plasma TV, dishes etc. She had bought for ""our new life together"". That was the last time I saw her....

There are many details I left out of this saga, its long enough as it is.  But suffice to say after over 9 years of an abusive, one way relationship, where I was lied to, made to feel guilty and cheated on (never found out how many times or how many people)  
I got out.  I started to learn I was actually a good person, that some women seemd to actually think im attractive.   when i started dating again it felt very odd when i recieved things like compliments and experianced relationships without emotional manipulation.  I started to live my own life....its wonderful.  Eventually I met my wife, we have a baby due soon, and I could not be happier with where I am now....even if it was 9 years of horror to get there.      


*edit:  some spelling (im sure i missed quite a few) 

* edit: also:  in typing a book i forgot to pst my question!  How do i work on leaving 9 years of conditioning behind me,  my wife is a very supportive and loving person, but sometimes im afraid that my first marriage has ""closed me off"" emotionally some times.  sorry, hard to put into words."
2e8tsl,693,2014-08-21,"""You are too disgusting to love"" - Mom",juststupidthings,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2e8tsl/you_are_too_disgusting_to_love_mom/,"Dear Mom,

I'm not sorry for who I am. I'm 5'8 and I weigh 165 pounds. I know I'm overweight, I have been for a few years. I know why and I'm working on it. I can run for miles, I went to state tennis, I was captain of the swim team, and I overeat- so trust me, I know what I need to work on.

And I don't need you to call me fat or make snide comments.

I'm sorry my weight makes me such a disappointment. I graduated as valedictorian of my high school, got a great scholarship and internship at a high ranking engineering college, and I've succeeded through my life so far. Yes, I'm fat and I'd probably go from being a 7/10 to a 9/10 if I lost 25 pounds, but I'm so much more than my weight. I'm not saying it's okay that I'm fat, I know it's unhealthy, but it's my issue.

We went to Mexico when I was 14. I was 5'5 and 135 pounds, barely chunky. I remember you wouldn't buy me shoes for the trip because you thought I was a size 9 shoe because I was getting kind of pudgy. I was getting hips and I was already a C cup while you're just an A cup. I was a few pounds overweight but it wasn't bad at all. You slapped my hand when I reached for a dinner roll.
""Why are you trying to eat that? Don't you see how fat you are already?"" I started to tear up and you yelled at me not to make a scene. ""You are honestly getting too fat to look at. Too disgusting to love."" I left the restaurant crying and Dad tried to talk to you.

You came up and apologized later. But it was one of those, sorrynotsorry apologies. ""I'm sorry I made you upset BUT you really are getting fat.""

I'd get a lot of comments from you over the years.

""How can you stand to look at yourself in the mirror?""

""You'll never be happy looking like that.""

""No, she’s had enough” 

""Do you really need more?""

""Don't you look at yourself and hate the way you look?""

I know you remember back when I was 12 and I could fit into a size 5, just like you. We could share the same clothes. But you're 5'2 and I'm 5'8. No matter how skinny I get that will never happen again. I remember you crying when we went shopping junior year and I reached a size 9 (I'm now an 11/12 and sometimes 13/14). You ran out of the dressing room, crying that you couldn't look at me anymore. The lady next to me was with her young daughter and she had to come up to me and tell me that I was beautiful. Something I had never heard from you.

I went to waterworld with my swim team my senior year. I was there with you, my best friends, and all the little kids on the swim team and their parents. The moment I took off my t-shirt you shouted, ""Suck it in! Suck it in!"". I told you to fuck off. That was the first time I ever swore around you. My friends mom came up to me and told me how sorry she felt for me. 

I couldn't handle it. I was happy with academics and friends and everything else in my life. But I couldn't be home. I couldn't stand to be called fat any more and I couldn't look at myself in the mirror anymore. I hated everything about myself and even though I could confide in friends and sleep at their houses, you had become the voice in my head, telling me I was too fat, too disgusting and too worthless. Thankfully, i'm past that now. I still hear your voice in my head telling me I'm fat and hard to look at and that I'll never be loved. But I've found a way past it.

I lost ten pounds in college through working out and eating healthy. I ran my first 5k straight. And when I tell you, I expect you to be proud. Instead, I get ""Well I guess that’s better than losing no pounds"". I gave up on losing weight. I'll never make you proud.

I overheard you tell Dad that you wish you had a daughter like a girl on my tennis team. She's not that bright or funny but she is skinny and pretty. You said you'd rather have her because you could be PROUD of her because she was skinny.

If it were between gaining 10 pounds and me being bulimic or anorexic, I would pick the 10 pounds. I would choose to have any self respect, self love, and strength in myself for 10 pounds. That’s the difference between me and you. I would choose the 10 pounds and happiness. You would want me to choose the eating disorder. Dad told me you used to be chunky. Not fat or obese, just chunky and that you once had an eating disorder. You'd never tell me that though so I really don't know anything about it. You're 100 pounds of fat hatred. And I know you only want me to be healthy. You don't think I want that too? I wanted to be skinny and healthy.

And one day I will be. But hell, I can’t even remember the last time you looked at me without disgust for my weight.

I know you want the best for me. But I hate you because you made me hate myself. And it will always be something I carry with me.

I need and want to move but I'm feeling backed into a corner,improbablydepressed,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/2e8v0v/i_have_a_job_i_have_an_internship_nmom_criticizes/,"**Background** - I'm a recent high school grad but I won't be attending university in the fall because of medical reasons. I will be attending community college and transferring once my medical issues are resolved.
I'm an (unpaid) intern at a really amazing company where everyone loves me and I'm a valued team member. My mom hates that I'm actually wanted by my company based on my skills and personality. Nmom has no job, is a bitch, physically and emotionally abusive, the works. She's threatened to cut me off many times before, she even left town for about a month very shortly after I turned 18 because I was no longer her responsibility. 


*Part 1* - I recently got a really cool paid job. It's my first real job (that pays). I aced my interview even without previous experience in the field and I was really excited. I came home and told my mother who promptly ignored me for a phone call that she was on (she's typically on her phone for 16+ hours a day, that's when she isn't sleeping). When she finally did speak to me about my employment she literally only laughed at me and how stupid I was for taking a job so far away. I asked her what the issue was since I finally had a job and she said I needed to ""get the fuck away from [her]"". 


*Part 2* - My job is about 40 minutes away which is admittedly far so I brought up something to my mom I've been thinking about for years; moving out. I mentioned that after I had saved enough from my job I could get an apartment across town which would cut my commute in half and save gas. My mom went into a frenzy. Calling my choices stupid, screaming about how I'm wasting my time, telling me I'd never be successful, etc. When I explained to her that I'd thought about this quite a bit she quickly picked up her cell phone and played a loud video on facebook and told me to stop talking because I was disturbing her and since I knew what I was doing I could leave home. This was literally 10 minutes ago. I started typing this post as soon as I left her presence. 

***The issue:*** I know that I need to move, I want to move, and I'm trying my hardest to get the resources that I need to move but I cannot mentally bring myself to cut myself off from my mother. She's my only parent. My grandmother raised me as well but I have father / father figure, I'm an only child, and I'm the youngest in my family so none of my cousins are near my age. I almost feel bad for wanting to leave my mother (and grandmother), I'm also scared because I have no other family. I don't have many friends either. Is there any way for me to stop feeling like this?"

We are having a really tough time lately and it is primarily my fault, but it is not fully. I have some mental illness issues and can get irritated easily. However, I take medication, a lot, and no one can tell, they only think im like Sheldon from the big bang but a much more toned down version. 


I have been trying to find the right med combo for the past two years and when I change them i can get some stronger irritability. I also went away to complete a 2 year graduate degree at a top 5 university in the world and my wife had to stay back home so she would keep her well paying job. She now found a much better opportunity so it worked out well for her. But she has resented me for years, throwing my desire to improve my career opportunities for life ( and leave a job and an industry that made me completely miserable and suicidal) in my face and saying that I just went to school to boost my ego. During school I visited every month and struggled in school, suffered with heavy social anxiety, and she wanted to talk to me less and less often. It got to the point where she would just text me a few times during the day and only call or facetime me 1-2 times per week. 


Oh and she hates my family although they have been nothing but nice and loving to her. They are not perfect but they dont mean bad. So I cannot talk to them because otherwise I am a mamas boy, oh and I betrayed her and went behind her back because I shared our wedding pictures with my family and she didnt want them to see them because they didnt give us a direct wedding gift or pay for pictures or ring, they just threw her a thousand dollar wedding shower, paid for 3 $650 tickets for our destination wedding plus the hotel. So I cannot talk to my family, I dont have many friends because I sometimes get depressed and dont talk to anyone for months, so I rely heavily on talking to my wife.


She is my support, my best friend for 8 years. Shes been with me through hell. She forgave me for seeing an escort when i got manic and hypersexual and during this time I really wanted to break up with her because she was, and has been, really mean to me. But she forgave me. Ive said horrible things to her, I used to drink a lot, which only pissed her off but never affect her (no physicality) and because of all the things and negative emotions she made me feel, in my drunken state i said things to hurt her. Now that i mention it i realize that it wasnt me just being evil, it was me retaliating, rebelling for the bad treatment that ive received. 


But she is my pillar of support, without her i wouldnt be in this elite school, or had worked for one of the best companies in the world, I would be nothing but a drunk, crazy, lonely guy. And i am very afraid. I dont know how i will feel if we separate. I dont want to end up so depressed that i kill myself. 20% of people like me kill themselves. I dont have a support network, friends to rely on for support, or to be there to talk to me when i lose it, or to talk me down when something or someone pisses me off.


I will be successful in life. I just dont know if i can do it alone.


The reason I think divorce is imminent is because this whole summer i came back home to do an internship. She made me get an apartment because she didnt want me to make a mess in hers, so i found a place where i stayed during the week. I was miserable all summer. She did not do one single thing to make me happy except to yell at me, say not to bother her. Im sure she did something but i just cant remember. I was so sad i ended up getting high every day so the time would pass by faster during the evenings and my loneliness wouldnt set in. I would just watch tv from 6pm until 10pm when i went to bed.


I am not in the best shape because these antipsychotics make people gain weight, they just do, theres nothing anyone can do, but im not fat. Im short. My meds also make me not function 100% in the sack. And im socially awkward, especially with my increasing social anxiety and worsening of my illness. I dont want to end up alone. I am also a little superficial and need to be with someone that I find at least a little attractive, and I am probably a 6, a 5 if you care about height. Id like to stay in the 6-7 range but with all my downsides i dont know if i can find someone that would be interested in me.


So it has been like 10 times this summer that she said she is done with me, mostly because i just asked her a question like what are you doing, and she just wants divorce. P

I just received a call from a top agency for an internship interview for a media buying + coordinator role.  

I have recently gone for an interview at another agency and my ego/morale is at an all time low because of a rejection letter that I've gotten (I know that there are others in worst situations than me but..).. I used my best tricks in that interview but perhaps that wasn't good enough so I was wondering what exactly can I do to get a job in the ad industry? I really really wanna a job in the ad industry but it just seems like an eternal struggle for me.

(Emailed the interviewee who rejected me btw to ask for feedback so we'll see what he says..)

BG info with regards to myself: I have good grades from uni, am doing a postgrad course at the moment at a pretty young age, no experience in the advertising industry whatsoever apart from some market research, got a good grade from uni from a relevant subject, must be good at hounding people down apparently because I have a feeling they finally reviewed my internship application after I have literally spammed all relevant personnel...

So, I was wondering if anyone has any tips on how to best blow the interviewees away with my amazing self?

I am dating a girl (let's call her Sam) that I met at the college I am at now, freshman year. We are now both going to be juniors, and we are kind of hitting a wall in our relationship. Sam I will say, has not had the perfect time at college; she had a family ordeal first semester of freshman year (house fire), and this has been a big part of our relationship.

Sam's house was symbolic of her life, since her father built the house, and it was very impressive to say the least. Now, her family is torn apart over it, even though they received a more than incredible lump sum of money from home insurance. I can clarify that money isn't an issue here; they are just completely distraught over losing almost all of their stuff. What boggles me about the family is that they are themselves rebuilding the house, and not having it rebuilt by a contractor, saving them an insane amount of stress and time. Almost two years later (aka now), the house is JUST being put together. They have been living in a smallish 'double-wide trailer' (it's very nice for a trailer). 

In addition to this, I feel that besides her obvious grief over losing her belongings, she has been struggling to find a major and profession that will follow after college. She came in as a pre-med student, but quickly saw that was not for her. After asking me multiple times about very specific professions, such as dietetics, I advised her to at least have a back up plan if she hated it - since I don't know what you would do with a degree such as that if you didn't plan on being a dietetic. This felt awkward to me, since I'm a college student as well - with no experience really outside of summer jobs. I tried giving advice that was too harsh for her, and she really began to become upset with me. This was about a year ago. I feel that she may have taken it harshly because she was depressed about her family ordeal, however, she never took the initiative to do **anything** about her depression (which I strongly advised, since I have been on SSRI's for over 4 years). 

After I advised her to stop asking me for advice and an actual counselor or advisor (our university is very big, and there are almost unlimited resources for this), we became good again. Now, fastforwarding to about this January, her roommate situation began to deteriorate.

A bit of a background on the roomies. Two of them: let's call one Angela and the other Breesa. Angela is somewhat nice, sometimes quirky, but easily manipulated. Now... Breesa is just a disaster. Somehow, Breesa and I were best friends in high school (we went to the same school). Breesa is a very promiscuous, manipulative, and attention seeking girl, and to say the least, is **VERY** insecure. Her latest shenanigan at the time was her at the time boyfriend, who I advised at least 100 times to stop seeing. He is a typical horrible, lying, cheating boyfriend. So, you can imagine how many different girls he had sex with, while dating Breesa. Yet, she continually went back to him. After a while, I basically told her, *look, this is your fault; I'm not going to sit here and feel sorry for you.* At this point, everyone basically had enough of her shit, and she started turning her grief over losing her boy toy into being a total psycho bitch to everyone. Breesa manipulated Angela into joining her sorority, which Breesa thinks is the most posh and popular on campus. Ever since, Angela has been manipulated to become more like Breesa, and my girlfriend Sam has been the victim of both of them being rude. Some of the examples of what Breesa and Angela do is:

1. Leave dirty dishes and pots on Sam's bed, if they're not clean (while A and B are absolutely disgusting pigs)
2. Use Sam's clothes without asking, and don't return them. And if they do, they're stained with god knows what...
3. Throw parties for their sorority without even telling Sam.

AND MOST RECENTLY!

4. Sam was going home for the months of this July and August (now). So, naturally, she would have someone sublet, to not have to pay the ridiculous $800/mo of living there. Breesa had a total shit fit, and said absolutely not; she will not live with someone who she does not know. Breesa said she was *hurt, confused, and very irritated* by this. How exactly? I don't know. I'm a guy though, so I guess it may be different? However, Breesa and Angela are studying abroad next semester, and now they are both requesting to sublet while they are gone, while my girlfriend's family lost out on about $1,600, and Breesa's father said if Sam (she owns the lease) does not allow them to sublet, they will most likely go to court. 

So... yeah. Anytime I go over there, I just do not say anything to Breesa or Angela. I mean, I just can't. I would go crazy on them, and tell them how insanely cruel they are. Thus, trying to be a good boyfriend, I have been trying to defend my girlfriend and advise her to not stick up for this shit (since unfortunately, Sam is kind of a pushover). This has led to countless arguments, since I just absolutely **hate** going to her apartment, because of her roommates. At one point during the summer, when I'd stay 3 nights a week since I work on campus, the two roommates said that I should start paying them for rent, since ""I stay there so much."" Needless to say, I don't go there anymore. 

So now, Sam lives across the state from me, 250 miles away. this whole summer, I've been working at an internship and working my ass off to find a Co-Op (I'm an engineering student). My grades sucked freshman year due to too much partying then, so I don't have much to show. I've put in countless weeks of 60+ hours programming, trying to better my skills. It has paid off luckily, and I found a co-op for the fall. But this has been really hurting our relationship. I was only able to go see her once, and it was right before I had a huge project due, so I hardly had time to have fun out there. She threw a fit over this, since she had no obligations at the time, and has continuously been calling me boring... Which I know this whole summer, I have been painfully boring. This brings me to the biggest problem lately.

I am basically more grown up than her. I don't mean that in an arrogant or belittling way. We are both the same age, but I am now at a company as a programmer, no little summer time job. I'm making the money to be completely independent and pay for my apartment, car, etc. I have had seriously no time for fun; the one 'fun time' I really had this summer was a 2 day trip to my best friend's lake trailer. So right now, my priorities are completely different than hers. She has never held a job, has gone on countless trips that her parents have funded, to NYC, Chicago, etc - hasn't even invited me... She still parties every weekend with her high school friends, and is fully dependent on everyone around her. I don't mean this in a disparaging way; that is completely okay that she does all of this. It is just different than my situation now, and it bothers me. It is the type of stuff I was doing right after I graduated high school. She insists that I am jealous that she goes to all of these places, since she and I fight when she goes on these countless trips. I personally don't care, since I am more focused on my future and setting up my job for out of college, so I can make the money to start a family. It just really hurts me that she goes on all of these trips without me, and doesn't even acknlowdge that she'd invite me if I wasn't busy.

So now, I told her all of this, and how I feel that all of the events of our relationship have stemmed from her family incident. Yeah, pretty damn fucking hard to say that without sounding like an asshole, but it's been two years since this has happened, and no one was even minorly injured in the event. She has been so over dramatic about everything lately, since her family is still a mess over this all and fights. She over exaggerates every fight with them, and every fight with us, making things so much worse than they have to be. I tell her that you just have to let go of things, or just deal with them. She knows that I know about this, since I've lived 20 years with my mother, who has deteriorated incredibly due to her very bad Schizophrenia. 

So, after telling Sam all of this stuff the other day, she says that she thinks she wants to break up with me. I told her that I am considering it too, and she has been off and on about breaking up with me since I came out there in July and was boring and 'wouldn't even swim with her.' So I advised that we shouldn't talk to each other until she gets back to school, which is Monday. In the meantime, we have just been doing our own thing and seeing what we want to do. Right now, I really just want to be with her, but with all of this drama and the fact that we have very different priorities right now, I just don't know what to think. I've gone through a very serious relationship before and had it end pretty badly, but I can't compare the most subtle thing  between the two here.

TL;DR :
me and girlfriend have been arguing a lot lately, since I have been over encumbered by engineering work to find a job. Her roommates are incredibly fake bitches; she accuses me of being boring, which is true for the time being; she is incredibly over dramatic; she still lives in the dependency stage on her parents, where I have just come out of that, and it's pretty weird to me.

I'm really sorry about the book of text here, and I'm sure i have jumped completely around the place... but please, I am really lost here and need some advice if I should stay with her or go... 

If there are any discrepancies above, let me know, and I'll try to point out what I meant, since I probably wrote this up too quickly.

What I thought was a good deed in the beginning sure bit me in the ass. My gut knew the moment I told him I'd refer him, I'd regret it. Oh well it's too late now.

He's now working there making friends with my old coworkers while I'm at home unemployed. The motherfucker never expressed any gratitude whatsoever and had the decency to tell me to my face that he thinks I can't go back to work at my old company? (because of my past situation) What the fuck do you know? 

We use to hangout a lot. When I was working there and he was looking for a job, at least I still called you up to grab dinner. Nope not this guy. I'm like a fucking nobody to this guy anymore. Glad you're making new friends and hanging out with them now. And don't give me that bullshit like you're busy, you fucking intern. I know exactly what you do at work. In the rare chance that we did get dinner, he still wanted me to pay for his dinner because he had no money. I'M FUCKING UNEMPLOYED. His excuse was that he didn't have enough money because he just started working there and that I worked there for over a year, so I must have saved enough money.

I was that person that happened to be your friend because we were bored and had no one else to hangout with in this boring ass town, right? Things have been falling on your lap your whole life, and the moment you get the opportunity of something new, you forget about those that helped you get there. Great to know that I was your stepping stone to get you out of your pathetic life. I'm done helping you.

2ea46v,4,2014-08-22,I[22M] have a huge crush on her [20F] and I'm clueless as to what to do,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2ea46v/i22m_have_a_huge_crush_on_her_20f_and_im_clueless/,"Hello, and thanks for taking the time to read this. I'll start of with a little background, with as much detail as possible, and sorry if this is painfully long. Side note: I've been friendzoned a lot and actually have never had a girlfriend.

I [22M] met this girl [20F] at work (a banquet hall) and I was pretty much attracted to her immediately, which never really happens. The funny thing is she wasn't even working that day; she just came in to give something to her sister who was training me since it was my first day. For the like 30 seconds I saw her I was practically crazy about her. Now it starts off like any new job, I'm kinda shy around everyone but after a few weeks I start acting like myself around there and seem to be well-liked by everyone. Now this is where I naturally start to talk to her more as well, not about anything too serious, usually school and stuff like that.

Nothing really happens up until last weekend, but I'll get to that shortly. Since the first day we actually worked together we would always give each other a hard time, in a joking (maybe even a flirty way, I don't know, I'm not good with that stuff) way, and we would talk about other things. Some examples are whenever I'd come in to work she'd say something like ""Ugghh what are you doing here!?"" or something like that, but never in a serious way. Whenever one of us needed help with something we would always help each other out first and then joke about the other person's incompetence.

So this goes on for a while, we don't usually work together that often but when we do it's always a fun time. Last weekend we worked together basically all day Saturday. Now this is where I decide I need to make a move for two reasons. 1) I really like her and 2) she's leaving to go to school Saturday, but it's only about 45 mins away, so it's not that big of a distance. We probably won't be working together again for a while, possibly until next summer, so I figured that even if I got a straight up no, I'd be fine. But that last day we worked together was great, I got her to laugh a lot, we teased each other like normal (she said ""ugh I can't believe I have to work with you on my last day!""), and she was pretty clumsy that day. Not sure if being clumsy is relevant but it sure was funny, but I've heard that sometimes girls are clumsy because they're nervous. A good example of that was when she was turning a table and she walked right into a podium and we both started laughing like crazy. Pretty much everything she did that was embarrassing that day she did in front of me and even said that to me too. Now getting her to laugh seemed just too easy that day, and I basically got her to crack up by just making a face when another co-worker said something I wasn't to thrilled about. She also asked me what school I went to, even though after I said what school she said ""I knew that, I don't know why I asked you that..."" so I don't know if that means anything. Also if we were walking past each other she would touch my arm or something like that, it's kinda hard to explain.

So after work that day all I think about is her and what I could do to make something happen. So since we're friends on facebook I send her a message late Sunday night but she doesn’t reply until Monday morning, which is fine she was probably sleeping. Now here is where I decide I don't have time for games so in an exchange of a few messages I ask her if she wanted to go to the mall with me on Wednesday (this past Wednesday), she said something along the lines that she has to make sure she's not doing anything and says text me and leaves me her number. So I think awesome and then I text her just so she has my number. There was only an exchange of 8 mesasges, 4 from me, 4 from her. Nothing else for Monday or Tuesday.

Wednesday rolls around and I'm pretty nervous all day, and I sent her a text to make sure our plans are good. She says yeah and we text back and forth for a bit while I'm at my other job (summer internship) and then I ask her if she wants to meet there or for me to pick her up, and she said if I don't mind I could pick her up, I say yeah no problem and then she gives me her address.

All of a sudden I was no longer nervous, like for some reason I felt like I was going to go pick-up someone I knew my whole life. So I get to her house and knock on her door and her sister (whom I work with) answers the door, doesn't seem surprised to see me, but happy and then her sister comes out and we go on our way. Now I'm not sure if this would be considered a date or not, but we went to the mall (I needed new shoes and that was my excuse for going there) and we talk the entire time, definitely not a one sided conversation either. We were both laughing quite a bit too and we even made fun of some of the people we work with.

So we go through like 2 or 3 stores and I find a pair of shoes that look good and she agrees they're nice so I buy them and we walk back to my car. When we get in my car I asked if she was hungry and wanted some dinner and she agreed so I drove to some random place we both knew of. Dinner was good, there was a lot of talking and laughing and then she mentioned she remembered the first time she saw me at work, which might not seem important but I don't know. We sat there for a long time, even after we were done eating and the bill was all paid (I paid) and we were just sitting there talking and laughing, there wasn't one silent moment either. I couldn’t tell if she wanted to leave but was just being nice and continued the conversation or if she actually enjoyed just sitting there talking to me.

So I drive her home and we talk the whole way home, again not a single silent moment, and I drop her off and she said thanks for dinner, said something about my new shoes, tells me to text her later, and then got out of my car and went inside. Now I don't know if I should've tried to make a move (just a kiss, nothing too crazy now) or anything but it seemed like she got out of my car fairly quick. We ended up being out for like 3 and a half hours, and by the time I got home it was just about 10 and I have to be up early for work (She knows that I'm up early) and I'm just about to head off to bed. I set my phone to silent, not vibrate, and I make sure my alarm is set for the morning and start to doze off but something weird happened. I was practically asleep and at quarter to 11 I shot my eyes open, I have no idea why but suddenly I was wide awake and I decide to check my phone and I have a text from her saying ""Thanks again for tonight!"" and the time on it was from one minute ago! I was pretty happy about that, so I said no problem and that I had a good time and that we should do it again soon, and she says ""Yeah definitely!"" and I eventually fall asleep.

But I might have made a mistake here. I text her Thursday(the next day) asking her about how the babysitting is going (She had to watch her little siblings and someone else’s 2 kids) and we text back and forth for a while and I decided it was such a smart idea to ask her to lunch for today (I have to work right after work so the last time I would see her before she left would only be today) Now I'm afraid I might have come across as too strong. She literally texts me back an hour later saying sorry and that she just dropped off all the kids and said she wishes she could but is busy packing and putting something together for a wedding with her friend. I say okay and its fine and I figured the conversation was just about over but then she asks me about work and we end up texting for another few hours.

Few notes about the texting... She likes to use haha a lot and sometimes throws in a lol with it. Also she used 3 :) faces, once was when we were talking about our boss and that he's a really cool dude, once when I said I'd pick her up she said thanks, had a smiley face and then gave her address, and the last one was just last night when we were texting and I asked if she knew anyone goin to the school she's going to (She's a junior but she transferred to this school and this will be her first semester there) and she said ""yeah"" and I said ""well that's good"" and then she sent a :) with nothing else. Not sure if that means anything but I sent one back also and that was the end of the conversation last night.

I know I could wait and see how it all plays out but I’m very pessimistic about myself and I pretty much always think the worst will happen, which probably isn’t good. Thanks for reading this, I know it was really long but I have just a few questions as well:

1. How do I stay out of the friendzone?

2. Do you think I’m in danger of entering the friendzone?

3. What should I do since she won't be in town as often now? (It seems that she is pretty willing to come back though)

4. Did I screw up by asking her to lunch?

5. Was what we did Wednesday a date?

6. Should I offer to come visit her at school?

Thanks for taking your time to read this!!! Also; I used a throwaway even though this is really detailed, just in case since I'm not sure if she goes on Reddit at all.

I had been on and off with my ex (Mark) since highschool. We did not have a healthy relationship at all and he has been on and off addicted to opiates throughout our relationship. I had become so unhappy that I knew it was time for me to break it off for good. I was afraid and on the fence about breaking up for awhile, I realized I was just waiting for him to do something fucked up. Well as usual, he did. I was over him and our relationship. I began to do things for myself and adjust to begin single. He is really good at manipulating me, since I do care about him and i was in love with him. He also has a history of blowing up my phone and threatening me. (EX: A student at our uni murdered his ex and her new boyfriend last year. The student then killed himself. After this incident happened I received a text from him saying ""Don't worry if your have guys over, luckily I dont have a gun"") To prevent any communication and to distance myself I blocked his number and blocked him on social media. 

  Fast forward about a month and half to 2 days ago. I had no contact and have been having so much fun with my friends and being single. Mark had left one of his bikes at my house before we broke up. I kept it in my garage and was eventually going to have one of his friends come and get it or something. I just needed some space and I didn't want to coordinate with him or his friends. Well, 2 days ago I was taking a nap after my internship and when I woke up I have a long text from him off a friends phone. The message is full of typos and is written like he was fucked up, I would understand if it was the middle of the night but it was 8pm. In the message he said we needed to exchanged stuff (his bike), that he 'loved me' and that he just needed to talk to me 'one last time'. I decided not to respond and think about what I wanted to do. I went to outside to my car and I noticed I had left the front door unlocked during my nap. I didn't think too much of it until I opened the garage to notice that his bike was gone out of the garage but garage had been locked. I had just check the air in the tires that afternoon. We also have 3 other bikes in the garage that were still there. I checked with my roommates to make sure no one came by to get it but they work all day too and said that no one came by. So the only conclusion I can come to is that some one CAME INTO MY HOUSE and got the bike.

  I was still freaked out yesterday but brushed it off and tried not to think about it. I was exhausted and decided to go to bed early. My phone kept going off while I was sleeping but I just pushed it off the bed. When I woke up I had 8 missed calls from jail. I checked the public records and sure enough my ex got arrested with 3 of his friends last night for criminal trespassing. I just wish I knew where they were trespassing. 

   I don't know what to do because it seems like he might be doing drugs again and he is very unpredictable. I am afraid he is going to come to my house or something. One of the friends he was with has access to illegal guns and I know they go out and shoot them. At this point it feels like he will never be fully of of my life and he won't let me be. Does anyone have any advice on what my next move should be?


TL;DR: My ex has a history of drugs and threats. 2 days ago his bike went missing out of my garage while I was taking a nap and he called me 8 times from jail last night for criminal trespassing. After already blocking his number and all other forms of communication, it feels like he wont leave me alone. "
2eaoiw,1,2014-08-22,Getting back together with a girl [20F] I [22M] dated after a summer apart -- is it worth it?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2eaoiw/getting_back_together_with_a_girl_20f_i_22m_dated/,"(X-post with r/askmen)

For a month before my college graduation in May, before I (22M) moved home for the summer, I dated a girl (20F) who I found out had a very long crush on me. From the first date, we clicked and shared a very fun, intimate month together. At the end, we agreed that long-distance relationship at that moment was too much for both of us. She went back to her home country for the summer, and I went home for an internship.

Over the summer, we communicated one to three times a week. At first, we talked very frequently because we just split apart, but we naturally slowed down the frequency. There would be times where we go a week or two without talking. She's not someone very active on social media; she goes on Facebook a couple of times a day for a couple of minutes and takes days to respond sometimes. She hasn't uploaded a photo of herself since February on Facebook. She has no Twitter, LinkedIn, or Instagram. (Maybe the onus is more on my personality: I am pretty active on social media and good about getting back ASAP.)

Summer's nearing its end, and she is coming back to school soon. And I am moving back near my college town too. My internship didn't translate to a full-time job as I hoped, and I had some personal problems back home. I decided to head back and look for a job there using the networks of mentors and professors I built during my college years. I'll be crashing at my friend's place for the time being until I settle down. I told her about I'm coming back and said I hoped to meet her again, and she said that sounds like a plan.

I'm very excited to see my friends and colleagues again, but when I think about her, my heart flutters still. I think I have a crush on the girl that had a crush on me. I think she's fun and wonderful, and if she is still down, I want to rekindle things slowly but surely. I went on a couple of dates this summer to get her out of my mind, but it fell flat. But considering the drop in communication between her and I and the flux in my life, I don't know if it's still worth it. I don't know if she moved on. Since I am no longer a college student, maybe I should move on from a college girl.

1) Is it worth checking up with her on dating again? Do you think she might have moved on? So far in my life, when I ended a relationship, I never looked back. But our ""break-up"" was a logistical one due to distance, not emotional, and that's a first for me. Whether it is worth it or not, I probably would still ask her out -- because that's the only way to get a clear answer -- but I wanted some opinions.

2) Should I take it slow (find a place, find a job, settle down, and ask her out again) or quick (ask her out again while settling down) in reaching out to her?

3) Should I try to initiating more conversations before meeting her in person? I've never been one for text-based communications with girls. I just let it come naturally, and it may have led to a decrease in interactions with her.

**tl;dr**: Girl and I broke up due to distance, more or less stopped talking over summer, I'm moving back up to where she lives again and want to date her again and wonders if it's worth asking her out again."

2eashm,43,2014-08-22,No privacy. Ever. (rant) / [support],playedinspace,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/2eashm/no_privacy_ever_rant_support/,"Context: 20 year old SG DoNM here. I go to college across the country from my mother and see her very rarely, but for the few weeks between the end of my summer internship and the start of classes, I've been stuck with her.

I'm currently at my grandparents' vacation home with my mother and SO (20M) and my mother just did something that I haven't had to deal with in a really long time. I'm shaking a little bit.

When I was living with her, there was a rule that essentially amounted to ""no privacy"" in our house. It was just me, my older sister (the GC) and her after my father left when I was 8, so her justification was that it was ""all girls in the house, so we didn't have anything to hide."" That rule meant no locks, ever—there were no locks on our bedroom doors, and we were explicitly not allowed to lock the bathroom doors.

This started being an issue for me when puberty started, and my NMom became OBSESSED with my body. There's a whole host of issues that came along with this; she would insist on ""supervising"" me when I shaved my legs, she forced me to use an electric trimmer to get rid of my arm hair because it was ""disgusting"" and ""everybody"" got rid of their arm hair (as an already bullied middle schooler, when my ""friends"" noticed this I got mocked. A lot.). But by far the worst was the complete and constant invasion of my privacy.

She started ALWAYS having to do something when I was in the shower (I shared the en-suite master bathroom with her, my sister got her own bathroom). She would often just go through drawers full of crap or pick at her makeup instead of actually doing anything, and then she would stand right in front of the shower (glass doors, not a curtain) and chat with me about nothing. And make comments about my body. When I'd go to my room to get dressed, I wasn't allowed to close the door and she would stand in the hallway until she heard me start to change and then come in and again make conversation about absolutely nothing or just sit on my bed and stare. And make more comments about my body.

As I got older it made me more and more uncomfortable. She had basically destroyed my self-esteem at this point by staring at my naked body constantly and telling me about all the places where I was fat or less attractive than my sister in some way or another, or commenting on how unnaturally large my breasts are, and I started really just wanting privacy. So I locked the door one time when I showered, just to try it. She was furious, and kept asking me what I was trying to hard from her. By the time I was sixteen I basically would only shower when she wasn't awake or wasn't home. It got to the point where I was scared of her coming in. It still scares me. Whenever I lock a door, I triple check it because I'm afraid of someone bursting in. It was fucking creepy for a grown woman to be staring at her daughter's body in that way. (A side note—I don't think a family being comfortable with their bodies around each other is a bad thing, but she MADE it a bad thing for me. She was creepy about it. Really, really, really creepy.)

Fast forward to today. Like I mentioned, I'm with her for a few days, and my boyfriend is here. As usual, I'm sharing a bathroom with her, my boyfriend is using the second bathroom upstairs, and there's a third bathroom downstairs. I was taking a shower when she started banging on the door, telling me to let her in because she had to use the bathroom. I told her I was almost done and she should just wait, but about thirty seconds later she started yelling again, saying she had to go right then. I told her I was taking a shower and to use one of the other bathrooms, and that was when she just lost it. She said she couldn't use the other upstairs bathroom because my boyfriend had been using it these past few days and it's ""gross"" to share a bathroom with a boy, and she couldn't use the downstairs bathroom because my boyfriend was downstairs. I told her that was ridiculous and she started screaming that the shower I was using was in ""her bathroom and she should be able to use it whenever she wanted."" I eventually just started ignoring her and she left but holy shit, she's so mad and I'm so scared I'm just hiding in my room right now and I feel like a little kid. Why is it so unreasonable to ask for privacy? Why? Why can't my body be my own and not hers? I hate it. I hate it I hate it I hate it and I'm still fucking afraid of her.









**tl;dr my mother is weirdly obsessed with seeing me naked**

I'm sorry for the huge wall of text but just...this is the worst thing I've had to deal with from her in a while and it brought back a lot of bad memories. Does anyone else have experience with Ns completely disregarding individual privacy? Advice? Just want to chat?"

My only prior experience had been IT101, which taught me *very* basic html, so I had no idea what I was doing from the start. 

To make things easier, the company gave me a subscription to Adobe CC, and after weeks of reading articles and watching tutorials, I have a rough mock up having used both Muse and Dreamweaver. In the past week or so I was playing around with Edge Animate, and I fell in love with its capabilities. It's running very smoothly now, but I only have two panels (1400 x 500, about 30s long with triggers and HQ images). If possible, I'd like to have a page with 8 animated panels, some with high quality images, but I have some concerns with stability, especially on phones/tablets. 

So here's my question(s): how much should I limit my use of Edge/.oam files? I don't want to spend time making a bunch of animations if the browser won't be able to handle them. Should I cut back on mobile/tablets? Are there more stable alternatives? (Flash, maybe?) and what are the benefits/pitfalls of using said alternatives?

She has always worked hard to make our household a home. She has sacrificed much to give me the comfortable life I have led. But, like any person, she has her flaws and rough sides that can make life with her difficult at times.* 

For the last 6 months, I have been working to improve myself as a person physically and mentally. Thus far, I've managed to drop 90lbs and aim to drop another 15lbs (Currently 180lbs, aiming for 165lbs). I did this not only for health reasons, but also because I wanted to finally stop hating my body. There have been hard times, but it has been a rewarding journey. While I still have a lot to learn at 20 years old, I feel like I'm finally making good progress towards becoming an independent man. I'm a constant work in progress and I've been fortunate enough to have found close friends and and a woman who understand as well as accept that aspect of my personality.

Having been raised mostly by my mother (Father spent a lot of time traveling abroad), I expected her to be happy for my recent accomplishments and overall increase in satisfaction with life. As I've been discovering these last few days, I was quite wrong.

Due to my major, I alternate between work semesters and education semesters. This summer was an education semester and I spent all three months of it on campus. I go to school out of state and I'm not able to go back home easily (8 hours driving/1 hour flight). It's not bad though because I have a nice social life that keeps me active and entertained. Overall, it was a fun summer with a lot of positive events; I started dating a wonderful woman, I got the internship I set my sights on, and I'm finally learning to be happy with my body (Healthy lifestyles will do that to you). However, I miss home often and decided to take a two week break before I started my internship to see friends and family I hadn't been able to see in the last 6 months.

Unfortunately, two days before I flew back, one of my two dogs died. In my family, my dogs are members of the family. Both were adopted and they were my closest friends growing up. Losing Nessa was heartbreaking especially because I hadn't been able to see her one last time (Put her down because of a cancer). Flying back home was a bittersweet event. I know my mom took the death especially hard because the dogs are like children to her since I've gone off to college. 

Not even a two days after I arrived, my mother exploded on me. She

Okay, so I woke up in my bed just a few minutes ago with no recollection of how I got back here, turned my laptop on that luckily survived the events of the night before and have started typing this latest addition. I can't recall anything after passing out yesterday...or I guess its still today. I'm really turned around because It's I know it's been a full day and night since I last updated and so much has happened but my computer calendar, reddit, and everything else is claiming its still 8/22/2014 which is only two days after my first visit to **[5,433 Cubits and 2 Palms Tower]**. That shouldn't be possible!

So before I get into things, I need to thank user kamafr for deciphering the text on my last entry. After looking back over the article I noticed that wherever I tried to type a formal noun of any kind like a friend's name or a location or whatever, something was changing the text. I don't know if my account got hacked or what. I hear about that happening way too often on posts like this to assume anything else but the text it changed to actually seems relevant. So yeah, here's what he found out: 
**[18 19 14 15    13 14 22.    5 8 13 3    19 7 4 18 4    22 14 17 3 18    0 13 3    8    18 7 0 11 11    5 8 13 3    24 14 20,    18 15 4 0 10    19 7 4 18 4    22 14 17 3 18    0 13 3    8    18 7 0 11 11    5 8 13 3    24 14 20    18 14 14 13 4 17.    2 11 14 0 10 4 3    8 13    18 10 8 13,    8    18 19 4 0 11    0 22 0 24    8 13 19 14    24 14 20 17    17 14 14 12    0 13 3    2 20 19    24 14 20 17    19 14 13 6 20 4    5 17 14 12    24 14 20 17    19 7 17 14 0 19    0 13 3    15 20 19    24 14 20    8 13    19 7 4    15 8 19    22 8 19 7    19 7 4    14 19 7 4 17 18.    3 14    13 14 19    18 4 4 10    19 7 4    19 17 20 19 7.]**

So basically **[5,433 Cubits and 2 Palms Tower]** is actually **[G + R 11:4-9]**. Before the events of this last week, this wouldn't have seemed possible to me but now I really think it's true.

I'm about to show you the pages I wrote before and during my most recent visit to the tower. I know you're not going to believe any of it and I know I have trouble with it myself, but this is the only place I know where someone out there might find some semblance of truth and take it as a warning. I've been shaking like crazy the whole time I'm writing this because the things I saw just weren't possible and I don't exactly know why I'm still alive. Something is happening and I think you all need to be ready for it. Nobody nearby seems to notice it like I do but maybe whatever's affecting them hasn't reached any of you yet. Let's get started

5:30 PM 8/22/2014

UPDATE! Holy fuck update! So it was my last day at this internship before starting back up the fall semester and I wanted one last picture of the place to remind me how kick ass this job was. I went up to our lounge room on the 6th floor and decided to take a nice shot of the fireplace with our sunny little balcony in the background. The view was kind of bleh since there was more construction in the background here as well (like I needed another reminder) but I didn't care because it was still a really cool place. I noticed that the lighting was really bad in the first pic I took, as you can see here: [work photo 1](http://i.imgur.com/n6epR1B.jpg)

So I decided to take another shot. Here's the picture: [work photo 2](http://i.imgur.com/hRiioJ4.jpg)

I had to do a double take to make sure I wasn't seeing things. There's no way it could be there! My apartment is very far south of where I work and the balcony faces the north side. Then I looked even closer. My apartment complex was suddenly to the left of the building. In the time it took me to take a single photo, the layout of several key parts of the city have changed. From what I can tell, just the central area of my apartment complex has moved to the northern lot of town along with that...that thing. That awful, awful tower! I don't even know what happened to what was there before it. I know I went to school with a girl that lived up in that area and I hope to god she's okay. I screamed at my coworkers to look and they all thought I was crazy like it had just been there the whole time. Not a single person realized what had happened or even that the building was never there to begin with. I began to wonder why was I able to remember where it used to be? Or more-so, why did it let me remember? Why is it following me?

I'm going to head home from work and update you all on my plan of action. I should just escape while I can, I've got nobody to turn to anyway. The cops would think I was crazy, and my friends aren't any better about helping me in a pinch. Ugh, I wish **[6120736176656420736f756c]** was still around. He was the only friend I had that always had my back. I don't want to get all sappy so I'll just say he isn't with us anymore. Ugh, I need to stop thinking for awhile. Be back later.

8:00 PM 8/22/2014

I'd been pacing the room for the last couple hours trying to decide if I'm going to go in there and if I do, how do I log everything. I caved and decided to go. I was also going to go with my original plan of bringing my laptop with me to type stuff down while I'm there. I really don't want to sit in that fucking building for any length of time, but I know if something happens, at least my text will be out there. There's a chance somebody might find it someday and do something with it and I need to take that chance. I decided to pack for extreme circumstances. I'm not some idiot in a horror movie, this is real and I'm not about to make any dumb decisions. I gathered together plenty of food in case I somehow got trapped (I mean the building was unfinished), a flashlight with extra batteries, my laptop, an extra battery for my laptop, a camera, my phone, a few basic tools (big fucking hammer, screwdriver, etc.), plenty of rope and a knife from the kitchen. I hope I wouldn't need it but I'm being cautious. This is it, there's nothing more to it. I'm going. I'll post another update later.

10:00 PM 8/22/2014
I made it in to the basement. The gate was still unlocked although this time much harder to swing open as if it were rusted over. On my way in, I was worried that whatever I saw last time would be back again but so far I haven't seen anything. The light in the back room was still on, flickering a little, and what it lit up was just a storage area for cement mixers, some tools, and a bunch of unmarked boxes. Possibly one of the boxes that fell and made that ungodly distant echo. The strange thing this time around though was that every sound I made seemed stiff and compressed without a single echo at all. The air was stale and hot as though I'd been sitting in a smaller room for a long time with the door closed. Beyond here was a hallway that lead into a series of other hallways all musty and unfinished but still dimly lit. Perhaps they kept the lights on at night as a safety protocol? I dunno. I walked down the halls for a bit and here are some phone pics of what I saw: [basement photo 1](http://i.imgur.com/mYX066Z.jpg) [basement photo 2](http://i.imgur.com/mJx7oPQ.jpg)

The interior looked really beat up for having been a new building but I've never worked in construction so I have no idea what unfinished buildings are supposed to look like. Sorry for the poor picture quality, by the way. I wasn't ready to pull out my nicer camera yet since it has a pretty short battery life and I think I'll save that for whatever I find higher up. I managed to find a staircase and I've decided to take a break to write this out before I continue up. As I'm typing this I keep hearing creaks in the metal above. I'm hoping it's just the wind. Another update coming.

10:49 PM 8/22/2014

I can't believe it's taken me 45 minutes to get up these stairs, and I'm still not done! I wasn't counting floors or anything but there's no way I'm not up to the top by now! I had to take a break because I'm so out of breath so I decided to make an update. There isn't much light up here anymore and my flash is wigging out so I had to take a night vision shot on my camera: [Elevator shaft stairs](http://i.imgur.com/flA0INc.jpg)

 I can't even see the bottom anymore. It's getting pretty cold up here too and I think it started storming outside because I keep hearing these booming sounds all up and down the stairs. I have to keep going though, I won't be satisfied until I get to the top. I really hope there's an answer waiting for me there.

12:11 AM 8/23/2014

This is impossible. I haven't seen any windows so I have no way of knowing but this is definitely impossible. I'm still climbing the stairs. I'm scared out of my mind because I know I've gone up at least 20, 30, maybe even 40 or 50 floors and that tower had to be 15 floors tops. I'm so tired and so cold and nothing makes any sense. I'm going to go a little further and if I don't find something soon I need to head back. I can already tell my sanity must be slipping because the giant mountain-sized echoes are coming back and they get a little louder with every step I take. I've also started seeing movement in the stairs below when I peer over the edge. I could just barely make out some features but it almost looked like **[18 15 8 11 11    19 7 4 8 17    1 11 14 14 3    14 13    19 7 4    18 19 0 8 17 18.    4 21 4 17 24 14 13 4.]** with grinning teeth. I know it's just my mind playing tricks on me but I'm going to start going again because the longer I stay here the worse the illusions get.

12:30 AM 8/23/2014

I just reached...whatever floor I reached, and it's different. Not by much, but it's different. The floor extends a little beyond the square area of the staircase into a small room in the corner. There isn't much in here besides some very old wires and a pile of junk on the floor. I got the flash working again on my camera so I took a picture: 
[extra room](http://i.imgur.com/kXLXAW6.jpg)

As you can see, the structure of the room doesn't really match the rest of the building architecture. It's all made with brick and looks far too old to have just been built. Stranger yet is a folder in the pile of junk on the floor. It's dated 2/11/95 so this file is 19 years old. It's possible that this junk was just brought up here for whatever reason but that still doesn't explain how old everything looks. Something isn't adding up and I need to find out what that something is. I need to keep going because even as I type I can feel eyes watching me like the walls are alive or something. I almost thought I heard someone say **[8    2 0 13    18 4 4    24 14 20    19 7 17 14 20 6 7    19 7 4    18 2 17 4 4 13.    19 7 4    20 13 2 14 13 5 20 18 4 3    0 17 4    5 8 17 18 19    19 14    5 0 11 11.]** If I don't make it to the top quickly I'm going to have a mental break down.

2:45 AM 8/23/2014

I finally made it to the top and it's so much bigger than anything I've ever seen. There's so many corridors leading on and on forever. Some of the rooms I don't even want to walk in to because they don't look like they end. The walls are covered in **[6 20 19    24 14 20    20 13 19 8 11    24 14 20    18 19 14 15    18 2 17 4 0 12 8 13 6]** and it just keeps going on like that from wall to wall. I can't imagine how any of this even got here. It's so hard to type with all the ringing from that echoing. The echo just keeps going and doesn't ever stop. I think the thing is catching up, I can smell **[0    13 4 22    11 14 17 3    7 0 18    17 8 18 4 13] getting stronger. I'm going to walk and type.

And that's the last saved update I could find on my laptop. I don't even remember writing that last entry at all or even if I ever really got to the top. I blacked out and suddenly woke up in my bed. I don't know what any of this means but if it coincides with what was deciphered from my first entry on reddit, then there isn't much time left. I don't know what to do or how I can stop any of this. This is above me. This is above all of us. I don't know if I have the will to try going back to **[5,433 Cubits and 2 Palms Tower]** but I need to make a decision soon because I can still hear the echo even now. It's **[coming for everyone]** and I can't stop it."
2ec572,5,2014-08-22,I [24M] can't get over an online relationship with her [21F].,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2ec572/i_24m_cant_get_over_an_online_relationship_with/,"No throwaway because no shame; I don't give a fuck and she doesn't reddit so that's okay.

My apologies for the long story, I haven't been able to tell anyone the whole story, so I just wanted to get it out. It's a bit unconventional I'd say, pretty 2014 and beyond.

To start: I'm a very introverted person, in contrast with the rest of my family and also 'Her'.

Anyway, we met online and after some weeks of talking and finally seeing each other on cam. We rolled from online friends into an online relationship (we both viewed it as such), pretty much skyping, texting, talking, sending pictures.. you name it, every day for about three months. I've never had a girlfriend but at this point viewed her as such, the physical part to come would only be a bonus in my eyes (I'm not a virgin, but that's another story, it was just sex) I cared enough about her without it. It seemed mutual (you can feel it coming, I know). We did cyber (on the phone) regularly (TMI sorry) and it all just seemed perfect really. I (think I) was in love.

We were planning on meeting up and had a date planned when my exams were over during the summer holiday (approx. 4 hour distance), after some quiet nights from her side, she then - out of the fucking blue - tells me she's been flirting with a 'friend' of mine (also online, knew this guy for about a year at that point as we played the same game, in the same group of people even, confided in him when things went south in real life and also on 'bad' days with her). 

As I said, she was my first 'intimate' contact, I didn't know how to deal with this new situation and handled more out of emotion than logic in my next action.

I ended up forgiving them both after promises, crying and explanations from both. I felt that I either give them both a second chance, or I cut them both off. No picking sides as they both hurt me.

Things are good after that night for a week or two. She said she partially felt that I was too present (daily Skype/talks) and it overwhelmed her (no experience from my side coming in to play I suppose) and I tried to adjust as I found it to be true and like I said: did not want to lose her. I realize now I put her on a pedestal and she could only really look down on me from there.

After that talk though, I feel that it is something the two of us can work with and get over soon. I even go back to talking a lot with said friend.

Few weeks later she ends up breaking it off with me as she feels that she cant have a relationship with me. Obviously in shock, we were still 'recovering' I try to explain what she means to me and try to win her back with all my heart could give I. She wouldn't have it. Said she really cared for me, but didnt believe she could do this relationship. We end up agreeing to stay friends (I valued her friendship more than the potential gf idea, which is how we got to meet in the first place) after a lot of hesitation from my side. I wasn't over her, but I didn't want to lose her completely.

Fast forward another two weeks and on my birthday I find out she's still talking to (and in the mean time has actually met up) with 'the friend' (who lives quite far away as well). I felt betrayed, cheated on and enraged.

I, half intoxicated due to my birthday, tell her she's a liar, pathetic and 'seriously fucking disgusts me'. This is also the start of NC (no contact for the newcomers). I wanted to message my 'friend' with some abuse in that state of mind, but he blocked me before I even got to it (kind of gives it away as well that they were still in contact). It hurt a lot but I believe it was the right thing to do (the NC, not my choice of words for which I feel a bit guilty).

Now that was two months ago. I don't know how I'm still thinking about her and the good times when I so vividly remember the bad. I try keeping my mind busy, but I can't beat it. The worst is when I go to bed and think 'hey, today I didnt think about her' and ofcourse that sets off my dumb-ass mind for a good nostalgia session.

I've lost motivation to work out (dropped from 3-4x to max 1x per week), I quit my job in between the first and second betrayal, as I felt it made me unhappy (still think it was the right decision, I thought about it before the relationship as well. I'm no longer excited about starting my internship, something I was really excited about or going abroad next year. Probably lost some weight as well, but haven't tracked it.

I believe my behavior is partially because I feel lonely and partially still because I'm heartbroken. I didn't mind being on my own before I met her, I still prefer it over being in groups, but now I crave that type of intimacy. It's like a reminder of what I could have. But I dont have the balls (read below) to go out and meet people.
Sometimes I literally (remember, 24M) cry myself to sleep because I lost two people I thought were really close to me, because of them betraying my trust, what is wrong with me?

It's been two months and secretly I still hope that one of them will reach out to me. Not necessarily so I can forgive them, but so I get the validation that they were in the wrong and they know it. Is that wrong of me? I feel guilty because of thinking like that.

I've started seeing a therapist about my social anxiety in real life situations (which is most likely why I haven't had an intimate relationship before) and depressed-like moods, but so far it's just been me talking as he probably still needs the fully story to 'help' me. 

I just wanted to get it all of my chest I suppose and hopefully get some feedback/ tips. I've never been this open before about this situation, so please don't crucify me. I've read other threads but sometimes, due to the nature of this relationship, I'm not sure if I'm 'allowed' to view it as cheating, what do you guys think? And how do I stop thinking about it..

Tl;dr: still hurting over online relationship which was also my first (should be an interesting full read though)."

1. I'm your celebrity stepmom you blackmail me, rape me or we have an affair

2. I'm a sexy celebrity of your choosing, you play my brothers/father who harass me and abuse me turning me into the family slut

3. Game of Thrones or Harry potter fanfiction roleplays

4. I'm your sexy celebrity mom, or older sister and i get continuously raped by your school bullies, or i have an affair with them!

5. I'm a sexy college girl on a vacation in Europe, i get kidnapped and turned into a sexual slut and sold to rich people

6. I'm a sexy intern you're my boss who blackmails me

7. I'm a sexy bimbo and we do some role on it!

8. I Spit on Your grave kinda scenario but i end up enjoying it and willingly participating

9. I'm the wife of one of your employees (so you're my husband's boss) you blackmail us and use me to your liking

10. I'm a sexy college girl working as a waitress at a bar and get harassed and abused by my boss/horny customers


I'm looking for a very specific type of role play: I want to be dominated by you mentally, knowing I have no other choice but to obey you, and getting no joy out of it, but I will do my best to please you and make you believe that I am into it.. ""I'm walking around the house in a tight thong and a bra like you requested, suddenly I feel you bending me over hard and ripping my thong off as you start spanking me hard, I wince in pain but don't dare complain as you start ramming your cock hard inside me until you shoot your cum deep inside my pussy..You smile then drag me to the couch where you lie down on your back, and I straddle you forcing a smile as I start riding you, my tits bouncing up and down as I lean down and kiss you passionately..In reality I can't stand what you've made me be, and I don't want to act like I'm into it, but I know if I dont put on a show I will be punished"". I want some role like that, where I'm forced to give in to your every wish, and act like I'm enjoying it but we both know my true feelings any other role you feel like suggesting ;)

2ed0t2,0,2014-08-23,Just ended 5yo LTR. Advice needed for turning ex into main plate.,[deleted],asktrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/2ed0t2/just_ended_5yo_ltr_advice_needed_for_turning_ex/,"So I [m/23] just ended my LTR with f/22 but want to keep her around until something better comes around.

A bit of context : she left in july for an internship and needless to say she wasn't on her best behaviour. She confessed to her 'adventures' and came home this weekend to talk it trough. I was seriously considering taking her back, alphaing up and go from there. 

Here's the kicker : while we were talking yesterday she laid a very important RP truth on me, straight from the horses mouth : ""Just the fact that i considered cheating make me question our relationship"". Roissy and Rollo made good points that you cannot stop a woman from cheating so it's best to just cut your losses early if you feel like you lost her.

After she told me this i knew it was a lost cause and told her to leave. *cry*sob*hamster* ""I just don't know what to do..."". I showed her the door and began dressing for a night out.

Now, your help is needed for turning her into my main plate. Is this even possible ? She will be going back to the internship until october when she comes back to finish her final college year. "
2edmmr,32,2014-08-23,Tips for Freshman - from a CSUF grad. (These tips can also be useful for any student),a_quick_glance,csuf,https://www.reddit.com/r/csuf/comments/2edmmr/tips_for_freshman_from_a_csuf_grad_these_tips_can/,"I wanted to give you guys some tips because there were so many things that I wish I had known during my freshman year. I have been looking at posts on here lately, and I never knew that you can take the bus for free by using your titan card. That would have been so useful to know. Feel free to give your own tips down below. 

1) At CSUF, [only 17% of students graduate within four years and only 53% graduate within six years.](http://www.fullerton.edu/analyticalstudies/degrees_grad/graduation_FTF.html) The sad truth is that most students don't study as much as they need to because they don't know how to study or make that transition from studying 3 hours to 20 hours a week. Many people flunk out of college or drop out because they didn't do any research about careers and they have no idea what to major in. Your school will have free resources to help you get the grades and research careers. Your school will offer free tutoring, you can visit your professors during their office hours and ask them for advice about how to study or you can ask them specific questions if you are confused about what you are learning, your school will have a [Learning Center](http://www.fullerton.edu/ulc/) with free handouts and workshops that will give you tips on how to study, they will have a [Writing Center](http://english.fullerton.edu/writing_center/) where someone will go over your essays with you and give you tips on how to improve your papers. Your school will also have a [Career Center](https://www.facebook.com/CSUFcareer) where you can meet with Career Counselors, attend workshops, they will look over your resume and cover letters and give you tips, they will have career fairs, they will have local job and internship postings. You can ask Career Counselors any questions that you may have. See Career Counselors a few times a year. 

2) If you want to get a 3.5, then you probably have to plan on being in class for about 15 hours a week and studying around 20+ hours a week. That is only 35 hours a week and is less than a full time job. If you need to study more than 20 hours, then adjust your schedule if you happen to get too many B's after your first tests. Sure, some people only need to study 15 hours a week but most people need to study more than that. You also may want to watch study advice videos on Youtube. Look up: ""how to get straight A's"", ""how to study"", ""how to take notes in college"", ""how to get good grades in college"" etc. It would also be a good idea to read articles about how to do well in school. During my last two years of school, I almost always studied over 25 hours a week to get the grades I wanted. 

3) I once watched a Zach Braff movie that mentioned that your grades in college don't matter - that is not true. Your grades matter very much because you want grad school to be an option for you. You are young, and you are not sure what you want right now. Later on you may figure out you want a career that requires you to attend grad school. Many Postgraduate programs will want you to have a 3.5 or above. 

Here are some examples of the average GPA's that are accepted for a few Postgraduate education programs:

* [3.52](http://www.apta.org/ProspectiveStudents/Admissions/PTProcess/) is the average accepted GPA for Physical Therapy programs 
* [3.8](http://slhs.sdsu.edu/programs/ma/admission-requirements/) is the average accepted GPA for SDSU's Speech, Language, and Hearing Sciences MA program
* [3.3](http://publichealth.sdsu.edu/programs/graduate/mph/environmental-health/admissions/) is the average accepted GPA for SDSU's Public Health program
 
4) See your professors during their office hours. I was very lucky to receive this advice from one of my professors on my very first day of college. He told us that your professors like when students come in to ask questions, that you should always make sure your professors know your name, and you should make sure to stop by and see all of your professors during their office hours even if it is just to introduce yourself and say ""hello."" I saw over 80% of my teachers during their office hours. It paid off tremendously. I got some great help and advice from them over the years, I sort of became friends with a couple of them, and I also received really great recommendation letters from them in case I decide to pursue grad school. 

5) Read the news. The news will discuss what careers will be in demand in the future. You can pick majors, join clubs, and get internships based on careers that will actually be in demand. 

6) Make sure to thoroughly research majors and careers before your sophomore year even starts. I'd say spend at least 30-40 hours researching careers before your sophomore year starts. 

7) Join clubs. I wanted to learn about social media, so I joined the [PRSSA](https://www.facebook.com/csufprssa). I was not a PR or Communications major. You can join any student organization you want, it doesn't matter what your major is. Joining the club was invaluable to me and it was the best decision I probably made while I was in college. 

* They have speakers that come in, who work in that particular field, and talk about their current job and past jobs, they give advice to students about how to prepare for life after graduation, they sometimes offer internships to the students in the clubs, they let you ask questions about their field. Hearing different people speak about different jobs and companies in the field that you want to work in helps you narrow down exactly what you want to do and what companies you want to work for. You are more prepared to go off on your own and understand the real world. 
* Clubs offer a lot of networking opportunities. My association hosted larger networking opportunities as well as some smaller networking opportunities as well. My favorite thing I did was go on a company tour to a tech company in Irvine and I got to ask the Social Media Director a ton of questions and I really picked her brain and I added her on LinkedIn. 

* My club actually had a member who went searching for internship postings for us, which was great because applying to internships isn't as stressful when everything is organized for you. 

* You get to chat with people who are interested in the same things you are and you can make friends.

8) Get internships. I think the only reason I have a job right now is because I had three internships while I was in college. 

9) Be nice, friendly, and charming. I have had my grades pushed up because I often participated in class and my professors liked me. 

10) Don't be afraid to go to community college. CSUF is so expensive. It's pretty stupid to go there if you don't receive any grants or scholarships. Spend you first two years, or three, at a community college. You will pay about $2,500 for parking passes because most people graduate after five years. I think parking passes are about $50-$100 a year at community colleges. Ugh, everything is so much cheaper at a CCC. 

**Extra Tips:**

1)There is a computer lab in the basement of McCarthy Hall that many students seem to not know about

2)There is a Trader Joe's off Imperial Hwy. You can get really tasty and cheap salads and sandwiches there. I also like their snack selection and I think their sushi is really good too. 

3) Like [CSUF on facebook](https://www.facebook.com/CSUFofficial) to learn about helpful and free workshops, free food, interesting opportunities etc. 

4) Don't be afraid to hang out with new people and try new things. Say ""yes"" to almost everything. 

5) Be nice. Offer to let people copy your notes. Buy an extra scantron in case someone forgets theirs. 

6) Use Google Drive to take notes and write papers. That way, you don't ever have to use flash drives. I have never owned a flash drive. Google Docs is just so convenient. 


Sorry for my grammar mistakes. I wrote this pretty quickly. Feel free to ask any questions or let me know if you want me to elaborate on anything. 

Here is a [Guide for Freshman](http://www.oswego.edu/academics/opportunities/honors/program/dowell.html) from SUNY Oswego. I think it is a very accurate and helpful guide.  

Edit: Spelling and general editing. Again, I apologize for any grammatical errors that I have made.

2edrtl,2,2014-08-23,"Hey Reddit, advice on dealing with depressed/unconfident friend[22m]?",[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2edrtl/hey_reddit_advice_on_dealing_with/,"I've never posted in this thread before, so I apologize if anything's off. Basically, I have a 22 year old male friend who I just don't know how to help anymore. I'm not sure if depressed is the right word, I don't remember if he was ever clinically diagnosed, but he has very low self esteem and motivation. He thinks he's this uninteresting, average joe type guy that no girl would ever be interested in. He lives with his parents, works a job in retail, despite having graduated from college earlier in the year. The biggest things that alarm me about him is his lack of self confidence, poor emotional control, blatant want for a girlfriend, nightmares, and an... I don't know an aloof attitude? 

He has very little self confidence. He's not an amazing looking guy by any means, but he's average. We've tried different looks, I've made tons of suggestions for him to try out a new hair cut, new clothes and such to maybe find his physical niche apart from jeans and video game shirts, but he hasn't done much to improve his attitude about himself apart from getting contacts. He doesn't think he's interesting or worth talking to, he's told me one of his biggest insecurities is that his package is small. I've tried telling him that when you feel better about yourself, other's will too. Feel good, look good kind of thing. 

Anytime he gets angry or upset, he doesn't really handle it well. He told me he was frustrated with something at work and went and kicked one of the shelves, will punch walls, bang his head up against things. We don't live in the same area, so I haven't witnessed any of it, but he'll send a message ""oh my hand hurts so bad"" and I'll reply asking why and his response is along the lines of ""i was mad so I punched the wall"". 

He almost seems to think that if he gets a girlfriend, everything in his life will miraculously fall into place. That he wont feel bad about himself, that he'll finally be happy, but he isn't the best with women and has very little relationship experience. 

He also has nightmares and bad dreams basically symbolizing how alone he feels on a nightly basis. Dreams like everyone else in a happy couple but him, dreams where some evil figure tells him he should kill himself, it's scary stuff. 

I'm no expert by any means. I have tried being supportive, I have tried giving him resources and advice to help figure out the root to his feelings, to boost that confidence, and so far there's been no real change in him over the past three years. Sometimes I wonder just how much he wants to change for the better. He says he does, but he takes little to no action to really do anything. He saw a therapist twice and stopped without a real reason. And when I bring up that he needs to see a professional, he insists it's a waste of his time that won't work. And I just don't know what to do anymore, what advice I can give, how I can help him. More recently, he was telling me about his dreams, I told him maybe he should see someone about it. He said there was no point, I made the comment that doing nothing, like he has been, hasn't been working for him and if he had any other ideas of things to try. He replied with ""i don't know besides the whole killing myself thing lol xD"". I told him that wasn't funny, he's made morbid jokes like that a few times over the years. 

I don't know if he seriously does have a huge depression problem and is just unmotivated. He works, goes out with his friends on occasion, really into the gaming scene and his music, but he says none of that really brings him any happiness at all. Any advice or insight you have at all is greatly appreciated, feel free to ask for specifics or details. What else can I do for him? 

EDIT: We were talking and I just asked him what's wrong with him/his life that he isn't pleased with and this was his answer: ""I'm tired of my job but have not been able to get a better one. I feel like every time I play the guitar or write a song, I lack creativity and that I suck. I'm tired of feeling like a failure and a disgrace in the eyes of my parents. I'm tired of doing things for other people because I can't say no and that if I do things for people my existence will be justified. And I feel really, really lonely most days."" I don't really think it has anything to do with pent up feelings for me. Maybe just a guy who's been down for the past three years? Like I said, he mentions and complains about these aspects of his life... but really doesn't take the initiative to change it. Like the job thing, for instance, he wants this lucrative job in business, which he's barely passed and I don't think is very interested in, or a good internship but he has zero experience to support it. So I told him to go apply for smaller jobs and unpaid internships to put his foot in the door and he seemed really reluctant and against it, but eventually said he'd start looking. "
2edvko,1,2014-08-23,I want to make a talkshow for Dota 2 and could use your help!,GrandPyromania,DotA2,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/2edvko/i_want_to_make_a_talkshow_for_dota_2_and_could/,"Hi! 

My name is Jay and I've tried before to get a general understanding and feeling of the community's desire to get a sort of talkshow/podcast thing going and unfortunately wasn't met with much of a response. I'm going to make another attempt at this, because I believe that the community needs something like this on a consistent basis. 

Basically, I'm hoping to host a talk show/podcast sort of thing, focused on all things Dota. I've noticed that most of the popular shows that focus on these are run by the casters, who while bring amazing content forward, have to focus on the sheer amount of tournaments and other things that make hosting such a show hard to schedule. I think that an extremely consistent show would be helpful and beneficial to the community, in not only informing people who would otherwise miss out on the information when it first hits but also help spotlight many of the amazing professional players/casters/personalities that have a limited window to showcase the fact that they too are people and to have us learn about them. I want to focus on showcasing Dota 2 in an informational, positive way. For example if there is drama afoot in the community, I would aim to not present any of the parties involved (be it a pro player, a caster, or Reddit itself) in a negative light, but instead, focus on the situation itself, getting all the facts across, and letting the viewer/listener make their own decision that hopefully would not be influenced by my personal opinion, only by my presentation of it. However, news is not the only thing we’ll discuss of course. As I stated earlier, I would absolutely be delighted to have on pro players, casters, personalities, and the like. Episodes that have guests like that would likely be less “newsy” and more about the guest, engaging them in an interview, discussion, and in general shooting the breeze with them. 


I have heavy experience with YouTube which (I hope) have made me more knowledgeable when it comes to things like hosting and the more technical aspects behind the scenes. I honestly do think I would be able to handle something like this. Currently, I am planning on doing the show either once a week or once every two weeks, depending on how I feel the show would be best suited, with special episodes for things like balance patches and new heroes. Ideally, I would love to livestream every episode, but I understand that most of my guests would probably not be available around the time I would be (I do work a 9-5, M-F internship right now), and so I will make the effort to stream every episode I can, but if the time conflict is too great between a guest and I, then I will simply record it as is, and upload it. I also realize that many people love to listen to shows like these when doing other tasks or at work, so I will also be making an audio-only version of each show, for people who want to listen to it on the go.
 
What I'm hoping for: **Advice**. I feel for this show to really take off, I should listen to the community, and I should really try seeing what the community likes and what the community prefers. It's easy as a content creator to create a personal vacuum in which they go with what they know and ultimately stagnate. I want to know who you guys want to see, what you guys want to see and pitfalls you want me to avoid when I start this show.

Secondly, while definitely something I don’t NEED to start getting the show off the ground, a partner in crime so to speak would help a lot. Ideally, I would be looking for someone who speaks English well, would be comfortable speaking with people, and has more game knowledge than me (which if I’ve got to be honest here- probably not hard to achieve.) I would also want a partner that would be dedicated to the show and help me research and plan the show out. However, above all else, I would want a partner that loves Dota as much as I do, and has a passion for the game that simply can’t be extinguished.

I love this game, this community, this scene and I’ve been searching for a way to give back, and help contribute, so I really hope this will help to grow and nurture the scene. If you have any questions, advice, comments, hate, please do post away! If you’re interested in possibly starting this project with me, then feel free to post away or PM me! If you’re someone who would love to be on the show as a guest, then definitely message me! :D Thanks for reading this huge wall of text. &lt;3


**tl;dr: dota 2 fan wants to get into making a podcast/talk show, could use advice.**

2edylf,2,2014-08-23,"Pre-Do and I need help keeping things in perspective, MCAT in 2.5 weeks and idk what more to do.",[deleted],premed,https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/2edylf/predo_and_i_need_help_keeping_things_in/,"So this is a bit of a loaded thread but please read. I would really appreciate it. See TL; DR for main points. 

Part 1: AAMC 11 
So I just took AAMC 11 yesterday and I got a 26 (9/9/8) which is my the best score I've gotten on an AAMC test. I got a 24 on AAMC 7 about 10 days ago (7/10/7). I took 2 TBR's after test 7, I did bad and just got super burned out. I plan on taking AAMC 8, 9, and 10 before my test (Sept 10th) I also have 5 but idk if I should waste my time on it considering 3-5 are old tests.

Part 2: Burnout 
I took the last week off because I just got burned out from almost 4 straight months of intense studying without any sort of break in addition to 3 FL's in a 4 day span. After spring quarter finals ended I jumped straight into the TBR prep course and after it finished I haven't been studying much the past ~10-12 days besides reviewing FL's just to recover mentally. It looks like it paid off with my 26 I got yesterday.

Part 3: Is my goal score (27-28+) reasonable when considering my application for next year? 
GPA: 3.1 cGPA, 2.97 sGPA (hoping to get to a 3.3/3.2 by the time I graduate next spring). Also do medical schools really consider the school you go to and the difficultly of your major? I'm a Molecular Biology major at a UC. I'm also in an EOP (educational opportunity program) due to finances and coming from a bad high school but I'm NOT a minority (I'm Arabic but there's no box for it except other) 

EC: Lots of community service/ shadowing /hospital volunteering (250, will have 400+ by app cycle next year) plus a 3 month internship in university relations. I also have 2 years of executive level leadership in my fraternity. I'm going to talk about how I organized a few philanthropies as VP. No research, I've tried to get into many labs last years but after getting rejected by a lot and deciding DO I've focused much more on community service and volunteering.

PS: Can't talk about since it's subjective 

LOR: 1 professor for sure (maybe 1 more), my internship supervisor, 1 DO letter, 1 MD letter and I might get 1 more DO letter. Lacking a strong science letter so I'm going to work super hard to get one this year.

EXTRA: I'm really going to try to show my vast (IMO) knowledge about DO's. I've read the Gevitz book, I know the 4 tenets, I've shadowed 1 DO with hopefully 1 more in the next year, and I've spent countless hours looking at the history. My DO worked in admissions at his school and he said he's going to help me shape my app. Also, I'd like to think I know more about the current DO policies (ie positives and negatives of the merger) plus ACA then most premeds. I look at that stuff for fun. I also did 4 mock interviews at my career center and my interviewers all said I was good or great. 

Also, I plan on doing a postbac in my gap year to show medical schools that I'm committed to improving in the sciences and having the best possible foundation before I start. Some people say I don't need it. What do you guys think? I live in Cali so I'm aiming at CSU east bay/SFSU if I don't get into Touro-CA MSMHS (my dream).

Part 4: Should I give up on MD? 
I just like to keep things in perspective especially since I failed 2 classes so w/o grade forgiveness I have like 2.8 GPA for MD schools. I don't think I should waste $1,500-2,000 to apply to 15-20 low tier MD that I have low chances at (IMO). Especially since I'm going to apply to ~20 DO schools so I'm assuming it would much more beneficial to focus on those and make those secondaries great so I can get interview invites.

TL; DR- got a 26 on AAMC 11 which what everyone has said it the best indicator of the real test. I'm aiming for a 27+ since I'm focusing on DO schools (should I give up on MD?). Is it a reasonable goal considering my app? what can I do in the next 18 days to prep for the MCAT to get that 27+?

2eedws,5,2014-08-23,I most likely didn't get the only internship I had a shot at,[deleted],MMFB,https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/2eedws/i_most_likely_didnt_get_the_only_internship_i_had/,"I go to school full time and take care of my disabled grandma. I don't like to complain and I know other people have it worse, but it has been really hard trying to focus on school (double majoring, one degree in STEM that is tough) while having to take care of someone whose mental health is declining. I don't have any friends because I can never stay on campus too long. I really don't get out of the house much at all. Finding a job or internship that is flexible enough to allow me to be at home when I need to be there has been completely impossible.

Until I found an online internship offered by the US Department of State! It is completely legitimate and there was one project that was absolutely perfect for my skillset (mix of math/computer science and humanities). I worked really hard on my resume and cover letter. I had super high hopes because I had experience in everything the project was looking for.

We are supposed to be contacted in the month of August (or early September) for an interview or follow up. We will be notified by September 10th if we were accepted or declined.

It seems like most people for other projects have been contacted already. I can't imagine why they would wait so long to contact me if they were considering me for the internship. Either they aren't considering me, they are considering me and for some reason waited 25+ days to contact me (unlikely), or they don't have any follow up questions/don't want to schedule an interview and are going to wait to accept me until September 10th (unlikely).

I totally understand that I am not going to get every job I apply for. I was just really counting on this. I am graduating in the winter and this was my last opportunity to get an internship. I feel so shitty because I had all the skills the internship was looking for and I know I could have done a really good job on the project.

I am going to be graduating without any internships or jobs, and I can't really put ""took care of grandma for 3 years"" on my resume. I feel so shitty about this. "
2eeeh5,1550,2014-08-23,Just submitted my payoff payment for 80K in student loans - 100% debt free!!!,TheTokenGirl,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2eeeh5/just_submitted_my_payoff_payment_for_80k_in/,"I finished school in Dec 2010. I'm proud to report I just scheduled my loan payoff payment. I want to thank this community and share my experience. You're teaching me all the things about money my family never did. Thank you!

*Tl;Dr - Student loans add up and then become huge, pay as much as you can and when you get raises don't change your lifestyle!*

**How I Got All This Debt**

* Bachelor's in computer engineering from a fancy private school (1998-2002) -&gt; 60K

I had tons of grants and scholarships, but I also had to take out the max in loans, as well as some extras to cover my parent's portion when their finances tanked.

* PhD in EE (2004-2010) -&gt; 20K

My program was funded but I got divorced in my 5th year and took out loans to be a buffer and cover first/last month's rent and funds while I found a job

*In total I owed ~80K, ~$450/month with rates from 3.25-6.8%*

**How I Paid it Off**

* 2002-2004, Salary ~30K, Paid ~$450/month (minimums)

I did 1 internship in college but mostly focused on research. When I graduated during the DotCom crash half my graduating class couldn't find a job, including me. I did temp work in offices, tutored high school, taught summer camp, etc to pay the bills then went back to grad school.

I always lived with roommates. I bought a Hyundai and paid it off in 3 years. I minimized eating out and buying anything I didn't need. I did still travel to see family and go to music events for entertainment. I didn't feel completely deprived but was hoping for more security and flexibility in the future.

* 2004-2010, Salary ~25k stipend during PhD, loans deferred

* 2011-2012, Salary ~45K, Paid ~$800/month

Worked as a post-doc on an exciting project with good potential to become a spin-off company

Still lived with a roommate (then later SO). No major lifestyle changes but a little more wiggle room in the budget. Started buying things of higher quality, but only when I needed them, not just wanted them.

* 2012- 2013, Salary ~80K (got promoted in the same lab) + ~70K (got married), paid ~$3-5k/month

I became the project manager of my team and got married. We ramped up the loan payments and started contributing appropriately to retirement.

We didn't change anything major about our lifestyle. We didn't redecorate. Didn't buy another car. Didn't move into a bigger apartment. Didn't buy anything we didn't actually need. A non-negligible fraction of my clothes still come from used clothing stores because they're cheap and functional! 

We both bus commute so that Hyundai is 10 years old with 40K miles on it. It will last another decade.

We did give ourselves more wiggle room for entertainment, self-care, and purchasing things we need of higher quality. Spending a few hundred a month on things we didn't need, but enjoyed, still fit in our debt payment goals.

* Today, after cost of living and merit raises and bonuses we're currently pulling in ~180k together. 

We're starting to save for a house now and have some stock options to give us a head start. Now we're saving that 4-5K a month for the house.

**Lessons Learned**

* At 17 the adults in my life said ""go to a good school, get a useful degree, and you'll get a job"". That's a lie! 

* They said ""student loans aren't a big deal! you're getting so much aid!"" That's a lie!

* I should have gotten more internships in college and focused on networking to get that first job. I did a lot of lab research instead which made me a great candidate for the PhD, but not employable in an entry level engineering position.

* I bought the cheapest new car I could find, but would have been fine financing a 1-2 year old car. I had NO experience in financing cars (my family had never done it) and made a mistake. It was still only a 14K car so not a giant mistake.

* Don't let your lifestyle inflate with your income, until you're satisfied with your savings rate or debt payment rate. It's hard to go backward. If you get comfortable living on less you can crush your debts!

**On the Personal Side**

I have been in debt since I was born. My parents were TERRIBLE with money. I was never homeless but my 'bedroom' was the living room couch for years. We all worked in the family business to help pay family bills as soon as we were useful and I spend many holidays and summers working when my friends were playing. The electricity got turned off several times and I was aware that we were always 2-3 months behind on rent. I have worked VERY hard to create a safer, more secure, and responsible life for myself. Next week is my 34th birthday and I'm currently 4 months pregnant with my first child. This baby will be born into a debt free life. With an e-fund, and retirement, and parents who are doing everything in their power to provide safety and security. I have changed my family's future! (with my husband's help of course) I'll continue learning from this community and improving our financial lives. Thank you!"

2eelpc,5,2014-08-23,[19/f] My ex [19/m] broke up with me and I miss him really bad. Help!,ludocrack11,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2eelpc/19f_my_ex_19m_broke_up_with_me_and_i_miss_him/,"So I'm Italian and this guy is German but we both lived in other countries because our parents had jobs that made them travel. We met in **central american country** when we were 12 during a school choir exchange and clicked right away because of similar musical interests and just overall chemistry. We were together for a week or so, broke up, and didn't talk for 6 years. 

Fast forward to mid 2013 we start talking on Facebook and then on Skype now that we have both returned to our respective countries to continue studying. We start Skyping super often and for very long (6 hours or so). Our conversations are amazing, we are so in sync, no matter what I'm doing I try to find time to talk to him because the conversations were just so engaging and he truly listened to me and wanted to know my opinion (guys here in Italy are super chauvinistic and never listen to you, they go on talking about themselves, etc). We talk on Whatsapp the rest of the time. This goes from October to March. He doesn't have a webcam so I just saw two pictures of him (literally) and one time we skyped while he was on his phone so I sorta saw him but I can assure you that my attraction to him was so strong that he could have been really ugly and I wouldn't have cared.But he wasn't ugly, he was extremely attractive. Very tall, blond, blue eyes, kind smile. Just handsome. One day, in March I believe, he asks me when I have the next school break and I told him it was in April. He immediately books tickets and a hotel to come visit me. A guy had never done such a thing for me. He came and it was all so natural, like we had always known each other. We had the most awesome physical experiences. He made me feel so special and cared for and he looked so in love I couldn't believe it. We said I love you and it was so true but after only 3 days he had to go back to Germany. The first 3 weeks things were perfect. We kept texting and all and I missed him so bad. I wanted to see him, he had been my best friend who I had a crush on and then became the boyfriend I had dreamed of: caring, loving, intelligent, funny, attractive and also he understood my past. Then, about 40 days after he had come to visit me, I went where he lived and he was... so cold.
At the airport he said ""yeah, I think you should go"" and during my stay he was so distant. It broke my heart but I stayed in the relationship hoping things would get better, hoping that the next time I saw him (which should have been during these days) things would get better. But things only got worse. he left for an internship, he didn't have a computer so we couldn't skype and he barely even answered my messages on Whatsapp. Normally, i don't even carry my phone with me at all times but I really missed him and that being our only means of communication, I gave it importance. But he talked to me less and less. I didn't want to break up over whatsapp but it was killing me. I was so sad thinking that my best friend and guy I loved lost interest in me completely.But he broke up with me, through whatsapp and asked me to stay friends. I told him I wanted to but that I needed time not talking to him but now, as time passes I don't know if I want to stay friends. He broke my heart and I don't think it would be healthy but at the same time I miss him so much, everyday. Though I know that the person I miss is never coming back because we'll never have that easy going friendship again because we have a past and even if we tried really hard to fix it it would just be forced and even sadder.

I don't know what to do. I miss him so much. I wish I could go back and decline his offer to come visit me, that way I could still have my best friend. I go on with my life and I'm not depressed nor am I not able to have fun but every once in a while I see something funny and think ""wow, he'd love this"" and then i remember that it's kinda like he died because the guy that I love, I'll never ever get back. I can just have a pale imitation of him... and that's even worse because it reminds me of the truly amazing person I lost. I swear I don't know what I did wrong. I miss him so much"
2eexn7,0,2014-08-23,I'm a CompSci student at an arts/business school looking to propose a math related research project to help myself gain resume experience to enter the aerospace industry.,[deleted],math,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/2eexn7/im_a_compsci_student_at_an_artsbusiness_school/,"I am seeking the advice of the mathematicians of reddit, and I will begin by stating my motive. I am a computer science student, and I am seeking a position in the aerospace industry. My goal is to eventually make it into one of the [new space](http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/national/2013/11/23/which-way-to-space/) pioneering companies and help pave the way for our civilization into a true space age. When I say ""new space"", I am talking about companies working towards goals such as asteroid mining, propellant depots, and colonization of other worlds. 

Here is my current situation, and how you can help me work through it. I left the military a few years back, and I set off on achieving this goal shortly thereafter. I started out at a community college, and I began working my way through all of the general education requirements. After completing my gen eds, I transferred to my local university, and I'm now working through my core classes to finish up my degree in computer science. I am looking to graduate in fall of 2015, and I need an internship at a relevant company before this happens. I'm not sure if I will land an internship at SpaceX or NASA, but I live near Huntsville, AL and there is aerospace companies everywhere. I am completely willing to start at the bottom and work my way up. I just need to get my foot in the door.

        I need to get my foot in the door, and I need project experience on my resume to land that internship at an aerospace company. This is where I'm looking for help from all of you reddit mathematicians. My computer science program offers undergraduate research projects. The program is awesome, but nearly all of the professors, including my adviser, are big-time into math. Currently, there is a research project going on that is somewhat relevant to what I'm wanting to do. [Model rocket launch and simulation as a pedagogical tool](http://ncurdb.cur.org/ncur2014/msearch/Display_NCUR.aspx?id=80134) is the research project currently ongoing. I've been tracking the project for a while now and progress seems to be pretty static. 

I would like to either propose a new project similar to this one, or ramp up the current ongoing project. I absolutely love the topic of using a rocket to teach math to younger kids, but I would seriously like to ramp up the scale of this project. I would like to use a much more sophisticated rocket with more advanced computer systems. I would possibly like to build a rocket system that would have payload bays, and allow kids from local high-schools to design experiments to go in the bays and test them. Back in the spring, I asked my adviser if we could do anything to get a NSL (NASA student launch project) started up, and I never got a response (NSL is a massive project btw).

tl;dr
How can I get my math-loving adviser and other professors interested in an aerospace project that I can flex my comp sci skills on to gain an aerospace internship next summer?"
2eezre,1,2014-08-23,"Me [21/F] with my SO [27 M] of 4 years, are at the breaking point...again.",confusedredditor324,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2eezre/me_21f_with_my_so_27_m_of_4_years_are_at_the/,"I'm so sad and worried right now. I don't want to make the wrong decision, and I'm clinging to my relationship for dear life even though I feel like it’s is ending.

My SO says he still loves me, and I love and care for him too. We’ve been together for nearly four years, but there's a lot wrong.

To start with the beginning, he moved from his hometown to live with his dad after his parents split. He was 22. When he moved hear he had an internship opportunity that fell through and ever since then (5 years ago) he has not gone back to school or find full-time employment.

He says he tries, but I really wonder how much he tries, because after five years of being here, the only job he’s gotten is as an assistant coaching position at a high school.

I know he is very smart. He’s brilliant with computers but for so long he has depended on his dad who is quite frankly, a narcissistic asshole (I will explain why later). He seemed very content with just living with his dad and grandparents and even though he has so much potential, he's wasting it away. In the past two years, he has showed an interest in trying harder and straightening his life out, but it still hasn't led to anything

He agrees that he is stuck, and is trying to get back in motion, but after four years of saying he’s going back to school and it falling through and that he talked to a guy who has a position open and then it fizzles out, has me really doubtful at whether or not he is trying. I believe he thinks he is trying hard, but I don’t think he realizes that he’s doing very little for his future.

Back to his dad, which has also caused problems for us. During the beginning of our relationship, his dad would make my SO do stuff with him on days we had planned to hang out and my SO would do it b/c he said his dad had been depressed and suicidal after the divorce. Now, I believe his dad has mental issues, but his irrational behavior took a toll on my SO and our relationship, but he was not standing up for himself and plain out babying his dad. I have been very sympathetic with him because no one wants to see their dad in a bad light, but it was really detrimental to my SO's growth and independence. Within the past year he has distanced himself from his dad who is off doing his own thing, and now he takes care of his grandparents, which is very admirable and I will never fault him for that because they really need the help, but because of it he still hasn’t done much for himself (regarding school and work).

His parents did a lot of messed up stuff to him and I really don't like them. They left him in debt after they split: they spent most of his and his brother’s college loan money and had them take out more loans to help pay for the divorce and left them with the debt. His mom just recently paid off his brother’s debt, but says she won't help him pay it, saying it was his father’s responsibility since she paid off the brother’s. His dad, like I said, is an asshole and won’t pay for it. He still tries to guilt my SO into doing things, and while he has made amends with his mom for the sake of his younger brothers, she still won't help him pay off the debt she and his dad basically put him in. Because of this he's had trouble financially and can't get back into school. Every year it's the same thing, he's almost paid it off and going back to school soon, but then it falls through. The same thing is true with his job situation.

I am newly graduated and job hunting (have a few prospective employers) while he is still stagnant. It worries me. We've discussed maybe moving in together, but my profession doesn't have a great starting out salary and if he hasn't managed to find a job here in five years, I doubt he'll find one in the next few months-year. I don't resent him for being stuck, because his parents helped dig that hole for him, but now the reasons are just sounding like excuses. I'm not saying anything bad about him, but thinking rationally, our relationship will have some serious stress if he can't find/keep a job.

Lately we’ve been having more and more arguments. One will do/not do something, and it ends up hurting the other person’s feelings. We’ll feel shitty, make up and things are good for week or two before we have another argument/misunderstanding. He says I don’t make as much of an effort to change and he thinks he’s the one trying harder. I do try hard and feel terrible when he says that and I hate making him upset and vice versa. We’re both trying, but not seeing each other eye to eye.

I’ve made my mistakes in the relationship and have hurt him, which I deeply regret, and he has too, but we’ve gotten past that and spent 4 years together. The past month we nearly broke up on several occasions and now we are at that point again. I don’t want to make a mistake and he doesn’t either. We both agree that this relationship is no longer healthy, but we’re torn in half as whether or not to take a break or try one more time.

Despite what I mentioned above, he is a great guy. He is very caring and loving and fun to be around. He still can make me smile and laugh and does his best to make me happy. He calls me his life changer. We have had some amazing times and I owe so much to him. He is sincere and honest and one of the best person's I've met.

Just certain differences have really caused strife in the relationship. I am usually a mature person who thinks very rationally, but right now I feel so naive and unsure of myself...it feels like everything I thought has been wrong...

It feels like we’re going in different directions in life and not sure how much longer we can hold out. Sometimes it feels right and that we will last (i.e. marriage), but other times it feels like we are both postponing the inevitable. We discussed that today and are both pretty exhausted and emotionally drained, without having come to a definitive decision.

I guess I need outside opinions. Are we crazy? Making things too complicated when we have something good going on? Or just afraid of breaking up because we’ve invested so much into this relationship? 

Help :/

I'm moving to amsterdam on 13/9/14 for 4 months whilst I undertake an internship in Amsterdam Noord.

I was wondering if any of you, in similar situations in the past, had any tips on how to find a place.

Part of the problem is not being able to view rooms before hand. This isnt a problem for me, I'd rather just reserve a place and then pay when I turn up, but landlords seem less cool on that idea... but i'd rather not stay in a hotel for a week whilst looking, because I start my internship pretty much straight away.

Anyway, yes, any tips on finding rooms? I've tried facebook groups, kamernet, neither of which seem to be bringing much success. 

Cheers :)

He really is awesome and kind and loving, but I just can’t get past some things that happened during our time together. They just gnaw at me and I need to let them go and never think of them again but I can’t.

(I apologize for my English, it's not my first language).


----


The first thing is what I refer to as the « week of hell ». My boyfriend was staying in my apartment back in September and October because he had an internship of 3 months starting mid October on the other side of the country (Paris), followed by another 3 months of class there, and then another internship before graduation. It didn’t make sense for him to rent an place just for two months while I had mine already. 




It wasn’t the easiest to come to terms with the fact that we were to become an LDR after a year of being together almost constantly, with not real end date to the LDR since his second internship would probably be in Paris again, as well a most of his jobs prospects.


So mid October was the last week we were together in the same place and I asked him if we could spend as much time as possible together in the evenings (we both had different classes) doing fun stuff or going on dates before he left that Saturday because we would basically be seeing each other once a month tops from now on. He agreed but insisted on things remaining normal (I also asked for a lot more hugs), his reasoning being that every time we saw each other shouldn’t be some kind of goodbye, and we should act as we would if we saw each other everyday. 


On Monday, his class went out for drinks. It was supposed to be at 5pm but was finally at 7pm so he came home, ate, and left saying he’d come back early. So I spent my evening looking forward to him coming back, I’d put on some lingerie and waxed, only to get a text around midnight saying that he was going to sleep at his friend’s place and he had no more battery. I was a bit pissed and he knew it but stayed at his friend’s anyway. 

Then I kinda overreacted and wrote him a letter saying basically « what the fuck, we say we’re spending as much time together as possible this week and the first thing you do is sleep somewhere else? In 3 months you’ll see your classmates all day everyday and you’ll go out with them every night if you want to, but you won’t see me nearly as much and yet you do this? ». 
I regretted it later but I just felt so stupid having done up myself for him and waited in my fucking underwear for him, it felt justified at the time. 

He came home the next morning to change his shirt and went to class and didn’t understand why I was still pissed at him for spending the night elsewhere, and then when he got back from class he saw the letter. I came back afterwards and we talked it out and agreed on keeping Friday for the two of us no matter what, I cried, we ate pizza and went to sleep. 

The next day he had a group project and I had a party so we agreed to come home at around the same time to see each other a bit, but he got home earlier and by the time I got back he was asleep. The day after that his classmates had organized a dinner with the whole class and the teachers, so he went saying « I don’t want to go, I’d rather stay with you, I'll come back as soon as I can ». 

Foolish me believed that and by 10pm he texted me they were going to a bar, and by midnight he was texting me, asking if I minded if he went clubbing. I said I did mind, and he came home around 1am and went to sleep. Not much quality time there either.
So that was another night of me waiting for him to come home early but not at all. At least he came back… 


The last day we had was Friday. We’d agreed it would only be the two of us, so we went on a date, came home, and he started getting calls from his classmates who were at a bar, some of them drunk. They all wanted him to come one last time before they all started their internships. He said no, but then it became « what if I just pop by and come home? » . I said you get 10 minutes and that’s it. But he didn’t go, instead, he spent half an hour on the phone with them outside the apartment. I was so gutted, really. 

When he came back and saw my face (the face of disappointment I suppose) he started crying, saying he was a terrible boyfriend and that he was sorry. I told him he wasn’t terrible but he really hurt me this week by not keeping his promise and spending all his time with his classmates. We kind of made up and the next day I helped him pack and he left for Paris. 

**TL;DR of Part 1: BF promised we’d spend as much time together as possible before he moved, he ended up spending a night and the majority of his time with his classmates, even the last day when we said it’d be just us, he cried, I cried, we made up but I still feel like shit when I think about it.**

---

I saw him on weekends and that went well, we skyped often, but then he made friends there and I just felt left out, like we didn’t have anything in common any more. Then I too had to find a an internship so I applied everywhere and by luck, a company in Paris accepted me. So the LDR finally had an end date and we started looking at places together over Skype. We moved in together officially 6 months ago and it’s been nothing but great.

Only I’m insecure and there was this female friend he texted a lot, so I went through their conversation on his phone and while he did text her more than I’m comfortable with when I wasn’t in Paris (although now they barely talk) it was always appropriate. 

What I found though, is that he told her a classmate of his tried to kiss him when they were having drinks at a bar. He said he told her no and explained he was in a relationship (and so was she, for 4 years and counting), but that it made him feel awful because she cried. My BF’s friend asked if he was going to tell me and that he should, and he said he was going to but never did.


So over the week I tried to figure out how to get him to tell me without admitting I’d snooped, like showing him reddit posts of people in similar situations and asking him what he’d do, and if anything had happened to him like that ever, but he said no.


I became obsessed with it and finding out who it was so I snooped again and found the girl in question (we’ll call her Virginia). The texts started with Virginia asking why he wasn’t smiling, and BF saying he was tired. 

They were all dated after the attempted kiss so I figure he deleted the previous ones. At an other time she asked him what he was doing and he replied he was out with friends. She said « don’t hit on any other girls », to which he replied they were between dudes. She said « you could reassure me more ». He didn’t reply and she proceeded to say « we’ve spent the evening, then the night together, and you just dismiss me like that ?». (at that point I felt like someone tore a hole in my stomach) and he said « that’s not cool, stop ». Virginia replies « you’re not cool ». Then days later « congratulations on finding an apartment with your girlfriend », later she tries to call him 4 times in one night and my BF says « I hope you were drunk » . Then she sends him texts she says were meant for someone else (about a dinner) and then it stops.



So I’m feeling horrible and horrified. What the fuck does spending the evening and then the night means? I once again can’t ask directly my BF because I snooped, but I fucking need to know. He comes in and sees my face and I just tell him I have been thinking about stuff and infidelity and just asking him if he’s cheated on me. He denies it, saying he never wants to leave me and he’d never cheat. I say okay. 

But it just gnaws at me, every time I have my mind free to think I just think about it. I sleep terribly, I get sick to my stomach… It’s awful. So one morning I finally confront him and say, « in your sleep you say the name Virginia, so I wondered if there was anything I should know so I looked through your phone and found this ».
He looked more annoyed than anything and said Virginia was crazy, that she had a boyfriend but hit on several of his classmates and then him. I said he tried to let her down gently but it didn’t work and he just avoided it. He swore nothing happened, and that they just went to the same party and both slept, along with other people, at the host's place.


He had to go to work and so did I, so we left it at that. He did send me texts saying he felt I didn’t trust him. I told him I did but I was insecure and the fact that he had many female friends and he’d never introduced me to them didn’t help. I also asked him to tell me if things like this (girls hitting on him) happened again to avoid misunderstandings later. He apologized, agreed for more transparency and said we’d meet some of his friends at some point.


I finally met amongst other of his friends one girl he got long with pretty well and she’s very nice, I like her a lot. 


I brought up Virginia one time a week after the facts and he got pissed saying this was annoying and had to stop, he already explained himself and didn’t want to every week. I dropped it.



So now here we are, we’ve been living pretty happily since then, I got flowers for our 2 year anniversary, we regularly go on dates, it’s all good. But now we’re both on holiday at our parents and the more I’m apart from him the more I think about Virginia and the texts and the more questions I ask myself, and the more I wonder « what if ».
I just want tot put this behind me, I really want to forget all about it but my mind won’t. It just keeps getting back to it.



So should I just think about it until I don’t anymore? Should I ask for more explanations so that all my questions are answered and I can stop wondering, knowing it’s gonna piss BF off? But will I ever stop wondering?

**TL;DR of Part 2: Found out a girl in his class tried to kiss him, he never told me. Found out the girl said they spent the night together and asked be reassured he didn’t hit on other girls but BF didn’t encourage her (not in his texts anyway), asked about it, he explained it (slept along w/ other people at a friends place) but I’m still having unresolved issues about it and can’t seem to let it go even though I want to.**

I know I’m insecure, a bit needy emotionally (this is my first real relationship), I have higher libido so I get turned down for sex regularly which doesn’t do wonders for my confidence. I’m not sure I’m exactly mature emotionally (I get jealous easily), I’m certainly not perfect. I just want to know how to improve before I fuck it up.


---


**TL;DR of the whole thing: Unresolved issues about my boyfriend spending too much time with his classmates right before leaving and us entering a LDR. Also can't let go of the fact one of his classmates tried to kiss him and believed she was worth the reassurance he wouldn't hit on any other girls, even though he did not encourage her. I'm insecure and this doesn't help, and I need advice to let these things go before I fuck my relationship up.**

I have been dating for 7 years with an awesome girl, she went on an 5 month internship, and I didn't give her the support she deserved, and when she came back she broke with me, I was devastated but she came back after 10 days and I started giving her all the love that I didn't gave her before. Everything was fine and we were starting to get things right again. It wasn't excellent but we were on the right path.

Recently, her father and grandfather were diagnosed with a terminal illness and her mother has a possible tumor so she is going through a rough time. I think she might be depressed and she told me that she doesn't love me like the way she used to before. I've read about people suffering depressions that push away people who they love and even say that they never loved them. Do you think this might be the case?
I think she might be depressed, she says that she hasn't been happy with her life lately. 

I know that I shouldn't be in a relationship where she doesn't love me but she says that she is confused and really doesn't know how she feels about me, she says she can't even retrieve affection to me or her family.  I asked her what she would feel if i left her and she said she would feel bad but also relieved because she doesn't like making me suffer like this. She also said that she wouldn't like to see me with someone else. I also asked her why she came back and she said that she had missed me and that she was always thinking of me when she heard a song on the radio or was in one of our favorite places.

What should I do? I don't want to leave her in this time of need, but I think that if I don't give her space she won't be able to miss me and find out what she really feels for me. Also I will be going on a 5 month internship far away which doesn't help me to decide what to do or how to fix this because I love her and want to be with her and I know that if this situation of her parents hadn't happened we would be slowly getting in the right path.

What should I do?"

I'm currently in the application process for a front end dev internship with a local web agency. As part of the interview process, they gave me a one-page PSD comp to break out and turn into a site. I've gotten the desktop version live and up-and-running, with all specifics from the PSD, but the problem is I've never made anything responsive before (I've worked primarily in Wordpress up until now).

I understand how it's supposed to work in theory, but I've never actually done it before. Which breakpoints would you include/any tips on where to start?

EDIT: Big thanks to everyone for the help and direction! I ended up taking my original CSS and editing it to the mobile version (320 or &lt;) and scaling the content up from there. After getting the content to look good on mobile it was a breeze scaling it up to larger sizes! "

I'm pretty sure she's had some feelings for me too the whole time, but my anxiety and low self esteem always prevented me from truly believing that.  I'm pretty sure this caused me to blow a chance with her back in December, and she got into a relationship with a guy (we'll call him **Joe**) shortly afterwards.

Being as obsessed with her as I was, I would check her Facebook profile at least once a week to see if she was still in a relationship with him.  After a few months, her relationship info on her profile disappeared.  Shortly afterwards, it went to single.  Unfortunately, I don't see her during that time of the year, and back then I didn't understand dating and was too shy to contact her through text/FB etc.  Her FB relationship status has remained at single ever since then as far as I'm aware of.

This summer she went to California for an internship.  She stayed there for three months.  I happened to run into Joe in July, and he mentioned that he was going to see her for a week pretty soon.  I live in Iowa, so that's a pretty good distance.  I was thrown off a bit, but I figured that maybe they're still close in a platonic way.

Anyway, I'm just coming back to school and I've been seeing her around a lot.  She's always happy to see me, starts conversations with me a lot, and touches me a lot.

However, at all the parties I've seen her at, she's always with Joe.  That, and I'm pretty sure I've heard people actually refer to them as a couple.

I'm starting to think I should just give up on her.  This is killing me and it's just not worth the stress.  Still, I know there's something between us, and it also kills me to think about never knowing if something could have happened."

2eh44m,2,2014-08-24,Inspirational roller coaster - advice welcome,Diegomanw,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/2eh44m/inspirational_roller_coaster_advice_welcome/,"Around April/May of this year my girlfriend of four years left me. At the time I felt incredibly betrayed and abandoned. I better give you some background info so you can get a clearer picture...

A year ago we were very happy together until one day I woke up in the hospital. I had suffered from a seizure and soon after was treated for epilepsy. The medication made me a shell of who I once was. I had no energy, motivation, libido and I was moody all the time. This caused problems in our relationship and eventually she left me.

I took it really hard for a while, I was depressed and felt completely alone. She kicked me out of the house we were sharing (I am a student in a foreign country so finding a new one was a nightmare). For a long time I felt like shit until I eventually came to the conclusion that being happy is a decision and I started working on improving myself in order to find happiness (nofap was part of the transformation).

I had found life again! I was happy with who I was and became more comfortable with other people than ever before. I found an apartment and an internship. I was exercising and getting out. I even quit that bullshit medication. Then, about a month ago my ex started contacting me to meet up again.

We've came to the point where we had decided to give it another go but then yesterday, while we were in bed, she told me she had been together with another guy after we broke up... She said she was sorry and that it was a mistake and she was drunk etc... But we were only separated for a month when she did it. 

I'm very upset about this... While I was looking to improve myself and find happiness as a single guy again, she was out getting drunk and partying and even slept with a random. Is that is a clear sign of emotional instability or am I being too sensitive? Even after the breakup I always loved her but accepted that we didn't work out.

I'm kind of ranting now so I'll end it with a question.

Do I tell her it's over or mark it off as a drunken mistake?"
2ehcdz,5,2014-08-24,"Me [20M] with my live-in girlfriend [22 F] of two years, considering break up",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2ehcdz/me_20m_with_my_livein_girlfriend_22_f_of_two/,"A little background. I am a Junior in college, and she has an associates degree but works overnights full time as an assistant manager. We have been living together for one year, and we have two roommates (both guy friends of mine). She began working overnights shortly after we moved in together. I have 3 jobs right now (two internships and a consulting gig on the side) as well as school, and she pretty much is only at work or home.

Also, we bought a car together, and we also have some other debt in both of our names. Stupid, I know. 

Basically, after she started working overnight everything kinda died. We argue about a lot of petty things, like laundry or things getting left out or the place being dirty, but honestly she doesn't really do much. She works overnight and is on her feet the whole time, so I understand her being tired (she also has some thyroid problems), but in reality the majority of the cleaning (including keeping her clothes washed) is done by me. It's also always one of my roommates or me that does the cooking.

I used to spend all of my time when I lived with my parents ""fetching"" things, like having to go get them a drink, or something they left in the other room, or other pointless tasks, and I've told her that this makes me upset because it reminds me of them but she just says it makes her feel special when I do these things and continues to do it even though it hurts my feelings, since she doesn't like to do things for herself. She isn't really lazy, (well maybe) it just seems she wants me to do everything for her.

I began working a lot, heading a few clubs, and getting really involved in entrepreneurship in my community so most of my time is spent networking or working on ideas and trying to make money. I'll be honest, and say that I have neglected her at times because I've focused on school and work. I just look at all of my family, and see how little success any of them have had in their lives and want to be able to have the best for myself and my future family. She says that she understands, but she still wants me to make time for her, but in all honesty I would much rather be focusing on my career than planning for a future together. 

She tells me how much she wants to marry me all the time, and I've made it clear that I don't really want to do anything like that for several years after I graduate. Yet she constantly talks about our marriage, or buying a house, or kids. Her younger sister got married, and is about to have a kid any day now, so thats probably not helping. I just don't really know if I would even want to marry her at this point.

In addition, the bedroom is pretty much dead too. That started right around the time she started working overnight. We actually had an argument this morning about me not wanting to kiss her (it wasn't true, I just have reoccurring sinus issues and I couldn't breathe) and about how I don't initiate intimacy - which is mostly true, I have a pretty low sex drive and am always tired because of overworking.

I really do care for her, but at the same time I think I am hurting her more than I am helping at this point. She's scared I'll leave because she doesn't really have anyone in this city, and she's basically put all of her cards with me. But I don't think this is what I want anymore. I'm not happy. I hate to hurt her, and I know it will suck having to sort through all of the mutual items we have, but I think it might be for the best to break it off and work on getting through this. 

What should I do Reddit? She's going to be off for the next three days, and works tonight, so I'm considering doing it in the morning so its not before work and she will have some time to get it together, since she is a boss and all.

========  
_A different take on Near-Earth Hub_

Already [Near-Earth Hub: Broadcast Center](http://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/06005) has been shown to be an amazingly strong identity. The extra influence and card draw have been used to good effect to bolster NBN Fast Advance, but I think that the ID can offer so much more.

Key Deck Concepts
--------
* There are 31 cards in the deck that can be installed facedown in a new remote, this deck aims to install in a new remote at least once each turn
*  The sheer number of trashable cards overwhelms _all_ runner economy. It is not possible to trash everything, and is even difficult for Whizzard. [Interns](http://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/04060) and [Encryption Protocol](http://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/02029) add to this.
* Landing tags on the runner allows you to slow them down through taxing both credits and cards.
* There are multiple win conditions: flatlining through [Snare!](http://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/01070)/[Dedicated Response Team](http://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/02118)/[TGTBT](http://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/04075), by scoring an overadvanced [Project Beale](http://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/02115) with [Psychographics](http://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/01085), or by regular [AstroScript Pilot Program](http://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/01081) chaining when the runner is to scared to run new remotes or centrals.

Playstyle
--------
* There are a wide variety of acceptable starting hands. You are looking for at least two of: [PAD Campaign](http://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/01109), [Marked Accounts](http://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/02055), [Pop-up Window](http://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/02056) or [Jackson Howard](http://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/04015), and not too many agendas. Due to the draw ability, bad starting hands are somewhat mitigated.
* Use the ID ability every turn if able. There are 31 cards in the deck that can be installed facedown in a new remote, so this shouldn't be difficult.
* Ice is almost exclusively for central servers. If you think you have a window for it, you can try and score an [AstroScript Pilot Program](http://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/01081) behind a [Tollbooth](http://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/01090), but [Tollbooth](http://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/01090) is usually best spent protecting your most heavily attacked central server.
* [City Surveillance](http://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/04055) strategy: this card is an MVP in this deck. Almost noone will trash them when they're unrezzed, especially if you have a few [Encryption Protocol](http://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/02029)s running. Place them face down, and then wait until the runner ends their turn with 1 or 2 credits, then rez as many as you can, even if it bankrupts you. This gives them the option of floating tags (which is what we really want), or spending a lot of turns getting the money to trash them while remaining tag-free, only to have you re-install them with [Interns](http://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/04060).
* [Dedicated Response Team](http://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/02118) strategy: try and hide their presence for as long as possible, only rezzing them when they commit to accessing a [Snare!](http://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/01070) or [TGTBT](http://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/04075). The other time to start rezzing them is if they start floating tags. Either way, they're going to be trashing them aggressively after that, so either protect them with light ice, or [Interns](http://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/04060) them back for maximum frustration. Once they start floating tags, [Dedicated Response Team](http://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/02118) taxes every run with meat damage, and slows them down _a lot_.
* Avoid HQ agenda flood at all costs. I don't mind holding onto 1 or 2 [NAPD Contract](http://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/04119)s or an [AstroScript Pilot Program](http://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/01081) that I think I'll be scoring soon, but otherwise they need to be chucked in the archives once you have a [Jackson Howard](http://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/04015) on the table.
* I inevitably need to devote a section to countering Account Siphon: try to keep enough assets on the table that you can rez, then hit them with [Closed Accounts](http://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/01084) as soon as possible. Keeping unrezzed [Dedicated Response Team](http://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/02118)s can also wreck an unprepared siphoner. This deck isn't too badly affected by siphon play, and can destroy a runner that decides to float tags. 
* There are a thousand mind games you can play with this card composition. Things like: install/advance a [TGTBT](http://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/04075), making it look like an NAPD, then they take the tag when they run. I'll often leave [AstroScript Pilot Program](http://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/01081) facedown unadvanced for a few turns if they're not checking remotes and I have other priorities for my clicks at the time.
* As of writing this, Astrobiotics NEH is by far the most popular build. The runner may play in anticipation of this, meaning that you may be able to get kills when they are rushing and are careless.

Weaknesses
--------
* Whizzard. This matchup can still work out, you just need to install faster than he can trash with his recurring credits. Manually draw if needed to supplement your ID draw for new assets.
* Ignoring your assets, and keeping pressure on centrals. If they have the econ to continually ignore the city surveillance tax and can enough to _also_ hit your central servers, then your remotes are pretty worthless. Aim to get difficult ice like [Tollbooth](http://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/01090) and [Data Raven](http://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/01088) rezzed on your key centrals.

Potential Adjustments and Alterations
--------
* [Diversified Portfolio](http://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/05026) could work really well; I usually have 5+ remotes early on in the game.
* Add a few more ice. I've tried a few different iterations of the deck with more, and some with less. Around 10 seems enough to tax your centrals sufficiently.
* More consistent ice. With lots of 1/2 ofs, Your ice composition will be different every game. Counterargument: allows unpredictability, mitigated by deck's draw power, allows multiple games against an opponent without them knowing what your ice will be.

Additional Notes
--------
* I've been playing around with [Dedicated Response Team](http://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/02118) for a fair while, so I'm glad that an ID finally came out that makes it great!"
2ehjh0,1,2014-08-24,Making a new start... Need some inputs. Any help would be greatly appreciated!,throwmas,france,https://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/2ehjh0/making_a_new_start_need_some_inputs_any_help/,"Hey /France/,

I am here because I need your Help. I do speak French, but I feel more comfortable with English. Feel free to reply in French if you want. 

**My situation:**

Well, technically, I’ve just graduated from an engineering school here in France, my internship ended a week ago and I’ve been looking for a job position for about 3 months now.
I made my last 2 internships in a very specific branch of a very specific industry where, unfortunately, there are very few work opportunities. I was a dreamer (and maybe a moron) and I didn’t choose wisely my internships. Now I’m labelled, and with the current crisis, it’s really hard to secure a job position without “reconverting”.

**The problem:**

I’ve talked recently to my professors and the general advice was to find another internship in order to change the path and make a new start.
The problem is that there are specific regulations about internships in France: the “internship agreement” (convention) from schools/universities is mandatory and schools do not provide any after the graduation.

Some friends told me that a new enrolment at another university may be the solution. But no one is sure if it is still possible nowadays to enrol just to have the internship agreement (without attending). In addition, being a foreigner, I am not sure if that is possible in my case.

After doing some search, I also found that there are many private “schools” offering enrolment to provide a “6 months internship agreement” is this practice legal?

So, /France/, were you in a same situation before?  How is it possible to get a “convention” after graduating? If enrolment is the only solution, do you know a university offering a Master with a high number of seats (so one does not take others chances) where it is still possible to enrol?

Thanks in advance!

Seattle, Seattle, Seee...attle.  When we came on the air, we said we were a fledgling broadcast searching for something interesting.

Chummers, the shadows *did not disappoint*.  Touristville is *exploding*!  Literally!

While Jerry the Intern is hiding down at the Chase nursing a GSW and reflecting on his poor choices in editing - I, Mister Seattle Tonight, am here to bring YOU the latest in city-spanning reporting, including things like **CUTTING OUT RUN-ON SENTENCES, JERRY.**

Arright, enough about him.  We got gang wars, we got drug labs, we got riders of the storm!

Without further ado, this is...Seattle Tonight!


Where the hell do these guys come up with this?  **THIS** is what Jerry flagged in the data miner?

&gt;**HOVERBOARDS: FACT OR FICTION?**

&gt;*Rumored stress test attacked in Redmond; prototype escapes*

&gt;**REDMOND BARRENS** - Since before the dawn of the Sixth World and in the twilight of the Fifth, the denizens of Earth have clamored for the pinnacle of scientific and technological achievement:

&gt;The Hoverboard.

&gt;Imagine, if you will:  A conveyance that floats a foot above the ground without turbines or jets, but merely the repulsion of the very laws of gravity!  A tool so simple that a child could use it!

&gt;Yet, we have been without such a marvel since magic returned to the world.

&gt;*Or have we?*

&gt;Reports this week of a gang assault on an unassuming building in the Redmond Barrens may have given hope to the technological enthusiast as eyewitnesses describe what could only be a king-size, metal reinforced **floating board** exiting the premises accompanied by what may have been a band of SINless worshippers herding this second coming of science to temple.

&gt;Those same eyewitnesses spoke of feelings of restlessness and unease as their hearts raced, hiding as they did from what sounded to be elven mercenaries in green and gold - soldiers from Tir Tairngire seeking to supplant the Dragons with icons of worship!  

&gt;Wary seekers of truth later snuck into the building to find many deceased fellows of Japanese descent, who could only be agents of Mitsuhama or Renraku.

&gt;Our ever-helpful witnesses, before reporting this to Technophile, also mentioned the existence of several white, powdery substances prior to their trepidation.  We find this information to be of little import to the truth of the Hoverboard - it is *here*, and **it demands adulation**.

I...don't even know what that was.  I think it's a good time for a word from a spons-okay seriously what the-

Listen, chummers.  Seattle Tonight is a fresh broadcast, we're still working the bugs out.  Some weird drek's going on in the tech room so until Jerry gets off his keister or Fritz gets paroled early we're just gonna have to continue on.  Sounds good, right?

&gt;**GRID OVERWATCH DIVISION BLAMED FOR UNRESTRICTED GANG WARFARE**

&gt;*Poor response times blamed on 'Anonymous Hackers' while death toll climbs*

&gt;**TOURISTVILLE** - Tensions between two previously unknown gangs reached a flashpoint this week as both Grid Overwatch Division and Knight Errant were found to be nonresponsive to emergency calls.

&gt;News crews from several publications were able to film the ensuing battle by air and ground crews as violence erupted between human-centric group the Gold Blood, and the violent street gang known as the Jade Bears, though the subsequent footage was deemed to be unsafe for viewing audiences at the time.

&gt;Patrol Captain Robert Krieger said that concerted hacking attacks against the Knight-Errant dispatch system kept their units from responding.

&gt;""We fielded over four thousand calls over a seventy-two hour period,"" he said.  ""With the influx of false emergencies, coupled with the actual emergencies we were able to get to and a lack of response from Grid Overwatch Division - It was all we could do to ride out the storm.""

&gt;The hours-long gun battle ended in a solid victory and an abandoned building for the Gold Blood according to independent journalist Lucy Leopold who had a first-person view of the rampage.

&gt;""It was unlike anything I'd ever seen,"" Lucy reported on her independent news blog *The Leopold Times*.  ""There was an individual in a bear mask that just started killing indiscriminately.""

&gt;Knight-Errant is offering a reward for information leading to the capture and arrest of an unidentified male wearing a green bear mask.  Initial sketches suggest this individual, termed ""The Ursa Mangler"" by onlookers, may be a male Ork, Human or Elf with an affinity for chainsaws.

&gt;The Grid Overwatch Division was unavailable for comment.

Okay, let's move on.  We've got a bit of the police blotter, and a very special interview by Yours Truly, Mister Seattle Tonight!  Hang in there, we're almost done!

&gt;&lt;&lt;**THE POLICE BLOTTER - YES, THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENED**&gt;&gt;

&gt;**TEEN ARRESTED AFTER CRAWLING INTO BED WITH SLEEPING WOMAN**

&gt;Knight-Errant on Wednesday arrested a teenager for breaking into a North Beacon Hill home last month and crawling into a woman’s bed as she slept.

&gt;The victim, on July 29th, reported to police that she was asleep, naked, in bed when she woke up and realized someone was lying next to her. When the woman told the suspect to get out, he told her “I need to sleep, please let me sleep here. He won’t let me sleep.”

&gt;At her insistence he got out bed and left the room. The victim got dressed and went downstairs to see if he was gone and found the teenager standing by the door. He told her “I need to stay here, I’m leaving town soon. I had four hundred brothers, but he got most of them already.” When the victim said no, he replied “Oh, OK,” and left.

&gt;The victim noticed the window to her room was open and the screen had been cut. A knife was on the dresser next to her window. The word, “Mixcoatl” was carved into the window frame.
KE arrested the 17-year-old at his home and booked him into the Youth Service Center for investigation of burglary. 	

I guess he wanted to love her madly, but that lovely got mad at him, right?  Right?

Screw it, comedy isn't my thing.  Here's the last piece for tonight!

Because the shadows and the streets are tough, and I know the kind of folks that listen to Seattle Tonight, I talked to some friends who talked to some friends and they came through with a tête-à-tête with premier second-story-man and retired intrusion expert Skeleton Key.  What follows is a direct audio and transcript for our listeners who might be hard of hearing.  Don't be alarmed if both people sound like me, 'cuz like I said our sound board's on the fritz, and Fritz won't be in for the next 3-5.

&gt;&lt;&lt;**BARRIER TO ENTRY: TAKING YOUR BABY STEPS INTO HOME INVASION**&gt;&gt;

&gt;Mr. ST: Good evening, Seattle! I am joined today by a very special guest, the infamous master thief, Skeleton Key. 

&gt;Skeleton Key: Thanks for having me.  

&gt;Mr. ST: No problem! Now, it is a treat to have such a skilled retired professional on the show and I’m sure our viewers would love to hear some stories about your golden days. 

&gt;Skeleton Key: No…I haven’t come here to talk about my past. 

&gt;Mr. ST:  Okay! Well then would you mind answering some questions for our loyal viewers?  Is it true that this is your first time leaving your home in over seven years? 

&gt;Skeleton Key:  Yes. But this isn’t my first encounter with the outside world.  I offer my services as a consultant and teacher into the fine arts of infiltration. 

&gt;Mr. ST:  So you willingly train criminals? 

&gt;Skeleton Key: Yes.  But only those who can find me.  My students are not street thugs. 

&gt;Mr. ST:  Could you give our viewers a little taste? I’m sure they would love to hear a lesson or two. 

&gt;Skeleton Key:  Yes, but only because I feel it’s an important lesson.  Don’t ever underestimate the danger behind closed doors. 

&gt;*Mr. Seattle Tonight stifles a laugh.*  

&gt;Skeleton Key:  That may sound stupid.  But it’s probably the most important tip you’ll ever get.   You have absolutely no idea what’s behind that door.  Even if one were to pick the lock covertly you would still run the risk of the run going completely south, and **FAST**.   You see, there are quite a lot of paranoid people in this city. Rightfully so, in fact, that booby trap doors.   I had four apprentices who learned this the hard way and I did as well. 

&gt;Mr. ST: What do you mean? 

&gt;Skeleton Key:  You wanted to hear about my golden days?  Back when I was in my prime I broke into a large office building in hopes of walking away with something big.  There was a door to the security room that I couldn’t access.  I pulled up a schematic and noticed that an out-of-order bathroom had a connection into that room.  I went in, popped the door, and the last thing I heard was a beep. 

&gt;Mr. ST: No…

&gt;Skeleton Key:  Someone had put an explosive trap behind the door.  I lost both of my hands in the blast and my team needed to sedate me and carry me out.  I, to this day, am convinced it was someone trying to murder a janitor.  But explosive traps aren’t the only things to be wary of.   People will booby trap doors with firearms, acid traps, spikes, and all kinds of other archaic means of murdering the intruder.  

&gt;Mr. ST: Did you say acid traps? 

&gt;Skeleton Key:  Yep.  Had a boy named Tim open a door to some sort of toy store and got a face full of acid somehow.  Poor kid.  Now he’s horribly disfigured and blind. 

&gt;Mr.  ST:  That’s awful. 

&gt;Skeleton Key: That’s life.  People just don’t trust locks anymore.  But can you blame them? There’s people who get paid good money to break into their homes.  Then again, if someone puts an explosive in their own home then there’s something good inside.  So, be cautious when opening doors and if you can try to get a good look behind it just in case.  You don’t want to end up dead because of a damned door.  That’s an awful way to go. 
 
&gt;Mr. ST: Well, I learned that people die by opening doors.  So, Jerry, watch your back later on tonight! Well that’s all the time we’ve got tonight. Thanks for joining us! 

&gt;Skeleton Key: My pleasure. 


That's all for tonight's show!  Double-check those doorknobs, shoot straight, conserve ammo, and never, *ever* make a deal with a dragon.

I'm Mister Seattle Tonight, signing off!

2ehqvn,14,2014-08-24,Pharmacist at Costco,TheHollowGamer1,pharmacy,https://www.reddit.com/r/pharmacy/comments/2ehqvn/pharmacist_at_costco/,"I am in my last year of pharmacy school, on rotations. I now this is probably somewhat early, but I am on the lookout for potential pharmacist jobs for after I graduate in May, 2015 (my school hosts a career fair in early september with many chain pharmacies holding pharmacist interviews that same day). 

My question is this: I am thinking I would like to work for Costco. In the state I am in, our Costco does not have a pharmacy owned by costco because state law does not allow for corporately owned pharmacies. I have worked in an independent pharmacy for the last 4 years. Due to reduction in hours from my independent pharmacy hiring too many interns, I needed to find a second job to be able to make rent, etc., and I picked up a limited part time job at Costco in their front end (cashiering, assisting cashiers, whatever else the store needed me to do), and during the interview process they told me the only reason I was even invited for the interview was because of my pharmacy background. I do not have a strong desire to stay in my home state (which is unfortunate because I have a lot networking that I have accomplished with my involvement with the state pharmacy association, and could probably get a job almost anywhere in the state because of that). Can anyone speak to me on the hiring process for costco for pharmacists? I still have my employment with them and just on an educational leave of absence. I have heard many times that Costco tends to a hard place to become a pharmacist at because they tend to have low turnover. I know I have enjoyed working for them as they treat their employees very well (great benefits, closed holidays, great pay, etc). Also, I have seen some rumors of a new Costco that might be opening around the time I would be getting licensed in the area I am interested in moving to. 

Thanks for any advice or knowledge from anyone who can help. "
2ei6ni,1,2014-08-25,My (Distant family included) family is disturbingly confusing (Extremely long),Caramalized,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2ei6ni/my_distant_family_included_family_is_disturbingly/,"So, I'm going to set the scene, I am a young male adult, young enough to be on a school football team. I do the normal hormonal things a teenage boy does. Mess around with friends, look at girls, try to get with those girls, etc, but from what I've realized I have a very distinct family. Both on my Dad and Mom's side. I'll start with my Mom's. My Mother is Hispanic, and in where Hispanic culture parents are foundation of life and deserve the most respect one can give. My Grandma was a very strange, deluded woman. She'd make threats to my Mother and her brother's because she had made up this situation in her head and threat to kill her self at some points. You'd think my Grandpa would have some say but he was a man, and that was his wife, he did everything in his power to stop her but it even continues to this day. She blamed me and my sister at least twice from stealing from her, don't get the impression that we are dirt poor, but money was never an issue in our lives. My Grandma chooses favorites and it is my most successful uncle. For privacy reasons I'll call him my Uncle E. He is an engineer that owns his own company that goes to hospitals and repairs CAT Scanners and other equipment. My mother does Financing and has a good job, and when I mean financing, it's actual financing, not as small as an accountant but she isn't a Financial team.  Uncle C, Uncle R, and Uncle M all have just as good or better jobs. Now that I've played out economical statuses, here it gets juicy, my Grandma has a house that was inherited from my Great Grandmother to her. The house was at least worth 200k US dollars. My grandma goes and puts my Mom's name in for the property when she married my father. but recently she put my Uncle E's name in, my mom wouldn't have gotten mad if it was anyone else because my Uncle C is having issues with his wife and that is a greater problem. Instead she gives it to her favorite Uncle E (My relationship with my Uncle's is not a bad one but I was kind of butt hurt, knowing 200k dollars was given to an almost multi-millionaire man. This got the whole family angry. My Uncle M decided to step out of line and he confronted her about it but was put to shame to an old Hispanic 70 year old woman and her sick excuses. If the youngest of my uncle's doesn't have say then what is her only grandson going to do? My Mom's side is my favorite even though it's governed by some sickened old lady that does what she pleases. My Father's is a roller coaster. I have my Aunt. D Uncle A. (Her husband) Uncle Y, Aunt N, Uncle S. All siblings but my Uncle A. My parents are divorced, So I live between 2 houses which is bad for me playing football. I can't show up to practices and sometimes I have to get notes from my parents for whole weeks. My father is Middle Eastern, refugee from Iraq when Saddam Hussein came into power. Him and my Aunt D left for Italy where they lived half of there Twenties in. then moved to Michigan. They got enough funds from the UN to help and from making money to go to where I currently live. Money was never an issue for this side of the family either. My Uncle A met my Aunt D and married having 4 kids, 2 girls, H and T, and 2 boys J and D. They are all cool people, but they all have defects. H is too liberal of a person (if that makes sense) and she only knows her parents when she needs money or someone to pay her car insurance. T is someone you look up too, she was in the Peace Corps for 2 planned years and 1 improvised one, My father's words not mine: ""She is a good person, too good of a person. Ever since she learned about the rest of the world in the state it is, she wants to help them."" It worked because she got an Internship working with the UN in Washington DC. D is a poor soul, he is the youngest but he is running on financial aid and is intimidated about the things I find in everyday life. J is a college graduate with a Master's in computer, but is an ""Asshole"" according to my father because of him constantly backing out of his promises with his parents and Uncle's and Aunt's on his father's side. My Dad is considered the bad guy. He is an schizophrenic, it's controlled but sometimes he is crazy. He lives in a privileged mostly Mormon/white neighborhood where the houses start at 7 figures and end at 8. He does things that aren't as acceptable to everyone else like demanding and cussing at everyday people that work in whatever establishment. I try to keep myself at home the most when I'm with him because I don't need him yelling at someone because of his attitude. I'm viewed by my Aunt's and Uncle's from my father's side and even my Uncle A's Brother's and sister's and mother as a miracle. Like a gene went off and I'm nothing like my father, but I'm also nothing like my mother. They look at me with praise, and particularly one person is a bit of a rival, my Cousin's cousin. He is everything like me, physically, but not mentally. I'm not a show off but I'm better than him, in terms of grades, social standing, and knowledge. He is a dumbed down version of me and it shows. My Father makes it loud and clear whenever we have a unity of a bunch of family at his house over 20 people, telling them about me and how I work and that I play football for a school that constantly gets scouted and so on and so forth. I'd like to get into detail, but I must go. I'd like to be given advice and closure and what I should do. Sometimes it is very stressful and gets to me. Thank you for taking you time to get here, have a delicious day."
2ei9os,1,2014-08-25,Just some of my thoughts written out.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2ei9os/just_some_of_my_thoughts_written_out/,"I aspire to do so much that I feel overwhelmed and can’t do anything. And this just feels like a crushing defeat. At this point it feels like I continue to live just so I can say I am. I haven’t felt happy in months. I turned to alcohol to help. I thought this elixir of happiness would help with all these negative emotions, but it only revealed how shallow the meaningful relationships I thought I had were. 

I needed attention. I needed help. I won’t deny that, I was in a dark place in life, faced with so many roads, so many choices; the weight on my shoulders was overwhelming. It started in January, and continued on for months and months until the weight peaked when my relationship ended. I was broken then and still feel broken now. 

I’m still struggling to learn to live for myself. After living for someone for almost two years it’s hard to learn to live for yourself again; how to be independent, and be happy on your own. I miss Kaylee. I can admit that, I miss her with all of my heart. She was my best friend, and I was closer to her than anyone else. I told her things about myself I had never told anyone, even before we were in a relationship. 
I just don’t know what to do with this weight. I have done so much for myself this summer in an attempt to remove the weight, but it barely lessens no matter what I do. Every time I succeed in some way, something else happens that knocks me back down. Down into the whole in which I fell, and have been trying to crawl out of. 

I felt worthless. My grades were going down; I was struggling with weight and confidence issues, and was rejected at every company I tried to get a job at. The only thing that kept me going was my relationship. Kaylee made me feel like I was worth something. 

And then my best friend walked out of my life, much like I had walked out of my best friend Rachel’s life. I had no job, no close friends, no best friend, my GPA was horrible, and I was 240 pounds. I was lost in life. 
I found myself with some help from friends. They held me up until I remembered how to stand on my own. And suddenly all of these people who I thought meant nothing to me, meant everything to me. A coworker from my previous internship went out of his way to find me a job at the same company. His name is Ari, we were friendly, and he is a well-liked guy at the office, but I didn’t think we were ever close in a way that would warrant him doing this for me. It was then I was reminded you don’t need a reason to do something good for a stranger. 

I started to get back in shape. I had started even before the break up, trying to take the first step. After the break up I went to the gym with this idea that if I got healthy I could get Kaylee back. When it became clear that wasn’t going to happen I started to go because I thought hooking up with girls would fill a spot in me. It did for a while, being able to say I got with so and so, or we hooked up at that place.  But I don’t have a particularly high sex drive. I’ve never been concerned about having lots of sex, because in my experience sex without an emotional connection is just boring (maybe I’m doing it wrong). 
At this point I’ve lost around 50 pounds in the last couple months. I dieted and exercised my way down. A lot of people are jealous that I could just lose so much weight, but I didn’t necessarily do it in a strictly healthy way, limiting my calories to sometimes under a thousand, even though I could easily burn a few thousand calories a day. I just need to keep the weight off this time. Continue to eat healthy and exercise and I should be okay. 

This accomplishment is still outweighed by all of the other weight I feel. The pressure to succeed and be successful, the pressure to constantly be entertaining and likable, but also understanding and caring. This pressure to be confident, and walk around with my head held high, not to show the cracks lying just under the skin. 

Kaylee once told me she was amazed at my confidence and wished she had the confidence I had. To which I replied, I fake it. I’m not that confident a person; I just put on a show for others. I don’t think she understood the gravity of my response at the time, but I feel like at that moment more than at any other time she saw a piece of the real me, whether she knew it or not.  
I often think of the book “the Catcher in the Rye” when I think about my life. As big a cliché as that probably is for someone my age to say, it’s true. I think about Holden, and how he deals with life. He just takes off. Goes on his own adventure. He has these goals in life that are so unmaterialistic, so pure. I feel like I would get along with Holden, until I remember how phony I am, and how much of me is fake. On an unrelated note, I swear Sum 41 wrote a song about that book and Holden, Walking Disaster seems like the musical version of that novel. 

I like my job. I’m working as an advanced engineering intern, which is not as fancy as it sounds, but sure as hell looks good on a resume. My coworkers are great, all nice guys who want me to succeed. But lately I’ve just felt like a fuck up at work too. I was put in charge of a couple large products, and for circumstances largely out of my control these projects have been a mess. I’m writing an award application, and have been for the past few weeks. We don’t stand a chance to win the award, no matter how much I spin the application, no matter how dressed up I make our part, it’s a plastic fucking spacer. We’re competing with companies like Tesla who are revolutionizing the auto industry, and you want me to succeed and win an award talking about a plastic spacer. My boss has been a family friends for a few years now, and acts as an almost mentor to me when I need someone. He wholeheartedly believes we are going to win this award, or have a good chance at least. This knowledge that we’re not only not going to win, but that I am going to let him down sucks. 

The other project I’m in charge of is this big ass machine that tests these plastic parts I am writing about. The machine however has been broken all summer, so I haven’t even begun work on the project; I’ve spent weeks trying to fix it with the help of my other boss. I just feel like I’ve wasted their time and money for a whole summer. 

I miss Rachel. A lot. I tried to fix things with us this summer, but I think I just made them worse. The timing didn’t help, when she realized I was just out of a relationship it might’ve felt like I was crawling back to her. I guess in a sense I was, although I had tried 5 months earlier to talk to her and start to fix things in January, although truth be told I had ulterior motives even then. I was struggling with Kaylee, and actually planned to break up with her that January, but thought maybe if I could just talk out these feelings I had with someone who understood my situation better I could move past everything and continue to be okay. 

Long story short I didn’t reconnect with Rachel, and I didn’t deal with the feelings and problems that had caused me to want to end the relationship. It wasn’t Kaylee, it was just me trying to cope with everything in life at once. I chose to just not cope, and live through Kaylee, to pretend my problems didn’t exist. And of course this wore the relationship down until it broke off. 

But I spent the summer trying to reconnect with Rachel, the girl who for a long time meant more to me than anyone else. The girl who I had to stop talking to because my heart was so torn between her and the girls I started relationships with. But my attempts to reconnect ultimately failed. I was so caught up in my pity party I lost myself even more for a while, and realized that the man who she’d fallen for was not the man who was crawling back to her to try to open our friendship up. The man who came crawling back was desperate for attention and needed approval. 

She gave me what I needed, but I think in the process I just pushed us farther apart. She would respond to my texts and talk to me. But it wasn’t because she wanted to, it was because I needed her to, and she cared enough to help me when I was in need. 

She left for college and a part of me felt empty. Even though I hadn’t seen her in a long time, it wasn’t until she left for college I realized how much she had meant to me, and how important she was to me. It wasn’t until she truly was gone that I wanted her back in my life, and not just for attention or because I needed approval, but because I actually genuinely missed her. 

The song semi-charmed life always makes me think of her, and I can’t for the life of me figure out why. 

I’ve gone off on so many tangents I don’t really know how I got here from where I started. It feels good to write these thoughts out. It feels good to let people know what I’m doing and what I’m feeling. I like being able to share without making an emotional connection with someone that will lead into something more, it feels good.

2eiac1,2,2014-08-25,Dreading my senior year of college. In dire need of advice.,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2eiac1/dreading_my_senior_year_of_college_in_dire_need/,"Deciding to come on here with this was difficult, and my thoughts are pretty scattered. But I'll try to be as concise and comprehensive as possible.

I've been depressed for a number of years now, pretty much since I started college in upstate NY. (It may have originated in high school, which I attended overseas), but really started to gestate once I moved to the U.S. for college).
Had serious thoughts about transferring my sophomore year, but was distracted by internship opportunities and commitments to my college band. Since high school, I've always had issues with putting my societal pursuits in front of my sense of self (along with self-esteem/introversion struggles)--i.e. being a 'yes man,' engaging in a plethora of extracurriculars, et cetera--and it seems this was finally catching up with me. Sure, I love(d) drumming and was doing well on paper in my compsci major, but I always felt like an outsider in band, ostensibly didn't have any true passion/interest in my major (besides liking physics/math and having done fairly well in an 11th grade Java course), and got through most of my college experience smoking weed in fluctuating quantities (mostly alone, given my introversion) to the effect of only exacerbating a boring-town, cliquey, ~80%-white environment arguably weak-suited for a third-culture, socially conflicted individual like myself.

Second half of sophomore year: quite a paradox, in retrospect. Did a part-time, on-campus internship in a program part-run by a nearby large IT company. Selected as the drummer for an NCAA tournament band. Entered and exited with a 3.9 GPA. And the semester before, I secured a summer IT internship at an F500 company. But I was miserable. (Having to let go of marijuana that semester for the upcoming internship was probably a factor.) But all in all, I just hadn’t found any social/cultural/philosophical niche at the school, and it catalyzed (or even created/contributed to, I’m not sure) a disconnect between my pursuits/triumphs and my grasp/understanding of life and self. And there were some other factors as well, like having had a shitty, passive-aggressive housemate that year.

So that same semester (S2013), I decided to study abroad (F2013). I thought it would provide the perspective realignment I needed to better/differently embrace this environment I’d struggled so much with. But things only seemed to worsen. I subconsciously saw the experience as an ‘escape’ more than anything, rather than, say, a unique opportunity to learn and grow in a very different environment. (Likely something I subconsciously took for granted as well, given my existing experience with living in and visiting various countries growing up—namely in Africa, from which my parents are.) I had many unique and memorable experiences and interactions during my semester in Europe, but it was all clouded by not-yet-fully-diagnosed depression, and my ‘letting go’ of the fact that I had any sort of life back at my college. Too were numerous negative experiences produced by the manifestation of that mindset.

Come S2014 semester. I returned, and began to fall from the cliff whose edge I’d put half my feet over in Europe. Courses got harder, and I’d become weaker. Ultimately had an 0.2 GPA drop, and I trudged mediocrely from previous extracurricular commitments (e-board position, band/ensembles, service fraternity)—even took hiatuses from them for most of the semester. All while hiding my marijuana crutch much less than I had in the past, committing social suicide in a lot of senses, and feeling very much like I wanted to leave, even though I also felt an obligation to ‘make things work’, ‘prove myself,’ and such.

And then, this past summer. I was supposed to return to the company I worked for last year for another internship, but ended up backing out due to this and health complications with my mother. I used the time to seek therapy and try to develop skills/mechanisms to cope with both my college-environment issues and personality. Therapist mainly concluded that I suffer from severe depression, based on MMPI-2 results. 

Unfortunately, despite my strides, most of the summer saw me being stagnant, motivation-lacking, and above all, still dreadful of the prospect of returning to my current college. Now, with a little over a week before classes start and less before I need to move in, a big part of me is fed up and thinks the change I really need must be found at another college, but I have about 3 semesters worth of courses left, and ambivalent senses of commitment to my extracurriculars (which I certainly shouldn’t care about as much as I do, but it’s a bit complex for me), and even a few friendships, despite my struggles hitherto. Making these calls has been incredibly difficult for me; I’m already missing band camp and have fraternity dues to submit, et cetera, but I’m experiencing a huge decision-making block. My family has suggested that begin the semester but withdraw before the tuition refund deadline, formulate a plan B in the process, and simply say no to the things I don’t really feel like doing (band, etc.)—which I’ve already sort of begun to move toward. But please, Reddit, I am in desperate need of some more insight.

We both have really strong feelings for each other.",throwaway83654,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2eit0z/me_19_m_with_my_first_girlfriend_19_f_of_15_years/,"Hello Reddit.

I'm not a proud man, i'm not the man my girlfriend has deserved.

I have fucked up and right now i'm in a situation there i could either fuck up more, or take my losses and leave. I however have a hard time deciding what i should do.

Let's begin with some backstory:

About 1,5 year ago i met my girlfriend, we are both eachothers firsts, and madly in love. At this time i was just coming out of my socially awkward shell, starting to socialize more, going to party's, etc.
We were really close from the beginning, both our first kisses were about 3 dates in, and i took our virginity after 1,5 months. However, now that i look back, i was not allowing myself to love her as much as she loved me. I didn't do it on purpose, but somehow i was always afraid of really letting myself love her.

4 months in in the relationship i got an internship and was away from her for 3 weeks. Under this time some doubting thoughts about the relationship came up. Maybe it's normal (honeymoon period over?) maybe it wasn't. But i decided that i wanted to be with her. And at this time i really started to let myself love her with all i had.

2 months after that, about 6 to 7 months into the relationship i came home from a night shift and was really tired. When i joined my girlfriend in bed to go to sleep we started talking for a bit. I don't remember exactly how it went because i was really tired, but somehow i said that a 3-some was something that i wanted to try sometime. If you count in that i just minutes earlier said that my co-worker (who had another job so it was just one time) was kind of attractive, she took it as i was suggesting a threesome with her.

This ofcourse made her really upset, and i regret that i said that to this day.

Several things like that have happened in this relationship. Here is a TL;DR as she said it to me just days ago while we had a fight about me wanting to have some alone time while she had PMS &amp; her period:

""You hurt me, you don't respect me, you emotionally cheated on me and you are an egoistic asshole""

Enough backstory for now.

Right now, Reddit, i'm in a situation where i could do 2 things. I will list them here and discuss them later:

1. Enroll university, leave her and we with a broken hearth and never see her again.

2. Stay here, move in with her (at least for a couple of months) find a job and work for a year

As you maybe understand, i really don't know what's best.

My girlfriend said that i can move in with her if we fix things, she wants me to talk with somebody about our problems and just wants me to become a better person.

To me, this sounds like a fair deal. But somewhere, a part of me is telling me that even though she cries about the fact that i maybe will choose university, it will be best for her if i break up with her. That i have done enough damage, and hurt her too much. That she deserves a better man than i have been for her.

But another part of me wants to try to fix things, be the man i always wanted to be for her. ditch university so i don't have to leave her. Have cuddles with her, tell her everything will be allright.

Reddit, what are your opinions about this?

**tl;dr**: I hurt my girlfriend a lot, now i don't know if the best option is to stay and move in with her, or take my losses, let her get over me, and enroll university."

*Sidenote:* I would post in /r/SuggestALaptop but it looks comparatively dead.

I'm currently in a Software internship and in 3 weeks I'm going into 2nd year Electronic Engineering, and my laptop is on its way out. Its an Acer Aspire 6930G that I've had 5+ years - expensive at the time but it's lasted me well so I'm comfortable to make an investment in my new laptop if I know it'll last me.

It'll be running stuff like MATLAB, IDEs, Photoshop, Video Editing and PSpice but I tend to have lots of programs open at once and 50 Chrome tabs at any given time, and I want it to run like butter while doing so. I cycle in to work at the minute so I don't want a huge screen, 13-15"" MAX. That also means I'd like something quite light and I guess thin. Other requirements include HDMI and VGA out, and an SD card slot.

Money is no object *to a certain degree* in the sense that I'm willing to go upwards of €1000 (I'm in Ireland) if I/you can justify it, and also in that I want it to last at least 4 years without becoming annoyingly slow.

**So** that brings me to my search. I'm stuck at a few places. I love the speeds that SSDs bring, but laptops containing them are rare enough. And are they worth the price? I'm also somewhat stuck between a Mac and a Windows machine - I'm tempted by the longevity and smoothness of Macbooks, but I've been Windows and Android all my life and all my software is aligned as such. How well does Bootcamp actually run big programs? I've heard of problems with some engineering applications. Another pull factor of Macbooks is the battery life - I'd love to go a full day of lectures without a plug socket. Should I worry abut discrete graphics? I'm not sure how well the Intel HD integrated graphics fares as I have no experience with them. 

I look forward to any help and suggestions and would be extremely grateful for your replies!"
2ej96j,2,2014-08-25,"Me [24 M] and my ex [21 F] of 1 year, broke up over the summer, I am stupid for wanting her back?",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2ej96j/me_24_m_and_my_ex_21_f_of_1_year_broke_up_over/,"Hi reddit,  




So, we dated a little over a year and I would say the majority of it was good and passionate up until the last month we were together. A couple of things mixed up at a bad time: job stress, housing problems...etc. and I became very distant and it lead to a lot of fighting. It wasn't the first time we'd fought by any means but that last month in particular was plagued by silly arguments.  




The breakup finally came about when she left to go out of state for an internship. A couple of days before she was set to leave, we got into a really bad argument and what came of it was me asking for a break during the summer so we could figure things out. She wasn't happy about it at all but she said we could give it a shot. About a week and a half into her internship she called me to say that she wanted to breakup with me because she couldn't forgive me for not trying to work things out. She had tried to patch things up a couple of days after she left but I was in a very bad mood and ultimately decided to just end it.  




After that we kept in touch but kind of sparsely. Some days we would small talk for bit but other days we would just fight all over again. I would say I was the most distant during this time and she had the majority of the initiative. We had long periods were we didn't talk at all but we tried kept in touch about once a week, roughly.




During the last of month of so or her internship I started noticing a change in her behavior. We hadn't talked for about two weeks and I noticed she had posted some pictures on facebook and made them private so I couldn't see. That didn't bother me at first but over time I started feeling suspicious. Despite being broken up, we had agreed about a month before she got back that I would pick her up whenever she got back into town. I still had things of hers and the plan was to return them that same day. Anyway, an exact week before she returned we got into a really bad text argument. She asked me if I ever cared about her, talked about some problems she had, we got into an argument about the breakup, who did what, whose fault it was…etc., basically nothing constructive and we stopped talking and all she said was she would let me know when she was back in town so I could get her things.  




Two days before she got back, I noticed on her facebook that she had gone on a trip with another guy to another state and I immediately un-friended her on facebook. I was really upset and asked her if she was seeing anybody but she denied it. When I asked her about the hidden pictures she said it was an accident and that I was making a bigger deal out of it than it was. When I asked about the trip she said she was going with friends and they would be visiting different states. Whatever it was, that day I finally realized I still had a lot of feelings for her still and went into an emotional breakdown.  




When she finally got back into town she tried to get her stuff back on the same day but I didn't have my phone on me so it would have to be next. I tried to meet her face to face but we couldn't coordinate it, part of me feels she was being evasive (and with good reason). She said she was with her friends and I know for a fact the same guy that she went on the trip with also brought her back into town but whatever, I wasn't trying to open that can of worms again. I put all her stuff in a box and left it outside her door, also left her a note saying I wanted to see her.  




She finally replied two days after and we've been talking every day since, very friendly and polite and mostly through my initiative. I don’t know if she’s talking to me out of pity or what but part of it feels genuine. I still have feelings for her and she said if she noticed things changed we could get back together. Whether that is really true I don’t know. I don’t really care if she was with somebody else during that time since we were officially broken up.  



She says she wants to keep talking to me but I don’t know where that will lead. I still love her but I don’t want to get hurt again. I realized I hurt her the same and most likely led her to do whatever she did, if anything at all...    




So, am I in the wrong for wanting her back? Is it pointless to get back together? Does it sound like she is trying to move on? Any advice is most welcomed, sorry for the long post. Thanks!  




**TL;DR;** : Girlfriend and I broke up, she may have seen somebody else in the meantime, now possibly trying to get back together

Throwaway as I've been posting a few things here.

I've been doing motion graphics as a freelancer for almost 4 years. 
I'm also occasionally shooting and editing videos.

My question is, how much should I rate for my projects? 
I never had any experiences working in a company, doing some internships etc.. so I don't have any idea of how much my work is worth.

I live in France and for me a pretty good month is a month where i'm reaching the 3.000€ mark (before taking out 25% in taxes)

I thought it was really okay as I come from a low income family, but lately i've looked at the rates motion designers are invoicing in the US and UK and the numbers are just INSANE. 

Any help would be greatly appreciated, i'm getting a bit tired of working my ass off and having some financial troubles at the end of the month..

EDIT : Should my price vary also depending from the clients I had? I mean, a Motion Designer who's gonna do some work for CBS or Coca-Cola will obviously ask more than one who's doing some work for a local shop.

Cheers!

I'm sort of in a pit right now and trying to climb out of it, wanted to try reaching out here. The TL;DR of this is, basically, help! (Said in good spirits, but writing from bed in an apartment I haven't left in three days so, in all seriousness - help.)

Basically, I've never had a job before and now I'm hitting a depressive crisis, what do I do?

History of depression and endless eating troubles (binge eating etc) and low self-image.

Last Monday I sort of reached a tipping point of seeing myself as fat and growing fatter, panicked over this, told my boss at my internship / startup job that I would be working from home. I've fallen back into this pattern of obsessing over my appearance and thinking that The Most Important Thing I Could Be Doing is fasting, detoxing, isolating and improving myself physically. 

I don't know if work is part of this - I think it might be. I recently started working at a startup on the business side. My boss, in a display of confidence in me that's probably really complimentary on some level, went on vacation and left me in charge of building our marketing and PR efforts - which is something totally beyond what I'm capable of. 

(I know that's unrelated just-life-stress but I feel like if I have a history of falling apart that those extra stresses could affect me?)

So I've basically disappeared from my job and I'm struggling to concentrate through the sadness / feels / self-loathing to continue working. I don't know what to do in this situation, when this is a long-term issue, and all things like medication and therapy have been pretty much exhausted. How do you manage work and being suddenly pulled under?

I feel like I’m at a breaking point and need to make a decision within the next couple of months, so any advice would be appreciated. This is a throwaway account and I’m gonna try to keep a lot of the details out to keep this as anonymous as possible, but still include enough info to describe my situation.

For full disclosure, I'm a 20 year old guy from the USA.

I thought how my mom treated me growing up was fairly normal, if not a little strict. Looking back, she was probably a little (or a lot) narcissistic and controlling, as friends seemed to have completely different experiences with their parents. If I ever wanted to have friends over, she was ""too exhausted"" or ""too worn out"" to deal with it, and if I was allowed to have people over, they were eventually banned from the house because my mom was ""sick of being used as a free babysitting service."" This led to a lot of social alienation as a kid that I feel like I still deal with to this day. In middle school, I got accused of doing drugs if I missed assignments or got in trouble in class. I was a smart kid who was still getting all As, but struggled a bit in that regard around the ages of 11-14. It was also a problem if I ever wanted to go to movies with friends, even if parents were there. or heaven forbid, talk to girls on the phone, as I ""just wasn't old enough to handle that."" I also made a Myspace page without telling my parents, which, when found out about, was about the worst thing I could have done. I had ""permanently broken the trust"" and ""put the family at risk"" by ""putting myself out there on the internet.""
  
The older I got, the worse things got between my mom and I. I played trumpet in the pit orchestra for the musical my freshman year, but decided I wanted to give being on stage a shot. I ran the idea by my mother, who responded with “You don’t really think you’d be good at that, do you? You just want to be the center of attention again, you can’t sing or dance,” and then when I continued to say that they taught you all those things and I already had some experience with singing, she said that I still couldn't because it would interfere with schoolwork. I did pit orchestra my sophomore year, but tried out for stage anyways for junior and senior years, and got a lead role both times. Of course, my mom reveled in all the attention she got from audience members and other parents simply for being the mom of one of the leads, but at home, I still got the ""you need to stop doing the musical because it's interfering with your schoolwork"" even if I got all As. My high school (to my mother's delight) had a website where all grades for all assignments in every class were posted, and this was used as a weapon to scream at me or lecture me about how I was using my time.

Anything I was doing, I wasn't focusing hard enough on my schoolwork, regardless of my grades. Things like making that Myspace page got brought up years later as an example of why I couldn't be trusted, had bad judgement, and was impulsive. If I wanted to spend time with friends, I had no respect for the family's schedule, I didn't care that my mother ""stayed up until the wee hours of the night"" (11:00 at the latest) waiting for me to come home, worrying about me, and I didn't care that she ""had to get up at 5:30 every morning with no break"" (her choice, she was a stay-at-home mom and a morning person). And if I apologized for something, I was never sorry, ""You're just sorry you got caught."" If I didn't apologize, I had to ""remember who you are talking to.""
Learning to drive was rough, and since she didn't have control even brake lights on a car in front of us was cause for screaming. While learning to put the car in the garage, I accidentally hit the corner of the garage and dented the front bumper and headlight. All I got was screaming from both parents, who were in the car. There weren't really any words said besides ""God dammit"" over and over again. This was kind of a breaking point, and I felt like nothing I ever did would be good enough. I considered suicide for the first time that night, and to see what it felt like, wrapped my hands around my throat (knowing this probably wouldn't kill me.) I stopped, and my mom came in a few minutes later. ""What are you trying to do, kill yourself?"" she said, and walked out. My dad came in about a half hour later to tell me it was just a little bit of damage and we could fix it, but it wasn't really about the car. 

I dealt with all the yelling and insults for the rest of high school, and when college came around I went off to a nearby state school to study engineering, which I didn't know much about and didn't really have an interest in, but would be my field of study because both my parents had engineering degrees and it was the ""only guarantee at a job"" after graduation, which is not entirely untrue. I spent the first year and a half trying to figure out what I was doing, bringing up several ideas of majors to them and asking them what they could possibly lead to, but all I got was a ""those fields won't get you anywhere! do you want to be living paycheck to paycheck?"" or ""you just want to be in that field because that's what everybody else is doing, because it's more glamorous than engineering"" or because it was the ""easy way out"" (these fields were Environmental Science and Business, and I only asked my parents what their opinions on the field were, and never said I was going to switch out of engineering). I eventually decided on computer science, which my mom approved of to an extent (although I should've just gone with electrical engineering, which she majored in and can do ""all the same things as a computer science major can and then some"").

While at college, I discovered alcohol and marijuana, which I used to help cope with the stress of never being able to live up to what my mom wanted me to be. I wasn't involved in enough activities, my dining hall job was a waste of time, my 3.5 wasn't high enough. When I was drunk or high, the names my mom
Finding housing was a nightmare. There is a major shortage of university housing at my school, and my mother insisted that I lived in the dorms sophomore year, so when I got a relatively early sign-up time I called my mom to tell her what was available, which at that point were only single rooms. My mom knew the price of those rooms was higher than normal, but told me I shouldn't worry about the price and sign the housing contract for the experience of living in the dorms. Ever since then, the story is that I ""coerced, tricked, and pressured her"" into agreeing to paying for the single room and letting me sign the contract. It got even worse when searching for housing for junior year. University housing was too expensive and not guaranteed for upperclassmen, and landlords for off-campus housing were shady, and no other student I would sign a contract with could be trusted to pay rent on time and ""my parents would get stuck footing the bill for the whole rent."" I offered to pay some of the rent myself, but this was shot down. 

Things hit the fan when I brought up living in my college town for the summer. I asked if I could pay for all my own rent and food, and live in town while working my dining hall job and possibly taking a class. ""It's not worth our money to pay for you to take one class! And what are you going to do living there, just drink cheap beer with your friends? I won't allow that! Who's going to buy you a car!?!"" (Every place I would need to go in my college town is within walking distance) ""Who's going to cook your food?"" (I know how to cook) and ""Who's going to pay your cell phone bill?"" (I didn't realize paying for my cell phone would be required if this happened, but I could make it work if need be). I just kind of shut myself down from there, and delved deeper into the partying to deal with the stress. I was having suicidal thoughts again at this point, but didn't tell anyone and didn't come close to acting on them.
Of course, a few weeks into the second semester of my sophomore year, shit really hit the fan even more. To keep a long story short, after a day arguing over the phone with my mom I had a really rough night out partying, which led to hospitalization and later charges from the police (won't go into too much detail here). My mom was livid, to no surprise. ""How could you do this to me? I put every ounce of my being into making sure you stayed off drugs and you still ignored everything I ever said! I'm paying for you to get an education and you don't even care, you're throwing it all away!!!!"" My dad didn't have much to say other than to talk to a lawyer. From this point on, my mom was driving me back and forth to college every day, and every car ride I just got told how much of a shock it was that I had been drinking or experimenting with drugs, about how much this hurt her and how much of a burden it was on her to support me through that, and that she could never do it again because it was so hard on her. All of my friends were ""criminals"" for drinking underage with me or doing drugs, despite her admitting to drinking underage when she was younger and hinting at a similar substance-fueled meltdown.
I started going to therapy at that point, told my therapist everything that happened, and he suggested that it was possibly my parents who had the problem. He told me to keep coming to sessions, which I did for the remainder of the semester. I also joined a support group to deal with the substance abuse issues.
As far as the legal side of things went, I got a sentence where if I successfully completed a year of probation, paid a fine and did some community service, I would never have a criminal conviction and would get everything cleared from my record, which I felt was extremely lucky. I'm currently six months into it, and hoping to get an early termination soon. My grades stayed relatively fine through the whole ordeal, I maintained around a 3.5 but had to drop one of my electives to keep up with classes while ""commuting.""
This summer, I took another class at my university, followed by working at the dining hall some more while ""commuting."" My mom bought me a parking pass to actually drive myself to school in the fall, but I don't know if this will actually happen since my mom is ""worried about me driving alone at night"" and about me driving around the campus now. 
At this point, I feel like I will never be back on my own, as even before my incident I got very little distance or independence. My bank account is a joint account with my mom, even though all the money is mine, and there are times when everyone needs to stop what they're doing so she can sit down and watch me balance my checkbook and approve it to make sure I did it right. If I casually mentioned I left my laptop in my manager's office, I ""didn't care about her, my laptop, or her money"" since it was a gift, ""i had no respect for her rules"" because she had told me not to leave my stuff unattended before, regardless of the fact that there is almost always a manager in that office, and ""mentioning that reminds her of how she felt"" the day I called to tell her about my incident. If I got sick, both my parents were sick of the ""medical drama"" and I must be getting sick because I ""stay up too late"". I just want some freedom and a sense that I'm making my own life decisions and not letting my mom call all the shots, and for some support when things go to shit.

Don't get me wrong, I'm extremely grateful for all the financial support, and both my parents are doing a lot for me in that regard. But at some point I feel like the financial help isn't worth constantly feeling like I'm worth nothing as a person if I don't figure out my mom's plan for me without her telling me, because anything that isn't part of it is an attack against the way I was raised, and if I do do anything good, it's only because it was her idea, or I was forced to, etc. I am paying for all my books, a small portion of my tuition, and I did pay for my entire ER bill, which wiped out my entire life savings. I was able to save up a small amount of money working this summer, but not enough to buy a car, pay my own rent, or get out on my own in any way, and nowhere close to enough to pay tuition myself. My mom now doesn't want me to get an internship, as they feel the money isn't necessary at this point and that I can get experience in my field in other ways. And to top it all off, I'm not even sure I'm in the right field. I don't know how much longer I can do this. I know I should probably wait until I'm off probation to do anything, and I definitely don't plan on going back to experimenting with drugs to drown out my problems afterwards, as that has caused much more harm than good and kept me from dealing with the real issues here.

So I feel I'm left with three options.

1. Cut off contact, find a place to stay and ride out the semester, and then get student loans and tough my way through maybe three more years of school. I have no idea what this would mean for my finances, but I would rather avoid debt if possible (although I'm open to the idea if I could make it work). My parents won't fill out FAFSA, and I probably wouldn't get anything anyways. And I would still be left trying to arrange housing and food. The last thing I need is to run out of money or ruin my credit on top of everything, but it could bring me some peace.

2. Take a leave of absence from school, get out on my own, and work for a year and save. I still might end up having to take out student loans if I cut out all contact, but I'd have more leverage with a bit of money in the bank. I could also supplement my income with music, as I play guitar and trumpet and my college town has a pretty solid music scene. But especially in the computer science field, a ""leave of absence"" from school could be devastating to future career prospects, as I understand. And I don't know how willing software development companies would be to take on an intern for a year rather than a summer, and pay a decent wage that would allow me to support myself and pay for school. I also feel that working for a year would give me the best chance at figuring out who I really am and what I really want to do with my life.

3. Suck it up and deal with my parents for the next three years, possibly be stuck at home for the rest of college, and never draw a line in the sand. This is definitely the smartest option financially, but I honestly don't know if I could handle doing this for the next three years and not have another breakdown and make things worse for myself. I also feel like if a line in the sand doesn't get drawn now, there will never be any respect or boundaries and I will continue to be controlled for the rest of my life.

So anyways, sorry about the rant, and thanks for any advice that might be given.


tl;dr: Mom is controlling and possibly an N, and I'm at a breaking point. What do???

I have a TS/SCI with CI poly from an internship with a federal agency in my junior year of college. It's still active because I've been volunteering but I'm having a super hard time finding a job that utilizes it without requiring 5, 8, 10, whatever years of experience. 

I graduated college in May with my BS in computer/network security (3.5 GPA) and have been working since then but my job doesn't need my clearance. I'd like to find something that uses it because I've really bent over backwards in order to keep it active. 

Does anyone have any recommendations for employers for cyber security? I've tried USAJobs.gov but I'm not a veteran, so I get passed up for pretty much everything.

So far I've tried most of the big contractors like Booz Allen, ManTech, Raytheon, McAfee/Intel, Northrop Grumman....

I also live in Delaware, so... that doesn't help either. I'm willing to relocate.

Any advice, guys? I work overnights right now and it's killing my social/family life. "
2ekl7m,6,2014-08-25,I fucked up with a girl and it's all my fault,throwaway_cockblock,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2ekl7m/i_fucked_up_with_a_girl_and_its_all_my_fault/,"Oh, I feel so shitty about it, my first time on offmychest, hope that writing about this situation will help my feel better. If you have any advice, it is welcomed.

TL;DR: I met a girl which I wasn't initially attracted to, even though she was hitting on me, but gradually fell in love with her, but she seemed to lost interest in me. Now I think like a pussy, because I had good situation to sort out if it will work out.

So anyway, last month I was on student internship abroad (I'm living in Europe BTW). There were a lot of people there from my country, because  it is organized as a yearly event within international scientific collaboration. The internship itself was very cool, in fact there was little studying and lots of partying. I met a girl there to whom I wasn't initially attracted. She was more like a cig-buddy (I started smoking again after few years break and she was always eager to go out for a cig). She was also very friendly to anybody, I on the other hand was acting little assholish, yet in a funny manner.

So a lot of alcohol was drank, because vodka is very popular where we were. The internship lasted for 3 weeks and after about 1.5 week I started noticing that this girl was hitting on me (well, at least best to my knowledge, I'm shitty at taking clues). Like I said, she was nice and quite cute looking, but I wasn't interested so she stopped hitting on me after few failed attempts.

Time flew, I started to like her more and more. She is a very positive person, hate to complain about anything. It turned about we had many character traits in common: both love travelling, she is very independent, has quite a good job to support herself during studies (I trait I really find as positive, because my last gf was in just a big baby that needed constant attention). 

Back home we study in different cities, but I though that despite that, we could somehow be in LDR after going back if thing would go good.  So I tried to give her clues that I'm interested, but for what is seems, she rejected any idea of us to have anything romantically in common. I wasn't really plain straight about what I think about her, it was more like flirting.

Last weekend in the internship we had a trip to the country's capital city and after that we managed to stay there for a night, because she was going back home by a bus, which was leaving late in the evening and I had a plane, so us two and few more people took a room in a hostel instead of going back to institute city and then again to the capital city. 

During a trip, we were talking about our hangovers (a farewell party was going on last evening) and I said to her: ""Shit, I think my liver is not gonna make it this month, we party a lot here and in the next month I will attend the bachelor party and a wedding"" (to clarify, in my country people drink a lot on weddings). So she replied: ""Oh, that's nice, are you going to the wedding with anybody?"". I said: ""No, but you can come with me if you want."" I knew she would not, because my hometown where wedding was taking place is around 5-6 hour trip by train from city where she is studying. Have in mind that in Europe it a significant distance, unlike in the US. So she replied: ""Yeah, I would love to."".  We discussed this next day, I asked if she was serious (because most of our conversations were conducted in joking manner). She said that as long she will be able to have free time at work, she would love to see my hometown and so on. I said great and after few hours had to leave to catch a plane, so we gave each other a hug and said goodbye. 

And then, after coming back to my house, strange thing happened. I could not stop thinking about her. From the distance I could see how a great person she is and even though I wasn't initially attracted to her at first, now I though that she has very cute face, great sincere smile and so on. It almost drove my crazy, I wasn't really expecting that I would miss her so much, because we were seeing each other every day and I treated her company as given. Wedding reception was in three weeks and we talked few times by phone and on Facebook, but from what is seems, she wasn't really keen to talk with me and initiate conversations.

So the wedding was last weekend, we were going to my hometown by train and met on the station in the middle of the trip, where trains from our directions meet and then we traveled to my hometown. We had a lot and lot of fun at the wedding reception, danced, almost all my best friends were there and I think everybody really liked her and we got a lot of questions from people treating us as a couple, even though I told her that she is just my friend. It was a little awkward, because either I or she had to clarify that we are not together to many people. 

Well, from my heart's point of view, I just felt worse after the wedding party. I again tried to hit on her, but I'm really bad at it, so it must has been awkward for her. My biggest regret is that I didn't make a definitive move on her to indicate my romantic interest and it's the biggest regret that I now have. I think she either: is shy and as clueless as me about seduction (she never mentioned any bf when we were talking about our past lives) or just treat me as a good friend. Or she doesn't want to be rejected again and just to be safe is not indicating any interest in romantic relationship.

But that's the worst, I cannot be her friend. I'm not able to. I think I fell in love with her and it would be counterproductive and even dishonest to act just like as a friend and secretly being attracted to her. I do not approach many girls or get romantically involved, mostly because I rarely meet a girl that has an attractive personality. I can't remember anyone that I be so happy talking to, we talked a lot about our lives, growing up, how each of us is seeing himself in the future etc.

So today I came to the city where I study, we parted our ways on the same station where we met earlier. I called her to see how was her travel and now I'm feeling like shit. I'm basically ""cockblocked"" myself, because I didn't think that I like her enough at the beginning of the internship to reciprocate her flirting and now I can't stop to fucking think about her. I don't know what to do. It is possible that I see her in the next month and I will definitely see her in October, because there is a conference where we will present our (little) scientific work performed at the internship. I though about telling her next time we meet that I can't continue friendship with a person I'm romantically attracted to . If she really is still interested in me, it will turn out fine and if not it will be easier for me to move on and not stay in the friendzone.

Dear redditor, if you managed to read it all despite my shitty English, thank you for your time.

How can I avoid being the inconsiderate girlfriend roommate?",killinnnmesmallz,AskMen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/2eksih/my_boyfriend_asked_me_to_move_into_his_apartment/,"To make a long story short, my boyfriend and I have been dating for about three months. We are incredibly compatible and already expect things to continue long term. I confided in him that I'm having a very difficult time finding an apartment for the last four months in my city (I'm moving in December for an internship), and he has offered several times for me to stay in his apartment. I'm afraid I'll have no other choice, and I'm also worried that his two roommates will find me a nuisance. I know the roommates well and we have absolutely no issues. But I know that when they signed the lease they did not expect to have an extra roommate, let alone a female one. 

So Reddit, what can I do to make sure I pull my weight around the house? Also, what amount is best to contribute for rent (They each pay $900 per month for the place)? Most importantly, what should I avoid doing (like eating all their food)?"
2ekzkl,4,2014-08-25,Bed bugs have fucked shit up,Coltron0,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2ekzkl/bed_bugs_have_fucked_shit_up/,"A bit of back story:

I've been living in my apartment for over two years now.  The first year being with my now ex-girlfriend, the second year being with a couple of guys I met through craigslist.  Now, most people think of craigslist and shutter in regards to finding a decent roommate, but I've actually found great luck.  The first guy was a Mormon college kid doing an internship for a few months, and the second guy ended up becoming one of my better friends, and is still currently my roommate.

Things have been great at the apartment.  It's definitely not fancy in any means of the word, but it's cheap and within walking distance to a lot of bars and other activities.  I've never had any real problems up until recently.  And that problem has been bed bugs.

For anyone not familiar, these bugs basically crawl into every crease and nook they can find, feast on your blood at night, and reproduce like crazy, and that's exactly what they've done in my case.  My current roommate has spent little to no time at the apartment anymore because of the fear of spreading them to other places, and instead has been staying at his girlfriend's.  This is understandable, but has left me pretty lonely since I have limited friends in the city. (I'm a transplant with a fairly introverted/shy personality)  The other few friends I have have shown their reservations in coming over.  Once again, I get it.

The exterminator came last week and did his treatment.  He also bagged up my mattress, where most of them were concentrated.  Since then, it has gone from a constant crawling sensation while I sleep back to how it used to be.  Yet my roommate announced this morning that he's been looking at 1 bedroom apartments, and after further talking to him, it was because his girlfriend was paranoid that the bugs would return.  Now I'm left with the option of living in my two bedroom by myself, which isn't really feasible due to my fairly humble income, find another roommate on craigslist, which scares the shit out of me (my luck is bound to run out sometime) or find an entirely new place to live.  All options make me anxious as hell.

I figure I have about a month or a month and a half before he'll be out, and he's assured me that he still wants to hang out and do things together, but I can't help but get a bit sick to my stomach thinking about it.  I've been dealing a bit with depression and anxiety issues already due to a long term break-up that happened a few months ago along with a bit of financial strain, so it's definitely not something I was expecting or wanting to hear this morning.

I've already made a list of goals and how to better myself prior to this, so I guess my game plan is to just add it to the list.  I've been doing pretty well with my accomplishments lately as well, and I'm sure I can get through this as well, it was just a bit of a step back I wasn't expecting.

If you take anything from this, don't take bed bugs lightly.  They are hard to get rid of, and they put strain on your relationships.  Seek professional help as soon as you can, you won't regret it."

i just want to talk to new people, maybe make some friends, who knows!

i'm an intj, for what it's worth, so... human interactions aren't my forte but i will try my best and if i like you, you can be sure that i'll have conversation :) i enjoy reading, food (sorely missing french food and cheese at the moment), going to my school's ice hockey games (i got hooked last fall when i moved to the states), music (my taste ranges from uk indie to kpop, but alos some electronica and top 20 pop... eclectic!), and, uh, wasting my time on the internet?

i'm an international business major if that's of any interest and currently interning in marketing. also a great tech/web/etc aficionado.

2elp1v,0,2014-08-26,I need some advice about handling a rough breakup… should I keep trying to make it work?,[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/2elp1v/i_need_some_advice_about_handling_a_rough_breakup/,"I (23, F) broke up with my SO of 3 years (27, M), 3 days ago. It was very hard for me, and I'm wondering if I made the right decision. If I could get some perspective from you ladies, that would be extremely helpful. 

The first year of our relationship was awesome, the second was pretty good. During the third year of our relationship, we moved in together as a temporary thing, for about 4 months. Around the same time, my dad passed away and I found out that I have a chronic autoimmune disease. I'm also a Ph.D. student, so I was trying to balance keeping my grades up with all the personal problems I was having. My boyfriend had also recently started a new, very high-stress job, and had also had some health issues. 

I was pretty depressed after my dad passed away, and would sometimes start crying or be irritable at seemingly stupid things. After 2 months of this, my boyfriend got freaked out and started emotionally distancing himself. He stopped holding conversations with me when I got home from school, stayed on his phone whenever we were alone together, and stopped doing the small nice things that he used to do at the start of our relationship. He never asked me how I was feeling, and would tell me to get my shit under control if I was having a bad day or randomly crying.

I asked him why his behavior changed, and he denied that it had- he'd tell me I was just imagining it, that I'm too sensitive, or that I'm looking for reasons to be miserable. This made me feel bad about myself as a person, which made my emotions even worse. We also argued a lot about daily things like cooking (he had no interest in helping with cooking or dishes), and our very different sleep schedules. I started noticing that we have different values- since he started his new job, he became pretty focused on status symbols, like fancy cars and designer sunglasses, and talking about how we should move together to whatever area would allow us to make the most money. 

In the last 3 months, I've been living out of town for an internship- I recently moved back to the city we both live in. While I was gone, I realized that I felt much better about myself. I had nice conversations with my roommate, made new friends, and was a generally happy, cheerful person. I only felt depressed or sad on the weekends I spent with my boyfriend. I tried going out of my way to do nice things for him to bring the love and affection back, but had no success with that either. 

So I broke up with him. I've been feeling very sad and lonely, and have been thinking about the good times in our relationship. I know that he does care about me very much, even if he didn't show it in the way I wanted. I also think that if I could have handled my emotions after my dad died better, he wouldn't have pulled away from me. I feel like being sad means that he or other people won't like me anymore. 

On the first night we were apart, I called him and told him I was sorry and wanted to try again. He was drunk, and told me to talk to him about it later. Since then, he has been texting me and asking me to meet him to talk about trying to work things out and get back together. To me, it still sounds like he wants to get back together, but still doesn't understand what I want from him, or why I wanted to leave. 

What do you think, TwoX? I know the general rule is to stick with your gut with breakups, but he really was incredibly sweet and loving in the beginning of our relationship- so I know he has the ability to be a great partner for me. I'm scared and lonely, and I'm wondering if I should have tried harder, or done something differently. Should I try talking to him again about making things better, or should I cut him out and try to figure out my own life? 

TL:DR: broke up with emotionally distant boyfriend, now he's asking about trying to fix things, unsure where to go from here"
2elt4w,1,2014-08-26,Tied down by several commitments and feel like I'm suffocating.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2elt4w/tied_down_by_several_commitments_and_feel_like_im/,"There are several places in my life where I feel tied down by someone or something....and I just feel stuck. I have too many commitments and all of them weigh me down in some way. 

First off, I'm in a play. This play was an opportunity to get out of the Midwest and take the show to New York with the help of a kickstarter. The rehearsals started out fine...until I realized that I just don't enjoy theatre anymore. I only have a month left and then it's over...but I wish I could just stop now. It's not fun anymore. The only word I have to describe the experience is lackluster. As sad as it is, it was a passion of mine previously but not anymore. This is a problem because my best friend wants me to be a part of a start up theatre company. I love him with all my heart but I can't be a part of it anymore. This will absolutely crush him if I tell him. 

Secondly, I am about to start teaching professional choreography with my old dance teacher in high school. While I think this is still a passion of mine, I am out of shape, feel pressured, and feel tied down before it has even started. She signed me up for four shows because she's pregnant and having a baby right when all the shows start. It's a lot of pressure after being out of the dance world for a year and a half. This will continue solidly till February. But since I made a commitment and since she is pregnant, I feel like I really have to keep true to this commitment.

Third, my job is a retail position at a high end clothing store. I just graduated from college and feel like I've failed in someway to be stuck in retail. I applied solidly for about three months and this is the only thing I could get. It's not as bad as it could be. Closing is actually cathartic and restocking makes the time go by really fast. However, I have been messing up what feels like constantly and I don't fit in with the girls that work there. I don't look like them or act like them. They are nice, but they make me feel small and treat me like I'm a child that can't handle herself. I try not to think about it but the idea that I'm not actually making any kind of difference bothers me the most. I am dealing with a bunch of things that are temporary in this world. None of the work (restocking, processing and adjusting clothes along with directing people towards certain sections of the store) really makes a difference. I'm not helping anyone in the way that I want to. Since it took me such a long time to get this position, I feel like I have to keep it and I really need the money. 

Fourth, My family. I live in my parent's house, stuck to the limitations and obligations I had when I was a child. They treat me like I'm four years old. Forced me to go to their church for several weeks (even though I wanted to go to a different church)....and long story short, it's put a dent in the ""family relationship"". It's awkward on Sundays. It's also a topic that cannot be openly discussed without shouting or argumentative responses. I want my own space. A space where I don't feel judged in my own fucking home. 

Fifth, I love my friends. I really do. One of my best friends wants to get the hell out of the midwest and so do I...but since I know I'm going to be stuck here for awhile, considering my commitments, I'm trying my hardest to enjoy my time here. She makes that near next to impossible. She talks about wanting to get out every day and I really don't know how to be positive about the midwest when I'm constantly being told that I should get the hell out and go with her somewhere.

Sixth, I took on an unpaid internship that is virtual. However, it's been a lot of time for little reward. Like most internships are...except this one has felt way more self-serving for the company. Getting a certain amount of Facebook likes, required fundraising, and super strict about scheduling meeting times (not being flexible at all). It's turned one of my favorite passions into something I've started to regret taking on. 

How do I change this? How do I get by without feeling like I am dying inside? I feel like if I died tomorrow, I would have died at such a terrible point in my life. Where I feel lost, sad, and unsure of myself. I want to experience a lot in this world and time is limited. I don't want to keep waiting and waiting for a day that I can finally do what I want. I want to start now. I want to go now. 

For months, I've really wanted to go on a bike tour across America. It's something that I think would help me immensely. Getting out of my comfort zone, meet new people, find beauty in America and give myself time to myself to write, find myself, and be at peace. I want to get on my bike right now and leave in the middle of the night. Never coming back to this shit show. 

How can I just be me? That's all I want to be."

Here is a catch 22 situation

I have been living a single life for one year now in Europe. Recently met a very sweet girl who is in my town, let us call her Petra. Petra is 25 and an awesome person to know. We met each other over a cup of coffee, went to a concert and a couple of dinners. Things have moved fast and we have kissed for long and made out. Not slept together yet. She is here on a short term internship and will be leaving town in next 12 days for another country in Europe. I am not sure what she is thinking or what the future will be. As of now, I like her. We have kept it light, no serious talks. I write poems, so i wrote one for her.

Now, there is another girl, let us call her Reza. Reza is also 25, we met 3-4 months ago and we slept together as we spent 2-3 days meeting each other. She took me out for a long drive. We have been in touch since then, simply as friends. Reza and I live in the same country but different cities. 
Reza is coming for work to my city and might be staying at my place again for 3-4 days next week.

I am not sure what to do?
 Should I say no to Reza?
Should I talk anything with Petra at this point of time?
 Do you think Petra even cares about what is going on in my life?
Or should I just go with the flow and see what is happening?

Wise people:-) please say a thing or two. More often than not, reddit is right.

She was my first actual relationship, my first kiss and the woman I lost my virginity to. This last summer however I had to move up to Washington to do a 3.5 month internship and that is where things went downhill.
The first 2 months were fine we had our good and bad moments but nothing serious just long distance problems. Then she started hanging out with some old friends who got her into drinking again. She stopped drinking when we got into a relationship because I am not a huge fan of it and she knows it (I never personally asked her not too so I don't sound controlling). She immediately became super distant once she started spending time with them, she stopped calling, cut our facetime's short, wouldn't text me for extended periods of time. A lot of the people she was with were guys who I personally didn't like because one of them I knew had a crush on her. I confronted her several times with how I felt during this because I felt very uncomfortable being so far away with her getting drunk with a bunch of guys at parties. She said she understood but said I was being controlling and needed to trust her so I did.
Then about 4 days before she was supposed to see me she calls and tells me at one of the parties she kissed one of the guys. I almost broke up with her then because I was so upset but I decided that I would give her another chance. She came up to see me and things seemed to go back to normal. We have been back a couple of weeks and she told me that she loves me and is my best friend but we need to take a break in our relationship. She says that she wants to marry me one day but thinks that she isn't in a good place for a relationship at this time. So I agreed to give her some space to think things through but we agreed we would talk but now she is hardly texting me and keeps saying she is ""busy"" all the time but when i ask her what she is doing she says stuff. She actually is busy right now with soccer but a part of me thinks she is avoiding me. I have seen her a couple nights and she falls asleep saying how tired she is then the next night she stayed up very late with the friends I don't like camping, she has done this twice so far, Now when I talk to her she is aggravated and seems manipulative. She says this is a time in her life where she is changing and needs to discover who she is, says I am the perfect boyfriend and I haven't done anything wrong yet everything I do seems to be wrong. I am just so confused right now I was planning on proposing to this woman within 6 months but now it seems my future isn't with her.
I love this woman more than anything and she is amazing and has been so good for me these past few years but this change has been so detrimental to our relationship. Am I stupid for staying in this relationship? Should I give it time and see if she will come back? Should I just try to end it altogether and come to terms that I wasted the last two years of my life with this woman? I have never felt more alone in my life than right now"

I'm currently in university and am considering purchasing a new suit. I've decided that the suit should probably be a 'nicer' suit (compared to my cheap as chips current suits) and I'm hoping it'll be able to take me through interviews, internships and hopefully to work (fairly conservative profession). So, I've narrowed it down pretty much to a navy suit from either suitsupply or MJ Bale

I guess I was hoping for advice on which supplier you guys would go for? 

Obviously with MJ Bale I'll be able to try on the suit first, but if I was to get a suit from them, it makes more sense to go for the 2 for a grand deal they run. $1000 is a LOT of money for a uni student though. On the other hand, the suitsupply suit will run me 499 + shipping but I won't be able to try it on first.

Thanks so much and if there's any other options I've missed feel free to let me know!

I'm seeking an entry level position as a web developer with a company that can help me expand my knowledge, experience, and skills. I would love the opportunity to work more with HTML5 and CSS3.
  
3 years Visual Studio  
1.5 years C# experience  
1.5 years VB.NET experience  
1.5 years using SQL &amp; SQL Developer  

To be specific, I have worked on a handful of websites, most of which were already existing. In one example, I would mainly write queries and use DataGrids to display and manipulate data for Business Analysts to view. In another example I created a site from scratch that called on the Google Analytics API to allow users to create ad hoc queries, which our marketing team used to view data for many websites at once. A few other projects were simple batch jobs helping clean up large amounts of data.

Projects I have worked on outside of my internship have included MVC, HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, JQuery, and Java as well, just enough to be familiar.

If interested or have questions, please PM me or leave a comment and I will be happy to send you my resume. Thanks for your consideration."

2endaw,2,2014-08-26,[Neat Find/Information Request] Vintage Seiko Diver,[deleted],Watches,https://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/2endaw/neat_findinformation_request_vintage_seiko_diver/,"To make a long story short(er): I was fortunate enough to be in Nicaragua for an internship this past summer, and although I wasn't planning on finding anything of horological interest, on my very last day in the country, I found a vintage (maybe a better word would be retro?) Seiko diver at a market stall. Although it is very beat up, I thought that it had a lot of character and seemed to be in working condition. So, I splurged for around 5 bucks.

Now, I appreciate Seikos very much, but I must confess that they are not my primary interest/specialty and that I know very little about them. After a little digging, I determined that this is an example of the 6309-7049 diver. According to [this](http://www.csce.uark.edu/~jgauch/photos/seiko/) site, my particular watch was produced in April of 1982.

[Here](http://imgur.com/a/yffGe) is a photo album with a few pictures of the watch in question. It is extremely beat up, as you can tell, but it seems to be keeping time quite well, within 30s or so per day. If anyone would like to input some views on topics such as 1) overall impressions, 2) potential for restoration, and 3) potential resale value (either pre/post restoration), I would greatly appreciate your comments and advice.

I think at a minimum I will take some Polywatch (or something of the like) to the crystal to clear up the scuffs a little bit. I don't feel particularly inclined to sell it (and I'm sure it's very poor condition wouldn't help much...), but there does seem to be a considerable collectors' market for this kind of thing, so who knows - maybe it would be useful for parts, or someone would like to restore it themselves.

Thanks!"

Bond Name | Suggested Action | Reason
:--:|:--:|:---
[Ashley Greene](http://www.hsx.com/security/view/AGREE)|**PASS**| No future project dates set
[Bradley Cooper](http://www.hsx.com/security/view/BCOOP)|**SHORT**| Next project American Sniper (trading at ~$40) will be replacing Silver Linings Playbook ($130+)
[Benicio Del Toro](http://www.hsx.com/security/view/BDELT)|**PASS**| A small Escobar documentary will be replacing his Che documentary...no real movement
[Chadwick Boseman](http://www.hsx.com/security/view/CBOSE)|**PASS**| Looks like Gods of Egypt is trading close to his current TAG...so it probably isn't going to move a whole lot
[Chris Pratt](http://www.hsx.com/security/view/CPRAT)|**BUY**| The new Jurassic Park will in all likelyhood be his next adjustment...replacing the $8 Movie 43 is going to mean a lot of $H to be made
[Craig Robinson](http://www.hsx.com/security/view/CROBI)|**SHORT**| Hot Tub Time Machine 2 will be taking the place of the most recent Shrek...no brainer...HTTM2 is not going to come near to the $230M+ Shrek did
[Dan Aykroyd](http://www.hsx.com/security/view/DAYKR)|**PASS**| No dates set for future projects...but watch for the news on Ghostbusters 3
[Dave Bautista](http://www.hsx.com/security/view/DBAUT)|**PASS**| Kickboxer doesn't have a release date set
[Daniel Bruhl](http://www.hsx.com/security/view/DBRUH)|**PASS**| No dates set for future projects either
[David Cross](http://www.hsx.com/security/view/DCROS)|**PASS**| Kung Fu Panda 3 will be trading with Kung Fu Panda 2...probably not a lot of movement.  Only catch would be if an indie film he is attached to slips in between now and next Christmas
[Donald Faison](http://www.hsx.com/security/view/DFAIS)|**PASS**| No future projects with him attached
[Djimon Hounsou](http://www.hsx.com/security/view/DHOUN)|**PASS**| UNLESS YOU ALREADY OWN IT - Vatican tapes is taking the place of Tempest and you may stretch a couple extra $H if you hold longer.  If you need the cash though, don't hold it.
[Glenn Close](http://www.hsx.com/security/view/GCLOS)|**SHORT**| Hoodwinked (~$50) will be coming off the bottom of her TAG to be replaced by a movie currently under $1
[John C. Reilly](http://www.hsx.com/security/view/JCREI)|**PASS**| Life After Beth is trading with Carnage (both under $5)
[Josh Gad](http://www.hsx.com/security/view/JGAD)|**PASS**| The Internship and The Wedding Ringer will be trading places on his TAG with little movement according to current trade prices
[Joey King](http://www.hsx.com/security/view/JOKIN)|**PASS**| No dates set on future projects
[Karen Gillan](http://www.hsx.com/security/view/KGILL)|**PASS**| No future projects with releases set
[Kate Hudson](http://www.hsx.com/security/view/KHUDS)|**PASS**| Two sub $1 movies trading on her TAG
[Lee Pace](http://www.hsx.com/security/view/LPACE)|**PASS UNLESS YOU ALREADY OWN**| If you already own this stock...then it makes sense to hold to grab a few extra bucks when the final Hobit runs it's course...otherwise the commissions may not cover the $5-$14(max) growth
[Michael Douglas](http://www.hsx.com/security/view/MDOUG)|**BUY**| The highly anticipated Ant-Man is his next project, taking out the Wall Street sequel
[Melissa Leo](http://www.hsx.com/security/view/MLEO)|**PASS**| The Equalizer will be taking the place of Olympus has Fallen...might be a few dollars to be made on the short...but Denzel can still potentially bring a crowd
[Mike Myers](http://www.hsx.com/security/view/MMYER)|**PASS**| No projects with release dates set
[Octavia Spencer](http://www.hsx.com/security/view/OSPEN)|**SHORT**| Octavia Spencer will no longer have The Help on her TAG once Snowpiercer cashes out...should be a hefty drop.
[Rachel McAdams](http://www.hsx.com/security/view/RMCAD)|**SHORT**| The Vow will be coming off her TAG when the new Cameron Crowe movie comes out early next year
[Robin Wright](http://www.hsx.com/security/view/RWPEN)|**SHORT**| Even if The Congress doesn't report box office, the Everest movie coming next year is trading well under Moneyball
[Sylvester Stallone](http://www.hsx.com/security/view/SSTAL)|**SHORT**| After the beating Expendables 3 took at the box office...it is a safe short 
[Tate Taylor](http://www.hsx.com/security/view/TTAYL)|**PASS**| No future projects with release dates set
[Viola Davis](http://www.hsx.com/security/view/VDAVI)|**PASS**| Two small (~$5 or less) movies swapping out on her TAG
[Vin Diesel](http://www.hsx.com/security/view/VDIES)|**BUY**| The newer F&amp;F installments have blown the older ones out of the water at the theaters...safe to say FF7 should outperform the 2009 FF4
[Willem Dafoe](http://www.hsx.com/security/view/WDAFO)|**BUY**| A small increase is likely with John Wick (trading around $30) replacing Out of the Furnace (~$10)
[Zach Braff](http://www.hsx.com/security/view/ZBRAF)|**SHORT**| Video Games: The movie has about $20k in box office reported so far...will be a big drop with Chicken Little coming off
[Zoe Saldana](http://www.hsx.com/security/view/ZSALD)|**BUY**| The Book of Life (currently ~$60) will be taking the place of The Words ($11)...means about a 10% gain possible"

Although I am an introvert, it was too much aloneness for me, and I was pretty depressed. And then magically one day I got assigned a summer intern, and although he's a few years younger than me, I just got along with him really well. Better than any of the other people I've worked with. He was like my friends from undergrad (the few people I am really close to), and he was so easy to talk to. He made me laugh a whole ton and I just thoroughly enjoyed spending time around him. So for the summer I've felt like I've had a friend, I haven't felt so alone, and I've been happy while at work. Even when I was there long days, if he was there making me laugh I was happy. But now he's leaving, and it's going to be so damn hard to go back to being alone. I've been crying (at home) because I just can't handle going back to that. I don't know what to do, because even if I apply to grad school this cycle and get in, I would have an entire year again of working in isolation. Working with him made me feel not alone.

2ep0t5,4,2014-08-26,"I accidentally revolved my whole life around my (ex) girlfriend, and now really have no one to call my friend or know what to do from here.",Levion687,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/2ep0t5/i_accidentally_revolved_my_whole_life_around_my/,"I won't go into too much detail, but when I moved here last summer to go school I met this girl. I should of left from the beginning and never bothered after being told countless times she is not good for me, but I got sucked in anyway. She was attractive in the bad girl type of way and couldn't stay away no matter how much we did not get along and always fought.

Anyways, we recently broke up and I now don't have anything to do. No one to hang out with. I was so absorbed in her for a year that I never made friends outside of her, went out to meet people or be social. The people I would somewhat associate with began to not like me because her rude personality rubbed off on me and I still have it of being overly rude and angry sometimes.

After still somewhat talking and hanging out, I realize I need to let it all go, but I can't because I have no one here. I have no one to hang out with, I have no one to sit around with and joke about the day I had, or see how things went in their day and for them to ask me how mine was. Though, I still need to let her go though, and am slowly working on it. I mean I have my roommates, but I haven't had time to get close with them because of her and now school started back up and I have a new job so I'm never here.

Hell, my new job is an internship in my major so I'm thrilled with that. When I'm there working I'm fine. Everything is off my mind and I work. It's probably the first job I've had where I don't want to leave and enjoy working.

I would work out again, but I don't really have time and when I do I would rather sit and rest for a bit. I have a cat I got recently which helps with the sense of loneliness I feel. I feel happy and more at peace not being around her since we would always fight.

I don't know, I'm 21, having a beer to myself and all I really got to do is sit here and study and watch movies by myself. I have bad anxiety and am anti-social at times so it makes nothing better.

I don't know if I really have a reason for posting this. I suppose I'm looking for advice, a place to vent, or a place for someone to just read it."

Somehow for 3.5 years, despite living together for 1.5 of those years, I've managed to keep it a secret by never being drunk in front of her, and never having much alcohol in the house.  There was a time when I thought that I had it pretty together despite being an alcoholic, but I can now see how far below my real potential I had been living.

After returning home after an 8 month internship, my gf has noticed what she has called 'amazing changes' in self improvement.  She has told me that she's always had a high opinion of me and my drive, ambition, patience, etc., but now it seems like those qualities and many others have increased tenfold!  Since she hasn't ever been aware of my drinking problem she isn't aware that I'm now sober, but she has seen real changes in me, and it's been a huge boon to my confidence and determination to stay the course!

I'm 46 days happier, healthier, and more focused. Thanks to everyone who's been helping me on my way!"

2epdb1,1,2014-08-27,Xenophobia vs. Pariah (An outsider's perspective),Bouda,goth,https://www.reddit.com/r/goth/comments/2epdb1/xenophobia_vs_pariah_an_outsiders_perspective/,"(I had a mod strike down my post from earlier about being bullied. Spent a couple nights on this instead. Critical thoughts welcome.)

Xenophobia vs. Pariah 

(An outsider's perspective)

We are all aware of the interests of the night family. We all know that we want to build a safe community, strengthened by our bonds of friendship and love. 

We are a dark people, and we embrace that which makes us so. We keep our family close and our enemies beneath our boots. 

We are a secret people, one to never judge those who seek shelter from the light, for the light holds many other forces that we cannot reveal ourselves to. 

We are a strong people, able to band together to leave a mark on this world and a name for our community, leaving it a better place than we had left it. 

We are a sacred people, sharing and taking life and energy in forms that perpetuate the cycle of existence.
 
We are the otherkin. We are the hidden world. We are the night. 

This is what we stand for and who we are. We are a nation of outcasts and debutantes, rebels and conformists, blue-bloods and rabble, vampires, were creatures, faye, and other various monikers. We are a community of our own, and we stand for our own. That is what the creed of every night creature should be, but, unfortunately, things don't always meet this status quo. There are two main things that we are guilty of, that as otherkin, we need to be aware of. 

Xenophobia

""In simplest terms 'Evolve  or Die' hence; we are more concerned with quality over quantity.""-The Gotham Archives, The Anthology, NYC

The sheer scope of what we are, and the power that we possess, is fantastic in both its origin and its application. That we should wield such tools may be fundamental to us, but may not be to others that are not of the kin. These -mundanes- may be fascinated, repulsed, or otherwise terrified of what we do. When witnessing what we are capable of in our own realms of power, we can be quite....overwhelming. Therefore, it was necessary over the course of the years to develop a method of decorum. This became known as many things throughout the nation. It was known as the Black Veil, the Mask, the Seeming, the Shade, etc, but they all came down to one thing: keep your nature a secret. 

This in turn spawned a new way of thinking. In order to maintain the secret of the otherkin, laws were enacted throughout the groups. Among these, which can be used as a model, were those laid down by Father S.T. In Gotham, NYC in the late 90's. They were first known by four tenets called the Black Veil, but later expanded to 13 laws that Gotham still adheres to today.  

The forging of this document would later start a wildfire of groups that would pop up all over the nation. All forms and codes of law were adopted from the same model. Although the laws were different in wording as well as in number, they remained, at their heart, the same. The most important stricture of them all was the adherence to secrecy. It was because of this, that the first major change in the cohesion of the community took place. 

In many ways, the change was a good thing. It kept the rituals and practices of the otherkin out of the spotlight so that they could do as they pleased. However, the only thing that this served to do was to stagnate membership. While some of us were free to move about our various circles, others, who had already awakened to their nature, were left to wander alone, with no sense of community. True, there were those that would find us by other means, but the main form of internship was through members themselves introducing the newest initiate. That's how many of us became involved in this world in the first place. However, because of the severe restrictions placed upon us due to secrecy, the world became even more closed. This is what some of us would refer to as social xenophobia. 

This condition still exists in various circles today. Rather than explain what and who we are to various interested parties, who may just be one of us in disguise, we become tight lipped and belligerent. This is one thing that has led not only to the exclusion of new members, but to the eventual departure of our current members as well.  Without the input of our own people, mundanes are left to their own ideas about what we do. Stereotypes appear, fears appreciate, and ignorance abounds about us, and, though this helps to keep us hidden, it does not give anyone a clear picture. Think of those not yet brought over. Think of the confusion this could cause. 

While the social xenophobia still exists, there are those who do want to reach out to the others in this reality.  Whether for a sense of purpose, charity, or supply of troops, these others still strike out to seek new initiates into the ranks, and thus we can grow. However, they are met with such animosity that this creates a chaos within the community itself, and could lead to a possible sundering. This must not be allowed to happen. Our beliefs and ideas are unique and individual. That is what makes us enlightened beings in the first place. Those that want to seek out new members should be allowed to do so. For, in truth, the same ideas from those already in the world for several years, will only lead to the same results. Stagnation must also be avoided, so, new ideas must be introduced. To do that we need new members, but the secrecy restrictions prevent us from doing so willy-nilly. Thus, we have the first paradox. Now, let's move to the other that is plaguing us.

There have even been some examples that can be found in the home city of Austin. One in particular involved an individual (whose name has been withheld for confidentiality) who wanted to be included in the courts of Austin. After paying the monthly dues to the court, this individual was denied entry to any event due to a series of misunderstandings. According to the doctrine and bylaws of the court, there should have been a trial for this person so that the elders could determine if exclusion was necessary. As there was no council, and the head of the community was slightly uncomfortable with what the initiate would say, there was no trial, and there has still not been. This initiate, crying for a place with us, was denied a spot in their own hometown, even Haven, and was forced to go over an hour away to find a community to accept them. This goes against the court's personal laws of Haven and the idea that they preach of radical inclusion. This is a direct contradiction, and again, must not be allowed to happen. This brings us to the second point that we need to discuss.

2epf21,67,2014-08-27,"According to my boyfriend's [22M] mother, I [22F] am not ""marriage material"" (~3 years)",throwawoway,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2epf21/according_to_my_boyfriends_22m_mother_i_22f_am/,"**tl;dr**: Despite my best efforts, my worries about my desi boyfriend's mom disapproving me came true. What do?

---
I didn't grow up in the best of situations. My parents had a relationship that ended up in financial ruin, and sickness because of strong disapproval of my dad's side of the family. 

My narcissistic grandmother harbored ill-will toward my mother ever since she and my father tied the knot, and since then, spent the rest of her life manipulating the local Korean community against her. Combined with the emotional abuse you would imagine happening in some crazy Cinderella themed Asian drama, the stress got to her and she ended up with a pretty severe autoimmune disease.

After my grandmother's death, my mother gained the strength to divorce, and though we had rough times financially, both of us pulled through. I'm now in college with high hopes of my dream career on the way, with my supportive and amazing boyfriend (we'll call him **Gohan**).

Gohan is amazing, smart, and ambitious, and is bound to have a great career. He's still in school, but has been financially supporting himself for the most part from the pay he gets from his internships. Gohan usually stays in a dormitory while he's in school (or in an apartment when he's in an internship), but up until September, is staying at his parents' home in our hometown.

We were high school sweethearts, and I think our relationship is wonderful. We're both all about trust, communication, and lots and lots of cuddles. Every issue and argument we've ever had ended up with compromise and cuddles. Both of us grew and learned together, and despite both of us being young, I really feel like we have something serious.

---

Now onto the issue, my boyfriend's mom (**Chichi**, for crazy) has a strange mix of conventional and unconventional characteristics of a typical Indian mom. For example, she would be overly protective to the point of calling the police if he blew off her calls or texts for a day, while at the same time, not caring about his attendance record or marks at school. 

Gohan has two older siblings (**Vegeta** and **Lazuli**), both of which are living their own lives at this point and have relatively fruitful careers. Over the years, I've gotten close to Vegeta and his girlfriend, **Bulma**. Initially, Chichi hated Bulma because she was not a citizen in this country and because of her looks, but has recently come around to accepting her because of her academic accomplishments and good background.

I knew that Chichi was rather ridiculous, and I was prepared to get her approval from the start. Whenever I saw her, I would doll myself up and be on my best behavior. I would send her holiday cards and occasionally give her a small gift. I would go above and beyond in treating her with respect, and to a degree, I helped get Chichi to trust Gohan more in his decisions.

Chichi, after approving Bulma, and Lazuli's fiance, wanted to have me over for dinner and to talk. I thought I was ready for the talk, and with the silent support of my boyfriend, I pulled through the night. Since she was all smiles, I thought I left her with a good impression.

Boy, I was wrong.

---

About two hours later, Gohan called me to have our usual bedtime talk. I was really curious about what she thought about me, and asked him. I had anticipated that my background would be cause for concern, but I never anticipated the other things Chichi said about me.

Chichi thought I was not fit for marriage. Why? Because she came to the conclusion that not only was I from a bad background, I was not smart enough, I would be a terrible housewife/mother, and I would never go very far in my career. Additionally, she thought that he was settling for me simply because he was too lazy to find another woman.

Gohan was confused. Half of these answers couldn't have come from the conversation we had that night. Sure, she had asked me about where I wanted to go, what I was doing, and asked me some questions about nutrition (my program is health related), but every question I had questioned ended with a wider smile and an acknowledging ""Perfect.""

He asked her how he had come to any of these conclusions, and she wasn't able to come up with an answer to any of them. She said she just knew.

---

Gohan and I were close friends before we dated, and I openly expressed that I would never ever want to be in the situation my mom was in. He told me he wouldn't want me to be in it either.

After realizing how crazy Chichi was earlier on in the relationship, he said he would cut off contact with her if she caused me (or his future SO) distress. He had also told me that spending long periods of time with her was suffocating, and that he had just enough of her, just like Vegeta and Lazuli.

While I understand that this was bound to happen, regardless of if he was with me or with some other girl, I can't help but feel lost now that I'm in this moment. Chichi is only human, and though she is crazy, if Gohan left her, she would be completely and utterly alone. Gohan feels similarly, which is why he has stuck by her for this long.

I have a counselor that I see in school once in a while for other reasons, but I'll be calling him up for appointment as soon as I can. Gohan is also planning on seeking counseling too as soon as he heads over to his internship.

What should I do, r/relationships? I had worked so long to gain her approval, and now I feel like all of it has gone to waste. I'm doing my best to be as supportive as possible to Gohan, because he must feel just as bad as I do, but I don't know what to do or say that wouldn't overstep my boundaries.

What is the next step?

2epwx4,12,2014-08-27,I know it's been asked one hundred times ... But is it okay if I don't wear a suit jacket to the interview?,gibberellins1,femalefashionadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/2epwx4/i_know_its_been_asked_one_hundred_times_but_is_it/,"Thanks for reading my question.

Anyway, the reason I ask is because I interviewed for an internship at an office this week. I wore a suit with black flats and a shell underneath and I looked clean and professional -- I find out today if I go back for the next round of interviews. 

As I was talking to my interviewer, I asked her what the environment was like, what the dress code was etc., and she remarked that it was business prof to business casual. 

I wore the suit, so I know I definitely fit right in, but for the next round of interviews I wanted to layer a scoop-neck cardigan over a button-up shirt, a black pencil skirt and black pumps (conservative and professional). I worry about the suit jacket because it needs to be tailored a little bit (I found it at Goodwill last week, and it fits around my shoulders and arms, but is just a little too big around the body).

I just want to ask ... how acceptable is that? Is there a no-budge order on the suited for an interview rule? I looked online to try to find information, but the closest I found was ""don't wear a pantsuit, wear a skirtsuit!"". I thought about e-mailing her if she e-mails me if I made it into the second round, but it makes me nervous. 

Finally, is it a huge faux pas if the black suit is not the same black as the pants or the skirt? I noticed my suit jacket was just a little off-color from the pants.

Thank you!

Edit: I just found out I go for another round of interviews! I know noe that I'm going to wear the suit tomorrow too, so thank you all!!

Clearly my best bet is to land the more competitive 2L summer internship there as well to have a chance for actual employment. 

Unfortunately my interview for summer is right before my fall internship orientation.  My concern is that I won't stand out enough or have an ""in"" for the summer interviewer other than ""I am starting next week and will hope to gain the experience you will be looking for"", as I'm taking the relevant doctrinal classes currently.

Assuming I get dinged for summer in the first round, what would you suggest in terms of me trying to ""backdoor"" a way into the summer program?  Is it even possible to make that much of an impression in ~15 hours a week?  Do I make myself a pariah if I disclose early on to a supervisor that I wanted to join the summer program but did not get in?  

Thanks."
2eq4ad,1,2014-08-27,Advice on telling a client they are overusing hashtags?,[deleted],web_design,https://www.reddit.com/r/web_design/comments/2eq4ad/advice_on_telling_a_client_they_are_overusing/,"It's a little awkward situation here. My client that I'm the webmaster for is way overusing hashtags on Facebook. It's embarrassing and looks unprofessional. I'm going to make up an organization, but lets just say it's called the Ottawa Polar Bear Hunting Organization. He tags every post #ottawapolarbearhuntingorganization.

Then, when he's linking to articles, he'll hashtag the authors name. So when he's posting an article by Sharon Colman Graham, he'll hashtag it #sharoncolmangraham.

And he posted a Pablo Picasso painting that was titled Violin and Grapes so he hashtagged it #violinandgrapes.

He was linking to a musical piece Temura by K-Ximbinho so he hashtagged it #temurabykximbinho.

And he's just placing all these hashtags in a row at the end of his posts.

I'm their webmaster and play no part in their social media (they're a non-profit, it's either the founder himself or an intern doing the Facebook). How do I let him know it's embarrassing and makes them look like noobs? I have a pretty good relationship with him and I don't think he would take offense, I'm just wondering if anyone has any advice on hashtag ""rules"" or how to say ""it's embarrassing"" without directly saying that. I know what's appropriate and what's not but it's kinda hard to put it into words.

Thanks."

2eqnt7,1,2014-08-27,Me [20M] trying to get back with my with my ex [20F] who I dated for 2 and a half years.,Ramgolf12,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2eqnt7/me_20m_trying_to_get_back_with_my_with_my_ex_20f/,"My girlfriend of two and a half years and I broke up mutually in May. I was ok with it because I was beginning to realize that she's ""the one"" and I was scared of that. Her reasoning at the time was that because we live 3 hours away during the school year, the long-distance/college thing was too difficult.

I quickly realized my mistake. I had never been overly emotional and we had waited until our first anniversary to say ""I love you"". So I tried to win her back. We began talking again and she considered coming back to me. However, I was away over the summer in a different state with an internship.

So I came home from my internship for a week to see her. She let me take her out to dinner and then we went back to her house. We then had sex for the first time and I stayed the night. I saw her once more during that week when she really wanted to meet with me and we ended up having sex again.

I returned to my internship on a high. We were talking about getting back together very seriously. We even began to send each other pictures and have phone sex. She said she was almost ready to agree to getting back together with me and we had plans to see each other soon after I came home.

Then she went back to school. A month had passed since I had seen her because of the internship. She quickly stopped texting me as well as before. I got 2 word replies from her. I asked her what was up and she said that she was just really busy, but didn't think she had been that bad at texting.

One week after getting back to school, she asked for some space. She asked me to stop texting her and asked that we not see each other. It was a short term plan, with plans to talk sparingly after a few days. When we spoke again, she said she was cutting me off and didn't want to talk at all anymore and didn't want to see me for a long time. Her reasoning was that she's not ready for another long-distance relationship and she doesn't believe in soulmates. She wants to focus on school, extracurricular activities, and getting into dating at her school.

I'm absolutely in love with her. Even as she was breaking my heart over Skype, I couldn't stop think about how beautiful she is. I'm not angry in the least with her, only with myself for letting her go. I'm willing to do anything in the world for her and need to figure out what I can do to win her back. She's my best friend and the person I love more than anyone else in the world. I can't do this without her. I'm struggling really badly and am constantly thinking about her. I'm not trying to be overly dramatic, but I need her back. She's the one. The only person I want to spend the rest of my life with.

What can I do? I'm willing to try anything at all to get her back. Give me some advice here, because I don't know what else I can do besides breakdown and cry whenever I'm alone and think of her.

2eqv8q,5,2014-08-27,"I [22 M] am having trouble with my girlfriend [20F] we've been together for almost 4 years, back on July 21st we separated but are still together, I haven't seen her in 3-4 weeks",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2eqv8q/i_22_m_am_having_trouble_with_my_girlfriend_20f/,"We started off the summer in excellent shape, I got an internship at home so I could be near her. We've been dating since she was a Junior in High School and I was a Senior (we are 1.5 years apart in age). She was with me and my entire family for my little brothers graduation, she would come over randomly when I'd be home just because she wanted to see me (and have sex) while she wasn't at work. In general just our normal style.

She's easily my best friend in the world and I am hers but unfortunately around late June we both got really busy, she had family trips, I had to travel and so for almost 3 weeks we only were able to text and call because our schedules with family and work conflicted. I briefly ran over to her house (we live a mile apart) with flowers for 4th of July like normal and to grab a kiss and tell her I love her.

Over the next 12 days I didn't see her at, I went on a trip and so did she. I got back the 16th and of course the only thing I wanted to do was to see and hold my girl (we did communicate as best we could during the trip signal is shoddy out in the rural new england area where I was).

We made plans for a date on that Friday (I got home Wednesday) and her father, he is a very overbearing man, told her no that he wanted to have them family together (makes sense). So we rescheduled for Sunday. That's when the unthinkable happened to me.

I had spoken to her best friend in the world (who is also like a little sister to me) earlier asking if she thought my girlfriend was alright, she told me ""she's just been really busy and stressed just breathe and she'll come back you don't need to worry"" The plan was to go see my girlfriend's best friend (We will call her Gina) at work for dinner.

From here on out my girlfriend will be Mary.

Well talking with Gina really put my mind at ease and so I relaxed a bit. Mary texted me like she usually does saying ""I'm coming!"" and etc. So I figured she was excited. Until she texted me ""Can you come outside?"" about 2 minutes later. Of course in my own foolishness I ran outside and I was so happy to see her I didn't realize what she was doing.

She started balling and holding me and trying her hardest to break up with me. She said she couldn't do the distance anymore (we are somewhat long distance about 120mi apart while at school but we would take turns every two weeks to see each other, I even did that my first year of college because she thought I was going to dump her and I love her far too much to do that), she also said she just didn't think she was happy anymore. 

* This last part took me aback. I knew she wasn't exactly happy because we both hadn't seen each other in so long we both get frustrated and etc. Also we both stopped communicating as well as we normally do. 

She cried and was holding me and kissing me and telling me she's still in love with me and does love me and etc. Which to me is somewhat irritating because no one is 100% happy all of the time in a relationship. There always will be points where you think you would be happier without them. She finally after about 45 minutes forced herself away from me and into her car and drove off.

I of course in a panic called Gina and left her a message asking what the hell just happened, I have never been so devastated in my entire life. Naturally I got no response. By this point Mary would've already texted her telling her the situation.

So I texted Mary once more ""Telling her not to give up on us, we're a team and have gotten through everything"" etc. Then I started the shutting her out. Over the next 5 days I didn't text, call, or anything. My little brother, who dated Gina and is very close with Mary, went out with both of them to hangout (he had his own agenda because he could tell I was miserable). That night Mary texted me saying she was so sorry about Sunday, she just needed some time to clear her head and think and etc. I did not respond. Two days later she texted me saying ""I want to see you can we meet up soon?"" I ignored that for a day and finally said that'd be fine.

Moving forward we reach the fifth day and she comes over and we sit in her car out front for 45 minutes. I started off by letting her air everything out the gist was she asked for three weeks to herself so she could reflect and just be alone that she wasn't sure what she wanted anymore. Then after those three weeks for me to come stay with her for the weekend and we would lock ourselves away and figure everything out. I agreed under three conditions and she had to be honest, the first was ""Do you want to make things work out with each other? the second was ""Are you still in love with me?"" and the third was ""Are we still together then, or are we broken up?"" The answer to one and two were a resounding YES and the last one was ""yes we're still together.""

The next half hour was us just laughing, and joking, holding hands, kissing and she told me she loved me, it felt like the normal us.

Then she drove off and that was that.

About a week to 9 days later I finally couldn't handle it anymore and texted Gina asking her what I needed to do in order to not lose my best friend, the love of my life. She responded with the obvious just don't harass her or rush her and you won't push her away. I figured that'd be the response but obviously that is harder than one thinks. Shortly after that Mary texted me saying she was okay, her wisdom teeth came out fine, and etc (she's scared to death of being put under). We spoke for a moment and I flat out asked her do you still want an ""us""? She told me yes she just needed to time to reflect and be one so ""... I can fix things..."". Which that made me smile knowing she was still in this.

Fast forward two weeks. I drove down to my friends and we went out, then I came across to visit our other friends while I waited on her to get to her University's city. I called her the night before and stayed neutral and calm saying ""I'll be there as per our agreement, I am looking forward to seeing you and working things out. I've missed you.""

The next morning she texted saying she can't even move into her place that weekend and that sorority recruitment workshops began and etc. I know how stressed out that stuff makes her and how rough that can be spending all of that time stuck on a couch. She asked if we could do it another weekend. I called her in a semi pissed off demeanor asking her why she didn't plan for this and what not. She explained and I could tell by her voice she was really happy to hear my voice. Once again I asked, are you still in love with me and do you want things to work. She said ""yes"". 

That saturday evening I texted her saying even if you can find just 5 minutes to see me before I head back north for my intership I will be happy. I came all of this way according to our agreement and the 3 weeks are over. Unfortunately I know she goes from 8am-10pm everyday for 2 weeks with this recruitment stuff (it ends this saturday the 30th). She tried getting a bit crass with ""you can't just show up like that"" and etc. I pointed out I didn't, it was what we agreed on (she stopped responding, I am assuming because she realized she was wrong). Anyhow She asked on the phone earlier just for two more weeks so she could get through with recruitment and be moved in (she moved into her apartment this most recent weekend). I reluctantly agreed.

This is where my dilemma is at. I would walk through hell and back for her and sadly due to my own devastation and the complete blindside of the entire situation I was unable to really distance myself. In doing so I showed my hand and have made it appear that I am completely available to her still and am just waiting around for her (which in essence is the case but that's not helpful from what I gather).

Her old roommate, and one of her close friends, has been helping me get through it. She's a dear friend and always has been a voice of reason. Mary tends to not think logically when she gets emotional, she's an extraordinarily intelligent girl but her brain locks up when she's upset, or angry. Her old roommate (we will call her Kiley) has spoken to her a few times and said that she misses me and that ""she wants to start over with you"". Kiley also said I shouldn't worry too much because she's going to do the most thinking early on and after these few weeks if she hasn't just cut things off completely then that should be a sign she's still in this. ( I am not so optimistic.) Sadly she isn't close with her other best friend who was the friend who would call her on her bullshit and tell her the important things like ""do you love him? If yes, then go talk to him and get moving in the right direction!"" ( This friend is the one who finally made her call her dad's bluff about making her live at home and go to community college if she didn't end things with me).

Kiley said she would try to go grab lunch with her this week and talk to her, because even Kiley is getting pissed off about how Mary has been treating me like a doormat. Kiley is the only friend that will be a bitch to the point to really rattle Mary's cage to get her to realize what she is doing is not okay. (Not the separation, because maybe the separation is just what we need to strengthen everything, but how she's being cruel by hiding from me and extending the length of time and etc) So I am hoping that lunch happens.

Anyhow I haven't spoken to her since the weekend of the 15th, and am trying to cut down my appearance of being available. I even reactivated my facebook just because since we are still ""together"" she will be stuck looking at me periodically (I haven't actually posted anything or even logged in since I reactivated it).

The only other thing that was brought to my attention was by my little brother who got it from Gina (sadly Gina and Mary are waaaayyy too close and one will never call the other out even if they know one of them is wrong, so sadly the one person who has Mary's ear is not on my side in the slightest. If anything I hope she's neutral.) it was regarding me when I brought up the idea of getting married eventually. I was a bit tipsy but apparently it freaked Mary out a bit.

We've discussed marriage before and we both were on board for it eventually, I just brought it up because after almost 4 years together it should be a relatively easy topic to discuss.

I was a bit of a player in High School, so I got around. Her friend that made her call her Dad's bluff was the friend that told her to go out with me despite what she'd heard and knew about me. Mary on the other hand was 100% virgin, no nothing beyond kissing. So I kind of made a lasting mark there and I have been one of a few boyfriends but the only one to make it past a few months.

I feel like I need to make a stand and really strike the fear of her losing **me** into her heart. The whole separation we have still been together which is reassuring but also makes me feel like she's not worried or afraid of what I am doing, who I am with, and that maybe I won't come back. I also keep getting the strange worry that maybe she's trying to fall out of love with me.

I trust her with my life and she's my love and my best friend and I can't imagine being without her, but I also tend to have really creative scenarios in my head that psych me out ( one crux to being an intelligent person who tends to overanalyze things).





---   
**tl;dr**: My longtime girlfriend of almost 4 years and I have been separated with no contact but still together for one month. We have spoken briefly here and there. She still loves me and appears to want to make things work. Sadly there is so much detail I gave to truly try and give a good understanding of the situation I don't know how to summarize it beyond this: She asked for two more weeks, I was supposed to come stay the weekend with her at the end of the separation so her and I could exhaust every option before we throw in the towel on our relationship. I am willing to go to hell and back in order to save my relationship with her. She literally is my world and I am not the same without her. This weekend the 30th is the end of the two week extension she requested to get through sorority recruitment. 

*QUESTION*: I am open to any and all advice, as stated above I already showed my hand consistently for the first big chunk of the separation by showing I care and I'm available. What should I say this weekend, or sooner, that will really get through a girls head and mess with her a bit to really consider what she is doing? I'm not trying to manipulate her but trying to strike the same fear I have had for the last month into her. The fear that she might lose me forever if she doesn't stop this. I need a way to demand the respect I deserve and so she understands the severity and consequences of what will happen. I want her back 100%, not this psuedo- togetherness. Please any recommendations on what to say, do, how to do it, how to word it, what to do afterwards and so on would be highly appreciated.


I think she believes maybe she needs to see what else is out there, and I don't want to ever hold her back but I know that if she loves me then there is no reason to try and find it elsewhere. Anyone with similar situations and advice I am begging. She's too much a part of my life and of me to let go without a fight.

**SORRY FOR THE NOVEL** I am just a detailed person and wanted to shed as much light as possible on the possible motives and whatnot. 

Thank you.

Edit: What I should say and do I'd like to be powerful and really help sink in the thought of ""Do you really want to go on without me?"" but without forcing her hand into stressing out and doing something she will regret or wasn't intending. I am beginning to confuse myself a bit. I need to stop analyzing everything.

Also I am obviously torn up and a bit depressed still, getting that sick feeling and the chill whenever I think of her, but I am not suicidal or anything. (I only add this because a friend of mine did shoot himself after a somewhat similar situation.)"
2erl91,2,2014-08-27,Problems with university MAC address blocking and USB adapter,FlyPengwin,HomeNetworking,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeNetworking/comments/2erl91/problems_with_university_mac_address_blocking_and/,"Hey guys, another college dorm-networking related question here.

Let me preface by saying that I am an intern with the IT department (not the networking side) at my university, and all of my immediate coworkers are stumped as well. I am trying to connect to the wired network.

The residential dorms on campus must have a MAC address registered to be able to connect to the wired internet, which is required for gaming/fast speeds. The computer has to pass a Bradford Dissolvable Agent check to become registered. This check passed on my computer, but I get the error ""Invalid Physical Address"" when it finishes. 

My laptop is the ultrabook form factor and does not have a network port, so I have to connect to the network through the USB-to-ethernet adapter (ASIX AX88772B USB2.0 to Fast Ethernet Adapter) that came with my machine. I know that this adapter works, and I have already installed the drivers that it came with. I believe that this adapter has its own MAC address that the Bradford agent will not accept, and this is why I can't connect.

I'm hunting for solutions, and I would like to avoid buying a router and setting it up on the network if possible. I'm currently wondering if a 5-port switch registered on the network (plug it in, register it's MAC address, and just go through that) but I don't know if they even have MAC addresses.

Anyone have any solutions? Would the switch idea work?"

We are both in college and because of us working while in school, we were able to see each other every 2 months for the last semester. We've never been completely official but we both understand that we love each other and eventually want to move in together.

So the last semester went great between her and I. I couldnt leave my phone alone for 20 minutes without 2-3 messages from her and she was always there for me and we told each other that we loved each other. I even met her parents and her best friends (who say the love me). Now here's where the problem starts...

Come summer time, and she gets a new internship. Because of her internship and time difference she wasnt able to text me back as much and communication dwindled. We got into a lot of fights because I wanted to talk to her more and she couldnt make more time for me due to work. This whole summer made me super insecure and indecisive and honestly a little depressed. We had just told each other before the summer started that we loved each other, and now its like pulling teeth to have a conversation. 

This weekend i ended up having a brief moment of just total breakdown and I almost broke up with her. She tells me she loves me so much and that she wants me to visit for the holidays since I cant afford to go see her during semester. I feel like this summer has changed me and not for the best. My parents have told me im very negative now, my friends seem kind of stand off-ish towards me as of recently. I just want to be myself again, happy and confident and making moves, but lately shes all i can think about because Im so afraid to lose her. Im not even sure what I can do anymore. I have this bad feeling that shes stringing me along just to see me for the couple of weeks that we can and in between those times she's with other people. Is breaking up the best option? I only have a year left at school and I want to be the happiest i can be but I dont want to lose her and have it ruin my year and I dont want to be insecure the rest of the semester. Im in a pickle guys. 

Any advice would be so much appreciated!

Those surrounding me tried to form me into a person that I simply am not.  Even now, my father has forced me into an internship at his company to show me, ""how fulfilling working in an office can be.""  I have been feeling a greater sense of shame knowing how much it has been reinforcing my aversion to living behind a desk.  I was speaking to my fathers co-worker about my future one day, as I've been extremely stressed about it since Im just a few years away from graduating college, and I've only ever wanted to be a writer, which is a terribly difficult profession to make any money in.  He told me to take this personality test as it may help me figure it all out.  I took it today, found out I am an INFP, and its been terrifically liberating.  I thought I was one of a kind my entire life, as I've never met anyone like me before, and that sense of isolation has reinforced that shame.  And like many other INFP's I have that built in reclusive nature that can be so destructive.  But today, I have found that there are indeed people like me, and there have always been people like me, and it is wonderfully liberating.  From today onward, I am going to fully accept who I am.  This new knowledge was the nudge I so badly needed to delve into my dream to become a writer.  I suppose I just wanted to thank all of you for existing, it has already made my life quite a bit better just knowing you're there.  Thank you."

2esl0a,3,2014-08-28,My dad [52m] is trying to guilt me [20m] into not moving out.,CSthrowaway93,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2esl0a/my_dad_52m_is_trying_to_guilt_me_20m_into_not/,"Hi,

Background: I'm a 20 year old college student, with one more quarter in the Autumn to go until I graduate and start working. For the past few years, I've planned a few attempt at trying to move out of my parents' house, mostly cause they fought all the time and I was starting to get pretty unhappy there. As soon as my dad caught wind of this, he would always aggressively try to convince me to stay at home longer, and honestly, at those times, he was probably right that it was a better idea, considering I would have still been a few years away from graduating, while still working little minimum wage jobs. This probably happened twice.

But now, after an extremely well-paying internship and the guarantees of job offers after I graduate, I feel like there's really no point to me not moving out now. I originally planned on doing so in April, but was once again convinced to stay home until at least June, when my internship started. Then when June came around, I was again convinced to stay until after the internship ended in September. 

Around this time, something between my parents snaps and my mom decides to move back to her home country to live with her family for a while. My dad hasn't been taking this so well, which is understandable, but now he's trying to use it as an excuse to get me to stay home even longer, cause he says he needs the company, needs help taking care of the house and the dogs, and that ""things are moving too fast"".

I feel like this isn't fair to me. I'm feeling trapped in an impossible situation. He says he just wants me to stay until December, but knowing him, he's not going to feel any more comfortable at that point about me moving out so when the time comes around I know he's just going to try and convince me to stay again. Maybe under different circumstances I'd be fine with staying for an extra few months, but (a) after all that's happened there I'm really just not happy being in that house anymore, and (b) I've got a few friends/potential roommates who were counting on me being able to move into a place in September and I don't want to let them down. It's worth pointing out that when I had tried to move out a few years ago, I did actually have to let another group of friends down by telling them I wasn't able to move out after having planned everything.

I don't know. Am I being selfish? I really don't want to have to do this to my dad cause honestly he was a terrific father, but I think I need to get out of that house. 


---   
**tl;dr**: I want to move out, dad is trying to guilt me into staying by using the fact that my mom just left."

The plight of Chinese rural migrants to major cities is a huge and troubling phenomenon in China, though seldom reported-on in the West ( http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/world-report/2014/06/17/migrant-labor-in-shanghai-highlights-inequality-in-china). Because of China's residence registration (hukou or 户口) policies, many migrants are unable to collect basic services from their government, such as education, health care, and driver's licenses, and are forced to take dangerous and low-paying jobs to survive. They are barred from living in regular housing and are forced to live in substandard apartments that are built without being properly zoned. Their children do not receive standard, state-sponsored education and must attend migrant community schools, which are often overcrowded and severely underfunded.

During my four months in Shanghai, China I will be volunteering with an organization that works with the migrant community to teach English to elementary school children, in the hopes that learning English will counter some of the disadvantages of not being able to attend regular schools. I will be working a teacher and in the organization's office to help with logistics and raising awareness about the importance of helping the underprivileged in Shanghai.

Alongside my volunteer work, I will be participating in a once-in-a-lifetime study opportunity in Shanghai. I have been selected for a program focusing on international relations (IR), globalization and Sino-US relations at the prestigious Fudan University ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fudan_University). As a Political Science major, there is no better place to study IR than in the most dynamic, fastest-rising country in the world.

I have been studying Mandarin (speaking, reading and writing) at the university level for two years, and am hoping to reach fluency by the end of my trip. Along with my classes in the Political Science department, I will also be studying to perfect my Mandarin. 

This four-month adventure has been a dream of mine for a long time, and I have already secured a university-supplied scholarship to help me with tuition expenses. However, I need some extra help to cover my transportation and living expenses while abroad, including for my flight ($832) housing (~$350/month for four months), school supplies ($100), transportation to and from my internship ($80), my meal plan ($200), outstanding tuition fees, and any other incidentals that may arise while I am abroad. 

Any and all help is appreciated. Please help me to accomplish something that I have been working towards since I began college and will remember for the rest of my life. This trip will be one of self-discover and self-betterment as well as a chance for me to make a difference in the lives of others, and I want more than anything to be able to make it happen.

Thank you!

2esppn,53,2014-08-28,1099 worker confused about Roth IRA vs. Traditional IRA vs. Individual 401K,minivanhighway,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2esppn/1099_worker_confused_about_roth_ira_vs/,"First off, I hope this question is appropriate. I have scoured the FAQ and done as much searching on my own as I could, but can't find a definitive answer.

My situation: I am 24 years old, 2 years out of college, and after working as an intern for a year, have moved up in my organization to be a full-time 1099 contractor who makes $54,000/yr with no benefits in the state of IL. As of last month, I have paid off the $20,000 student loans in my name, have built up a modest emergency fund, and am currently trying to get myself oriented financially as I save for the future.

All conventional wisdom points to saving in an IRA, and while the Roth seems to be the most no-brainer option for most, I'm wondering if I need to reconsider based on my situation. I've had some trouble understanding my taxes as a 1099 employee. Based on the IRS calculator, taking the standard deduction as a single person with no dependents, my effective tax rate works out to be 32.9% because of the ""self-employment tax."" My understanding is that 1099 workers should try to write off whatever they can to ameliorate this tax burden, but based on everything I have found, I'm not really eligible for any deductions (I use my own computer but purchased it a few years ago during college, don't have a car, don't work from home, everything else related to work is basically provided by my employer, and every other deduction I look into seems to be a dead end for my situation). So I am making estimated tax payments assuming that my effective tax rate is 33%.

Now that student loans are paid, I'm confused about where my extra income should go. If I understand correctly, with a Roth IRA, contributions made now are considered to be ""post-tax"" and can be withdrawn during retirement without paying taxes at that time. With a traditional IRA, you can write off your contributions to the fund, so that the money you contribute now is effectively untaxed, but then it is taxed at the time of withdrawal during retirement. Because I am looking for tax write-offs right now, should I choose the Traditional IRA option over a Roth IRA?

To complicate things further, after looking into this, I am now reading about Individual 401Ks, SEP-IRAs, and more, and now my head is spinning. From what I can discern, it seems like the personal 401k might be smartest (it looks like the limits are higher and you can write off more?), but I don't really understand how it works, and reading something like [this explanation](http://www.irs.gov/Retirement-Plans/One-Participant-401\(k\)-Plans) just confuses me more because I don't understand what of my income is considered to be employer vs. employee contributions, etc. And I'm not sure what happens to that 401k if I stop being a 1099 worker and become employed as a W2 in a few years. The personal 401K thing in general is really confusing me. 

My income situation is pretty cut and dry (fixed monthly fee of $4,500/mo), and I just want to know the smartest place to put my extra income, which I estimate from here on out will be approximately $10,000 per year. If anybody could maybe lay out what my smartest option would be, it would be really helpful.

One last question that may be very stupid, but keeps bugging me after reading the IRA faq: people say that the Roth IRA should be used when you expect your income tax to be higher during retirement than it is right now (and vice versa for the traditional IRA). But why would you ever be in a higher tax bracket once you're retired? Once you're retired, aren't you - by definition - taking in no income, so you would automatically be in the lowest tax bracket?

EDIT: thanks for everybody's responses. My basic questions about roth vs. traditional (in terms of how they work) have been answered, and the 1099 vs. w2 classification has been noted, but I still don't have a clear lock on what is most prudent in my situation (after reading all of the responses, it seems to me that putting my money in a personal 401K rather than a personal IRA would be smart because I have the option to do it as a self-employed person, and I can save more than the 5,500 IRA limit). So if anybody has a final word on why specifically somebody in my situation should go traditional over Roth, or vice versa, it would be much appreciated."

I have a triple major in Accounting, Finance, and MIS (Management of Information Systems). I went into college wanting to go into finance, but ever since I took my first accounting course in my second semester, I have loved accounting. Specifically, I wanted to go into auditing. 

Last summer, I was not able to find an internship after applying and going through many interviews. Therefore, I lack any real world experience in Accounting, and I think thats where I may have my problem.

I started looking for a job last November hoping I would find something by the time I graduated. Unfortunately, I was not able to. Since graduating, I have been consistently applying to and interviewing for positions. I have gone in for 2nd round interviews with at least 5 employers. I'm not sure if I'm doing something wrong in the interview department, but I am confident that I do well in interviews, and I get the impression that people like my personality.

Other than the issue about my experience in the field, I'm not sure if i'm high on salary expectations or not. I would like to make a minimum of 35k per year. Any lower than this and I don't think I will have the capability to pay for all of my living expenses, including my payments towards my $90k college loan debt. I have talked to friends who have also graduated from the same school, many of whom make much more than this, sometimes 55k/year+. 

I am currently studying for the CPA exam, and I am going to take it in October/November this year. 

I am starting to run out of money that I have saved up, and I am still looking for jobs constantly every day. I'm not sure what I should do at this point. Should I continue to pursue a career in accounting, or should I try for something else?

Edit: 
For Those Wondering if I did anything besides school, I worked a part time student job, otherwise my debt would've been much higher. I also participated in the Schools voluntary tax assistance program.

I have Talked to my schools career center, and consistently find jobs to apply for on their job board. I have not done their interview prep, so I will check that out.

Thanks for all of the advice."

I'm in the UK. Current medications; half a zyrtek a day.

15 years ago I had a caesarean. Shortly after I occasionally started feeling like I'd pulled a muscle underneath my sternum, on the right-hand side. My scar also tended to be swollen and painful around that time. After a while I realised that this happened around my period and then went away again.

It started getting worse, but when I got the Mirena coil installed and my periods stopped the pain stopped too. 

The Mirena was taken out 4 years later and when my periods resumed so did the pain. When it got really, really annoying I went to the doctor, who referred me to a gynaecologist. He first did a bunch of ultrasounds (of the area around my uterus, not of the area below my sternum) and couldn't find anything. Then he got an intern who specialised in scar endometriosis who suggested they had a look inside. To my gyno's surprise (he obviously thought I was exaggerating or imagining things) they found scar endo in my scar and removed it. They didn't look underneath my sternum.

A year or two went by. The pain in my scar was gone, the pain underneath my sternum got worse. I went back to the doctor. Scans (MRI - not in a machine, it was one of those things that actually turns around you while you're standing up -  and several ultrasounds, again just of ovaries and uterus). Saw nothing. Laparoscopy: found some endo on my ovaries, removed endo. Swung the camera up, saw a huge number of adhesions around the liver. Then put me on injections that brought on the menopause, which worked but had so many side effects (I no longer slept AT ALL and had a permanent migrane) that I had to stop. When I told the gyno it had worked for the pain he said ""it's obviously nothing to do with your periods"" (!!!) and referred me to the surgeons (the guys who do bowel stuff).

The surgeon poo-pooed (pun intended) the adhesions around my liver, saying gynos don't know about such stuff, even though I'd never had an operation that could have caused them. He did do a blood test to check my liver (I think, they weren't very informative). He then did an endoscopy (it was *horrible*) and only found a little gastritis. Got discharged.

And the pain got worse. It is now always present, getting worse around my period (when I sneeze it hurts so much I go kinda yellow and end up having to do contraction breathing so I don't faint) and not getting better until around my ovulation, when it becomes sort of bearable. My stomach also swells up (it's always swollen, really). 

So I asked for a second opinion. Got referred to another hospital and had a long chat with the gyno there. I made *sure* he made a note of where the pain was and they made an appointment for another laparoscopy (yup, looking down there again ...). Day arrives, huge delay, another gyno does the surgery because the one I talked to was too busy, finds nothing, doesn't tell me what's going on (I never actually talked to him), discharges me, and that's that.

And the pain gets worse.

I really can't deal with this anymore. When it's very bad I take painkillers, but the only thing that takes the edge off things is ibuprofen and that isn't exactly great for the stomach (even when I take ompeprazole with it).

To be honest? I think the NHS is killing me, and I don't know where to turn. The pain has caused severe depression. I can't enjoy anything anymore. I don't want to live like this. What do I do now?"

&gt; Thank you for your quick answer. I am excited to hear that you still offer the internship position.
&gt;  
&gt; I am currently in the final semester of my Bachelor's degree in Computational Visualistics and Design at the Bielefeld University of Applied Sciences in Germany. 
&gt; 
&gt; You indicated that the internship will involve using Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop for the creation of print and digital media. I have done this during my studies for the past three years and learned to efficiently work on multiple projects at the same time. Some of the projects were analysing and designing corporate identities, marketing products, posters, invitational letters and editing a stop motion film. 
&gt; I got to develop creative skills using the Adobe Creative Suite with focus on Illustrator, Photoshop and InDesign. Furthermore I was able to gain insights into technologies behind camera sensors and 2D/3D printing with an outlook on future developments. I am sure that this knowledge will be a helpful addition when working with you and your team. 
&gt; 
&gt; My recent graphic design semester abroad in New Zealand was not only helpful for getting a fresh perspective on design but also for becoming proficient in English. 
&gt; Following that semester I have travelled through Korea for roughly two months and fell in love with the country which is why I am even more motivated to work in this exact position.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I am flexible in terms of start and duration of the internship and look forward to hearing from you soon. 
&gt;

&gt; Thank you for your time and consideration.

* I also contribute 4% of my paycheck to my 401k and 10% to my Roth IRA outside the company (does this contribute to my tax calculations as well?)

We invested so much time and parts of our lives into playing this game, it REALLY was amazing. I just dont know what happened. And omega has been the worst phase, but the longest? Meeting the devs was like every players dream back in the day, Now this game has lost all of its mature quality players. If you brought back a phase liek gamma (which is now impossible due to the irreperable damage - Giving non vars var weapons) people would play again. WHy dont you guys actually see what you have lost? An Expanding playerbase has now diminished almost entirely. I dont even know why you guys dont do something about it. You KNOW whats happening... But instead you push out more wars that last a week with a months cooldown. I just want to know. Why? What is the reasoning?

I wanted to respond when I had time to do so to give you my undivided attention. Today's been busy helping the AE teams get content ready before they head to Dragon*Con this weekend. I'm sry I could not respond right away. Deadlines ya know. 

I'd like to say first I do not feel like I'm wasting my time on what you call a ""dying game"" I have had several offers to further my employment at other companies on other projects. However working on a game means more to me then furthering my financial benefits.  I also don't feel like I need to attach my name to a larger titled game either. I'm not in it for the fame or recognition of my work. If I wanted those things I would have moved on by now. I get great enjoyment working with my co-workers. The artists here are fantastic to learn from and work with. I also enjoy helping  and teaching ( my first passion )  AE allows me to help work one on one with our volunteer artists creating content for EpicDuel. Its an internship I wish I had available to me back when I was learning art. This to me is priceless to have this opportunity and to be able to be there for them. My roles at AE goes far beyond working on EpicDuel which I think is something many people tend to forget when they get tunnel vision. Not only that but AE is family friendly. I'm able to take off when I need to for my daughter. Which is really nice for AE to allow us to do this. Not many places are like that. 

We obviously stand on different views when it comes to Omega and the effects on what its made on the game.  Which is okay, I respect your opinions. They are the views and expressions of a very passionate player who has had great enjoyment playing EpicDuel.  However like any game EpicDuel has gone through changes just like people do, for good or for bad. There are no plans to bring back old phases of the game and I doubt there ever will be. Omega was a necessary push for EpicDuel's survival. Technical dept was building rapidly with each release and we had no way to solve those issues with out the changes made in Omega. Not everyone is going to agree with it and yes we had to make sacrifices to how some of the core elements of the game works. Those changes were made very carefully and we weighed all the pros and con's before going forward. What you see in the game now is the result of keeping EpicDuel going forward rather then rushing into a brick wall without being able to update it. Which would have been the case without the Omega changes. Its more of a technical reason for Omega then for the pure enjoyment of the player base. Which I think is why most players tend to get on the Omega sucks bandwagon. To look at the game objectively to know whats best for it even when its not the most popular decision was probably the hardest thing we had to do. You could call it tough love. If I could chose to go back into time to change anything, it would be to make the Omega changes sooner rather then later. 

The game is not dying as you say. We are actually having a great year, projected better then we thought it would be. Early this year there was data that supported browser based games stood no chance of lasting though summer. Many other companies pulled and stopped support for browser based games all together. Something that also concerned us as in 2013 sales of mobile and tablet devices doubled. You can go to ""google trends"" website and type in popular browser games to show you we are just following the popular playing trends of the internet. Its not just a AE issue. Thankfully AE  is in no trouble, yes the player base has lessened due to mobile and console sales taking off, there have been better days, but we are still standing strong. Part of the reason for this is we have a very loyal and awesome playerbase. No other online game company I can think of really works with the players as much as AE does.  I also think part of the reason why I contribute our success was AE stayed small in terms of employment. While other companies hired huge staff in 2011 they had to fire most of them by 2013. For now we do not know our future, no one does. To say a game is going to die is like looking into a volcano and predicting when its going to erupt. Games go through trends of enjoyment and so do what we play games on. There are often surprises like we had this year. We beat the odds of impending doom all gaming annalists and media columnists said about browser based games in 2014. All I know is for as long as we can, we will be making updates to EpicDuel.

Like I said to start, I wanted to give you my honest time  to answer your questions. As with all the players of EpicDuel I appreciate each one whither or not what they feel the same way in return. 

Whither or not you decide to support and play our games in the future  I want to  thank you for being apart of EpicDuel's history. 

Sincerely,
-Charfade

2euulq,1,2014-08-28,"For the first time, I actually believe I can be a great teacher.",[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2euulq/for_the_first_time_i_actually_believe_i_can_be_a/,"Throughout college, during my internships, and while working as a substitute, I had serious doubts about my abilities as a teacher. I thought I was disorganized, timid, and scatter-brained. My clinical faculty during my student teaching made me feel worthless and put down by overruling my decisions constantly. I still stuck to my desire to give teaching a try, though, hoping for the best and honestly just praying I didn't screw up in any catastrophic way.

But my job is amazing! The principal at this school is helpful and understanding, assuring me that mistakes will happen and that she believes I will figure out my own methods in time. The staff is all extremely helpful and encouraging, offering tips and advice but never in any demanding or patronizing way. The kids are great. They listen and are respectful.

Also, I'll let myself say it, I'm good at this! Sure, I'm still learning and I definitely could use improvement in certain areas (particularly grading; I'm still struggling to find a system that works for me). And I often leave the school reflecting on all the things I could've handled better or explained differently to get better results. But it's my first year, and I really think I have great classroom management skills. I am naturally timid, but I don't let my students see that side of me. I feel confident in front of them, and I feel that, for the most part, I have earned their respect. One of my students actually commented on how organized I seem to be, when in reality I feel like I'm scattered all over the place. I still feel I need to get some more supplies to help me find a place for everything and keep everything in it's place, but I like hearing that my students don't notice that.

Today, the teacher across the hall came over to my classroom to let me know that she's been hearing a lot of talk about me and that it's all good. The staff is excited to have me on board and think I'm doing really well, and I think I've established a good rapport with the kids.

I'm not perfect, and I have a lot of improving and learning to do. I know that I won't always feel this way throughout the year and it will go up and down, but I'm so pleasantly surprised thus far. I fully expected to be the teacher who is hated/disliked by students and staff alike. I didn't realize until today just how low my confidence was and how well I'd hidden my insecurities even from myself, and it's so nice to proven wrong."
2euviz,0,2014-08-28,"[Serious] Should I go to University A or University B? University A-&gt;Early Decision only, University B-&gt;Early Action only",Shitty_Antivirus,makemychoice,https://www.reddit.com/r/makemychoice/comments/2euviz/serious_should_i_go_to_university_a_or_university/,"Hi, r/makemychoice! I'm working on college apps and all those fun things so trying to choose where to apply etc. 
I live in the US and I'm looking towards an engineering oriented major (compsci). Debating between two main universities, both of which I'm pretty sure I can get in from looking at average SAT scores and GPAs (I would say I have a 100% chance getting into University B, and maybe a 80% chance of getting University A for sure) but I'm not sure which one I should get into. I know it probably looks cocky asking which one I should go to since I haven't even submitted my application yet, but chances I'll be accepted into both. 

The dilemma is: 

University A (UniA) is early decision only, meaning that if I apply early I MUST go. **Early decision = binding.**

University B (UniB) is early action only, meaning that if I apply early I can still choose if I want to go or not. **Early action = not binding.** 

Early decision generally has a higher acceptance rate, which is why I want to apply early. However, I may or may not be accepted early into UniA. If I am accepted, I MUST go (something I'm not sure if I want to due to reasons listed below). 

About UniA: 

* 4 hours away driving (I don't mind being super far away from home)
* Parents really won't/can't nag me to do things 
* In the middle of nowhere pretty much (in a small town) 
* Better engineering program (best in the state!) 
* Gorgeous campus 
* Harder to get into, more ""prestigious"" 
* Most of my friends are going to apply here or already go here
* Really good architecture program too
* Has one of the top 10 dining halls in the US

About UniB:

* 20 minutes away from my house (but public transportation here sucks anyway lol) 

* Likely will be living at home 
* Decent engineering program 
* More opportunities for internships (right outside big city) 
* Offers 12k automatic scholarship to early applicants with decent GPA/SAT 
* Parents can easily nag me to do things 
* Less expensive overall 
* Easier to get into 
* The company my dad works at offers internships mostly to students at this Uni (because of proximity and convenience) and pays for part of their tuition if their freshman grades are good. 
* Offers more fun degrees as well that UniA doesn't offer (Computer Game Design, etc) 


That's really all I can think of, so I'm not sure which university I'd rather go to...

* I graduated college and have at this point 1 year and 3 months of industry experience in my field (including my internship).

* I make enough so that a 30 year mortgage with 20% down at 4.5%; payments would be less than 28% of my monthly income.

* My only line of credit (the only statement on my credit report) is a secured credit card with a $500 secured payment/deposit with a 1.5 year history.

* credit karma says my score is 708

I'm worried:

* My credit history is not enough

* My score is not high enough

* My job history is not long enough (you need 2 ""professional"" years employment).

What I think I should do to mitigate and questions:

* Upgrade my secured credit card and apply for another. However this would be 2 hard inquiries and when I go to apply for a mortgage might end up hurting me more than helping me by raising my credit score.


What should I do knowing that I want to apply for a mortgage between 5-12 months from now (need to save enough for down-payment and buffer for unemployment)?

Additional info:

* Would be renting out the spare rooms (so don't worry that renting instead of buying would be cheaper for me)."
2evda1,6,2014-08-28,Bridesmaid choosing advice,bridesmaidta,weddingplanning,https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/2evda1/bridesmaid_choosing_advice/,"Hey guys! 

I would really appreciate some advice on choosing bridesmaids! My husband-to-be has many friends he would like to be his groomsmen. When we originally had the conversation on how many groomsmen/ bridesmaids we wanted, he said he was torn between seven of his closest male friends (his brother, our mutual best friend, and his five roommates). We can't afford a big wedding, so we decided to scale it back to five attendants each. We really want the same number.  

Well even with the smaller number of five, I'm having trouble picking who my ladies will be. I graduated from college 9 months ago, and have sadly lost touch with many of my close friends from college. I'm starting graduate school now, but I haven't made any close female friends yet. I feel like I'm in girlfriend limbo. 

Here are some of the people I could ask, but I would like some feedback on the ettiquette of who I should ask. 

- C - She's my best friend of all time. Definitely MOH. No brainer

- J - step-sister. Again, no brainer.

Here's where it gets tricky: 

- A - best friend from college, but I sadly haven't seen her in two years because of study abroad and internship schedules. I really hope it wouldn't be awkward asking her, but a lot of time has passed since we last really hung out. We haven't kept in touch very well, but I like to think we would just fall back in to the old rhythm of things. Another thing, she might be living abroad at the time of my wedding, so I wouldn't want it to be a burden on her to have to organize her outfit and stuff overseas. 

- N - hubby-to-be's sister. Not super close, but I really like her. Her family has really welcomed me into the fold. She's been very nice and gracious to me. My guy assumed I was asking N and M (below) automatically, but I'm not so sure. I just don't know if it's appropriate since we're not crazy close, she's married, and she's a mother (?)

- M - hubby-to-be's sister in law. She is amazing. We're close in the sense that I love his family and we all spend a lot of time together, but we've spent very little one on one time together. It seems a little weird to ask my fiance's brother's wife who is not necessarily a close friend. 

- T - T is another close friend from college. T is a wonderful, fun, caring friend. We fell out of touch when I graduated, and I feel like this is really my fault. I kinda think she resents me for not putting more effort into the relationship. I don't know if being in my wedding party is the best time to try to rekindle friendship. 

- K - K is another close friend from college. She's really close with T, and they are still best friends. In college, we were kind of a set. While I love K, the main reason I would invite her to be a bridesmaid, is because it would be seen as a big dramatic snub if I asked T and not her. 

I know it seems weird to ask strangers on the internet for this kind of help, but I really would like to hear some opinions on this. I really don't know what's appropriate and what's not when it comes to these things. 
Thanks so much in advance for the input. "

2ew24e,1,2014-08-29,"New grad student lucky to have a good job, but I have so many questions on savings/investing! (CA resident)",looking__ahead,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2ew24e/new_grad_student_lucky_to_have_a_good_job_but_i/,"Hello personal finance,

First of all, yes I've read the FAQ and it is has been helpful. But, I've still got questions and it would be great to get advice from you guys. Also, since I live in Canada, I feel like a lot of the specific advice I see given to people early in their careers is U.S. related and may not be applicable to me. Also, I'm looking to move internationally within a few years, so I have no idea how that will affect any investments I start to make now.

Some background first...

Graduated with an engineering degree and I've been working for almost a year now. I was constantly struggling to pay off tuition, rent, and other expenses during school and never had money saved up. So I never bothered with any sort of financial planning or reading. As engineering student, I used to scoff at financial planning, but I regret that now.

I changed a lot going through university. Questioned my major about a year in because I chose it without much thought, but it was too late to change it without having to backtrack. This left me in a bad state of mind for several years. I didn't see a clear future for myself, so I only ever focused on the semester ahead. I also became very distant from my family, and just spent my time focusing on the current semester, and blowing any money I ever had left on drugs. But, I worked a lot of internships, so with a bit of help from my parents and small scholarships, I graduated with no debt. Tuition isn't as crazy here as it is for you Americans...

Now that I've been working a while and life is steady, I've been thinking a lot about my future financially. The last few months, I feel like the motivation I had early in my university years is finally back. And ever since /r/personalfinance has become a default subreddit, I've seen a lot of great advice from you guys and realized how important it is to budget, save, and invest.

These are my financial details:

* Take home pay is $5600/month.
* Rent+utilities+bills+gas are about $1600/month. Not sure exactly how much entertainment+food is. Only recently started to track those figures.
* No debt.
* No plans on buying a home, will be renting for a while.
* Have bought the old family car from parents, no longer planning to buy one anymore. Cars are expensive!


I am completely clueless on how pensions, RRSPs, and employee matched contributions work. Also, I plan to move out of Canada in 3 years (max, maybe even 1-2), and potentially live and work in Asia. On this note:

* How does a pension work in that case? If I leave in 3 years, and choose to retire here much later, can I still claim a pension? Would it even be significant?
* What about employee matched contributions? Am I really getting anything by giving up x% of my income if I will no longer be working in Canada?


What I'd really like to get more information on is investing some of the money I've saved up so far. Currently, I've got about $40K in the bank. Some of it is in my chequings account, and the rest is all in savings.

I would like to start investing this money, with consideration to what will happen if I move out of the country? Setting aside an emergency fund, how do I start investing?

* What portion of my income do I toss into my savings and what do I invest?
* How do my investments in say domestic / international stocks / bonds work if I leave the country?
* How do I even begin with making these investments (is there software/websites I can use, or do I find a financial planner?)

I guess I'm looking to start a portfolio? Is a three-fund portfolio mentioned in the FAQ suitable for someone in my position? How do I start and manage this portfolio?

I am so clueless on these matters that I'll take any advice I can get on where/how to get started. What would you do in my position?

Note that it is very likely I'll be moving out of Canada after a few years, so I am not looking to make any investments that will tie me down here.



Thank you /r/personalfinance!"
2ew3ee,1,2014-08-29,Getting Better Seems Worse,SilentPatient,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2ew3ee/getting_better_seems_worse/,"Everything about depression is about getting better.

Learning-to-live-with-it this, support-system that, let's quantify it or describe what it is and isn't and insist that people understand and outsiders don't understand and yadda yadda yadda.

All of that makes me angry. And here's why. Let me first say that my brain tells me what I'm about to say is all wrong. But the rest of me has this to say...

Progress, in context of depression, to me appears to be delusion rather than success. When I hear about someone feeling better because they told their family, or someone doing slightly better with medication, or someone having found something that helps them cope, I get angry (inwardly) with them for succumbing to this ""delusion"". Here they are, depressed, and they've gone and confounded the issue by pretending that something is helping.

From where I sit, I'm looking out over a beautiful nighttime cityscape. This evening a girl I've been campaigning with for some time agreed to, in the near future, see some movies with me. My classes are already going much better than last year. I love my job. **None of it helps.** I'm still laughing maniacally at romantic movies on Netflix, alone, in the dark, hating myself and a lot of people around me.

I don't trust my family because they tell me nice things about me.
I don't trust my friends because they're friends with people who don't like me -- and anyway they tell me nice things too.
I do trust those people, but they validate all of the things I think about myself. So why should I believe that a ""support system"" will help?

If I take medication, I surrender my mind to the chemical haze that is american pharmacology. What will be real? When will my medication suddenly fail me? How will I distinguish my own mind from the black creature that torments me with feigned, momentary happiness?

I have ways to cope. I play the piano, but I'm insecure about my talent - and as we know, insecurity is depression's greatest portal. I watch movies, but when they end I feel worse for not leaving my room and creating my own happy ending. I drink, but not nearly enough.

So when people say anything involving the words ""was"" or ""used to be"", it infuriates me that they believe in some way out. Who is it that's lying to you, saying they understand? What psychiatrist and pharmacist are making money off of you? What lies are you reading on the internet about encouragement and support?

I don't want your fantasy world. I don't want your drugs, or your puppy-eyed sympathy. I don't want you to tell me you understand, even if you do. I don't want you to confess that you don't understand. I don't want you to earn my trust by being an amazing friend, and I don't want any more enemies. I want to yell and punch stuff and make it worse. Because that's what I believe in. I believe that it can get worse. I can fail out of college. I can fail to start a decent career. I can blow it with this girl, just like I've done with the last ten. I can alienate my friends by sitting alone in the dark. I can finally disillusion my family, I can cry, and I can get more and more angry.

So this bullshit about getting better needs to stop. There is no such thing. I'm depressed, and I don't need to be told what it is and what it isn't. I don't give a shit that I'm not the only one. I don't want to see a therapist. I don't want help. I just want to stay here.

....and then a tiny, tiny, tiny voice tries to convince me that I desperately want to be held. I want to get out of this room and this town and this god-forsaken school; away from all of these ""professionals"" and interns and successful people and and and and and and. I want to crack open this outer shell and pour it all over someone. I want to actually play my feelings on the piano. I want to want to get better. I want to trust my friends and my family.

But the monster keeps rushing back, driving me to my desk in my dark room, my bed, my nothingness. Anger. Mistrust, and hate. It's a war between me and myself. And I'm losing every battle.

And at the end, the monster tells me that I'm alone and I don't want to get better.
And I believe him."

#/r/Eyebombing

**15,323** readers for **2 years**

There is a small, niche culture of people called the ""Eyebombers"" that don't travel anywhere without their trusty peel-and-stick googliieies (spelling according to the resident experts, the /r/eyebombing mods). They are said to roam the streets, looking for anything that even vaguely resembles a face, affixing their accouterments on the object to make it look goofy and foolish. 

Their hits include [trees](http://i.imgur.com/adAOhtJ.jpg), [Jesus](http://i.imgur.com/j7bDwVt.jpg), and [lots and lots of drinks](http://i.imgur.com/JkksEUv.jpg). This hit fad makes everyday, common objects come to life in a quick personification - it's like /r/Pareidolia on steroids. The humorous look on everything from beach balls to windows make eyebombing one of the funniest and most innocuous pranks out there. 

There are even [gifs](http://i.imgur.com/A0japgf.jpg) of eyebombing victims, that range from hilarious to [creepy](http://i.imgur.com/IPTEm.gif). Some victims even end up looking like [pop culture references](http://i.imgur.com/Gba4ENk.jpg).

Overall /r/eyebombing is one of the most innovative and hilarious subs out there, with high quality posts and an active fanbase. The posts are easy to digest and offer some of the most laughs-per-view that I have ever seen.

After having seen the hilarious antics of ""eyebombing"" firsthand, I have ordered my own set [of googly eyes from Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Watch-them-wiggle-Black-PIECES/dp/B0074MHV7W/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1407169547&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=googly+eyes). I know that I will soon be turning everyday objects into googly-eyed beings!

I asked /u/billybird about the subreddit, and here were his answers. 

&gt;1.) What gave you the idea to start an ""eyebombing"" subreddit?
 &gt;&gt;Actually I think “User17”, created it due to popular demand in the “Funny” subreddit. However I am a little unclear. As one of the founders of the eyebombing, I took on some of the modly duties some time afterwards.

&gt;2.) Do you, as the mods, ""eyebomb"" other things, or do you only do your modly duties? 
&gt;&gt;Well I do eyebombing fairly regularly, I always have “googly eyes” in my jacket. You never know, when you find the perfect spot. For me that would be an especially dreary place, with a need of some spontaneous smiles.

&gt;3.) Is there something you never leave your house without? 
&gt;&gt;Googliieies.

&gt;4.) What has been your favorite post in the subreddit as of yet?
&gt;&gt; I am leaning towards this: http://www.reddit.com/r/eyebombing/comments/22ftzg/we_meet_again_se%C3%B1or_banco/ I love how the guy have put so much effort into making his own giant googly eyes.

&gt;5.) Is there anything special about you that makes you stand out?
 &gt;&gt;Well, I think the sub is good for a few laughs. Personally I find it really rewarding to see the creativity, that most of the posts represent. It interesting to see how some ordinary thing, is suddenly turned into something hilarious.

&gt;6.) Is /r/eyebombing a spontaneous creation, or did it start from a single post, or was it a ""brain child""? 

&gt;&gt;“Eyebombing” was Peter and my brainchild, you can see a nice explanatory video here: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-25449223


&gt;7.) Is there anything else you would like to have us know about you or your subreddit? 

&gt;&gt;Not really, it’s a good humoured lot. :)

Note: This is my first story to /r/SubredditOfTheDay. I'm currently an intern and hope to soon become a permanent fixture here. 

I am a huge Marvel fan, as well as an avid tech user. My favorite subreddits include /r/jailbreak, /r/happycrowds, /r/marvelstudios, and my nurtured lovechild, /r/damnthatsinteresting."
2ewixt,3,2014-08-29,Living the dream isn't as great as it seem to be.,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2ewixt/living_the_dream_isnt_as_great_as_it_seem_to_be/,"I became severely depressed in the beginning of high school. I tried killing myself on several occasions but put it of for one thing: I believed that I am only depressed because I don't have the things I want, because I am not living my dream life. This idea kept me alive until the end of high school. 
In the first year of college I decided to really push myself to chase after what I wanted. I thought that I was depressed because l don't have any friends. So I made a great effort to know my roommate and floor mates. Some relations fell apart and others stayed until this day. Then I thought that I was depressed because I didn't socialized enough, so I started going out to parties, movies, hikes, and other activities. At the end of the year, I had a great bunch of drinking buddies, but more importantly a handful of friends I am still in contact with. 
    Start of second year, I was still depressed despite all I had, so I thought maybe its because I was not happy with my body (I am on the scrawny side). So I started working out, and I started eating more and more. At the same time I thought I was also depressed because I am missing out on the ""college experience"". So I pushed myself to the limit and rushed a fraternity. I was able to get in because many of my friends from freshman year rushed and put in a good word for me. Again, I didn't forge lifelong friendships with everyone, but I picked up a few people that I know had my back. We went on hikes, studies together, partied together, helped each other out. It was great, I couldn't have asked for anything better. The end of second year, I got more fit (though not as much as I wanted, but it was okay), had good academic standing, a job, seeing a counselor and taking lexapro, great deal of friends and was always occupied in doing something. But every morning, day and night, no matter where I was and what I was doing, I still had the depression lingering over me. The thought of ending my life still haunts me every moment. 
    Start of third year, I thought I was depressed because I don't know what I wanted to do with my life. So I sat down with a career counselor and talked through my interests and goals, and I came up with something I thought I would enjoy. So I started applying to jobs that would become stepping stones to my ultimate career goal. After a lot of turn downs I finally found an internship. At the same time I also set a timeline for myself. I know what I want to do after graduation, the kind of jobs I would apply for and the grad school I want to go. I was all set career-wise. 
    By the time I graduated, I had everything I would have hoped for as the start of a successful and amazing life. Friends, career, money. And yet... and yet... everything single waking day, I am still depressed. Some days I have to literally punch myself in the face to get out of bed. And every time I achieve something, all I feel is gray and monotone emotion, and it took me everything to just give my life one more chance to get that last thing in my dream instead of killing myself. 
    Now I am desperate. I don't know what I want anymore. Or actually, I have made a reality of the things I want, but I am still as depressed as when I first started. So now I think to myself, maybe I lost the battle even before I began, maybe depression just gave me a false sense of hope that I may conquer so only to reveal the fact that it is impossible to defeat. 
    I suppose I will have to struggle on, to find that missing piece of the puzzle. I just do hope I still have enough stamina to carry on after all those years, because I am really tired, so so tired of overcoming obstacles and not seeing the end.

2ewjmo,1,2014-08-29,I cut off ties to my family a year and a half ago and haven't seen them since [AMA],[deleted],casualiama,https://www.reddit.com/r/casualiama/comments/2ewjmo/i_cut_off_ties_to_my_family_a_year_and_a_half_ago/,"Disclaimer to admin: This is not supposed to be an advertisement for my business and I also don't want any bias towards race or gender (as a fun little social experiment for myself), so I'll use simple and vague language when describing my story. Everything I mention here is true. I will entertain any and all questions so long as they are not attempts at uncovering sensitive information such as my name, the names of the people I've mentioned, my former employees, the address of my studio, and/or the name of the brand. 

tldr: This is the story of me starting my own clothing brand and running away from home when I was 17 and realized that I wasn't going to be able to do what I loved and also be with my family. 

I'm currently a 19 year old living in NYC and I've loved fashion for as long as I can remember. I come from a super conservative family that places a lot of faith in two things that I find somewhat contradictory, religion and school. And also family. First, I totally value education, however, I place no value in school and structured learning after a certain point. I used to attend one of the best high schools in the nation and I grew disenchanted with having my career options narrowed down to like three things and being asked what I want to do when I'm older and being hit with the infamous, ""pick something more realistic"" after I reply. Although I am currently in college for business and marketing, I don't see why I should spend thousands of dollars on a BACHELORS degree that'll land me an internship and maybe a job IF I'm lucky which is what my parents wanted me to do. I just didn't see it as a worthy investment. Not to mention that I would have to do it on a loan because my mother can't work and my dad hadn't had a job in 9 years. We had been living off of government aid and my weekly paychecks as well as my brothers. Secondly, I had been (and still am) agnostic for the longest time so listening to my father preach about how there are seven angels firmly planted on earth that hold up the heavens always gave me a headache. As for family, my sister was married off in an arranged marriage to an abusive husband who still visits my house and has a bite to eat and I absolutely loathe him. Out of the eight years that my sister has been married to him, four of them have been spent living with our parents because he beats her. I've literally called the police once only to be bullied into not saying anything by my own family. My sister has convinced herself that she wants to be with him and they all try to get me to get along with my brother-in-law. My parents believe that if they were to separate, it would make our family look bad. This is just one example, but this need to always SEEM perfect and happy to our relatives has always ended up hurting me and my siblings. I've seen their faces and I remember talking to them and trying to comfort them with empty words. They knew that they had their lives planned out for them by our parents based on their religious beliefs and needs. I was going to be different, I wasn't going to let people walk all over my dreams as if I was worth anything less than what I am.

I had spent the last three years before I left selling drugs, running small scams/cons, and working overtime shifts to fund my fashion line. Sounds corny, I know. But fashion was and still is a wonderful world for me. For the last two years before I ran away, I had been lying about how I spend my time. The first time was when I lied to my parents when I was 16 and told them I'm going to Washington DC for an internship to work as an assistant for some businessman and instead, mustered up the money I saved up and traveled to Ulbrique, Spain to speak to the owner of a prominent leather factory to discuss my bag designs. I secured a partnership with them and was back in NYC within the week. After that, it was just lie after lie and plane ticket after plane ticket. By the time I was ready to leave, I had traveled to Milan, Paris, and London for fashion week. I created various fragrances, took classes in shoemaking and created a line of men's shoes/slippers and heels for women, traveled to Switzerland and submitted various designs for wristwatches, and even designed my own packaging for this brand. I had burned through all of the money I had saved up within those three years and I went looking for private angel investors to find some way to market my products and sell them. My former tutor (family friend) who had introduced me to fashion at a young age, taught me Italian, taught me French, taught me my manners, how to walk/talk, and carry myself had risen from a similar lower class background as me to a cushy job on Wall St and was married and had 2 kids. I went to him, showed him my designs, explained my situation to him, and was eventually greeted with enough money for a 700 square feet studio for an entire year, office equipment, camera gear, and a new laptop. I changed my name to a more Western name, I started wearing my own designs, I applied for food stamps and unemployment benefits to survive, and I paid for a professional web designer to help me build a clean website that would run seamlessly. Within a month, I had 2,000 people with accounts on the website and I was funneling the money from my sales through my tutor's bank account since I was too young for my own at the time. I was making an average of around $2500 in sales every week and packaging, shipping, and handling customer requests was too much for me so I hired 3 interns and an assistant to work for me while I took on the bigger fish. I convinced my tutor to let me keep and reinvest my earnings throughout my first year in exchange for interest on his initial investment. I didn't want to let the brand die and I had so many ideas that I hadn't given birth to. It's been a crazy year since then. I kept putting out new collections, kept hiring models and interns, kept selling, and after my year was up, paying my tutor was a huge financial blow to me. I was too proud to ask him for more time so I just paid up and explained that things were going great. I spent almost two months holding off on my rent, ran small cons/sold drugs like I did in high school, held off on my brand, got a part time job, spent another month locked out of my studio and homeless, and was eventually able to get my place back. I decided to take two gap years and focus on my brand growing since I know it could possibly be a successful designer brand in the future while working part time to help keep my operation moving forward. I say that because it has gained a bit of a following and some traction on social media as well as the website, not just out of some freaky, unconditional, motherly love for my creations.

Thanks for reading."

I'm going to be starting my internship exchange in Nov 2014 till June 2015 as a visiting student researcher.

Does anyone have any experience with the pros and cons of living in Caltech vs looking for something private?

Caltech housing seems to be about $725/month (inclusive of utilities). Should I look for off-campus housing? Will it be cheaper? Im fine with living in a big house (eg 4br house shared with 4 people). I don't drive though (no license, don't intend to get one), I'd prefer to bike.

I'm looking for cheap, furnished, and accessible, with emphasis on the first two criteria.

Thanks guys!"
2exrac,1,2014-08-29,I [M/22] feel like I'm losing her...,kyeovo,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/2exrac/i_m22_feel_like_im_losing_her/,"First time posting here, but I've been lurking for a while and this sub has aways been extremely helpful. Sorry if this comes across as too long, I'll try and sum it up at the bottom.

Basically, I met a girl [F/21] online at the start of the year, and we instantly hit it off. Within a couple months we were practically together in everything but name. We'd talk all day, share everything, talk about the future together and things were just genuinely amazing. I've never felt like this about a girl before. I'm from the UK while she is from the USA, so while the distance has always been a factor, we've both been confident we can overcome, we even had an end date in mind. 

Anyway, that's the background. Earlier this month it came time for us to finally meet, so I flew to stay with her for ten days. Things went great for a few days, but then we started to have issues. I was pretty nervous the whole time, but my nerves and insecurities came across as being aloof to her, and about a week in we had a massive discussion about us and things were said that put this whole thing in jeopardy, and things were just kind of awkward from that point on.

Before I left, we both said we'd try to make it work, but I feel like I'm losing her and it won't be long until things are officially over. I got back yesterday morning and we haven't really talked. She's going to be extremely busy the next couple of months with school/college/internships so I understand that communication won't be as easy as it was, which is something that has been stressing her out, but I don't want to give up on this. I struggle to imagine not talking to her every day, let alone not having her in my life at all. She's the most incredible girl and letting this slip will be something that will stick with me for a long time, if it were to happen. I know she starts her internship soon and I've arranged to have flowers delivered to her today to wish her luck.

So basically, my question. Has anyone else gotten to this near-breaking point before and managed to salvage the relationship? Any stories or advice would be amazingly appreciated. Thanks.

TL;DR: Me and my girl met for the first time but things didn't go as plan, and I'm worried all hope for us is lost.

2exslm,11,2014-08-29,[Warning: Long Post] Does anyone else feel so tired/helpless/apathetic they can't help themselves even when they know how ?,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2exslm/warning_long_post_does_anyone_else_feel_so/,"I know some things are good for me: eating right (or at all some days), exercising, socializing, seeing a therapist, applying for a job, ask for help from a friend, admit you're feeling upset...

But I can't convince myself to even try - to even take the tiniest step on 99.9% of things. Sometimes, I try just a teeny tiny bit when I have the energy and then it works a little (or even a lot), but even that positivity doesn't make me feel motivated to try more.

So, most days I spend laying around in bed and quite literally staring at a wall. I never actually get tired of staring at a wall because it's so relaxing not to have to expend energy; the only time I stop is when I start getting bad thoughts/panic attacks. Then I know it's time to distract myself, so I do something low energy like post on here or play a simple game.

Last year I was incredibly depressed (emotionally), and I was still functional. I ate pretty well, I occasionally exercised (like 1-2x a week), I saw a therapist, I had lots of nice friends who actually cared about me, I tried medication/treatment and didn't give up if they failed, I got an internship that paid a good amount of money. I was incredibly sad, cried often, felt like I was dying on the inside - but at least I could DO things. Even though I was sad, I also LIKED things - friendship, my job, my school, my boyfriend.

Then, I became more depressed, only now extremely apathetic. I refused acknowledge my boss out of fear of a discussing a return offer. I refused to apply for jobs, even when recruiters e-mailed me 3-4x or tried to call me. I refused to respond to any professors or friends offers to help me find a job. This is not to say I was elite or something, but in my field they're dying to fill spots. There's more spots than people, so they'll do whatever they can to help you.

I thought ""okay, I must not just want a job"". The truth is, now I realize, ***I don't want anything***. It only got worse - I refused any help at all. I refused to socialize because I know it either a) hurts them and/or b) makes them not want to hang out with me. If people text me, I rarely text back. I ignore my boyfriend. I only respond to 2 people who seem unaffected by my depression and will let me be as apathetic as I want. Now, I refuse even basic bodily functions like eating unless I feel like I'm going to die.

The only time I do something is when I get enough energy for a day or two. Sometimes, I eat a bunch on these days and I feel physically better - but not emotionally better. It's not a lot of energy, but I feel like I waste that too by trying to figure out my feelings alone instead of doing something that would actually help. This seems so much easier though than trying.

I try to be thankful and positive. I try to muster up the energy to WANT things only to feel extraordinarily tired and fall asleep - NOT voluntarily. I literally feel my body go physically weak. I can literally fall asleep trying to interact with people because I get so exhausted. After 2-3 hours of hanging out with a close friend I just fall asleep. Taking a shower makes me sleepy. Eating makes me tired. Thinking makes me tired. Enjoyment makes me tired. Being upset makes me tired.

I just feel like I am an incredibly wasteful person. I am doing only the minimum to survive; I am essentially a vegetable.

Has anyone experienced something similar? Does anyone have any insight/general advice?"

Firstly, please forgive my ""Noobness"". It has been a longtime since I took those networking classes and courses in school. Since then I have relied all to heavily on associates, co-workers, and friends to handle the heavy Networking and Server Configuration stuff. Now however, I want to learn and I feel a friends project is exactly what I need to get my hands dirty again.

I must also apologize for my lack of communication skills and not being very articulate. I have a disability (dumbness) and as such I might need to go over things several times. Please excuse me for that and treat me as though I was a high-school student (though most surely know more than I do at this point).

So my friend is an Attorney and his firm needs:
*To access AbacusLaw remotely from their Laptops (2 or 3 at this time)
*He has two offices one in LA, and one in SD
*Me to build him a server capable of running two clients remotely, simultaneously
*OS/Software (MS Server 2012 ?)
*And to keep costs down as they are a really small firm with only 2-3 Employees

I was really hoping we could just set-up a NAS, but from what everyone is saying that is not going to be an option. Which is sad because now he needs to invest some serious money into this Set-up.

I have not actually set-up Server 2012 and will need your guys help and advice. I have searched a lot lately and spent a lot of time talking to people in regards to this but everyone I talk to say that this forum is the go to place for this stuff. So what I am going to do is use this post to help others. I will be using this post and your expertise as a step-by-step guide.

Please advise. The more thorough and articulate you can be, the better. Here are my questions (Will update as I go):

What Software do we need exactly ? Remember, they will be remotely accessing Abacus on the server to use in Court and in their Satellite Office in LA.

What Hardware do they need exactly ? I have built quite a few servers in the last few years but I mostly use Workstation MoBo's, Xeon's, ECC Ram however we want to keep costs down so we are hoping we can use something like:
-Intel Pentium G3258
-MSi Z97I AC
-2x 1TB Seagate Barracuda (1x for Backup)
-Corsair 8GB 1600MHz RAM

Is there a way to set it up so they don't need an extra Keyboard/Mouse/Monitor ? They will never actually use the Server for anything right ? But I do understand that this is something that they just have to accept, most likely.

How exactly do we set-up the OS for this type of Remote Access ? (Sorry for asking this but I do want to help others who are looking for this exact information so I will use this to help them)

How bad is the latency or lag going to be ?

Why wouldn't we just be able to build two PC's at the main office in San Diego, and use Teamviewer or something to access those ? Is that lag/latency going to be that bad ? That would save so much money. Please help me explain this to my friend.

Are they going to be able to access the files at the same time ? That might be a 1% case scenario.

http://us.msi.com/product/mb/Z97I_AC.html#hero-overview



Okay, well that about sums up where I am at right now. I was really hoping I could just set my buddy up with a NAS, and then allow it to host the files they needed, but Abacus is saying we need to build the Server, use the high-cost MS Server OS, Host the Program on that, set-up the remote access and Terminal Management ? Or what have you, and go from there. They do not know anything about Linux, or using the NAS like that, and only suggest the high-cost option.

Please post links to any Guides, or Tutorials that I will be using. I do have an intern that I am training in this matter to so for his sake I will be asking some really basic questions.

Again, please excuse my lack of understanding and knowledge but I think this will also help others.

2exyrs,6,2014-08-29,CIA GPA Requirement,WhySheHateMe,washingtondc,https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/2exyrs/cia_gpa_requirement/,"Hey guys,

I've been out of school since December (graduated) and since then, I have been working and studying for certifications. I saw something I was interested in on the CIA's career website that I think I am well suited for...however, I notice that they are asking for you to have atleast a 3.0 in College (if you went to college..) 

How strict are they on this? I've been out of school for a while and while I'm OK with submitting my grades, I don't think its absolutely necessary if I've been working and have job experience + past internships.

Also, if your GPA was lower than a 3.0, will you automatically be disqualified as an applicant? I tried desperately to make it in Computer Science and failed miserably (twice!) before realizing that I'm just not smart enough and switched to a Telecom degree. The major I switched to didn't do ""Major"" GPAs (My Major GPA would have been over a 3.0) so, I was stuck with all those bullet holes from Engineering affecting my Cumulative GPA.

If you guys could offer some input if you have experience applying with the CIA, I would be grateful :)

I'm still confused.",useless85,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2ey5iu/me_22m_with_my_gf_21f_of_2_years_she_broke_up/,"**I am SO sorry that this is so long. I just kept typing my feeling out. I'll try to keep this organized in a way that gives the most background in the quickest way. Sorry for any possible confusion, I will try to edit anything if it is confusing.**


We became a couple during the beginning of our second year at college. We had gone on a couple dates at the end of our first year of college after first meeting as friends about 2 months before our first date. She is my first/only girlfriend I have ever had and I am her first serious relationship. (she had only dated a few people before me, but only for a couple months) So, we were both new at the long-term thing for sure.


My personality is introverted and I have usually taken pride in the fact that I am a logical thinker, being very level headed. I've always tried hiding my emotions, even from my family. Her personality is very extroverted, full of energy, she's very level headed as well. She's more emotionally driven than I am, but I wouldn't say she likes talking about emotions either.


I know for me her personality is what attracted me to her in the first place. I have learned so much from her these past two years about opening myself up and getting out more (which was close to non-existant, before), but you can imagine that there would be times where we clashed over these types of things because of our opposite personalities. 


For example, whenever we did have arguments (we've never yelled at each other) they were usually about how we stay in too much and how she would want us to go out with our friends more. I did try going out more; parties, events, just groups of people that we knew hanging out at someones house with some drinks and stuff (I'm not really into drinking, I've tried it and I just don't really ""get it""), but with my personality these things always freak me the **** out. I get super anxious, my shell goes on, and sometimes even panic attacks. I hate the feelings and I also hate the fact that that's what happens when I go out, I don't want to feel like that. 


Also, there were times that I would stay in and she would go out with our friends without me and I would get so worried about her safety and anxious that, stupid me, would just shut down my emotions and she would take it as me being ""mad at her for going out instead of staying in with [me]."" (I just learned this recently from a good friend who has been helping me through the breakup. I had never known from that point of view that me staying in was probably coming across as ""I would rather stay by myself than be with you where I'm uncomfortable."" And I feel horrible)


This past spring (before our internships) during classes I noticed (in hindsight, unfortunately) that we were both in a lot of stress from school and under stress because we knew that our separation was coming up and we've been almost inseparable, having never had to deal with long separation. On top of that (!) I was in the process of planning on studying abroad in the fall right after our internships, so we wouldn't see each other until Christmas. (Long story short, that plan fell through in the middle of the summer and I was back to the regular schedule of being back at our University for classes in the fall, but at the time of the stress we didn't know that.)


My GF and I were separated this summer, because of our internships, for 4 months. We were on opposite coasts of the US. It was the first time we had been separated for more than like a week or two, which would happen between semesters when we went home for breaks.


This summer was also my first time living totally on my own and I had to find a place quickly in the city where my job was because getting the job was last minute. Not knowing much about the city I ended up in a bad part of town with the place I had secured and the place I ended up in was a dump. I was scared of going out of my room. The only time I went outside was quickly going to my car. This, added with the facts of being separated from my girlfriend, and my family, in a totally new part of the country, as well as being in a city after growing up rural areas all my life, I quickly became severely depressed. EDIT: I also had horrible internet in the apartment and Skype would never work for us.


My depression hit me hard, I clammed up. I wasn't very conversational at all, I was always in a defensive/bad mood. It was hard for me to talk about things. (I'm not good on the phone anyway) And she was having a blast at her internship! Making new friends, tons of sightseeing (granted the city she was in was way cooler than the one I was in), and eventually turing 21 toward the end of the summer and she started doing night-life things with her friends. It wasn't helping my depression knowing that I couldn't join in with her. I wasn't being outwardly excited for her and I feel like she started to take it personally, and I feel like she didn't understand my depression. But, knowing that it was one day closer to seeing her again was the only thing that got me through it! (I do NOT want to use my depression as an excuse, I know I didn't handle myself and things the right way and that's my fault!)


We had been making a bunch of plans of things to do together when we got back. I was so excited to see her again, but I (again) wasn't outwardly excited like she would have hoped and that started an argument about how I ""was too bummed about [my] summer to he excited for [hers]."" I kind of got defensive and that didn't help things. We kept arguing about how I wanted to spend some alone time with her when we got back to catch up and she wanted to go out with friends as soon as we got back. (the argument started a few days before we were due back at school)


The day before we were going to be moving back to our University I tried texting her a ""good morning"" when I woke up. She said, ""Do you mind if I have some space? I will see you tomorrow."" That's when I knew something was really wrong. The next day my parents helped me move in to my new apartment and then she got into town and then met up at my new place for us to ""talk."" She came over, I apologized immediately for not knowing how much my introvertedness had been affecting her for about the last 5 months, we exchanged birthday gifts since we had both had birthdays in the summer) and then we talked. (Well, she didn't say much)


We cried. I tried explaining what was going on with me. She said that it was affecting her all summer. This was news to me. I didn't know anything was bothering her, she didn't talk about it. I was confused. Then she kept saying ""I can't do it anymore. I can't."" Gave me the ""you're a good guy"" speech, as well as that she knew we had had hypothetical talks before about what we would be like 20 years from now, but she said she couldn't see it anymore. She said that she had changed this summer. (I didn't really get a reason, or what she changed into) She said that she couldn't make me happy anymore and I tried explaining to her that she didn't have to ""make me happy"" and she should never feel like that, because I don't believe that that's what relationships are about. I told her that just her, as she is, makes me happy. Yes, I may be disappointed in certain events or if something doesn't go my way, but that's human nature, it doesn't mean I'm unhappy with us. It's on a different level. In the end she left and I was left confused and in pain. (EDIT: Her mind was made up before coming over to ""talk."" She said she just wanted to hear my side. Whatever that means. *Shrug*)


It was all so sudden. We had been making plans days and weeks before for what stuff we wanted to do together and with our friends when we got back to school. I was so excited to take her out to a bar for our first time, to celebrate our birthdays together, and to take her to see the summer movies she didn't get to see. Then BAM, we meet for the first time in 4 months and this happens.


What I didn't get to tell her was that I can understand how she changed (even though I didn't know what), because I had changed as well. I saw her with her friends and doing things being adventurous in pictures and I want that happiness now! I had the whole summer to reflect on what I had been missing out with shutting myself in and I was excited to start trying these things more and more with her. I didn't get a chance to EXPLAIN that too her. It happened so fast. I also didn't get to explain to her that I was perfectly fine with not picking up where we left off. I was feeling like that would have been too much pressure for the both of us and that we should ease back into it after being apart. 


I have not talked to her since that night. I've been giving space at the advice of my friend who has been helping us both through it. (the friend is a female of both me and my GF, we've known each other since the beginning of college, I view her like a sister) 


It's been almost a week since it happened and I haven't slept much and I haven't been eating. (I couldn't keep it down at first, then I just didn't feel like it) On top of that this week was the first week of classes. I keep having panic attacks, I can't stop thinking about it. 


I WANT TO FIX THIS!


Any advice would be most welcome. As I said, I haven't talked to her yet in respect for her space, but I would like to next week. I've started eating and sleeping again because I've been talking about it with my friend and my family. Actually, I think some good has come out of the pain. This week was the first time I have ever had an emotional conversation with my father. I've learned a lot about myself even. I started writing down my throughs and emotions and I've never done that before. I'm actually kind of excited to talk to her, because I want to be happy about all of the things that we wanted to do, and I want to share with her what I found out about myself through the process, and I feel like if we do get back together it would be an exciting new chapter in our relationship. I just don't know her thoughts at all, because we haven't talked since that night and both of our minds were clouded with emotions at the time.


She was the first person that I ever showed any emotions towards or talked about them to. I cried more times talking with her about things in the first month of our relationship than I think I did through my entire teenage years. (I was so ""good"" at hiding behind my shell that I didn't even cry when family members passed away.) I trust her in every sense of the word and I shared every aspect of my life with her. 


**I'm a firm believer in that nothing can grow without resistance.** That's what I feel about this, but I don't know how she feels.


Today would have been our two-year mark as a couple.


Sorry if it sound like I'm repeating myself, I switched around some paragraphs.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------   

**TL;DR:** My GF of 2 years and I have had clashes over our opposite personalities in the past. We were potentially not going to see each other for 8 months. I get depressed. She sees it (possibly? I'm guessing) as us growing apart. We see each other after 4 months, she breaks up with me, because she ""can't anymore."" I'm utterly confused because it came out of nowhere for me. First-break-up week is the most painful thing I've ever had to endure, but I learn some things about myself and us. I'm excited to ask to talk to her after giving her some space for what potentially we could both learn from it. 


What advice could I get from this and for talking to her? Because I want it to work out. "
2ey7vg,4,2014-08-29,Garmin or Cerner?,garminorcerner,kansascity,https://www.reddit.com/r/kansascity/comments/2ey7vg/garmin_or_cerner/,"Hey all, graduating in May of 2015 w/ a major in CS. I've gotten offers from Garmin, Cerner, and a couple other random companies I don't want to work at. I'm really only between Garmin and Cerner, and honestly don't know which way to lean, and figured a handful from both companies reddit on here.

My basic pros and cons are as follows:

**Garmin:**

*PROS*

* Already been an intern here, the team I would work for is good.

* Pay is higher / Benefits seem mostly better

*CONS*

* I'm CS, not a CE or EE - so I think I'd be starting at a disadvantage.

* Don't really want to spend all my life working in C++. Was hoping to do higher level work, (Obj-C, Java, C#, etc.)

**Cerner:**

*PROS*

* Would get to work in high level langauges

* More suited to my major

*CONS*

* I've heard that the work life balance can blow

* Lower starting salary and worse benefits

Anything obvious that I've missed? Anyone else been in the same situation (and how did you pick / are you happy with your choice)? How do the locations of the two compare? I'm not from KC so I don't really know the area at all.

My uncle just went through a terrible break up and was kicked out of the house he shared with his now ex. He has a pretty good reason to be here, but he is a bad alcoholic (that has only gotten worse since the break up) who spends most of his money on booze. I fear that he wont find another place because he will never save up enough money because he is to occupied with his addiction. He currently sleeps on my couch.

My mother... is a piece of work. When I was very little (too little to really remember completely) she cheated on my father and disappeared. I didn't see her once, between the ages of 5 and 13. Around my 13th birthday she shows up randomly with a 5 year old daughter (my half sister) and promptly vanishes again for another year or so. In all this time, not once did she pay an dollar in child support. I could never call her, because once every 4 months, she ups and moves across country with my half sister (my half sister is really awesome despite all this btw).

She is a man eater by trade. She gets with men, marries them, drains them for all their money, until they can no longer support themselves and then leaves. In the short amount of time I have known her (give or take 12 years, on and off) I have seen her do this to 6 men. I have even tried to warn one of them and they ran and told her what I said and trashed talked me because I talked bad about her. I learned my lesson about warning them and won't do it again because of that.

To this day, she will not stay in one STATE longer than 3 months. She had a very nice job as a counselor here in IL, and got bored (i guess?) and up and moved down to Alabama, then moved back up here, then to Georgia, now shes back here living with me, while she ""looks for a place.""

I don't even know what to tell the landlord. Actually, when she first came back up here (this last time) she told me she wasnt staying with me. She told me she was staying with a friend. So thats what I told the land lord. Then she said she was just going to stay the night, then the week, then the month, now its been three. Her and her husband live in my basement. Not a full basement mind you, but a shitty storage basement with a concrete floor, cinderblock walls, and floods when it rains.

Now lets talk about her husband. Her current husband is a loser in the purest sense of the word. He's 45, 6'5 and dresses like the lead singer of greenday. On top of all that, he refuses to fucking work. You might ask ""why is she with him when you just said she goes for men that can support her indefinitely?"" I'll tell you why. Disability. The guy is 45 years old and ""completely disabled."" I put that in quotations to mark the sarcasm. Every fucking day the guy claims some new ailment, but he won't let my mother go into the doctors office with him so we dont know if the shit is true at all. He won't do shit because he says his ""legs swell up"" or ""his ankles hurt"" or his because of his ""knee"" injury. The mother fucker wont even drive his self to the god damn store because he says he will get lost. Keep in mind, he doesnt have a car, so this is me offering him to borrow MINE.

What makes it fucking worse, what really, really, makes me hate they guy, is that the fucker is such a god damn picky eater, that I have to tailor meals around him. I have to do the god damn shopping with him in mind. The other day I made chicken and rice. Bought a whole chicken, boiled it, picked all the meat of the bones, ect ect. When I was finished we all grabbed a bowl, and i noticed the mother fucker making himself a sandwich. When i asked him why he said ""oh, i only eat brown rice."" and went about his fucking merry way eating my bread, and my ham.

Mom mom is using him for what little he makes and she doesn't even hide it. Hes just too immature to notice. Hell, even when they sleep, they sleep with their heads at the opposite sides of the bed. 

None of the people that live in my house pay me a cent. I feed them, house them, and pay for their gas. I am a more than full time student that lives of my MGIB and what little i get paid from my internship. It is breaking me. My landlord fucking hates me, because he thinks I've been lying about it the whole time.

Its killing me, but i cant say no to family...

**Thanks for the great input guys. I'm gonna sit everyone down tonight and have a pow wow. They have until the 1st. Its a bit short of notice, but they have had 3 months and im fairly sure that if they start feeling the pressure, some alternatives will ""magically"" appear**"
2eyhen,36,2014-08-29,"I made switch. Something to prove something, and I am fine with that I found, which I want to share with this community.",[deleted],SSBPM,https://www.reddit.com/r/SSBPM/comments/2eyhen/i_made_switch_something_to_prove_something_and_i/,"Since I started playing Project M, I've loved it. Even with it's flaws (which are not that big) I've enjoyed every match, every game, every defeat and every victory.

Yet there are people that dismiss this gem of a game in favor of Melee. I do not expect that PM ever replaces Melee, given it's unofficial status of mod, but it is a great sequel.

It is a game better than I ever expected Brawl to be, and even then, this is not about Brawl and it's engine and the direction Sakurai wants to take the games.

This is about the Melee community dismissing a brilliant piece of craftsmanship with very little reason, other than that it is not Melee.

We all here know and understand that there are some characters that are better than others for tourney play, right? But for the first time in Smash history, I feel like I can actually play well with the entire cast! Maybe not win a tourney with Fox or Olimar, but I can see their weaknesses and strengths and I can put them on display in the battlefield in such a way that I feel that regardless of who I played with, I know that character has potential.

Now, I started playing PM later in October last year, so I started with 2.6b. I immediately gravitated towards Ivy, not because of tier lists, which didn't exist, or because of Smashboards, which I do not frequent, nor because of this sub. It was pure sheer innocence, wanting to experience an overhauled new character, being able to wield Ivy without the shackles of the stupid stamina system and by sheer luck I loved her!

Now everyone know she got super nerfed in the 2.6b to 3.0 transition, but I still stuck to her! I still played and I still had fun and I still enjoyed PM and I loved seeing Melee pros play PM and everything seemed fine!

Thens tarted the complaints. Little by little, Toph, Mango, Scar... they all started giving little negative bits of unfounded opinion about the game. I could care less, because they are Melee players, not PM players, but their comments did cause a shift in how the Smash community perceived us!

And then came Mew2King with his rants some weeks ago! Followed by Hundgyrbox dissing on PM even harder! I could not believe it!

For one moment, though, I thought I had to get Melee. Melee is the answer, if I play Melee I will be able to stop all of this stupid discussion in my head.

So I started playing Falcon. Falcon is not the top of the list but is not called a stupid easy character by any means. So I picked him in PM and started grinding. SD after SD after SD, I learned Falcon and loved it.

But the comments were still there ""Melee will always be better than PM""...

So I went out of my way and dished 80 bucks because I'm stupid and got a Wii to play Melee. And after 3 months of internship doing nothing but engineering and Falcon, I found out that I don't like Melee (as much) anymore.

Don't get me wrong, I love watching it, and I am super hyped about all the tournies that are coming, but I think PM is THE game for me. I feel Melee has a lot of unreasonably high skill hurdles to defeat and PM opens hundreds of matchups all more entertaining to watch than the last. It's skill requirement also allows for more people to be good and have fun at a high level without being dumbed down! It's perfect, it's a win win! Why would you want to overcomplicate your game for the sake of making it harder?

In PM, I can easily short hop. I can easily l-cancel and know when I succeeded. I can even wavedash better!

Now, there will be an argument that if I play Melee long enough I will get used to it.

But I don't need to. I found my game. PM is only inferior to Melee because we allow the Melee pros to tell us that. PM is a game that is just as great, if not even better than Melee.

I just wanted to share this with you guys. Sorry if I am being a drag.

And again, thanks to the PMBR for such a wonderful game. Keep doing what you're doing, because it's the best."

**Background**: When I was young, I wanted to be a scientist. I was always interested in how the world worked and, as I grew up, I became more and more interested in genetics. Going in to college, I knew that I wanted to get a PhD so that I could lead research. However, in my senior year I began to question my career choice. I met a lot of grad students that were miserable and worried if they were going to get a job. This was the first real time I thought about the job market for biomedical research. I didn't know how to handle it, so I just marched ahead. I accomplished my goal of getting into a PhD program right after undergrad and went off to start grad school last summer. I was excited at first, but reality hit me. Hard. The lab work got old very fast and I felt little interest in continuing. It would take me an average of 5 more years to get through...with a crappy job market waiting for me. So I decided to walk away.

Now I have pretty useless degree and not much in terms of earning potential. Over the past few months, I had a job that didn't require an education and I became depressed. I know I need to continue my education if I want to have a career. Computers have been an interest of mine for a long time and I'm good at problem solving/analytical thinking, so I looked into a computer science degree at a state school near me. Luckily, my friend's dad is a professor in the program and has been a big help to me. He has allowed me to take the introductory course through self study with him and I have been liking it a lot. The programming comes easy to me and I enjoy the challenges. I am starting classes next week and will be taking the prerequisites for the master's program. I can potentially complete the master's in 3 years, which will hopefully give me time to develop the skills needed for a job and allow me to do some internships. 

The big problem I have is fear. I fucking hate it. I'm afraid everyday that this is a stupid idea. That I will be stuck again with more time wasted. I feel like shit for not doing something more practical the first time I went to college. Now I'll be 26/27 when I get a job (if I even get one). There are people my age now working in the field making money while I'm still in school growing older. I feel paranoid that every decision I make is going to set me back farther in life. I need to move forward, but I'm my own worst enemy. I don't know how to get out of my way. "

2ez72q,1,2014-08-29,Will this relationship ever work.,paigeswanson,BreakUp,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUp/comments/2ez72q/will_this_relationship_ever_work/,"Background story: My boyfriend and I have been dating for around two years. Whenever I first met him he was on probation for a POM, but whenever I met him I didn't think anything of it. All I saw was the fact that he was my soulmate. I was instantly comfortable around him and I felt like we understood parts of one another no one else could. We had a really good relationship and I thought I was going to marry him. 

One of our problems though was whenever I took an internship in Dallas two summers ago he got a DWI. This put an extreme damper on our relationship. For starters, it made me lose all trust in him. I started acting controlling and didn't believe he was growing in the right direction. After my internship in Dallas, I began to get very, very serious about school and my professional career. We had a good 8 months of our relationship. One thing that was a problem was he never stopped smoking weed on probation. I didn't mind it at first because he would smoke whenever he got off probation for a couple days. Then near the end of it, he started smoking for over a week. He also did other illegal drugs a lot too- like shrooms and acid. I've done shrooms with him... I just cared so much because they were illegal and I didn't want him going to jail. 

Over this summer, I got another internship in Dallas, and I asked him to slow down. The day I asked him to slow down, I called him after work and he told me he was doing shrooms with his best friend and brother. I let it go. I wanted to start a life and marry this man. I just didn't feel like he took me seriously. It wasn't until he did shrooms a couple more times and smoked 6 days before his probation that I felt completely numb. 

I then met someone at work. He was responsible and really, really smart. We started a friendship. However, after my boyfriend continually disrespected my boundaries I started to have feelings for my coworker. So much so, that I kissed him one night whenever we were together. Out of guilt I immediately broke up with my boyfriend and started to continue a friendship with my coworker. 

As soon as I moved back from Dallas, I wanted to see if I could work on things with my boyfriend. He still won't quit smoking and I don't know what to do. I wasn't very nice to him and became very abusive. However, I truly believe he is my soulmate and if he wasn't on probation I wouldn't care so much that he used marijuana or did other kind of herbal drugs. 

I love this person more than anything else in the world. I made a mistake and he knows all about it. I want him back. Do you think there is anyway we can come back from this. He is not just my partner or my best friend. He is my person. My other half. 

I'd do anything for him and sacrifice anything to be with him. "

Gnothi Seauton By Author

I had the problem of wanting to be many things growing up. I just couldn’t decide. I always had priorities, even as a child, so my decisions were largely influenced by those I loved most. My parents never went to college and my grandparents weren’t around for much guidance. But I always knew that emergencies, death and medicine were topics that I feared. I knew that I wanted to overcome the dissociation and instead embrace them for the sake of self-reliance and to be ready to help others. No other degree meets my definition of nobility, care or honor as what I’ve decided in becoming a nurse. After much soul searching, pursuing a nursing degree meets my needs for hard work and personal drive. The following sections describe specific personal reasons as to why I want to pursue a career in the medical field, for what reasons, and some future plans. By no means is this essay a definite expansion on my journey for higher education, but rather the description of the open door I’m trying to pass though, leading to what I define as success. Truly, no other career would fulfill my constant curiosity in learning from a subject as humane as the one associated to the field of medical science.

Support

My parents always argued in emergencies, especially when it concerned my sisters and I. This was because either one didn’t have a plan at the time or one misheard the other due to lack of focus. The scenes were nonsensical. But I knew the greatest reason for their actions was they dreaded being helpless. My insecurity with their way of handling “accidents” came into question, early on, even though I always looked up to them for answers. I’ve understood that my parents will encounter some life, health-oriented, devastation someday. Taking part as a nurse would give me confidence in being ready to assist others in times of large stress, including those I love most in life. Based on my research of specific characteristics found nurses, along with the common stressors of the job, my state of mind is well suited for the field. My parents have always exemplified the golden rule, in every aspect of my life, including what the purposes of my studies are for. Continuing my education in a field where I assist others current health state gives me a privilege to be apart of.

Plans

With my own real world life circumstances, my goals for the medical field are specific, expansive and ambitious. Starting with my long-term goals, I’m plan to intern in other countries outside the U.S. I’ve been thinking those located in the Middle East and Asia. I’ve considered in applying for the Peace Corps by becoming a volunteer. I’d plan to apply within 5-6 years from now. I feel this would provide my focus on the important factors that countries share in the field of medicine. I would get a grander perspective on the point of medicine. Learning Arabic and Japanese would also be beneficial. Currently I’m studying Arabic (MSA), progressing quite quickly. I’ve studied beginner’s Japanese during high school. As my short-term goals, they revolve on attaining my degree. By pursuing a Baccalaureate in Nursing I feel I can attain it within three years time. I plan to attend University of California, Irvine in Fall of 2015. Once admitted, I’ll plan for a 3.8-4.0 GPA. As packed and difficult these goals may seem, I feel the challenge would be my motivation towards completing the tasks. I feel that the larger the ambition, the more growth I’m allowing for my person. I should comment that “restricted” is a word seldom used in my vocabulary. This also applies to my persistence in educational goals. My perspective on achieving them stands as my guide to why I chose this field to devote my life to.

Inspiration

I’ve always believed that the destination is not as important as the journey. I’ll explain what I mean. You’ve reached an elevation of 4,000 feet, 2 hours into your 6-mile hike, wanting to reach another 4,000 in altitude before calling it good. You’ve experienced too much to stop. At that point a convenient overcast blows through your path and it flows around you in waves, sprinkling you with mist while blending with your sweat. Getting closer to the peak, the clouds are clearly visible in opaque sheets, causing the temperature to drop, moistening the air with the scent of moss and pinecone sap. As you pull through the last step of your journey, you look down. There’s an open plain with hills tumbling one on top of another, rooted with trees in tandem surrounding the trail from which you came. The sun rays peak through the overcast, leaving you breathing, motionless and to your thoughts on what it meant to have gotten this far. Now, remind yourself what feelings you felt right as you made that last step. Imagine being able to apply your intrinsic reaction of success to every second of your life with the serenity of knowing that you enjoy what you do while you do it, as time, seemingly transparent, ticks on. I could have focused on the three blisters formed on my toes, the wetness of my clothes, the aches felt on my joints &amp; knees, or the heaviness of my shoulders, but I moved on knowing that would have been a waste of my time. My focus was on finishing what had serendipitously occurred, and I found the outcome much more rewarding. When I look forward to such experiences/opportunities, the outcome leads to receiving knowledge, growth and dependability. This perception to life’s challenges and achievements is my motto in motivation.

Courses

University of California is quite competitive. They demand for specific prerequisites to be accomplished prior to applying, along with a good amount of community service and exceptional essay of intent. This 2014/2015 year I have planned out for twelve classes, all which will meet eligibility requirements to UCI. They range from Organic Chemistry, Microbiology, to Genetics. As devastated as I would be in not being admitted, I would be more upset and me not making the best grades I’ve ever had in my 18 years of education. I feel that regardless of admittance or not, the knowledge I would receive would be more than enough for future reference. Along with the current workload ahead of me, I’d be practicing my strengths as well as devoting some time to pinpoint my weaknesses in learning. Naturally, by saying, “I did my best”, would I accept success. Knowing myself, that’s a tall order.

Life’s reciprocity is managed by what parts any person continuously provides, conditions and maintains during their lifetime. The golden rule provides a wholesome solution to such efforts. After all, its point is simple. The idea of what you put in life is what you’ll get out of it. This is my staple asset to my character. Don’t misinterpret my ambitions to be false idealism, metaphysics, or some new age exercise. Considering the components I’ve expressed conjuring my purpose of this essay, its still up to me to see that I focus on the future, no matter the barriers I must deconstruct. I’d like to plan to visit Mt. Fuji someday, take part in a triathlon, and adopt two kids. But as all stages in my life, I feel most at ease by prioritizing and taking it one step at a time. Sometimes my best chances in life are left best with knowing that no matter what, I’m going to succeed instead of just forgetting, disbelieving and becoming disloyal in life’s journey. I asked a much older friend the other day on any advice he could give me to life. He responded, “Most people tend to give up because it's the easy way out.” You could say that by hearing that, it was the proper diagnosis to my troubles.

I'm in a pretty good place in life right now. College is paid for, I always make the dean's list, I have a job (more than one even), I still have living grandparents, my relationship with my siblings keeps improving as we get older, and I have a decent feel for where I'm going in the next ten years. Except for one thing...

I have this SO, and they're pretty great, really they are. We met when I was 16 and they were 17, we were both in relationships at the time and moved on with life. We reconnected almost a year later, hit it off, and a few months after started dating (so we were 17 and 18). We graduated high school, went our separate ways to college, and stayed together. The first weeks of freshman year were hard. I didn't know what I wanted. I saw all these other attractive people, I was flirted with (and I flirted a bit) and this whole time I was honest with my SO and they were with me. We struggled, we almost ended, but stuck it out. We saw each other most weekends and the rest of the year was reasonably smooth. Summer together at home was amazing. I even left for a month to fly across the world, and still we stuck it out, through tears, jet lag  delayed flights home, and time differences. 

So here we are, still reasonably young, still together, and still struggling sometimes. School began again in it's seemingly endless cycle, and just like that first fall in college, I'm struggling. I've been asked out, flirted with, and I'm surrounded by attractive people my own age, and I feel so guilty, so awful, and so ungrateful for looking at them, wondering what it would be like to be with them. I make no secret of my SO, and I make no secrets  to my SO about what's happening. But I came home yesterday and lost it. The guilt tore me down, I laid in the floor and sulked while my SO stood by not understanding my seemingly unprovoked downward spiral. I explained my thoughts, my feelings, my guilt for looking at others and got nothing but understanding. Torturous, painful, sympathy and understanding. I couldn't stand it. I don't deserve that, I was disloyal in my mind. I looked at others. I wanted others to want me. I thought about others and still was looked upon as worthy of this love and it's killing me. 

My SO told me that I'm normal, that they see others as attractive too. That sometimes you think of others, dream of others, and can't help it. But Noe I'm wondering... am I holding on to an old relationship when I actually desire something else? Am I just clinging to security?

But we've been through so much. Two family deaths, surgery, graduations, new beginnings, family weddings, family crises and fights, car crashes, new cars, new jobs and job resignations, internships, vacations, exams, illnesses both shared and separate, money problems, weight gain and loss, hikes, family holidays, tears, yelling, raw feelings, future dreams, and past injuries returning to haunt us. I can't let all that go. I know we're young, and I know we're both loyal to a fault. I stayed in a bad relationship before out of loyalty and I know my SO has the same loyal vein pulsing through their body. I'm so afraid I'm hurting them or me, or holding one or both of us back. I love them. I don't want to let go, but I can't help but wonder why my eyes wander when my head, my heart, my dreams, and our future seem so set..."

Some helpful facts:


- we are both 24


- he lives in san francisco, i live in LA


- he is not from america, only doing internship for a year.


- im international student, got a year left to stay in the US.


- english isnt our first language


- we never met


I met this guy on an online dating website (i forgot which one, not okc) i think around end of july? We talked abit, he would reply once a day or every other day until i decided to close my account and we continue to talk in a chat app (didnt exchange number). From there on, it went well, we chat every night after he got off work. He told me he really want to visit Venice beach and meet me when he is in LA. He got plans to visit la with his intern friends, even before he knew me, which will be on september. After talking for 2-3 weeks, he said i should let him know when is my next free weekend so he can hop in the bus and come down to LA to meet and spend the weekend with me. At this point, i was feeling hopeful.. He would do that for me? I was astonished and happy.. I kinda like him, and i think he likes me too... Then i gave him my schedule and he said he will let me know the plan. A week later, he got back to me, he wont be coming on my free weekend coz he needs to save money, but on september, he surely wants to meet me.


I mean, It make sense, who would take the risk to travel and spend money to meet someone from an online dating site... Never know whats gonna happen right.....
Well, after he cancelled the weekend plan, we started to talk less.. I havent talk to him for 4 days now.. 


My question is:
Is there any point of continuing this? Should i just forget him and move on? Should i reach out and say hi? And considering the facts too?


**update:**


So I sent him a message and he neither replied nor read it... He usually reply within an hour. I guess thats it...."
2f13en,1,2014-08-30,"Me [21 M] with my friend [21 F] of 2 years who has a boyfriend, I fell for her, she broke up with her boyfriend, and now things are complicated.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2f13en/me_21_m_with_my_friend_21_f_of_2_years_who_has_a/,"Hi Redditors,

I apologize in advance for the long spew. I'm getting a lot off my chest so please bear with me. Also, throw away account.


I met this girl at the beginning of university, lets call her Jane. She and I were a part of the same circle of close-knit friends (approx. 15 good looking people) and during this time, Jane was in a relationship with a guy named John for the last 4 years and they both live together. I was single and was not interested in this girl at all because (1) she had a boyfriend so therefore she was off-limits, (2) we didn’t have any common grounds and our personalities appeared to be somewhat different, and (3) I wasn’t looking for anyone as I had just gotten out of a short relationship.


2 years went by and everything went smoothly as it could be. It’s also worth mentioning that our group of friends (including myself and Jane) had the same standardized class schedules, so that means we –as a group- would go to class together on a daily basis. My interaction with Jane throughout the school year was nonexistent and I rarely saw her at our group hangouts.


The next year was different, however. Just when summer was approaching, Jane and I began to talk to one another more frequently and our friendship eventually developed.  It started when both of us were heading back to our respective homes after a night of partying with the usual friends (mind you, it was a rare occurrence for Jane to join us for our hangouts).  It turned out that Jane was having some issues back home with some friends. She and John moved to my city from a different state for school. 


As we got to know each more, I found out that Jane was essentially having some long-distant friendship issues back home and on top of that, she found out that John was accepted for a prestigious summer internship and therefore, would be away for the whole summer in a different country. Also, she had gotten a summer job in the city as did I.  Overall, she was worried and alone. Being a sucker for people who are distressed, I decided that one of my summer goals was to try and get Jane to be more involved with our group hangouts by personally asking her to join us. It worked very well and our hangouts were made better by her presence. 


The more we hung out, the closer we get. To the point where we would text one another on a daily basis. Being her friend, I wanted to make my intentions clear between the two of us without making things too complicated. At the right time, I told her that what she and John had was good, and that if there ever comes a time when our friendship (aka texting) was jeopardizing her relationship with John, I asked that she tell me so we can sort it out. 


Things began to develop further during the incoming school year. When John had returned back, their relationship re-kindled and went back to its usual state. To which I was very glad. I had expected our conversations to stop but it continued on and we grew even closer. She even contemplated on the idea of us going on a trip together and even introducing me to her family back home. We got pretty intimate with another to the point where we each had nicknames. She started the nicknames. At around this time, I started to become more attracted to her, but I knew that nothing good would come out it if I pursued it, but at the same time, I couldn’t help but enjoy this feeling of attention and intimacy, so I kept it to myself and continued to support her (I had no expectations of us getting together or anything, I assumed I had been friend-zoned but I was cool with it). As the school year progressed, Jane began to tell me how her relationship with John was going through some issues. She felt that she had changed as a person and didn’t feel the spark anymore with the relationship. Being her friend, I told her that maybe they could work the kinks out. Either way, it was quite obvious that Jane wanted to end the relationship, she just didn’t know when and it was eating her away. 


The next summer, Jane and John went back home for a summer job, while I was offered a summer internship at another city. At this point, Jane had already told John that she was having difficulties with their relationship. She had asked that they take a short break but John wasn’t open to that option. As school was about to end, Jane asked if she could visit me, seeing as how she had always wanted to travel around and couldn’t do so ever since school started (summer jobs every year). Of course, I was delighted and sure enough, she bought plane tickets. I was excited and so was she. It at this point where I had actually thought the maybe Jane had feelings for me. Because why would anyone go through the lengths and money in visiting someone unless they liked them. 


All was well during the first months of summer, I was busy with work and was getting used to my new environment. As a result, I didn’t talk much with Jane. I imagined she was busy with her friends back home and also with John. Deep down, I was also relieved that we were apart, because I figure that with me out of the picture, perhaps she could focus all her time with John and her relationship. 


Two days before her flight, I received a text from Jane saying that she had broken up with John. I was devastated but relieved that she had taken the necessary steps. I gave her my condolences and told her everything was going to be alright. Now that she was now single, she had the freedom to do the things she had always wanted to do (ex: work in Hawaii for the summer, take scuba lessons, etc). I offered to talk to her about her breakup, but she turned me down, saying that she already had someone to confide with (a male coworker who had also recently broken up, we’ll call him Luke). 


We had a great time when Jane visited me. We went to multiple tourist attractions and explore various foods and sceneries. I took her for a fancy dinner and we had some quality time together. She told me that this short vacation was one of the best vacations she has had for a while. When Jane returned back home however, she stopped texting frequently and told me that she going to be distant due to the fact that John was harassing her via text. I understood the situation and was fine with it. However, whenever we would text again, she would tell me how she and Luke were spending time together and that she may have developed a crush for him. After talking to her on phone, she got the hint that I was jealous and she even teased me about it. I confessed that I was and that I was worried I was loosing her. She responded by saying that I meant more to her than Luke did. I felt that was true given the fact that she had previously cried to me on the phone a few months back after realizing that we were growing distant. 


Weeks past, and when we spoke again, I found out that she had slept over at his place after watching a movie until 4am. At this point, I’m heartbroken and felt betrayed. Here was a girl who used to skype and text with me on a constant basis, now hanging out with someone else and ignoring my text (it usually took 3-12 hrs for her to respond back). I started to text her less and grew distant. Eventually after hearing about how close she was getting with Luke, I called her and confessed my feelings for her. To which she said she didn’t know that I was interested in her and that after I had asked her about her relationship with Luke, she wasn’t sure how things will play out with him and that there “are not titles between us”. All she knew was that he made her happy and given the current circumstances with her recent breakup, she didn’t want to deal with anything else. The thing that got me so worked up was that she never said that she wasn’t interested in me. 


Needless to say, I didn’t want to deal with this complication so I decided that I would try and put her out of my mind. It worked out, I became happy again and made some new friends at my workplace. From time to time, Jane and I would have a brief text conversation about our day and she got the gist that I was happy and seemed to have moved on after my confession to her. But deep down, I do still miss our intimacy. 


So here’s the conundrum, we’re returning back to school and I find out that Luke had decided to travel back with Jane to accompany her before classes begin. I believe they’re staying together at a family friend’s place and Luke will return back home once class begins. Its quite clear to me that they both like each other but I’m not sure what their relationship is exactly. Is he a rebound? Or will it turn into a LDR?


I don’t know if I should just avoid getting close to Jane again. She had texted me saying she missed me and was glad to see my again. We still have a year left of school together. I know I have no one to blame but myself for not taking the first steps in distancing myself from Jane when I started to have feelings for her. I’m torned redditors, part of me wants to move on and say “f*ck this, I’m just her emotional pillow”, while the other part of me wants to understand her situation. She just got out of a long-term relationship, needed someone to fill the void, and Luke was available. On top of that, your close friend decides to confess his feelings to you. You shut everyone out so you can focus on being happy for the summer. At the end of the day, I want both of us to be happy. 


If you're wondering how I justified in her liking me more as a friend:

1. She notices when girls check me out and tells me about it (im a decent looking guy, not brad pitt)
2. She was willing to spend $700 in flight tickets to visit me
2. She was willing to move some of course schedule to be project partners
3. We've talked about going on vacation together (two of us) and her introducing me to her family


So here are my questions o great redditors:

1.	Should I attempt to rekindle our relationship? 
2.	Should I apologize for being distant and jeopardizing our friendship?
3.	Are my concerns justifiable or am I being an overly sensitive 21 year old? And should just grow up 


Thanks for your time and I appreciate any advice

---
  
I love my boyfriend. We haven't been together for an extremely long time, but we moved in together in June and I'm so happy in this relationship. We have our ups and downs like everyone else, but overall he's perfect to me and I want to spend my life with him.  

I just got a new job this month, and my new schedule means I don't get to see my boyfriend as much as I'm used to. We see eachother for maybe 3 nights a week (even though we live together), and the rest of the time one of us is either at work or sleeping. It's been really hard for me to adjust to, since I'm rather introverted and have few friends/don't go out much.  

My coworker has been shooting me glances from across the room since the day I started, and I've found myself catching his eye more than once. I really worried that I was sending signals I didn't want to, but he's an intern, so I thought I wouldn't have to worry about it for long.  

The company threw a back to school party for our interns, that I wouldn't have gone to except I've already missed one work function and I don't want to be seen as that bitch who never goes to anything. Lo and behold I end up talking to this intern (mostly in groups, but once or twice it was one-on-one) for most of the night. Work paid for drinks, so we were all a little more honest that we would have been. He's hilarious, hyper-intelligent, and we share a whole whackton of interests... which is exactly what I was worried about.  

The end of the night hit, and we ended up walking home in the same general direction. He confessed to me that he has had feelings for me since the day I started. He said that he knew I had a boyfriend so he wasn't going to do anything about it, but he couldn't stand the tension anymore. Drunk-me was super happy with herself (I don't have the best self-esteem, but once in a while it's nice to feel wanted), and admitted that if the timing had been different, if I didn't have a boyfriend... We hugged, said goodbye, and that was it.

The problem now is that I keep catching myself thinking about him, and I don't want to. He's gone back to school now, so at least I don't have to deal with the constant reminder, but all likelihood points to him coming back to work for the company in 8 months and that scares me, far away as it may be.  

I *love* my boyfriend more than anything, but this small part of me keeps wishing I could split myself in half to be with the intern. What do I do, reddit? How do I stop myself from ruining the best relationship that's ever happened to me?"

3. She was willing to move some of course schedule to be project partners
4. We've talked about going on vacation together (two of us) and her introducing me to her family

So here are my questions o great redditors:

1. Should I attempt to rekindle our relationship?
2. Should I apologize for being distant and jeopardizing our friendship?
3. Are my concerns justifiable or am I being an overly sensitive 21 year old? And should just grow up

Thanks for your time and I appreciate any advice

I'm 18 and recently graduated high school in the top quarter of my class, I'm doing college full time and work an internship at a place where laws are enforced. I started smoking senior year too.

Recently after having a little smoke in my car (actually mine, it's registered in my name) with a friend, I came home and my mom said I smelled like cigarettes (we smoked maybe 3 hours ago and the windows were down) and she wouldn't take no for an answer, she's set on me smoking cigarettes. I said ""Sure, I smoked a black and mild once"". Suddenly I was labelled the addict in the house. I sometimes buy backwoods if I feel like having some tobacco, maybe 2 a month. Not habitual at all.

My moms an alcoholic, there have been times where I've ran from her in fear of my own well being as a child. Recently I just ignore her when shes belligerent. My dad smokes weed. Doesn't even hide it. He'll start rolling J's in the living room, doesn't air out the house ever either. I'm not in an area where any weed is legal. Basically, my mom knows what weed is and smells like. Why she said it was cigarettes is beyond me.

Anyways, I guess she wanted to rummage through (I mean, clean, she was only being a good mom /s) and found some blunt wrappers, a few baggies that had practically nothing in them, and a backwoods. I completely forgot about this joke of a bong I wanted to make. I never even used it, its just embarrassing. She found that too. I went to my car, only for it to be completely turned upside down. There was nothing in there either, just some more backwoods wrappers.

She said we were all going to talk later, I mean honestly I don't know what to expect. My mom is an alcoholic and has something like a Nancy Grace/I don't know attitude and shes extremely stubborn. My dad's a laid back stoner who is almost always rolling Js in the living room, and basically started around my age as well, and he's a manager of a small business. I can respect them having me do it in moderation and not in their house, that's understandable. Getting rid of it completely is not an option. It helps me have an appetite and lets me relax.

Just needed to get that out there and have as much damage control as possible. I have a few links possible as to why its not a terrible drug and all that, I'm just annoyed and she's going to end up doing something completely unnecessary."

My self esteem can't handle it. I'm 28f and the guys I have dated are in their early 30s. 

Guys I date are ashamed of me. I have come to this conclusion after the 3rd guy in a row refused to allow me to tag him on Facebook. Here is a rundown of my experiences (in a row) and over the course of 3 years: 

A - We were bffs for 4 years, the last 2 years feelings developed but he told me he wasn't looking for a gf at the time. I stupidly ignored that and hooked up with him anyway. We would go on dates (dinner, movie, etc.) and when I posted something on his fb, he would delete it. After 4 months of hooking up, and him not wanting to commit...I stopped seeing him and he immediately got into a relationship with his best friend's ex. 

I - Also told me he wasn't looking for a relationship and would not allow me to tag him in a post of us going to the movies. I straight up asked him if he was ashamed of me, which he denied stating that he was a private person. So, I believed it. 2 months later, he got into a relationship with his intern. Yes, while we were still seeing each other casually. 

C - We were coworkers and he too, told me he wasn't looking for a relationship and did not add coworkers on fb. I stupidly believed it and did not push the issue. He also said was not looking for a relationship, but refused to take me out publicly stating that he was always broke, that he was a homebody (accusing me of calling him boring when I asked why we couldn't go out sometimes). He also stated he wasn't using me and that if he was looking for a gf, it would have been me. He also stated that he wasn't a social media enthusiast and that his last relationship was 5 years ago. So I gave him the benefit of the doubt and let that go too. 

Turns out, he posts on fb all the time. His last gf was 3 months before we dated, a coworker of ours, and she was on there posting all sorts of flirty comments and talking to his mom. He also got a job across the country and before he left stated that ""Well, tankadin...its not like we ever went on *dates* or anything..."" I thought we didn't go on dates because I thought he was broke and a homebody (like he told me)! He also hit my car and refused to pay for the damages (~$400) I'm still reeling from the pain of being used and every time i see my car, its a reminder of how stupid I was. It's been 9 months.

r/dating, I know that I'm picking out the emotionally unavailable men. Or men that aren't into me, despite me asking if they are, and them telling me that I'm everything they'd want in a gf and give me a string of excuses. 

I want to learn how to STOP believing lies, being naive (I started dating when I was 21 so maybe I got a late start). I also don't want to take these experiences personally, but I can't help it. I'm a successful, beautiful (or so I thought), person. But it's shit like this that makes me think otherwise. I don't want to be that girl that doubts every single thing a guy tells me (I gave these people the benefit of the doubt and they ended up all lies). 

I have also tried everything from therapy (over 10 sessions), hitting the gym 3x a week, working my ass off (I got a promotion recently) and going back to school to get my MS. Nothing is working. 

**TL;DR** Bad dating experiences leading me to believe I'm not worthy of a real relationship. Interests keep lying to me, want to learn how to stop this pattern. "
2f1y0k,7,2014-08-30,I tried 300mg worth of gel caps last night. (Lengthy trip report),TriedRobitussin,dxm,https://www.reddit.com/r/dxm/comments/2f1y0k/i_tried_300mg_worth_of_gel_caps_last_night/,"I took 2x my normal adderall dose this morning (legal script for ADHD) to help me fully wake up after my trip last night. I like writing really long posts to begin with, and 40mg of adderall in my system makes me write even more than usual. So I ended up writing a very detailed wall of text about my trip, mostly so I can reflect on it later, but feel free to read it if you are interested and have the time!

**TL;DR:**

Skip the TL;DR if you plan on reading the trip report. 

I took 300mg DXM last night in gelcap form. I also had some weed while I waited for it to kick in. During the come-up I felt really happy and more stoned than usual. This turned into more of a drunk feeling as the DXM started to overpower the weed. My body felt good and I could really feel the movement of my muscles. I started off by listening to Snoop Dogg's music but didn't like the violence of it so I listened to Lorde's Pure Heroine and Kanye's 808's and Heartbreaks which both sounded so incredibly beautiful. I felt a little bit of nausea but didn't puke. The nausea led me to my bathroom toilet. I stared at the toilet hole for quite a long time, going in and out of reality/awareness. After a while I laid down and turned off the lights so I could focus on music. I put on a random DXM playlist I found on spotify and it didn't sound like real music at all, just random sounds, even though I later listened to it sober and it sounded very normal. It felt like I was going in and out of a dream state with mild closed eye visuals for the peak of the trip. I'd say at this peak I was mid/high 2nd plateau. I dosed too late and ended up too tired to continue after the peak. I went to sleep, skipping the come-down. I woke up a bit tired but with no real hangover symptoms. I don't have any addictive feelings of *needing* to try it again. But I think I will try it again, upping the dose to 600mg, to see if I can hit the 3rd plateau. Overall I'd rate this first trip **7.5/10**.

**Trip Report:**

This was my first time trying DXM. For some background, I'm 19 years old, have a full time engineering internship through fall semester, and will be returning to my university in January to start my Junior year. I've always been very introverted and spend a lot of time on self reflection. I'm very open to trying new drugs and am interested in exploring my own thoughts and memories. DXM isn't really one of the 'cool' drugs to be taking right now, but some people say it helps you look into your own mind which is exactly what I was looking for. Based on that, the relative safeness of a single trip, and how easy it is to buy, I decided to go to Walmart and get a bottle.

I took 20 (15mg) gelcaps all at once at around 8:45. I also took 2 (25mg) benadryl to stop any potential itching. I was alone in my one bedroom apartment. After about 15 minutes I decided to get a little stoned as well with my MFLB vape. I had one regular sized trench (probably around .15g) which is my usual daily amount to help with some sleeping issues I have. I'm not sure if it was placebo, but I felt more stoned than I usually did. It was very much a head high and my body felt relatively 'sober'. 

During my come-up I felt exceptionally happy. My life is in a good place right now, more so than it ever has been, and I think my come-up reflected that. My music was sounding good (though not quite as good as it sounds when I'm baked as fuck), my body felt lightweight and free, and there was an overall euphoric feeling.

An hour after dosing I moved my head around and walked around my apartment a bit. I don't drink alcohol very often, but when I do that's how I gauge how drunk I am. Moving my head from side to side felt fan-fucking-tastic. The movement was silky smooth and I could really feel every single muscle working in perfect unison to move my head. It felt ever so slightly like my head was moving in slow motion, though I don't know if I felt any real change in my perception of time. Walking around was more difficult than usually and was similar to walking at the tail end of a night of moderate drinking. I was slow moving, but sober enough to not knock shit over or fall down. My arms felt locked in mid air. Kind of like [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqhkdHlCHLk#t=22). They really did not want to move or fall back down to my sides.

I sat back down and my head and neck felt warm. I think I remember reading something about heat surges through your body when on DXM, but there weren't any other heat surges through the night and I could've just been lightheaded. I put on Snoop Dogg's ""Doggystyle"" to vibe a little bit. I don't think that album is very good for a DXM trip. I couldn't vibe to it and eventually [Serial Killa](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSWOLKxZkPY) came on. The lyrics of the hook are ""Suicide, it's a suicide
(Repeat x3)/
Now tell me, what's my motherfuckin name?/
Serial killa! Serial killa! Serial killa!"" I didn't freak out too bad but those lyrics made me incredibly uncomfortable and vulnerable. I switched to Lorde's ""Pure Heroine"" which is a much more chill album. I love that album to begin with, but the DXM was making it so much better. Her voice sounded nothing short of perfect. 

While listening to my music I was also on reddit. I remember that my laptop keyboard felt rubbery. Reading became basically impossible. I couldn't focus on individual words and had to concentrate really hard to pick out words from a piece of text that I was looking at. I even tried to copy some text into an online text to speech program, but I wasn't really comprehending anything at that point and decided to get off the internet to focus more on my music. 

My browser history says I got off the internet at about 10:30, 1 hour and 45 minutes after I dosed. I didn't think I was feeling the full effects at this point but I was pretty sure I was less stoned and closer to tripping. Up until this point I had only had very light nausea. I walked 10 feet to my bedroom and felt the nausea really kick in and my mouth had that pre-vomit salivation thing going on. I staggered to the toilet, dry heaved twice, and suddenly the nausea was completely gone. I was really happy about that. I was fully expecting to have to vomit, so not having to do so was a nice little surprise. While waiting to see if the nausea would come back I remember staring into the toilet. The water had very slight ripples going through it and they were static-rainbow colored. The ripples were mesmerizing. My sight drifted to the hole of the toilet bowl and I ended up staring into it for god know's how long. I think I was slipping in and out of reality. I honestly can't remember what I saw when I was looking into the hole, but it must've been nice. When I snapped out a visual I would think to myself, ""I'm on drugs and staring into a toilet that hasn't been cleaned in a week"", but that didn't stop me from going right back to staring into the hole. Eventually I pulled myself away from the toilet. I never did throw up.

I decided to stick close to my bathroom, just in case. I finished listening to Pure Heroine and put on Kanye West's ""808's and Heartbreaks"". The music was sounding so good. I got a pillow, turned off the lights, curled up on the floor, and I let the music take me away. I have no clue what time it was at this point but it was probably 2 and a half to 3 hours after I dosed. My body felt tired but my mind felt very awake. I was able to actively listen to the music and at the same time my mind was wandering. I'd say my mind was much closer to dreaming than hallucinating. My memory of this is fuzzy, but I think the dreams were coming and going very quickly. Something would play in my head, I'd snap back to reality, and within seconds my mind would be back to wandering. Unfortunately I can't remember what any of the dreams or visuals were.

Once 808's finished I was probably peaking. I typed ""DXM"" into spotify, picked the first playlist that popped up, and put it on. The music was really really strange sounding. It was choppy sounding and sounded like someone testing percussion instruments, striking a woodblock, hitting a triangle, banging a drum, etc. It didn't sound like any music I had ever heard but I brushed it off thinking it was just some weird genre made for tripping. It sounded nice either way. Once sober, I went back to the playlist and the first song in the playlist, the one I would've made the judgement on, was [Beach House - Myth](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuvWc3ToDHg). The song sounds like normal music now that I'm sober, so I figure I must've been really out of it at that point. I kept coming in and out of that dreamy state that I mentioned earlier and I was gradually getting more and more tired.

After some unknown period of time I called it a night and made it to my bed to go to sleep. I woke up around 10AM and was sober. I did feel exceptionally tired though and ended up sleeping until 11:30AM. It felt like I had about 1/10th of a hangover with hardly any nausea and just a bit of head spinning. I woke up happier than usual. That might've been a bit of an afterglow. I took some adderall in order to help myself wake up and an hour later I was completely back to normal.

How I feel waking up after a night of drugs varies quite heavily on which drug it is. This morning after feeling is a huge part of the experience for me and I like to categorize the feelings in three ways. The first is the ""I never want to do that ever again"" category. Alcohol is a good example for that category because of it's hangovers. I'm not a morning person, so any drug that makes the mornings worse I tend to stay away from. Any drug that has effects that I didn't like could also be included in that category, although I try not to swear myself off of a drug due to one bad trip. The next category would be the ""I'd do it again"" category. Weed is the best example for this category. If it makes me feel good and doesn't have any bad side effects, it's in this category. The last category is the scariest. It's the ""I NEED TO TRY THAT DRUG AGAIN RIGHT NOW MY LIFE DEPENDS ON IT"" feeling. Some leftover Oxycontin from a surgery I had gave me that feeling once I ran out. I had a mild withdrawal and actually cried about not having any more. I was dangerously close to getting addicted and it's a damn good thing I didn't have the chance to get more. I'm not about to ruin my entire life over a drug, so I won't ever touch Oxy again and I will immediately stop any drug that gives me that feeling. DXM fits right into the ""I'd do it again"" category close to weed. I don't have cravings to go out and get more right away. Recreationally, I'll stick to weed. It can give you similar effects to the 1st and 2nd plateau without making you feel like a brain dead zombie and there's no real long term mental or physical side effects to worry about. I don't think the same could be said about DXM. 

I do want to try DXM again though. I was satisfied with my trip but I also feel that there are some things that could've made it better. I need to take my dose earlier. Waking up at 7AM every day for work means that I can't stay up into the early hours of the morning anymore. I just can't push myself to stay awake for that long after a full work week. Dosing on a Saturday night at around 7PM should work better. That will allow ample time for the come-up and I won't be falling in and out of sleep during the peak. I need to think more carefully about my music selection. I shouldn't listen to violent music like Snoop's and I shouldn't be listening to completely unfamiliar music either, such as the spotify playlist. Radiohead's ""Kid A"" and Pink Floyd's ""Dark Side of the Moon"" would be good albums to try. At the time that I dosed it had been seven hours since my last meal. This, along with vaping some weed, may have contributed to the lack of nausea, so I'll make sure I do the same for my next trip. Either the benadryl worked or I just don't get ""the itch"", but either way I'll still take some while dosing as a good precaution because I hate being itchy. Another good idea would be cleaning my apartment before I trip. My apartment isn't terribly messy, some dishes were in the sink, I hadn't vacuumed in a while, and there was random junk around that could've been put away. The little messes around were unsettling. A cleaner environment could lead to a cleaner trip. 

300mg was a safe first dose and I'm glad I didn't go for more my first time. Better safe than sorry. But 300mg wasn't very psychedelic and I wasn't ever fully dissociated from my body. So I'm going to up my dosage next time to 600mg, hopefully reaching the 3rd plateau. Since I only got to the 2nd plateau I can't give any final thoughts on the drug. I just don't know it well enough yet. I'll write another trip report after the 600mg trip. Assuming all goes well I'll have a much better perspective of what this drug has to offer. Until then, thanks for reading and stay safe!"
2f22zj,47,2014-08-30,Are you threatening my life or hitting on me?,avaprolol,TalesFromThePharmacy,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromThePharmacy/comments/2f22zj/are_you_threatening_my_life_or_hitting_on_me/,"This just happened tonight to me. I've had a lot of creepy patients. I've been proposed to by a toothless guy with a Mickey Mouse watch and I've been asked out on a Valentine's Day date. You get lots of crazy people in our profession.

I am working with two other people in the outpatient pharmacy tonight and both of them are male. The other intern is relatively new and so every once in awhile I have to hop in and take over something for him (especially with patients). So, I get an escript for a medication and I start to fill it. I am looking for this person's insurance in our hospital system (we are set up differently than most pharmacies) and am having no luck. He has never filled here before either. So when my coworker goes up to the window to help a man who has just shown up I tell him that if it is Jacob^nothisname then I need his insurance card because it isn't on file.

My coworker relays that message and the guy starts looking around. Eventually, he realizes he doesn't have it and looks up and starts the ""you should have it on file"" argument. I hear this and step around the counter I'm working at to intervene. I tell him he has never filled here before so there is no way we could have it on file. When he sees me he just.. *looks* at me. In one of those serial killer, creep you down to the bone looks. It's like he's really just seeing me for the first time. So he smirks and says, ""How do you know I've never filled here before?"" in this.. weird.. challenging type voice that makes it seem like hes just asking to tease me. I tell him we have electronic records and we have no history of him. I then tell him he can pay about 20$ for his script tonight if he wants it. He agrees and I tell him it will be just a few more minutes. He then gives me this.. pouty face. Like, he majorly pouts. My coworker is still standing next to me going, ""wtf?"". This guy says nothing, he just makes this pouty face and looks at me. I try saying a few things explaining it won't take very long and he continues to not move and just makes this face. Eventually I walk away and finish his script. I am in line of sight from him and he hasn't moved away from the window. He is just watching me with this pouty face.

So, now I'm weirded out. So when I finish I decided to walk around the corner so he couldn't see me. The guy then walks over to the other window and tries to get an angle on me (which he does) and continues to make the face. I walked completely to the other part of the pharmacy where he couldn't see me at all and he finally sat down then (according to my coworker).

The pharmacist goes in now to check the script and asks if I want to counsel. I said that I actually didn't want to (I never say that) because the guy is creeping me out. So the pharmacist goes to do it himself. A minute or so in I walk back into the outpatient part to help with scripts again. As soon as the guy sees me, he completely starts ignoring the pharmacist. The pharmacist is sitting there talking to him and the guy isn't even looking or paying any attention. He is just staring at me. I finally look up and he starts making the [*I'm watching you* signal](http://gifsoup.com/view/3836473/i-m-watching-you.html) over and over again. Like fifteen times. The pharmacist is still trying to talk to him and this guy is completely ignoring him. So I break eye contact and look at my coworker intern like *wtfisgoingonhere*? He looks just as weirded out. I look back over again and the guy is still doing it. This time he also does the *you're dead* sign where he drags his finger across his neck like he was cutting it. 

That got me.

I finally spoke up and said, ""Are you threatening my life or hitting on me?"" The guy says nothing and just does it again. My coworker then tells me to gtfo the room and I gladly do. I guess when I left out of eyeshot the guy kept asking the pharmacist for my name and told him he wanted to keep an eye on me. The pharmacist refused (he unfortunately didn't do much to dissuade the guy either I guess), but the guy said he would find a way to keep an eye on me anyway.

We got a call about 10 minutes later from the front desk saying that the guy was trying to get my name from them. When they said they couldn't help, he asked what time the pharmacy closed (they said never because it's true), so then he asked where the employee parking lot was. They were dumb enough to tell him. Eventually they realized what that likely meant and called and told us.

Needless to say his name went on our watch list and I had an escort to my car :(

I still don't understand his intentions. Are you threatening to kill me or are you trying to hit on me? I can't imagine those tactics are very effective either way.

**tl;dr** Man has strange obsession with me while I am filling his script. Makes the I'm watching you sign many times and then ran his finger across his neck while pointing at me twice. Tried to get my name, work schedule, and where I parked. Was not completely successful."
2f29u4,1,2014-08-31,Unrequited? Just need some help.,BobQuickie,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2f29u4/unrequited_just_need_some_help/,"Alright so I made a throwaway account only because I need some opinions that don't include my friends. It's going to be a long post so I hope this post won't bore you guys but I'm just legitimately curious on what I should do. Also sorry because this is my first post on reddit. 

So lets rewind to 2013 spring. There's this girl who've I've been really good friends with for about 2 years now. We had a fallout for about 6 months only because I guess we started getting annoyed of each other. After that time was up though, I randomly heard from her and next thing we know it's like nothing happened. Slowly but surely I started to get this really big crush on her and I was always looking forward to her. One day, its just the two of us on my bed, just hanging out and she randomly asks me if she wants me to learn how to kiss. Now keep in mind, that I'm an 18 year old virgin who's only ever kissed one girl once. So I'm not very... experienced? So I obviously take on the offer and open a whole new part of my life basically. Fast forwarding a bit, things escalate to the point where I lose my virginity to her and at this point I am head over heels for her. She basically became just this very important person to me. One things that was irksome was the fact nothing ever... was set in stone? We were just friends and she obviously saw it as casual sex, but unfortunately for me I saw it as something else. 

Now let's fast forward a little bit more. We're still best friends, and the sex was getting bad, and in a sense she's getting bored. We both work at the same place and we're still very good friends til this day but she starts getting a crush on a fellow co-worker. Here comes a plethora of depression. I was a little bitch to put it quite simply, and so when she told me she had a crush on this guy, I told her to go for it. We were simply friends with no strings attached so I mean supporting her decisions just seem like a good idea (even though I wanted to tell her ""fuck nah."") So things obviously escalate between the two, and they start dating. I was just so salty and jealous and it sucked. I remember I felt like an intern at morton salt, when she told me she took his virginity away. Mannnnnn that feeling of playing cool and internally screaming was prominent. I was just told I was this very special person to her, and here she is, screwing some other dude. I know its my fault for never laying a full grid of mutual standpoints because, during all this. I didn't want to be that one fuckboy who asks ""so what are we?"" as much as I wanted too. It sucks because I wanted her to be mine, but she didn't want me to be hers type of thing. 

Fastforward 5 months. So the most frustrating part of all this. We still hangout ALOT. I mean yeah, we're still friends, but she has a boyfriend. Now before I sound like a jealous bitch let me explain. She only hangs out with her boyfriend when she wants to fuck. Nothing else. That fuckboy did no part outside from that. I was the piece of shit who would stay with her til 3am trying to find this piece of shit cat. I would take her to school, I would do so much for her. Simply because I was trying to be a good friend, nothing else. But it was just annoying because at social gatherings she would ask ME to take her, and as soon as I take her, her boyfriend is there. Why don't you just ask your boyfriend to take your bitchass to a party instead of me. Like why invite the dude and make me take you. I didn't want to be at some lame ass christmas gathering anyways. Sorry for going off tangent. Point is, he never really played a role other than boyfriend and fuck buddy. smh, and its pretty bad cause she cheated on him with me, so that also makes me a piece of shit. /end salt.

Present day, they have broken up and we're still good friends. It just makes me salty that I had to deal with that, but I'm asking you guys that is it healthy to still be bitter about that and remain good friends with her? I absolutely hate her but at the same time I would do anything for her. I try to put everything behind me and just go on with my life, but because I still see her on the daily, I just get these reminders that just simply ruin my day. What should I do guys? I don't want to victimize myself, nor do I want to victimize her ex boyfriend or her. I just want some clarity.

Oh and also to clarify, we haven't had any type of physical intimacy since the break up."
2f2hoh,10,2014-08-31,My Personal Story,lifesurfeit,shoppingaddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/shoppingaddiction/comments/2f2hoh/my_personal_story/,"Hello all! To those of you who have found this place, welcome. I created this subreddit so that I could have somewhere to document my own journey on overcoming my shopping addiction and possibly spread the word to others who are struggling with their addiction as well.

My addiction began in my sophomore year of college. I started out small, visiting Marshall's and TJ Maxx, trying on clothes for hours and only buying a few things that I liked. It was fun finally having financial and physical freedom from my very frugal mother. I remember my first big ticket purchase: a pair of red and white Ash sneaker wedges that I bought on eBay for $160. I still have and wear those shoes often and every time I love the way they make me feel and the endless compliments I get on them from strangers. 

Well, one pair of shoes wasn't enough, I remember a few months later buying a pair of Diesel high top sneakers in crazy colors. I bought them to use while breakdancing, my new-found love. I was buying them for a reasonable purpose, I justified to myself. And so the purchases continued. Sophomore year was the first time I had a part time job that paid quite well ($3000 of extra pocket change over the course of a year), and I spent every last penny.

It was just so, so easy to buy things online and not think about the actual cost. I started spending more time online shopping, looking at pages and pages of products for hours on end. I got a kick out of finding things that were brand name on sale and using coupons. I could easily blow more than $100 in an hour online, splurging and then returning almost everything or selling on eBay when I regretted my purchase. Soon I was relying on my eBay income to paying my bill on time. I racked up a $1000 on Bill Me Later and was terrified of not being able to pay it when the end of the six months approached. But lucky me, I got an internship that paid $4000 for two months over the summer. I spent my first paycheck paying back the balance. And then the problem just got worse.

I opened up a new credit card that had 0% interest for 15 months, because apparently I had racked up a great credit score after using Bill Me Later. I started buying things left and right. I started becoming embarrassed about all the purchases that were coming to the house and scared of my mother's angry outbursts over the money I was spending so I started hiding the problem. A couple of white lies when my mom would interrogate me about price or when I had gotten an item. I was building my new wardrobe trying to find my own sense of personal style, I rationalized to myself.

It was only this summer, when my now $3000 balance was due on my credit card, $1500 racked up on Bill Me Later, and less than $1000 in my bank account (plus many angry outbursts from my mother) that I realized the full extent of my problem. I had spent over $8000 in the past year alone. And where had it all gone? I couldn't say. A $100 here, $200 there. It was hard to think that I had spent that much and so I had tried to block it out of my mind.

It was painful, evaluating myself and realizing my shopping addiction was out of control. I am only been about a month into my recovery and I can say that I have faltered already with a few purchases. But I have blocked all my online sites and have all the money in my bank account queued to pay off my Bill Me Later account. I have my mother to thank for my credit card balance but it is painful having to accept help. I know I have a long journey ahead of me but I am determined to conquer this addiction.

**TL;DR** It took three years and over $4000 of debt for me to realize my shopping addiction, and I am a month into recovery."
2f2zhj,1,2014-08-31,"3 yrs of NoFap struggle. Think I finally ""flipped the switch"". Hope this can help others. !LONG READ!",TakeYourLifeBack,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/2f2zhj/3_yrs_of_nofap_struggle_think_i_finally_flipped/,"I have been a lurker on this reddit for 3 years. The continual stream of motivational posts have helped me to retain some hope for the future and tolerate this shit piece of life I am living. Today I have decided that it's time for me to chip-in and give back something to this wonderful community. God bless you all.

Ever since I was 13 I have been excessively masturbating and playing computer games almost every single day of my life. These two habits have completely destroyed me. I am 22 now and even though my life probably seems quite cool to an outsider - I attend a top university and had ""prestigious"" internships, whatever that means - I am a depressed and suicidal motherfucker. I literally hate myself most of the days and try to numb the pain with a continual dose of weed and alcohol followed by countless hours of DotA 2 and PMO.

You can name all the usual symptoms of PMO and gaming: social anxiety, ED, virgin (never had PIV sex), brain fog, lack of motivation, dark eyes, tiredness, etc. I have them all. I have literally no idea how I have managed to get a job and get into uni, as I look back it seems like it never even happened - its almost like some memories from another life.

When I realised I have this addiction I have been trying to fight it ever since. I have tried everything, nothing worked and nothing seemed to stop me from getting what my fucked up brain wanted. I have formatted my Windows to get rid of K9 protection, I have downloaded porn in my uni library, I have masturbated in train toilets - you get the idea. I have made a chains.cc account when I started (recommended). The longest streak of NoFap reads - 9 days. Quite recently I almost gave in into thinking that I am hooked for life and its for the best if I just keep on PMOing with no regrets.

&amp;nbsp;

Well, I can say that these past few weeks have been life-changing. Even though I kept relapsing, I went on continuous streaks of 5-7 days of NoFap and no gaming which for me is huge (also, every time I broke NoFap I broke my no gaming streak as well - with each evil it only gets more and more worse, you have to be as clean as possible). I have also consumed a minimum amount of weed and alcohol. 

During these streaks I have truly found out how beautiful life is. I have found my passion of what I truly enjoy, I have met old friends and made new, I had a number of deep and meaningful conversations, I have been romantic with girls and looked so deep into their eyes that it felt like I was looking straight into their soul, I have been commented on having good looks, but the most amazing feeling I had was from just being outside, enjoying the sunshine, listening to birds, breathing fresh air.. In these moments I have felt truly incredible - a sense of fullness and happiness. 

&amp;nbsp;

However, the major breakthrough happened today. I have recently met this Spanish girl with whom I started getting intimate. She is a foreigner in my country, with below average English and obviously a little scared because of that. She also has this unbelievably cute and ""innocent"" personality. I had a strange feeling of needing to make this girl feel loved and cared for. On Friday night we had a romantic evening and started to make out back at mine. Now, I have had cases of ED (with every single one of total 3 girls in my life), but I either blamed it on alcohol or thought if I will abstain from fapping for a day or two it will cure itself. This time, I had no alcohol and I was 5 days in, but nothing was working. I could not get it up even after 3 hours of intense makeout. I made an excuse and said that we will continue next day, as we already had planned to go out on Saturday. Well, make your guesses - the next day the exact same story repeated. [I tried to force myself into her but it didn't work](/nsfw). I will never forget the sadness in her eyes, her quiet 'sorry' thinking she is not good enough for me. I felt absolutely devastated from the pain I caused to this little girl. 

&amp;nbsp;

After she left this morning, I relapsed again. But something was different this time, instead of going for a second time which I wanted, I got up and started crying and feeling this insane hate towards myself. In tears, I have started shaking, breathing heavily and beating myself, punching the wall so hard my fist started bleeding. Before my eyes flashed all these amazing moments of happiness I have been feeling compared to the insane disgust and worthlessness I felt when watching porn. I could see the sadness in the eyes of all girls of my life: a one night stand from uni and my non-existent confidence afterwards and most importantly my unbelievably beautiful girlfriend whom I loved with all my heart and her look of sadness that despite our mutual love something was wrong - this habit has destroyed our relationship.

Still in tears I went to clean up the kitchen and put on some music. One of my favorite songs came up - Clean Bandit, ""Dust Clears"". I have never actually paid attention to its lyrics, but this time I heard every word crystal clear and it hit me like a truck with the weight of this addiction crumbling on my shoulders:

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;""Dust Clears""

&gt;Imagine if the life
&gt;That you thought you shared wasn't really there.
&gt;It was made up in your mind,
&gt;Could be anyone, anywhere,


&gt;'Cause you'd been living in a world of your own design, undermined,
&gt;In another place, other space in time.

&gt;As the dust clears and it all starts to disappear,
&gt;It may get harder
&gt;'cause you just restarted.
&gt;And wherever you are, land on another star!
&gt;It may get harder
&gt;'cause you just restarted.
&gt;
&gt;You better get real, real, real and realize that the situation's going nowhere.
&gt;Because you act so tough I've totally lost control.
&gt;So please try to understand that if I could I'd call and I would be there.
&gt;And if I didn't hurt so much you know I'd give you it all.
&gt;You know I'd give you it all.

&amp;nbsp;

The dust has cleared for me my friends. It's time for me to step out of my imaginary world of gaming and porn and start living.

&amp;nbsp;

TL;DR: I don't care. You should stop your short attention spans and read it all anyways.

2f3kwr,8,2014-08-31,Can I increase SMV by dating a girl with high SMV? Got one on the line but the hook is starting to fall out,[deleted],asktrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/2f3kwr/can_i_increase_smv_by_dating_a_girl_with_high_smv/,"Hello askTRP, I need some fresh perspective for my situation. I really need to hear some straight RP answers because I might be getting a case of oneitis... The story is a bit long but I'll try keep it short and concise. I am 25 btw.

Each summer my company always hires a few interns from the local university. The girl that was assigned to my department did not stand out to me at first... She seemed mostly average and I didn't have much interest in pursuing her. After working with her a few weeks and getting to know her it was clear that she had a crush on me. I was kind of surprised she was so crazy about me. I don't have the immediate attraction that a visual alpha has, I just have good frame and good demeanor, I carry myself well and dress well. She started inviting me to hang out outside of work and it wasn't long until we were banging. After getting to know her I discovered that she actually has quite a high SMV and here is why:

She is 20 years old and she is a fencer. Quite a good fencer actually. So good in fact she was ranked 3rd overall last year and one of the best universities in the country gave her a scholarship to go there. Her body is extremely tight and fit and she has a great squatters ass, two solid pythons for legs and a tight stomach... her face is a 6 but the body is easily an 8 so I'd give her a 7 overall. The sex is great and that pussy is cash.

Personality wise I have never met a girl like her before. She is the most competitive person I have ever met. She is very independent and has a lot going on in her life socially, academically (STEM major) and athletically. Her drive and determination far exceeds my own. She has traveled a good portion the world already and is always seeking out new adventures and experiences. We share a lot of the same interests and have done a lot of fun things together such as training, cycling, camping, hiking, cooking, partying and doing pretty much anything that isn't sitting on our ass being docile.

So we became fast friends and started seeing each other a lot. 4-6 nights a week for the past 2 months. I treated her pretty much just like a GF except emotionally I still treated her as a fuck buddy. She was always shit testing me post sex about when we would take the relationship to the next level. The reason I didn't want to take it to the next level is because:

1. Her partner count is high (9) higher than my own (6)

2. I want to get better at pulling tail and conquest some more.

3. I could easily see her dumping me if she were to get bored of me

So she knew that I thought her count was too high and started saying that if couldn't get over that then we would have to end our relationship. I told her to be patient and just wait it out because if we were to start a relationship then would be worth it. She kept getting increasingly impatient and then asked me last week ""is there anything else that's keeping you from starting this relationship?"" I failed the shit test and revealed to her reason number 2. she flipped out and started calling me names. I told calm the eff down and that she was being hypocritical judging me for desiring an experiences she has already had. I then went home even though we planned for a sleepover.

I went home and was weighing the pros and cons of walking away and trying to salvage it. I decided that I wanted to salvage the situation and take her to GF status. Now I know she isn't what TRP would consider to be LTR material but my logic was that I could really boost my SMV by being in a relationship with her because she would motivate me to keep on being a better version of myself and she has some great social and academic connections. I feel like she fits in very nice with my current situation. I work full time and go to different school part time. Between those two thing and lifting and cooking my own meals I don't find have much other time for chasing pussy and social activities. Pretty much all of my other friends have moved away, married or busy.

So, I told her that I want to be in a relationship with her and now she is on the fence. She is no longer crazy about me. Failing that shit test really damaged how she feels about me. She stayed over last night and I am going to her place Tuesday for a sleepover but she says she doesn't know what her attitude towards me is. I decided that my best move here is to act indifferent, that I am going to keep having fun in my life and will keep on striving to improve. She can join me and we can have fun together or she can go ahead and do her own thing.

So TRP, I have a feeling that you are going to tell me to walk away from this girl, and that is probably what I should do, but I want to keep her around a little longer because she is a boatload of fun and I don't know when I will be able to pull another girl like her. Is it possible for me to boost my SMV by dating a girl with high SMV? If so, then how can I convince her to stick around?  Also, for those of you who think I should walk away, why?

I will supply any additional details that are needed.

2f3mg9,1,2014-08-31,[FN] My sons flu symptoms,[deleted],shortstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/2f3mg9/fn_my_sons_flu_symptoms/,"I work as a junior executive at a large investment firm. It started off as an internship while still in university. That was all I needed. It was a foot in the door. I was goal oriented. I was motivated. I wouldn't allow myself to fail. I wasted little time moving up in the company. Before long I was promoted. Then promoted again and again. It didn't matter who or what I sacrificed to do so. It was the cost of doing business.

The value of my bank account and stock portfolio was quickly approaching the millions. I owned a large house in a gated community and a vacation villa in the Caribbean. I had a beautiful wife, whom I met in university and married soon after. We had a seven year old son that attended one of the most prestigious private schools on the eastern seaboard. Though my involvement with his education was limited. I paid his tuition. Thats where it stopped. I knew to succeed in the corporate environment I needed to maintain focus. There was little time for such events as school plays or movie nights at home. Not at this point in my career. My son understood. My wife understood. It was to provide a better future. For them. For us. It was all for a reason. It would pay off in the end.

I was at the airport when my wife called to tell me the school had admitted Jeremy to the hospital with flu symptoms. It was precautionary. It was to ensure the other students wouldn't be exposed. That it was routine. Don’t worry about it. It was normal at this time of year, she said.

I was waiting to board a flight to Chicago to meet a client when she called. They were one of our biggest accounts and had raised some concerns about reports that recently surfaced. The numbers weren't where they expected. Or where we projected them to be. They had questions and wanted answers. The firm didn't have answers. I didn't have answers. There were more important things to worry about than the status of my sons flu symptoms. 

This was a meeting that could help advance my career. There were rumours that the Senior Vice President of my department was moving on to pursue other opportunities. I wanted that job. Badly. At age thirty four I would be the youngest senior executive within the company. To achieve this would be a dream come true. If I could appease the client in such a way that they were not only were satisfied with the response, but to increase their investment the job would be mine for the taking.

The meeting was scheduled to take place in three days. This afforded me the opportunity to formulate an appropriate response to the questions that were raised. During this time my wife informed me that the doctors were to keep our son for a few days to run some tests. It was to rule out worst case scenarios. I shouldn't worry she said.

There was little time to worry. The client was expecting answers. I was focused on the meeting and how to keep them from losing faith. They were important to us. They were important to me. It was critical to have this go well. If one client loses faith others are sure to follow. That wasn't an option. We needed this to be a success. I wouldn't allow it to be a failure. Not for me. Not for the company.

The day before the meeting my wife called to update me that Jeremy's doctors were concerned about the results of one of the tests. He was being referred to a specialist so he could be further evaluated. She asked me to come home quickly. He was scared. He missed his father. He wanted me there with him.

The meeting was a resounding success. The client was not only satisfied with the answers I provided, but they were excited about my vision for the future. The firm was ecstatic. I was ecstatic. I was told that when I returned we would discuss my future. I was told there was a huge potential for growth and they wanted me as a part of it.

By the time I returned I was met with several messages from my wife. The specialist was troubled by the results of the tests. There was an abnormality on one of the scans and they wanted to check it out further. Jeremy was scheduled to have an exploratory surgery later that day to help decide what the next step should be. I called to tell her I would be there as soon as possible, but I had to stop by the office first. I told her to tell Jeremy I was thinking of him and that I loved him. That he would be fine. He takes after me.

I was in the board room when the call came in from my wife. I ignored it. I was sitting across the table from the top executives of the firm. These were men I respected. Men I wished to emulate. Men I sought to become. We were discussing my future goals. Where I saw myself in five years. A decade. Several more. Despite her repeated calls, it wasn't the time or place to answer the phone. This was important.

When the meeting concluded my wife had left one message. 

“Tim….” She was crying, “........Pl...Please call me...”

I think about the moments I missed. The moments I sacrificed. The birthdays. The first days of school and the recitals I couldn’t make time for. I think of the moments where he was happiest. Where he was smiling. Laughing. Carefree. I think about how scared he must have been. The complications that arose. That there was nothing the surgeon could do.

I think about the fact I wasn't there when he needed me most. I was in a meeting. A meeting I deemed too important to postpone. A meeting that informed me that I wasn't to be considered for the senior VP position. They were looking to hire a person with more experience. They told me they appreciated all the hard work I put in because without that they wouldn’t be where they are today. Keep doing what I’m doing, they said, and my future is limitless.

I think about those that told me how sorry they are for my loss. That I was a good father and he loved me. That he is in a better place. I think about the funeral. He was so small in the casket. So peaceful. As if he was sleeping. He was just a child.

I think about the moments I missed with the delusion it was all for him. To further his life. That was, after all, why I did all this. To give him everything. To provide for him. To give him a future. I’m left thinking that I had more important things to worry about than the status of my sons flu symptoms."
2f3oc7,0,2014-08-31,What should I do about this guy at work?,creepythrowaway2xc,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/2f3oc7/what_should_i_do_about_this_guy_at_work/,"Hi all. Throwaway used.

I have been working at my hospital now for six months, as a floater in the dietary department. I enjoy my job, LOVE the people that I work with, and love the experience I am getting as I prepare to apply to my dietetic internship in the next year.

Pretty since I started my job, I have been having trouble with one of the cooks there. He is a young and attractive guy, and one of the few that I can converse with (language barriers). Starting from my training, he would stare at me without talking to me. It made me a little uncomfortable at first, but not wanting to rock the boat, I didn't say anything.

The staring but not saying anything beyond hi or what's up continued until a few months into my job when we started talking one time when it was slow.  We talked for about half an hour just about life: hobbies, school, etc. He mentioned that he has a girlfriend and a 5y/o son, and I talked about my husband. That was it. I thought it was a friendly conversation, and at the end he said, ""That was fun... we should do that again.""

Whatever. Since we had that lengthy conversation, though, I've been noticing that he has gotten increasingly more inappropriate. One of my job routines requires me to wear business casual clothes, a lab coat, and work in an office down in the kitchen. When I started working in that routine, the staring and hanging out in my general vicinity increased even more. He consistently calls me beautiful, I catch him staring at my ass ALL the time, and just makes comments here and there. He has also recently taken an interest in my husband, asking what my husband does for work, what ethnicity he is, and other stuff. I recently started keeping a log of stuff he says. Like, August 7: ""It's a shame you're married, all the pretty girls are"", ""I can't stop staring at you"" (when I told him he should probably make himself stop anyway, he told me that my green eyes don't make that easy for him), and that he's just a ""typical guy"" for flirting with women at work. When I told him that I hoped my husband wasn't being a typical guy at work, he said, ""Well, no guy would ever do that to YOU.""

August 15, it came out that both of us would be in Vegas at the same time: ""Hope we don't run into each other, you wouldn't want me to catch you drinking too much"" (with elevator eyes); ""Wanna stay in my room? Oh, but your husband probably wouldn't like that, huh?"" (My response: ""Sneaking around's not my thing, don't know if YOU'RE into that"")

Two X, what do I do? I have never been shy about telling off creepy guys, but I feel completely stuck in where to go from here. The thing is, this individual only does this stuff when none of the other employees who speak English and are around our ages are around. When other young people are around, he ignores me. I am hesitant to bring this up with my supervisor because she is very passive and most likely won't do anything; also, my supervisor routinely flirts with and throws herself at any man that comes in the kitchen, and looks at any young, attractive woman in our department as competition. I don't feel comfortable bringing this to her attention because I know that she has found ways to fire employees who have gotten more male attention than her.

I really don't know how to proceed from here. Any advice would be most welcome and appreciated. xx"

2f48gm,0,2014-08-31,"Me [22M] and my girlfriend[22F] of 8 years broke up, got back together and broke up again due to bad circumstances",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2f48gm/me_22m_and_my_girlfriend22f_of_8_years_broke_up/,"Earlier this year my girlfriend went away on an internship for 4 months, she was nervous because she was going to be alone in a new town and I supported her, but over the months I started having doubts about our relationship and stopped calling her often.


I thought about ending the relationship but decided that I loved her and wanted to make it work when she came back.


When she came back, she broke up with me and said her feelings had changed, I was devastated and I begged her not to leave and apologized for being distant when she was away, she said she didn't blame me for that but she left me anyway. 


2 weeks later she came back asking me if we could try again, I immediately took her back and we were both happy. Over the next weeks we were happy and although things weren't perfect we were on the right path.

Then her mom was diagnosed with a terminal illness.


She started acting distant and would discretly avoid me when i tried kissing her or hugging her for too long. I asked her what was wrong and she said that she was sorry but she couldn't return affection to anyone(not even her family) because she was really unhappy since her mother was probably going to die, she said that she started doubting what she felt about me and didn't know if she loved me as before...

I was going away on an internship myself so we both decided to break up cause she didn't know how she felt about me and I didn't want her to worry about me (she said that she felt bad for treating me this way and that she didn't deserve me). I told her that I didn't want to end but I knew she needed some space to know what would make her happy


1 week later I found out that I had lost the internship, and came back to my home town. Now I only want her back to make it work and be there for her but my friends tell me that I shouldn't try to get back with her because she seems like she doesn't love me but I know and she knows(she told me) that if this situation of her mother hadn't happen that we would be together and probably happy.


What do I do? I want her back more than anything! 


---   
**tl;dr**: Girlfriend broke up with me when she came back from internship, she came back after 2 weeks, everything was great until her mom was diagnosed with a terminal illness and she started doubting what she felt about me, we broke up because I was going away on an internship. I lost the internship and went back to my home town, I want her back what should I do? "
2f48pl,1,2014-08-31,I'm an average looking dude and am insecure about it,sillythrowawaytime,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2f48pl/im_an_average_looking_dude_and_am_insecure_about/,"Hi all, I'm a straight 19-year old male at 6'3"" and I weigh about 195 lbs. I pay a great deal of attention to my appearance, regardless of how little I like my face. I don't lift but I feel I have a decent body and I carry myself well. I'm not the hipstery fashion type, but I believe I dress okay and have gotten compliments on my outfits.

I'm above-average looking at best, and more likely average looking, and this troubles me. At the risk of identifying myself, I'm deeply insecure about one flaw on my face that holds me back, and another one that is noticeable from certain angles. As I walk by women look at my face with empty gazes, like, ""oh, he's tall, but his face is kind of weird.""

I have an appearance that people either love or hate. I've gotten forced comments from friends and acquaintances that I should model, that I'm handsome, or ""maybe a bit above average or below average"" but have also gotten shit like ""I think you're ugly, but then again I have a penis so I'm a bit biased"" or ""if you were a porn star, you'd be like Ron Jeremy."" I've asked about my chances with a couple of girls and friends advised me that I'd need money or be well-hung. Good thing I'm at a top business school for ugrad, so the former won't be an issue. -.- The vast majority of the negative comments came over the past 6 months, which makes me wonder if puberty magically made me ugly without my noticing (I think the gap from my mouth and nose is larger now).  Reddit rates me between 5-7 on rateme and amiugly, but the photos were mildly flattering.

tl;dr I'm aware enough to realize that I can still find someone, and that I'm probably making a big deal out of nothing, but I spend an unusual amount of time worrying about my appearance and when I could be worrying about getting a good internship or finding a woman."
2f4evj,1,2014-08-31,I am just done.,recyclingjunk,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2f4evj/i_am_just_done/,"wall of text. using a throwaway.

last year, after 5 years of bullying from coworkers, i was fired from my job. i snapped. i didn't hit or harm anyone. i got angry. really angry. but, well, when you work in a bar and another waitress tells you to fuck off from a table you were waiting on, that had beckoned to you for service and you keep losing out on money because people won't let you do your job. you just get fed the fuck up. yes, jerk said 'you need to leave!' in front of the customers. there are no assigned sections in this bar, no one had served them yet and they called to me. what am i supposed to do?! management backed her up instead and fired me. i would have just left immediately that night, but i decided to go in the storage room and sit for a bit alone because i was concerned about driving while angry and getting into an accident. apparently, this makes me crazy. like i said, i was only angry and even though i was screwed over, i removed myself from the situation as best as i could. i did not hit or harm anyone. funny, but coworkers HAVE punched other coworkers in the face, etc. and kept their jobs if they were a favorite. i have been physically assaulted by customers, slammed on the floor, slammed into a table by another waitress on purpose (oh and she only got a talking to), etc. trust me, when this crap builds up long enough, you've had it. it really makes me angry. i worked there for years, was never late, do not drink or use drugs, do my best to be pleasant and have a good sense of humor. i only stayed because there was $$$ here. $$$ i need because of healthcare, which i will now be losing next month.

so i manage to get a job at another bar. nice people. not as many hours or $$$, but, it's a job. also, assigned sections. they are very fair about that, so no fighting bullshit. in the meantime, i attempt to apply for places during the week as this bar is more lucrative to work during the weekends than retail. no dice. every damn employer wants me to work weekends! i cannot survive working just weekends in retail. that is why i work in the bar. i cannot put my former place of employment down as a reference. actually, i'm very reluctant to.

this past winter, my best friend died suddenly from a heart attack. this person was a sibling to me. i still cry and miss this person. there have been so many things i wanted to tell him and now that he is gone, i can't. i am so broken without him. i am crying right now and wish more than anything he was here to give me a hug.

a month after burying my best friend, i got pregnant. with my job being in the air and my so having pretty much no income, i had to terminate the pregnancy. my health insurance did not offer maternity care and there was no way for me to pay for health care. i also smoke cigs and that concerned me as well. i have some other health issues that would have made carrying risky. so has serious genetic health problems that we would not have had the $$$ to test for. my so originally wanted me to keep it, despite the fact he works 7 days a week, 5 of them at an unpaid internship (min wage part time on weekends) with literally no finances to assist me in raising this kid. he put pressure on me to move out of my place and get a house for us. pretty much it would have turned into me paying for everything while pregnant. this made me feel resentful. i had really bad morning sickness, so it made work hard. also, i didn't feel being huge and pregnant in a bar was a good idea. this was just not the right life to bring a child into. he even contacted some 'men and abortion' website and they sent him an email he forwarded to me about the horrible depression women who get abortions suffer. i just....i just didn't need that shit. eventually, a friend talked to him and he changed his tune to 'whatever you want'. which didn't really make me feel better. a few days before the appointment (which i checked with him to make sure he could get time off), he had the nerve to ask me to reschedule it so he could be at some important nonpaying internship thing. of course i threw a fit. i had been sick as a dog pregnant. due to some medical issues, the clinic was also concerned. i was just so angry he would put this damn UNPAID internship before something this big. i knew not having a child with him was the right decision. i still hurt and i still cry. i feel horrible. he did go to the appointment with me, i'll give him that. but i feel like i had to push him to.

and that's another thing. a year ago my so took an unpaid internship in his field. i was so proud of him! he told me he'd have set hours and it was for 6 months, leading to a job. that was great! i was happy for him. emphasize WAS. because it's now been over a year, he really doesnt have set hours, still UNPAID, works every day and i have had cancelled or late dates EVERY week. and i am sick of it! we can never make a date with a set time, ever. he isn't making $$$, he is still living with his parents and what $$$ he does have he blows on internship related stuff (not getting into detail in case someone i know finds this). many times on the few hours we do get to spend together, he is on his phone, starts working on something internship related, takes work calls. and he is exhausted all the time. i have to beg him for sex. it is degrading. no he's not cheating.

he is depressed as well. he is just not going where he wants in life. he is busting his ass and has nothing to show for it. i feel him, i do. but it's taking a toll on me as well. i feel like we are spinning our wheels and going nowhere. we are in our 30s. i am getting too old for this shit.

on top of that, my health insurance premium is now going to be more than my rent next month. i cannot pay it. i am fucked.

i am depressed. i have cried for that last 3 days. i. am. just. done."
