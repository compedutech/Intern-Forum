 So me and this girl dated for about 2.5 years. Went to same university and live very close back home too. I would say we had a great relationship (at school) during breaks I often took advantage of this time for many internships and work up to 60+ hrs a week. She did not like how I would disappear but I tried very hard  to make her happy. I would say 3 months before we broke up she started getting really friendly with one of her friends who was another female. I felt uncomfortable with the way they were but never said anything. She ends up breaking it off with me and shortly after ends up with her ""friend"". The following months sucked as you can imagine between her trying to hide it and us going to a small school everyone always telling me things, but I tried to focus on me and meet new people. That was a year ago. Last month was the first time I have heard from her since the end of last summer. She said she was confused and still is but this year did not go how she had planned and that many people avoided her. She also said she had told her parents and they were very against the idea of her being with a girl. We starting texting and hanging out again because I still care and would rather be there for her than something happen. I would like to be with her but don't know how to go about anything. She says that she is not with the girl anymore but is best friends with her. Naturally I am against it and we constantly argue about them hanging out. I left the University last semester and have recently found a house. She comes and hangs out but has never stayed has told me she is unsure if she can be with a guy again. I was her first (ever) she was her first (girl). She is also worried about it becoming much like it did over breaks at school. How can I become ok with them being friends when the other girl numerously over stepped lines before? Or more generally what should I do reddit?

TL:DR Ex of 2.5 left me for a girl and hasn't spoken to me in a yr. Just recently coming back and idk what to do."

24g5pw,11,2014-05-01,Relationship vs. Education/Career (Moving or staying put) [M23] [F21],remoteplanet,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/24g5pw/relationship_vs_educationcareer_moving_or_staying/,"When I was a Freshman in Uni I decided I wanted to study abroad in Japan and eventually find a job either in Japan or an American company with Japanese ties. My major is accounting with a focus in finance. 
Fast forward to April of my Junior year: I have 5 months left before my study abroad ends. I meet this amazing Japanese girl who I worked with at our school's English Lounge, and we instantly hit it off and start dating in the beginning of May. We both are having the times of our lives and are meeting each almost everyday at school for an hour or two, then hanging out and going places once a weekend. However, both know that I have to go back to the US at the end of August. Then out of the blue, I get an offer to start an internship in Tokyo at a small international finance company (with the intention to eventually hire me full-time) to start from mid-December (which was my original dream). Therefore, she came to stay with me for 3 weeks in the US during her summer vacation, and we decided to go long distance until I return (3 Months). 
When I get back we had a slightly shaky relationship for about two months, then everything cleared up and have had a next to perfect relationship since then. Talked about getting an apartment together once she graduates in almost a year (still lives with her family-which is common due to the price of housing) and even marriage. 
Fast-forward to 6 months to present day: Now that I have been here for almost six months and the company I interned with offered me a permanent job, but the salary was less almost one third what I would be making if I worked in New York City and less than half in Alabama. I tried to negotiated a higher salary but they wouldn't budge. Plus they change my role in the company so that I am no longer doing accounting work but something completely different than my previously intended career path. Lastly, they expect everybody to work 11-12 hours a day, which would be about $10/hr for my new salary. I would want to change jobs, but I have yet to gain enough work experience nor past the language examination to qualify for any jobs other than teaching English (a resume killer). 
Because of this my parents want me to come home and start graduate school (which they will pay for) in NYC or DC so that I can take the CPA exam and get a high paying accounting job. In the past, my girlfriend said she would move with me to the states if I had to but when I brought this new issue up and told her if I do this it will be a minimum of 5 years before I can come back to Japan to live, she started to cry. I don't know what to do because if I go back to the states and she decides to come that means we would have to get married and I would be with very little income until I graduate one year from starting. But if I don't take her we will most definitely have to breakup losing all of our hard work we have put into our relationship. If I decide to stay, I am either an English teacher with no hope of advancement or working at a sweatshop of a company for next to nothing in the most expensive city to live in the world. 
Be both really love each other and there hasn't been a week that has passed were we having seen each other for less than three times. Please provide me on some guidance for what I should do. Thanks"
24gn45,0,2014-05-01,Constant cycle of having to start from square one,Xiphura,ForeverAlone,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/24gn45/constant_cycle_of_having_to_start_from_square_one/,"If you had seen me 24 hours ago, you would've seen a girl on top of the world. I am so close to being an ex FA. Have a good job, actually have some friends, a couple of hobbies. And to top it all off I just got a new BF, and not just a guy who wants to use me for sex, he legit likes me. 

So what has gone wrong?

Almost all of my friends are from my job. I don't think there's anything wrong with that. I have 2 groups of friends here, I went out to lunch with one of them yesterday, and one girl is going away for an internship next week. And another girl (who I do my hobbies with and consider my closest friend) said her husband wants to move them 2 hours up north! I started panicking because I will be so lonely if she moves away. My other group of friends from work and I have been drifting apart a bit lately, and I don't know what to do (they all work together in the same dept and I don't get to talk to them as much).

I live in a college town. And I'm still young enough (26) that most people I meet are in college. But when they graduate, they move back home. So every spring I lose friends and I'm lonely. Even my new BF is graduating in a year, and who knows what will happen then. 

Sure, I could meet people through my hobbies. My 2 hobbies are going to the gym and I also take a hip hop dance class. But I wouldn't want to talk to people at the gym and the hip hop class is pretty small. Sometimes it's only me and my friend who might move away. And I do get along with other people there but it would be weird to ask them to do other stuff when most of them are older than me, and have families and stuff like that. And there's not much to do in this shitty town so I'm not sure where to find other things to do (no Meetup groups here).

Sorry for the rant, but I just feel like what's the point when everyone I meet will move away in a year? I want to not be FA so badly, but I feel like I am constantly starting over and it makes me depressed. "
24gzxc,1,2014-05-01,Career Advice: Help,GoingWestASAP,marketing,https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/24gzxc/career_advice_help/,"So I know this is a long shot but here goes:

I need help finding a job in Marketing and Advertising.  I don't know where else to go so I thought someone here might be able to help.  I am trying to find a job in a marketing or advertising capacity.  I am going to graduate from my university this month and I believe I am having so much trouble finding a job in this field because:

1.  I am not a Business school major (double major in Economics and International Affairs)
2.  I only have taken a few classes in marketing or business (which have been my favorite classes at school hands down)
3.  I have a **LOT** of internship experience, but I feel like not enough is relevant for this field
4.  I am trying to get a job in a big city, especially on the West Coast (California, Denver, Seattle, etc), or even in NYC.  I am of course looking everywhere, but location is important too.  Pickers can't be choosers I suppose but it doesn't mean I can't try I suppose...

Maybe someone here can even give me a better lead on where to apply or more specific things to look into.  My motivation for marketing is sort of like this, as I explained in an email to my friend:

""I chose my other major in International Affairs because I love everything International, and I love everything International because I love everything that is ""different"" i.e. cultures, societies, and **especially** people.  And I love different people because I love seeing and trying to understand how people think and what makes us similar and different.  There is such a vast world out there that it is impossible to know if what you are thinking is similar or different from the norm.  Figuring out what people want and desire through all of the thick diversity around the world is incredible, and finding those needs and wants is what I believe lies at the heart of Marketing and Advertising.  It is a way to take both a creative and scientific approach to understanding how the world and people work.""

Marketing, advertising, market research methodology: All of it is incredibly fascinating to me but it is so hard to get a job.  I've applied to many but, as you could imagine, I have not been successful in my search.  I don't want to settle for a job I don't want because I know this field is where my passions (and happiness) lie.  If ANYONE can give me advice on how to better go about my search or would like to PM me, it would mean the world to this redditor :)"
24h5v3,8,2014-05-01,I need to get this off my chest (long),ouibonjourmadame,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/24h5v3/i_need_to_get_this_off_my_chest_long/,"I came across this subreddit a long time ago reading a post someone had x-posted from another subreddit I'm active into. Sorry if my English is not the best, it's my second language. Anyways I remember I thought: maybe I had a Nmom reading the stories here. Then a few days ago I decided to read all the trait list and omg did I recognize my mom. 

My parents are separated. They never got along. Dad is an introvert and kind of.. Living in his head. My mom is a psychologist. I have an older sister, a younger brother. I'm 21 years old. I got pregnant last year with my current SO. He's a student. I was a waitress. It was a surprise pregnancy. I was living with my dad with my SO and brother. We were living in the basement. My dad and brother were smoking inside, cleaning nothing. The house looked like the TV show: hoarding: buried alive. My dad offered to let us stay there with the baby. We kept the pregnancy secret from my mom until it was too late for abortion because I knew she would talk about it ALL the time. When we announced the pregnancy, she got mad, insulted us and called me that night to tell me I HAD to get an abortion. We left for 10 days in a country house my dad had rented. When we came, she was all excited about the baby and offered to us to come stay with her. She was living alone in her big 5 bedroom house. Really nice from her. We accepted. At first she was so nice my SO couldn't understand why I had problems with her in the past. Everyone always believes her. She's a psychologist. She knows best. When I was 16 she tried to intern me in the hospital. She was a psychologist. And as no one would listen to me, I'd get more mad. And she would say: you can see, she's getting mad at me and I just want the best for her, I'm a psychologist. Anyways.

So we came to live with her. She decided we'd pay a part of the groceries by giving her a certain amount of money on the first of each month. We also pay rent but a not much, but she has the right to walk in our room at anytime of day and night and to use us pretty much as her slaves. She even walked in while we had intercourse once, and decided she'd stay until we stopped, ""in case we were thinking about getting pregnant again"". She would never do the groceries. We would do it (with our money). She works a lot and eats out but still ate at home. She'd ask for more money for the groceries. We refused has she almost never bought anything. She got mad and told everyone we were so ungrateful. My SO has student loans. He received money from the government because he has now a child. He decided not to use it since he'd have to pay it back. When she heard, she was mad because she said we should have gave that money to her and be in debt. We need to hide all our money and everything we buy. If we buy things, we have money that we should have given her. She's making so much damn money herself, her house is almost all paid and she wants to take everything we have. Every dollar she knows we have, she finds a way to get it. We can't buy anything for our daughter. She wants to control everything.

I never do anything right concerning taking care of our daughter. One day I'm the best mom in the world (if there's people around). The next day, I do EVERYTHING wrong. We are also the only ones cleaning the house. It's never enough. We have a 2 month old. My SO is in finals. We don't do enough. She says what my SO is doing is easy and he should study less and spend more time cleaning or do any chore she'd like him to do.(he does engineering)

We're supposed to move out in January of next year. My SO's parents have an apartment but it's being renovated right now (it's basicly their house's second floor they used to rent before).They want to rent it to us for a reduced price. It's really nice and we could not afford something else this nice. When we told his dad that we could not stand to stay with my mom until January he said it could be ready this fall. We were satisfied with that.

But now, my mom won't work this month. She has ""professional burnout"" (her boss told her to stop being late every single day, she continued because she won't listen to anyone, she's always late, it's her way to control people, so she told her doctor she was having a burnout) and then she won't be working this summer either because she's working in schools. Since she has stopped working our life is a total nightmare. She's always at home. She's really intrusive. Follows us everywhere. Comments everything we do. Nothing we do is okay. And also everytime we talk about moving out or any dream we have (go back to school for me, eventually buying a house, our future life with our daughter and future other children) she just criticizes us and keeps repeating we will fail. I can't take it anymore. Being told I won't have in success in life is really bringing me down. Also, she constantly screams, in front of the baby. She tries to hit me. She said our daughter was ""an error"". She tries to manipulate us and everyone around us. She lies to all our family and friends. We're tired and depressed because of her. I tried telling her that her criticizing us is making me sad. She just responds: it's not my problem if you have not self-esteem. She says I have paranoia. She always diagnoses people (especially her children) with mental illness. Also, she says she has EVERY right (even to scream and be violent) because we live at her house. I told her no one has the right to scream and be violent and that it brings nothing positive. Also, she does like she didn't hear what I said if I say something she don't like. I repeat. Try to get her attention. She just leaves the room. 

My SO's parents offered to us to come stay at their place until the apartment is ready. The house is smaller. His sister tends to smoke weed inside the house (but probably her mom would make her stop if we'd come live there). I'm scared to go live with his family. They have a huge dog and the house is covered in hair. I guess I'm just shy. Also I'm scared of my mom's reaction. I don't know if she'll try to take revenge and try to make us lose custody of our child (because she knows his family smoke pot). Or that she'll do something horrible. She's so manipulative. My dad is sick with lung cancer. I don't want to completly screw my relationship with her. She hurts me really bad all the time and makes me feel ridiculous if I show her any feelings (sadness especially). I want the best for us and for my daughter. Sorry that was long."

I've just added a bunch of H&amp;P cards, and I'm not sure if I've improved or hampered the deck.

I hope that someone can read this and be helped.  I wish I had someone, when I was young, that could have helped me out.

I grew up in a very conservative part of Oklahoma on a farm in the middle of no where.  I didn't have Internet until I was 14...cable TV until I was 20.  All i knew was my small little sheltered world.  Just some context.

My first homosexual experience happened at age 6.  I was in first grade and I sacked the class bully's dick on the playground at school.  I did this everyday at recess to avoid getting hurt.  When I was young I was very slight and non confrontational (still am this one.)  Needless to say, Bully was held back and I advanced.  My ""innocence"" returned for a few years.

At age 9 I hit puberty...my first public hair.  I thought this was odd, as no one else had them in the bathroom.  It started to feel good when I touched myself and I began to realize what I had done a few years prior.  I began to experiment.  First by myself, but slowly I began trying things with a friend.  That didn't go far and i kept my thoughts, which wholly surrounded men, to myself.

I began masterbating and cumming at 11.  It was amazing.  My first time to reach orgasm i swear i saw stars.  Unbeknownst to me, my cousin began feeling what I had felt at 9...the curiosity.  He was 2 weeks younger than me.  He came over one weekend, as was typical, and asked me if I'd ever wanked (not typical).  What followed was three years (12-15) of gay experimentation and sex.  We blew each other, jerked each other and fucked each other, getting off several times each day.

I was in heaven.  He was my best friend.  That he was my cousin was inconsequential.  I loved him.  I was gay.

Turns out, he wasn't.   He began having issues with what we did at 15.  It stopped without notice...He no longer cared to visit, to even talk comic books or video games with me.  It was as if he didn't know me.

This was when the lectures began from my verbally abusive stepfather.  Fags this and queers that.  Things I didn't understand.  I had no exposure to what gay was until 15.  All I knew before that, was that I liked having a penis in me...especially my best friend's.  It was just another thing we shared; like we had shared everything else growing up.  

Anyway, I digress.  Along with the constant gay bashing from my step dad came the lectures at church.  I had never heard a sermon on the abomination of gays until 15.  I was scared shitless.  However, I couldn't get enough cock.  My sex drive was at the max.  I needed the release,  but hated myself with each and every act.  I resorted to blowing guys in locker rooms, at the city pool, where ever I could find it.  

Word began to travel that I was exceptionally talented at sex.   This didn't change how I felt..how I thought that the devil had poisoned me at such a young age, and that I couldn't change.  At 16 I begin driving and get an invitation from an older guy I had serviced to meet him at a truck stop.  This began my whoring.  Truckers would pay 20 to 50 per visit, depending on what they wanted.  I saw none of this money, of course, as I knew nothing until it was over.  I was a simple eager-to-please farm boy who liked a penis in me.  By this time I was well and truly depressed and suicidal.  I hated being an abomination in the eyes of God.  However, I was too chickenshit to take my own life.  I heard stories of how this queer or that queer was picked up and beaten to death.  I wanted this.  I thought that if I couldn't take my own life, then I'd at least put myself in a situation for someone else to.  I'd go on weekend runs with truckers hoping to not come back.  I knew nothing but wanting the pain inside to end.

I did this until the truck stop closed when I graduated high school.  At this point I'd had many dicks and a few hands in me.  I decided to see if I could actually live with being gay.  I got my first real boyfriend the summer after graduation.  He was 19, I was 18.  He was an army brat who was still living on his parents dime and had just returned from a year of school in France or some place.  It was  true love...for a whole month.  

I continued to build a chain of serial relationships over the next few years.  I was out to a few friends, but no one else.  I had actually began to enjoy life, even though I still hated being gay; being a disappointment to my family, even though they didn't know.  I dated a few really good guys...and it was the last one that I regret fucking up the most.

I was 20, he was 23.  Proper gentleman, never asked for sex.  We went on real dates and he showered me with attention and love.  I was in heaven again.  I had finally found my new best friend.  We dated for several months and had even planned our ""first time together"" for New Years Eve 2005.  Now, I had a friend at the time that was pregnant.  The babydaddy was an awful person so she had asked me to help her out...yaknow, doctors visits and what not.  Well, my family mistook these actions for us being together--they didn't believe the bullshit that we were just friends.   They knew I wasn't the dad, but didn't care.  They were excited that I may be a step in father.  Anyway, my goddaughter was born on 12/27/2005.  She was beautiful and I loved her very much.  

New Years Eve is here.  My fella and I are enjoying the night; having drinks, listening to music, kissing and what not. We are getting hot and heavy and all of a sudden, I had a panic attack.  I don't know why, I had been with more guys than I could remember, but something hit me. I KNEW that I couldn't be gay.  I had to be straight.  I had to live the life acceptable to my parents.  I left without speaking to him again...

Now, I know this was a horrible move.  Absolutely dick on my part and I accept all recriminations.  

I was straight.  Gay?  Fuck no, never.

I had one of my friends introduce me to one of hers.  A lady with the curse of the pink wand (her first husband was gay...)

We hit it off well because we had sitar interests.   Never mind that her vagina absolutely repulsed me.  Hey, beer was an acquired taste and I had learned to like it...pussy can't be that different.  And I'm straight, anyhow so it doesn't matter. *flexes muscles and scratches chest hair*

Well, she and I date for a year.  It's now the summer of 2007.  I have an internship in a city an hours drive away from home, she goes home (an hour in the opposite direction).  We begin to drift apart.  We both contemplate leaving each other.  I begin moving my stuff back to my old farm house (I had began staying with her at her apartment).  The summer ends, it's August and we are both gearing up for good bye...it's evident.  I wasn't happy being straight as i hated myself even more.  Anyway, I get drunk on my 22nd birthday (8/8) and pass out in bed.  Well, she has other plans and gets me going downstairs.  Now, we had always practiced safe sex but for this one time...I know cliché.  The next thing I remember, I'm sitting on the side of the tube, smoking a cigarette, with cum leaking out of my dick.  

Our plans continue...

Fast forward a few weeks...she's late.  She is pregnant. 

Well fuck.  Now I have to do the good thing.  I have to marry her.  I have to provide for this child.  It's not his fault his dad's stupid.  So, we stay together for the child.   He becomes my life and I still love him very much.  He was born in may of 2008 and mommy and I finally marry in October of that year.  We do all the typical stuff.

However, I'm miserable.  I can't help that I look at guys.  I stay true to her and never once do I step out.  The years go on and now it's the summer of 2011.  I've gained a lot of weight, am constantly depressed.  We are always fighting...she's not working, I'm working full time and in an MBA program AND being the housekeeper and full parent while she struggles part time going to college.   

I go to a FFDP concert that July and something clicks in one of their songs, I can't remember which.  I'm tired of being someone I'm not.  I'm tired of lieing to everyone, myself included.  I make the decision then...I have to get a divorce.

I go leave on 8/15/11.  I tell my family in the following months the truth.  

And guess what....the world didn't end.  I wasn't disowned.  My fears were for nothing.  

Now I'm with a guy that I love totally and completely.   This 8/8 will be 2 years.  




That's it...

If you're reading this and you're scared or worried please reach out.  At the very least, I'm here to listen...it may not help, but don't do what I did.

On that same line, if you know someone you think may be hurting inside, reach out to them, help them.  All they want is for someone to have a care for them.  This isn't restricted to gay youth...

24hlsw,1,2014-05-01,Should I drop university? Please read my story.,[deleted],asktrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/24hlsw/should_i_drop_university_please_read_my_story/,"Currently I am a beta. I might have the mind of an alpha, but what does that matter?
I want to change desperately. So here is my story:

I am 20 and currently sutdying CS and starting my 4th semester.
But I fucked it up. I never really cared about getting good grades or paying attention.
I have really bad grades and I am probably 2 semester behind.
Yeah, I know I fucked it up hard.
However to be honest, I really don't like CS. It's pretty boring and feels pretty useless.
Also my profs and university sucks even though this doesn't concern me that much.

I knew right after my first semester that this is nothing for me. I should stop. I was about to drop out... almost did not write any exam at all.
But I don't know somehow my environment started attacking me: 
""No, what are you doing!"", ""When you drop out you will always stay poor"", ""You are a total looser if you drop out"", ""Just continue and everything will be fine"", ""You will earn $70.000 by the time you graduate""...
And all shit like that. I don't know why though but I continued.

But this thought never got out of me. I always somehow wanted to quit. But I was a pussy and just went with the flow.
Yet this thought is getting bigger from time to time. And I am getting more depressed. Sometimes I am just paralyzed by the situation.

So here is what I am thinking about doing:
Stop university right now. Just put an end to my hell finally.

And focus 100% on these things:
- fitness and get the most out of me
- create a business
- expand my skills in some languages where I already have a very good, above basic, knowledge
- create some social life (join some sport club)
- other things: waking up at 4, volunteer, try getting an internships
- improve my math skills especially getting better at mental calculation where I currently suck even though I am good at math
- plus some other things which I desperately want/have to learn

When I say create a business I am mainly talking about an internet based business.
Before university started when I was about 17-19 I generated about $1-2k/month through the internet.
I know how create an internet business. I know how the things work there.
Not that this is something special, it really isn't.., but I can (almost) build sites like facebook from the scratch.
I have already some genuine business ideas. But no, I am not talking about shit like ""I am going to be rich I will build facebook!!..""

After these 6 month I will either:

1) continue doing what I am doing for another 6 months depends how for example my business etc. goes
2) or join the military for one year
3) or start over with another subject which I will choose more carefully
4) or (most probably) everything from 1 to 3

If I don't have already something going for myself I will go to university.
There I will choose some major like mechanical engineering (because well STEM... and I am acutally interested in these kind of subjects).
This time I will kick some serious ass and spend my time at university very wisely. And I will try to choose a university which focuses more on the practical side.

By the time I graduate with a bachelor I will be about 24 to 26.
I probably won't have a lot of internships to list on my CV. But at least I will have a life and maybe some successful business, who knows?

If I continue my current path I will probably be about 24 to 25 and probably miserable. I will always convince myself why didn't I just try it?
My thoughts, my body where crying for me to stop. But I didn't listen.

It's really serious. I had suicidal thoughts from time to time. I am so stressed that I am losing some hairs even though I started meditating and doing sports etc.
By the way cold showers do help a lot against depression...

I tried to to the things which I listed above whilst continue with my study.
But I can't. Either I do this then I get frustrated why I didn't do that enough or I do that and I am depressed that I didn't do this enough.
I don't know but I can't do multiple things at once. I either do that 100% or this 100%. I just can't do both.

Guys, this is not just some post on the internet. This is about my life. I need some serious advice. Please honestly think about it."
24hmoy,20,2014-05-01,Thank God I found this sub - my story and new path,jeezydasnowman,ThankTRP,https://www.reddit.com/r/ThankTRP/comments/24hmoy/thank_god_i_found_this_sub_my_story_and_new_path/,"Fuck the blue pill bullshit I've been my entire 24 years of (so far wasted) life. It's time to swallow and not gargle.


I discovered TRP about a week ago and literally spent 6 hours reading top posts of it and the RPN, and have since been reading more every day. Its like the Matrix where I'm vomiting trying to deny it, but the evidence is infallible: we live in a feminist world where men are expected to be weak emotional pussies. In order to rip my dick from the gaping hole that is between my legs I must 


- get ripped 
- get confident 
- get social


A little about me: I grew up in ultra-Christian deep south, everyone who believes evolution is going to hell, yadda yadda. I lost my faith about 14 years old listening to hiphop and from there things progressed pretty quickly. Being rebellious to the Christian girls was like the most attractive quality you could have so I had a lot of flings and STR's til I met a unicorn when I was 16. For two long years she had me as her lapdog literally willing to do anything as long as she would fuck me nonstop. Of course she eventually got tired of me beta ways and dumped me for my best friend, who, coincidentally, now drives a Benz and lives in Hawaii with unlimited pussy access. Instead of realizing he, while flawed, was definitely taking life by the horns I inserted my tampon and became bitter, victimized etc. I tried to date fellow college girls before I graduated but I was so bitter against women in general and I couldn't figure out why so many of them were literally willing to fuck ANYTHING WITH A COCK. Instead of joining a frat and learning social skills, I spent my first three years of college with beta friends all putting pussy on pedestals. Then I got an internship so my final year was spent working, studying, and dealing with video game addiction (it was bad). All the while any girl that batted an eye I immediately would assume my place in the line of orbiters. Oh, did I mention I also managed to white-knight on multiple occasions? Everything you can do wrong I HAVE DONE.


Which brings me to this last two years. My internship turned into a full time position but I was overconfident and lazy and managed to get myself fired, rightly so. Then I got a job in sales because, like women, the first job that came my way I opened wide and took. Making all commission my finances dropped pretty quick, especiallysince the girl I was orbiting at the time offered my her sweet 20+ partner-having pussy in exchange for free rent and lap dog services. I gleefully accepted thinking about how having sex again would solve all my problems. Wrong. I got into severe credit card debt, got evicted, had to sleep in my fucking car some nights until I finally waved the white flag and moved into my parents house. This was one year ago. Since then, I have talked to zero women, have no friends, and can't even discipline myself enough to profit consistently at 10NL online poker, which is literally the only thing in life I feel like I could do if I could just get my head out of my ass and get motivated.


Enter the red pill. Holy shit omfg. I am a vacuum and the content is rushing into me and its so damn obvious and simple. The solution to all my problems: become a man. It has been building all week until tonight, when I finally throw down the gauntlet and resolve I WILL: 

- get my fat white whale ass in the gym 
- stop eating shit food (I'm looking at you, McDonald's) 
- Exercise every day, gym or not.  Take a walk, do some pushups, etc. 
- Post results consistently (once a month, maybe?)


See ya at the gym, guys."

Okay, so I'm not really a romantic person at all. I'm kinda sporty/tough. I've had guys ask me out on dates, but I usually turn them down (as nicely as I can) because I honestly don't want to date anyone?
I'm very ambitious and pretty booksmart. I want to major in MIS/have a good summer internship at a big tech firm set up which is rare for a freshman. This is usually it's a turn off to most dudes for one reason or another. (overshadowing? don't like smart girls? who knows, I'm not going to put words in anyone's mouth)

I'm super witty. Which sounds pretentious, but for my own sake just trust me on this that I am wittier than the average bear. Read: humor is important to me and is a large part of my personality.

So I met this dude --tall super lanky, kinda dorky guy with black hair and a scruffy beard, dressed... passable for a white dude (jeans, not terrible tennis shoes. neutral colored shirts)-- on the first day of spring classes. 

We were one of a handfull of kids who showed up to the first lab, which no one was sure if it was canceled or not, which is common for the first week of school at my college. We sat next to each other and small talked while we waited for 10 minutes before leaving. 

I thought he was cute but I'm *very* cautious because most of the boys I like are the ones I don't know well enough.

from then on we've sat next to each other every lab session and I learned he's an engineer student. And he didn't seem intimidated at all by my major which was refreshing.

so naturally I facebook stalked the hell out of him so I could find ways to dislike him to get this unproductive dumb crush out of my system.

my findings:

-his posts are sometimes kinda dumb. let's just say he likes Mountain Dew.

-he eats really shitty shit. So many pictures of gummy candies. I mean he's thin, but I don't know if I can handle the unhealthyness of not exercising (he mentioned to me that in 2 years he's never used the school's gym because he's too buisy (??)) and the unhealthy food. I'm not up for changing people.

-I dig geeky guys, but his friends look totally weird and embarrassing. I don't know my threshold of nerdyness. I secretly read comic books and am the geekiest of my friends, but this might be more than I can do comfortably.

-these posts did range back to 2009, so maybe development has been made??

honestly not terrible results. Also what??? he's from my home town???

He compliments me on things other than my appearance, like my skill with maths, my art that I brought in one day (I needed it for the class after) and we share interest in photography, but I have to say he's more into it than I am. One red flag for me personally was that he said he's spent more money on a single camera lens than he has on his car. But I don't know exactly how passionate he is about it, so it's unfair for me to use that to judge him impulsive-money-spending-smartness-wise. He likes hiking like me too.

Just two weeks ago he started seeking me out in our big lecture class to sit next to, and we talk about stuff. 

The thing is, while in labs I spend most of the time helping him code, (I'm definitely better at it than he is, but I don't mind helping. I'm a prospective MIS major after all)

but in lecture we have more time before/after class to just talk. And god, guys --he's not funny. He gives good attempts, but I don't know if he just doesn't have the skill or if he's nervous (he talks very quietly all the time too), but having a good sense of humor would have been the selling point in this situation. but it just isn't there (so far as i can tell)!

But, he's so genuinely nice. And I'm so genuinely unexperienced in this type of thing and don't know what to do. 
And I hate thinking about his stupid cute face all the time!!"
24i9vy,1,2014-05-01,Best way to prepare myself for graduating college?,[deleted],AskCompSci,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCompSci/comments/24i9vy/best_way_to_prepare_myself_for_graduating_college/,"I am currently an undergrad studying computer science at a university (4-6 quarters left), and am wondering what some steps are that I should take to give myself the best opportunity to get a decent/good job out of college.

Some things I have done already: 
Have a published extended abstract (hopefully will make it into a full paper) 
Started a club with over 500 members
Am a paid research assistant for an ICSCI project
Have been doing as many projects in my spare time as possible (game making, random development, etc)

I still have a big bulk of classes to take, parallel computing, unix development, database systems, etc. so I still have a lot to learn.

I'm wondering how to get myself out there as much as possible for internships over the summer (I know the period for this summer has passed) but I just don't know where to get started, and where to apply to other than big companies where I have less of a chance.

How much of a difference does having internships make over not having any?

Please, let me know of anything that I can do to up my chances of being able to get a good/decent job after I graduate.

What kind of pages should I have? What should I have on those pages to have the best chances of getting noticed? I have a github and a linkedin but I don't think they are setup to give me the best results. Any pages/resources/etc. you can link me to would be very helpful."
24ik0b,62,2014-05-01,"I'm finally getting my mind back, and it feels great.",[deleted],intj,https://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/24ik0b/im_finally_getting_my_mind_back_and_it_feels_great/,"From December 12, 2012 to April 17, 2014 I was less than myself. There were a lot of things that piled up and began to weigh on me, including someone I know dying as well as my girlfriend cheating on me and flippantly disregarding our entire relationship. After that there were a few financial troubles, and amongst it all I learned who cared about me and who didn't.

For 491 days I woke up every morning with suicide in the back of my mind. Life went on. I shuffled forward. First was anger, then sadness. I broke things, then I spent a while crying most mornings. After that wore off, I just spent each day existing. 

I changed my number, then later my address. I deleted all traces of myself from the internet. I stopped doing well in school. I went through a few different jobs, a few of which I got fired from for being too argumentative and hostile. 

I began drinking more and spending days not talking to anyone. I ceased to think about life in terms of what was possible for me. Meeting new people, having new experiences, reaching new insights, that was no longer going to happen ever again. Once my emotions wore off there was this unbearable sort of weariness that set in, and though I knew that rationally my situation wasn't too dismal, I was no longer capable of thinking clearly. 

On April 17 at approximately 5:04 PM that changed, and a switch in my brain flipped on. I was driving down the road listening to some inconsequential song, having my inconsequential day, and I began feeling a dawning sort of awareness set in. If I wasn't an atheist, I would call it divine intervention. A voice, my own but also foreign to myself, chimed in. I thought to myself, ""Well, that's it. I was that person, and now I'm another person. It's over."" 

There was no event that sparked it. I'd spent the last month or so drunk out of my mind most nights. I often laid in my bed drinking beer until I fell asleep. Over the last two months I had drunkenly tried to connect with some girls I knew, only to be rejected by each and every one of them. This wasn't a new low, it was just another few months of my life. I'd suffered worse rejections over the past year or so, most of my attempts to connect with others made more in desperation and weakness. Because for 491 days, I felt I didn't have the personal strength to keep getting through my days alone. 

The girls smelled the desperation on me, too. Pathetic has a stench. 

I spent days drinking and walking around my apartment with the lights off. I lost friends due to petty arguments. Every little thing was cause for argument when it came to me. I'd bicker over anything and not budge an inch. My mind was fogged and cluttered with senselessness. Overloaded with banality. 

Now, on April 17 it began changing. This wasn't some unexpected cheerful song on a radio. Some unoriginal quote on a social media site. It wasn't some catharsis, and I wasn't magically happy. It was a slow wind-up, first one piston and then another, slowly at first and then rhythmically speeding up in unison and working on all of my cylinders. It wasn't happiness, it was a robotic detachment and icy sense of clarity. Emotions have no place in discipline. Leave that to the warm and fuzzy types who need their iPods tuned to the happy station so they can get their work done. This wasn't that. This was logic. 

Since then I've moved back into my head and seen what a mess the previous tenant has left behind. My body I'm viewing as some run down contraption, its parts long ago worn out. My joints pop and ache.

Little things here and there: on December 12 of 2012 I could grip a bar and do ten dead-hang pull-ups. Now, not one. I could run three miles easy. Now I had a stitch in my side after ten minutes at a brisk pace. 

I dusted off my keyboard. Rusty, can't remember a single thing on the piano. That will have to change. 

It's been two weeks since I've drank. After the switch flipped on, the desire left me. We'll see if I need to quit outright or if I'm fine with drinking every now and then. I'll have to observe myself. Right now I'm still on my training wheels. I'm currently working towards a paid internship and waking myself back up to the idea of a stable career after I graduate college. 

Arguments and conflicts, they're necessary, but they're not everywhere. Some battles are worth fighting and others aren't. I can keep silent on some issues, or stay neutral if the issue isn't important enough to spend energy on. 

It's still an uphill climb. A lot of people have moved on and forgot about me. Many of them have lost respect and affection for me, and I don't have anyone serving as my cheerleaders. But I've procured a sense of detachment I used to cherish in myself. And what's more is I feel as if I'm rebuilding myself into a better version than I was before. As if this rejuvenated mind is something that can withstand more beatings than I could before the 491 days. 

For the first time in over a year, being alone and sober doesn't feel too painful to bear. My mind feels sharp again. 

The best I can sum it up is probably this. There are other ways to struggle. Ways that are no less easy, but much more productive. 

Just thought I'd share. "
24ivxs,1,2014-05-02,I have never been this depressed in my life and the reality of it just has me demotivated. Just want to get it off my chest. Thanks,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/24ivxs/i_have_never_been_this_depressed_in_my_life_and/,"I know this is going to sound petty and a lot of people are going to tell me ""it's really not that bad, some people have it much worse!"" I really can't help feeling this way.

To preface, I've always been a doer in life. I've always been ahead of the curve to a degree, not by too much, but definitely enough to make me personally comfortable with what I was doing with life. 

But mostly, I've always wanted to have ""purpose"" in life. A reason to wake up in the morning. Running a business where my effort rewarded me, and I was building my dream, not someone else's. When I woke up and got to the office, it would be a new day filled with challenges and rewards. Where there was always change and big things going on.

But unfortunately that's not  happening, nor do I see that capacity in sight. I'm 27 years old and I make 15 dollars an hour. I hate my job. I fucking loath it. Sure, it's a fun company with good people and is actually a great company as a whole, but how my role makes me feel just kills me. I went to school for a dumb degree in retrospect, a liberal art. So right of out of college I had to take whatever job I could get in a terrible economy. It was a sales gig, and at the time I had to take it because I had no experience.

Now fast forward several years later and I""m still in sales. I fucking hate sales. The only reason I still do it is because it's the only experience I've been able to get, and I naturally excel in it so people think it's a good fit. It's not. It's redundant and obnoxious. I want a job that has growth. I want something that makes me a critical asset to a company. Something when someone asks what I can offer their company, it's more than just fucking selling shit for them. 

But that's my fucking path. I go to work everyday doing the same exact shit, while my bosses are always trying to push everyone non stop to keep performing more and more. I just make fucking calls, talk to people, convince them, and do it again. What's supposed to be the motivation? In a year I'll be a sales manager if I'm good enough? Yeah... Now I go from 15 an hour to 22! Now I get to do the same level of monetany, but now it's me motivating people every single day for the next several years until I can hopefully... Just hopefully, get another promotion where I can make 55k a year. 

I'm still going to be stuck in lower middle income. I wont have the disposable income for a while to actually afford having a large enough cushion to try something else and break me out of this cycle. And the truth is it MUST be my own venture. Again, companies aren't going to hire someone beyond entry level that just has sales experience.

And you know what really rubs it in? I have friends who I used to work with who are now making 6 figures at my age. Some who was just really incompetent (I'm not trying to be mean, just real) but lucked out via his dad and got some operations internship, which fast tracked them to middle management. Now when they decide to go to another company, and the company asks, ""What can you offer us?"" They have a huge list of experience that they can offer the company. And it's not just those in the corporate world. Just today my buddy was talking to me about how exiting it was starting his own venture with his co-founders. How exiting the whole process is of raising capital, travelling all over South America, meeting really smart people, getting great insights, and actually starting his company...

And again, here I fucking am. Stuck in this shitty fucking cycle. I feel like I've so severally failed to live up to my potential I just don't know what to do. I look around and see my friends having exiting lives, while I am forced to admit that I am likely going to have an unfilled life of mediocrity. It's just not what I envisioned for myself. It's not the life I want.

I don't care if anyone reads this, typing it out -- albeit terribly -- was enough. "
24iz39,9,2014-05-02,Reddit AMA vom 1.Mai - Zusammenfassung Übersetzung (german translation),Lumartist,elderscrollsonline,https://www.reddit.com/r/elderscrollsonline/comments/24iz39/reddit_ama_vom_1mai_zusammenfassung_übersetzung/,"Hallo zusammen,

am gestrigen Tag fand ein weiteres [Reddit AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/elderscrollsonline/comments/24h8dv/welcome_to_the_zos_aua/) mit verschiedenen Entwicklern statt, bei welchem sie diverse Fragen der Spielerschaft beantwortet haben. Der Nutzer [Dulfy](http://www.reddit.com/user/dulfy) hat daraus ein [Transcript](http://www.reddit.com/r/elderscrollsonline/comments/24hrc8/may_1_reddit_ama_qa_transcriptsummary/), bzw. eine Zusammenfassung erstellt. Auf dieser basiert die folgende deutsche Übersetzung:

**Neue Inhalte / Features**

- Es wird alle 4-6 Wochen ein Update geben, mit wöchentlichen Patches dazwischen um die aktuellen Probleme zu beheben und das Angebot zu stabilisieren.
- Diese Updates werden nicht alle die Größe von Kargstein (mit einer kompletten Zone und einer Menge anderen Zeugs) haben, aber sie werden jeweils eine Mischung aus neue Inhalten und Lösungen von Problemen, als auch Anpassungen enthalten.
- Erfolge (Achievements) werden neue Farben freischalten, wenn das Färbesystem eingeführt wird.
- Sprechblasen für den Chat werden schon bald vorgestellt.
- Die Suchfunktion für den Gildenladen kann aktuell umständlich sein, aber es gibt Pläne diese zu verbessern.
- Verkaufsstände für Gilden werden in großen Städten verfügbar sein, wobei sie von einem NPC betrieben werden. Gilden werden danach für einen Verkaufsstand bieten können, und das höchste Gebot wird dann den Zuschlag erhalten. Danach wird jeder Spieler auf den Gildenladen zugreifen können. Verkaufsstände gelten jeweils für eine Woche.
- Es wird mehr Gildenränge und Anpassungen noch in diesem Jahr geben.
- Das Rechtssystem wird Spieler betreffen, welche von NPCs stehlen, oder diese gar töten, wobei ein Kopfgeld auf den Spieler ausgesetzt wird. Wachen werden dem Spieler die Chance geben ihre Strafe zu zahlen, oder diese bei Sichtkontakt angreifen und töten, wenn das Kopfgeld zu hoch ist. Spieler können zusätzlich selbst Wachen werden.
- Die Diebesgilde und Dunkle Bruderschaft werden jeweils eigene Fertigkeitslinien haben.
- Aktuell gibt es keine Pläne für Inhalte unter Wasser.
- Zauberweben – Man kann die traditionelle Art der Elder Scrolls Magie entdecken – Anpassung, Zerstörung, usw.
- Das Guar-Reittier wird es geben, aber es gibt hierfür keinen Zeitplan.
- Weitere Infos zu den Konsolenversionen wird es in Zukunft geben.
- Housing ist durchaus angedacht, aber es soll richtig umgesetzt werden, weswegen es hierfür keinen Zeitplan gibt.
- Aktuell gibt es keinen Termin für die Gilden-Wappenröcke, aber sie kommen eher früher als später.

**Quests / Endgame**

- Die Erfolge für Quests werden mit Kargstein behoben, und sie werden Spielern rückwirkend verliehen.
- Es gibt Pläne bestehenden Zonen neue Quests hinzuzufügen.
- Die Idee alle Zonen auf VR10 anzuheben, sobald man VR10 erreicht hat ist eine interessante Idee, und wird aktuell geprüft.
- Bezüglich der Veteranen-Inhalte, dachten die Entwickler, dass es Spielern besser gefällt alle Inhalte mit einem Charakter erleben zu können, anstatt Twinks zu starten.
- Kargstein kann durchaus mit VR1 betreten werden, was aber sehr hart wird, da die Gegner VR11 und VR12 sein werden.
- Bezüglich der Updates werden diese für unterschiedliche Arten von Inhalten sein.
- Es gibt Gedankenspiele bezüglich verschiedener Regeln für bestimmte Kampagnen im PvP, als auch für einen Dungeon mit PvP-Anteil.
- Aktuell gibt es für das Anheben der VR-Stufe auf 11 und 12 neue Ausrüstung, welche hergestellt werden kann, welche aber keine zusätzlichen Skillpunkte benötigen.

**Verschiedenes**

- Es wird Änderungen bei den schweren Rüstungen geben, welche es erlauben ultimative Fertigkeiten schneller aufzuladen, wenn der Spieler defensiv spielt.
- Aktuell geht man davon aus, dass der Werwolf nicht die volle Leistung bringt. Daher wird es in Zukunft ein paar Anpassungen geben. Zeitnah werden hierzu die ultimativen Kosten für das Aktivieren der Transformation gesenkt.
- Aktuell gibt es keine Pläne die Zeit zwischen den Stufen der Vampire zu erhöhen.
- Der Fledermausschwarm für Vampire wird in der nahen Zukunft angepasst.
- Die Standarte der Macht des Drachenritters wird eventuell angepasst (nerf). Dafür gibt es keinen Termin.
- Für Patch 1.2 soll die Vielseitigkeit der Builds vorangetrieben werden, weswegen Fertigkeiten, die wenig genutzt werden entsprechend angepasst werden. Für Nachtklingen umfasst das z.B. Assassinenmacht, Pfad der Dunkelheit, oder Todesstoss, und einige mehr.
- Der Rassenstil soll bei Rüstungen mit in den Tooltip.
- Das Phasing von Gruppen ist aktuell eine der Top-Prioritäten.
- Neue Inhalte sollen als Gruppe deutlich leichter zu meistern sein.
- Eine Phase nur für Rollenspieler ist aktuell wegen der Serverleistung nicht umsetzbar, aber es wird geprüft das Ziel anders umzusetzen.
- Die Beschädigung von Ausrüstung ist aktuell in Gruppen ein wenig höher als geplant, z.B. in Dungeons, der neuen Kargstein-Zone, und den Prüfungen. Mit Patch 1.1, wird man merklich weniger Beschädigung erfahren.
- Für neue Inhalte und das Beheben von Bugs sind unterschiedliche Teams verantwortlich.
- SLI-Support sollte mit Kargstein verfügbar sein.
- Die Vollbild-Ansicht sollte ebenfalls mit Kargstein kommen.
- Sobald das Problem der Gold-Farmer behoben wurde, und die Stabilität des Servers gewährleistet ist, wird der europäische Server nach Europa transferiert. Es gibt hierzu keinen unmittelbaren Termin, aber es findet statt, wenn sich die Dinge normalisieren.
- Aktuell gibt es keine Pläne die gewonnene Erfahrung im PvE anzuheben, allerdings wird jene für das PvP geprüft.
- Für das offizielle Forum wird eine allgemeine Kategorie für Diskussionen geprüft, und es wird intern darüber diskutiert.
- Für das offizielle Forum wird zudem eine Funktion zum Ignorieren geprüft, wobei diese so schnell wie möglich verfügbar sein soll.

**PvP**

- Bessere Markierungen für Anführer im PvP sollen mit Patch 1.2 kommen.
- Das Vampir-Problem im PvP ist bekannt und es wird bereits nächste Woche Anpassungen geben:
- Ein Fehler wird behoben, bei dem mehrere Fledermausschwärme auf einem Vampir gestapelt werden konnten.
- Die Bewegungsgeschwindigkeit innerhalb der Nebelform wurde auf 30% gesenkt.
- Die Kosten für Vampirfertigkeiten je nach Vampirstufe wurden auf 7% reduziert.
- Die Geschwindigkeit innerhalb der Kampagnen ist in einigen dieser wie erwartet, und in anderen nicht. Das Problem der Bevölkerung ist bekannt und es wird in Zukunft Anpassungen geben. Das gesagt, Festungen werden eine Anhebung der Schwierigkeit erhalten, was die Rate der individuellen Eroberungen senken kann.
- In den Staaten nutzen viele Spieler die Möglichkeit der Gastkampagnen, um so an den gut bevölkerten Kampagnen teilzuhaben. In der EU im Gegenzug bleiben die Spieler meist ihrer Heimatkampagne treu. Die Zeit und Kosten um eine Kampagne zu wechseln wird täglich geprüft, um zu verhindern, dass sich diese negativ auf das Spielverhalten von Spielern auswirken.
- Im ersten Patch werden wir die Erfahrung verdoppeln, welche Spieler wert sind. Das wird genau beobachtet und es wird geprüft ob eine weitere Anpassung notwendig ist.
- Die Veteranenpunkte für Aufgaben in Cyrodiil könnten ebenfalls erhöht werden.
- Im ersten Patch wird es einen Bonus für Fraktionen mit geringer Bevölkerung geben, welcher der Fraktion mit der geringsten Bevölkerung in der Kampagne das dreifache an Punkten für besetzte Einrichtungen und Festungen gewährt, und 10 Prozent mehr Allianzpunkte. Es werden außerdem verschiedene Laufzeiten für Kampagnen geprüft, und auch Regeln die den Zugang zu Kampagnen je nach Stufe beschränken.
- Dunkle Krallen (Drachenritter) ist aktuell verbuggt und kann mehr Ziele treffen als angedacht.
- Die Elder Scrolls werden zudem so angepasst, dass Funkenschlag (Magier) durch den Träger nicht verwendet werden kann um zu entkommen.
- Aktuell gibt es keine Pläne für neue Belagerungswaffen oder neue Munitionstypen.
- Keine Pläne für Modi mit weniger Spielern im PvP, Duelle, oder Schlachtfelder. Der Fokus gilt klar Cyrodiil.
- Unendliche Ladebildschirme und das Einfrieren/Ruckeln in großen Gruppen wird geprüft."
24izmn,1,2014-05-02,Can't seem to turn off my brain and just do... Constantly worrying,tatahtoh,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/24izmn/cant_seem_to_turn_off_my_brain_and_just_do/,"Hate my current position, not have any disease, ongoing trouble or something tearing me down.

I just can't seem to get through it all. I'm not depressed or suicidal, I just don't see the point. I had a great time going out last night with some friends. Today there was some bs amongst 2 of my friends over a girl. I was temporarily amused and now I am annoyed by the entire situation.

University is easy, whatever clicks with me is easy, whatever doesn't is a hell. Aced all but one class so far, but now I have to get an internship. No clue what to do, can't postpone and deadline is coming up.

Have work, hate work, tried to set up my own stuff (quite competent just incredibly shit at pushing myself some days / weeks it goes well for a while but then suddenly everything just drops and I don't seem to be able to finish it or only if there are other people involved who I can not let down).

I can not seem to focus to make certain things happen. Just ever since I turned 18 throughout my early 20's (23 now). Its just utter shit.
But I don't know why, nothing big changed, no structural changes, no big leap in emotional state. I just gradually failed at everything I value. Which leads me to believe that my live isn't worth living because I don't enjoy it more than the hassle I go through to hopefully receive some joy in return. 

It is so much more effort to keep up and keep myself satisfied that I wonder what the point is. Everyone (including me) hop from one goal to another. I can't even seem to complete any I just hop on and get by with the minimal result but it is already so much fucking effort for me to pull that off because I feel like I have to juggle so many things at once. 

When even when I try to rationally look at my situation, I should have nothing to complain about. I pay all my bills, I 'm getting through uni with a good degree. But I guess that isnt enough for me (in my head, chemically or neurologically).

Socially a bit awkward, not that I mind. I do fine on my own ( I do have friends but I meant that I don't mind sit at home watch a series instead of going out.) But I do miss being intimate with someone.

Some days I just want it all to end, or for it all to pause... For me to get some space... Everything seems to work out, but I dont sleep any better, I don't feel any calmer nor any more content.

I do not know where to go from here, I just felt the need to vent and hopefully someone can help me out with some advice.

edit:

Reason I might be so upset or worried is because I tend to think about every aspect a lot. (Different perspectives, different choices, different outcomes and how to respond to all of this.) This means I spend a lot of time overthinking situations that may never occur but could still worry me. It also means that regardless of how much it involves me, I am investing myself into an issue whether I benefit by solving it or not.
I've grown to not care about small stuff and problems that don't involve me but still I seem to worry a lot

**TL;DR**

- No disease, sickness or anything that should make me feel so fucked up

- Friends fight over a girl, funny at first. 3 hours in Kind of annoying. (Girl is insecure, has some issues. Likes one of em alot but they re friends and now the other gave her some attention too and now he is attractive in a 'we could hook up because ur cute and I like the attention kind of way'). **short tl dr of a tldr: I hate social interaction issues because there is no logical solution where all parties are satisfied with the outcome**

- Myself not that social, don't go out too often. Have fun when I do.

- Nothing satisfies me, constantly looking for ways to feel more content.

- Problems (uni, socially, job, anything) keep stacking up and I take a lot of time analyzing and solving them. Driving myself mad over every possibility, factor or person involved

- Take on a lot of stuff as my responsibility

- Bullshit deadlines, no space to do my own stuff and when I finally make some I fail to capitalize on it and rather 'enjoy' the spare time by doing pointless stuff or worrying about why I am not doing something useful (or solve one of the many problems).

- Not been intimate with anyone for couple of years now."
24j023,4,2014-05-02,Here I am...,[deleted],loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/24j023/here_i_am/,"Hello friends (or soon to be friends).

I am starting my weight loss journey again! Let me tell you a bit about my journey thus far -

I have always been the ""chubby kid"" growing up. My siblings seemed to be able to eat whatever they wanted without gaining and there I was putting on five pounds if I had an off day. I had major depression about my weight growing up and I always used it as a mechanism to make fun of myself - better to make fun of myself first before anyone else had the opportunity, right? Wrong. When I was 16 I got my first job at a Jamba Juice where I had unlimited access to some of the sugariest smoothies available. It didn't take long for my weight to skyrocket. By the time I was 21 I hit 295 pounds and had enough, so I signed up for a gym and decided it was time for a change. I saw results instantly, five pounds here, five pounds there - before I knew it I was down forty pounds and counting! I started training harder, faster, I was finally turning into the person I wanted to be. I would hike/run 8 miles a day, sometimes twice, thus my caloric intake had to be higher. I couldn't help but boost the intake once I started running up mountains on a daily basis! Things started slowing down. Two pounds here, one pound there, but I was still losing. Last year I left for school at 245 pounds, down 50 pounds from where I started. I was comfortable in my skin, not where I wanted to be physically, but happy enough to not constantly be checking myself in the mirror, or be afraid to take a photo and worry about someone putting it on the internet for everyone to criticize. I was happy. I left for college and the freshman 15 (or in my case Junior fifteen) hit, except I lose fifteen pounds instead of gaining. It was great! I lived on campus and regularly hit the gym, my roommate was an avid racquetball player so we constantly kept each other on track. I hit 225lbs before this last winter, in total losing 70lbs to date. Winter came, I put on the usual 5 pounds I do during the holiday (I'm a sucker for Christmas cookies, what can I say?) and was ready to work it off once school started again. However with an internship lined up, a full time job, and school - I didn't work it off. It stayed with me, but I wasn't gaining because my diet had been pretty solid.

About two months ago while I was hiking I took a fall and fractured my tibia as well as sprained my knee. I haven't been able to do any physical exercise for two months and my diet has gone south. I have put on 10 more pounds bringing my weight back to 240lbs. I am disgusted with myself again and I feel like that kid who hid behind giant sweaters because he didn't want anyone to see what was hiding underneath.

Today I stumbled upon this lovely subreddit to find a community of people who want to help each other. I graduate from university in two weeks and I don't want to feel like I do today. I want to be proud of my accomplishment and feel good in my own skin again.

Some days my knee is totally fine, some days it irritates, and some days it is excruciating. I want to start exercising again but I am afraid of hurting my knee even more. 

Tomorrow is a new day and the beginning of the continuation of my weight loss journey. It is now or never, and I am not going to be the person hiding behind everyone in photographs to cover myself up any longer.

Thank you for reading this and I can't wait to start learning about you all individually. "
24j1hz,1,2014-05-02,I and the rest of our friends fucking hate who you've become,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/24j1hz/i_and_the_rest_of_our_friends_fucking_hate_who/,"What the fuck happened to you, man?
  
We used to be so close. We used to hang out all the time, talking about girls we liked, sports, our favorite bands and TV shows, smoking weed, anything and everything was on the table until you started dating her. After that, you became somebody I don't even recognize; somebody who has swallowed up my good-natured, happy, fun and social friend and turned him into an angry, dull, and bitter recluse who only interacts with his girlfriend and who only emerges from her room and interact with the rest of our friends and me on the rare occasion you decide to play 2K14.

Don't think that I don't understand the reasons behind your withdrawal from our social circle. It's not like I'm here to cast aspersions upon your affection for your girlfriend (which is obviously very real) or your decision to stop smoking weed with our friends and me (I probably need to cut down a bit myself).  

I've had girlfriends before too, dude. I sympathize with and fully understand your desire to spend quality time alone with the girl you love, but the thing you just can't seem to grasp is that a significant other is supposed to *enhance* your enjoyment of life, not manipulate you into avoiding your friends altogether and cause you to cease most of what used to be your favorite activities. You have allowed her to manipulate and mold your personality into a bitter shell of your former self who cringes at the idea of having independent thoughts so that she'll like you.

Although that stuff irks me, what really makes me genuinely scared for you is the fact that you seem to be completely ignoring the obvious fact that she has been manipulating your behavior. The last time you hung out independently with me and the rest of our friends who smoke, you didn't partake because your girlfriend didn't want you to. That's fine, I can understand that. What I can't understand is that *even while knowing you weren't partaking*, she refused to hold a conversation with you until you left the area we were in and avoided us altogether for the rest of the night. 

That is *by far* not the only thing that concerns me. The rest of my friends that are in serious relationships haven't completely changed their personalities as a result of their significant others. You seem to be the only one showing genuine affection in this relationship and it is incredibly unhealthy. If I have to watch you try to kiss or embrace her in public only to have her turn away and ignore you one more time, I may snap. If I have to hear one more time about how you'd willingly give up the high paying internship you had last summer in a hospital by your house to flip burgers at a fast food joint in the city where your girlfriend (OF SIX MONTHS) lives just so you could be close to her, I'm going to scream. If I have to hear you repeatedly ask ""What's the matter, babe? You sad?"" only to have her respond with ""Nothing. No."" one more goddamn time, I'm going to have a psychotic break.

Back when you were my friend and hadn't grown distant and cold, you told me that you hated the fact that one of our other close friends had been spending all his time with his girlfriend and completely forgotten about the rest of us, and you talked to him on multiple occasions about why you were upset. In a similar fashion, after you started dating her, you avoided the rest of us altogether. After the fifth time you told me at the last minute that you were actually going to hang out with your girlfriend after we'd specifically made plans to hang out that night, I told you that I was upset due to your fairly obvious ditching habits. You told me: ""I'm sorry, I just care about her feelings....and stuff"" and that you'd make amends and hang out with me and the rest of our friends soon, but you never did. You only grew more distant with time, and the two times I brought up the subject afterwards, you responded less and less to my concerns until your responses weren't even verbal. You'd just clam up, ignore what I'd said and walk away. The worst part is that I know this isn't just me receiving this treatment: some of our other friends have talked to you about the exact same thing (the fact that you don't hang out with us anymore) only to have it result in the same aloof treatment and your further withdrawal from a healthy social life into your girlfriend's room, never to emerge again. On the rare occasions that we do see you playing 2K14 or relaxing in the common room with her, you're distant, angry, and highly critical of everything we do and say. You just seem to sit there seething until you've had enough and proceed to retire back to her room.

Over these past few months you have readily proven to all of us that she is not only the most important person in your life, she is the *only* important person in your life. You have chosen her over your relationships with your friends. You have chosen her over your favorite activities. You have chosen her companionship over being happy. I miss the friend that I used to know and I fear above all else that he may be gone forever."
24j1l8,7,2014-05-02,next Stretch Goal; “THE WRITER COMETH” has been announced,Merketh,CamelotUnchained,https://www.reddit.com/r/CamelotUnchained/comments/24j1l8/next_stretch_goal_the_writer_cometh_has_been/,"http://camelotunchained.com/en/builders-tiers/



The Writer Cometh

Wow, two stretch goals knocked down pretty quick! As mentioned in my latest Foundational Principle (#15, here), know that I am going to be very careful with our stretch goals. Upcoming goals cannot unduly burden the CSE team, or betray the trust shown to us by our Backers.

Over the last year, I’ve written a lot of stories and lore for this world. However, because I need to focus on the game design and business side of things, my ability to keep that momentum will decrease. We need to add a full-time writer to our team.

We have fantastically exciting lore, and the writer will create even more epic stories and flavor as our universe of tales expands. He will focus on editing my stories, creating his own stories, and will become the Keeper of The Lore for this game.

We are fortunate that over the last two months we have had a published novelist intern for us: Max Porter. He’s been a great fit, and I would like to hire him full-time. This stretch goal will pay for his work for us and open up very cool things in the future.

As a bonus, if we are able to put together a novel based on the Becoming™ tales, all our current Backers will receive a free PDF of the book!

So, to sum it up, “Do it for the lore!”"
24jqnc,14,2014-05-02,"Me [21F] with my boyfriend of ten months [20M], getting over jealousy after he sexted another girl",pleathernubbins,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/24jqnc/me_21f_with_my_boyfriend_of_ten_months_20m/,"About seven weeks ago I discovered that my LDR boyfriend had been sexting another girl for about a week and a half. He'd stopped by the time I found it, though he didn't tell her to stop--he just stopped responding. She'd sent him photos of her in lingerie, her bare boobs, close up of her ass, etc. He responded by telling her he'd always thought she was gorgeous, that he wouldn't even be able to control himself if she were there, her curves were amazing, etc etc. (And it sucks because I'm not an especially curvy girl.) This is a girl he'd known back home, which is clear across the country. He told me he'd never been interested in her romantically because she's generally very selfish and immature. 

For backstory, I met my boyfriend last summer when I was in the area for an internship. He's in the military and we hit it off and decided to continue the relationship after my internship ended. For the most part, our relationship has been wonderful. Anyway, after we'd known each other for about two weeks, he showed me pictures of his childhood home on his computer when some pictures popped up of her. Two were somewhat innocent, and one was her in her bikini or something like that. He was very flustered, and told me she'd sent that to a bunch of her friends. He still says that today, so I believe him. But he obviously saved it on his computer, because his phone doesn't automatically upload photos sent to him. But that was in the past--we didn't know each other then, and he'd forgotten they were there so probably wasn't using them with any frequency. A few months later we were talking and I asked if he still had the photos. He said he wasn't sure, so I asked him to look and then delete them. I think he did (but the fact that I asked him to delete the pictures and then later they sext and somehow he didn't think it was -that- bad. Now he does, obviously.)

After finding the sexts, I was heartbroken and almost broke up with him more than once. We've steadily been working past it, and honestly I've never seen anyone as hurt or as sorry as he is, which is why I feel like if anyone deserves a second chance, it's him. I don't think he honestly saw it as cheating. He knew it was wrong, but I guess having a screen between them made it seem more innocent. He's been saying now how much he sees how important it is to put me at the center of all his decisions and how much he wants me in his life. I really do believe he's deeply in love with me, as does everyone around us. I also don't believe he would have ever physically cheated on me, and especially not after this happened. I don't think it'll happen again--we communicate so much better now and have put a huge emphasis on it, especially as I try to get over this. We also realized how much we hadn't been communicating about sexting and pictures in our own relationship--this was something I'd always wanted, but never felt attractive enough to him (which is why it especially hurt seeing him respond to her that way).

He's said that she's not even that attractive and that it was literally a response of like, ""Oh, boobs. Oh, ass. Oh, female body. I like that."" But I'm having a hard time getting over the jealousy and feeling attractive I guess. Like, sometimes I think maybe he'd prefer a different body type over mine, or hers in particular. My insecurities have just increased tenfold, and I get angry sometimes thinking how she gets to leave with an ego boost and I'm left hating my body. I know it had nothing to do with me, but I still feel ugly. My boyfriend consistently tells me now that he's infinitely more attracted to me, and that there's no other girl he's more attracted to than me. Which makes sense to me, from an emotional standpoint--I prefer his body more than anybody else's, not because he's some god, but because it's his. But I keep thinking of her, and keep thinking that he's saying these things because he knows that's what I need to hear, etc. That maybe she is prettier or he does think that and it's just her less-than-stellar personality that makes him not pursue her. 

I guess I just need help getting over the jealousy. I want her out of my head. I want to be proud of my body (and honestly, I'm really not that unattractive. But because I'm not especially curvy I feel like I'm not his ideal and I can't seem to reconcile the fact that I'm not with the fact that he can still desire me sexually or even just romantically).

I guess..just..any advice? I'm not really sure where to go from here. Every time I do get a sincere compliment from him and feel somewhat proud or sexy I'll remember how he spoke to her and doubt myself. I don't want to compare myself to her, and I know what he did has nothing to do with how attractive I am or not, and especially in relation to her. But emotions and logic don't always coincide. Any advice? :/

---   
**tl;dr**: My LDR boyfriend sexted another girl for about a week and a half. I found the texts after they'd stopped to see photos of her half-naked body. We're working through our relationship and I know he's truly, deeply sorry. I just need help getting through my new insecurities and not feeling attractive enough, despite his constant reassurances. :("

For moderate feminist talking heads it is an easy way to stay in the spotlights by uttering some statements about the problem of boys being diagnosed with ADHD and being less likely to graduate college than girls.

The suggestion now offered is that male role patterns make it difficult for men to adapt to modern society. One [Ms. Buchmann](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/29/upshot/a-link-between-fidgety-boys-and-a-sputtering-economy.html) was recorded in the New York Times as saying that ""Boys are getting the wrong message about what you need to do to be successful"". According to Ms. Buchmann, ""Traditional gender roles are misguiding boys. In today’s economy, being tough and being strong are not what leads to success.""

It does not seem to occur to Ms. Buchmann or anyone outside of sheltered upper-middle class college educated liberal circles that when forced to choose between strength and success, the vast majority of young men would rather choose for strength. If your ideal society requires of men to abandon strength and toughness, then it requires of you to eradicate masculinity and you should be forthright about the fact that you would rather grow your nation's GDP by another few percent than you would wish to preserve the dignity of its men.

Young men are not stupid. They recognize that to rise to the higher echelons of our society and stay there requires of a man to continually degrade and humiliate himself. The road to success is in our society is paved with group projects, participation grades, job interviews, silly uniforms with nametags, unpaid internships, sensitivity training and most importantly, dishonesty.

As an example, consider Jeremy Clarkson, who had to grovel before the political correctness police for supposedly mumbling the word ""nigger"" under his breath. It is clearly a dishonest apology, because no man could genuinely feel sorry for an offense so petty. He apologized to save his career. Other men see this and lose respect for someone they previously admired.

Men consider dishonesty to be an expression of weakness, and studies show that men exposed to higher testosterone become [more honest](http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/251411.php). Modern society however requires of men to be continually dishonest for them to achieve anything. Men are required to lie to customers about the quality of products. They are forced to lie at job interviews about their personality and motivations for the job. 

This is degrading to men and the entire modern workplace culture makes men feel degraded. A 19th century coal miner did not have to pretend he got the job because he likes working in a team. It was accepted that he hates his boss and his job and merely carries it out because his family depends on him. It is more dignified than the situation of modern men of whom continual dishonesty and narcissism is expected, feigning qualities on resumes that they do not have.

When young black boys die at age nineteen in shootouts over drug deals, it is not because they can not afford to go to college. Rather, it is because they consider dying in a ditch to be more dignified than stocking shelves in a supermarket while wearing a [ridiculous uniform](http://imgur.com/a/PPekc). The fact that growing numbers of young white and Asian boys now lock themselves up in their rooms and play video games is because society has changed in such a manner that there are no dignified alternatives available to them. In video games, the boys can at least feel as if they are strong, because they depend on one another's unique skills in virtual worlds. 

Society attempts to fix the confidence of young women by indoctrinating them with the message that they are all beautiful, but young men already understand themselves as being strong and tough. As an example, although my best friend can lift heavier weights, I can walk for longer consecutive periods before suffering exhaustion. Similarly every man has his own strengths. One man has strong legs, the other strong arms. One man has a high tolerance of physical pain, another man laughs in the face of overwhelming odds. One man is good at hunting, another at fishing. A society that has no place for those talents is a society that men have no desire to participate in."

My site does not leverage caching whatsoever it seems. I intend fix that.

24kjmh,1,2014-05-02,Husband. Married Six years. Wife wants to leave me. Is this a good letter to give her?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/24kjmh/husband_married_six_years_wife_wants_to_leave_me/,"**TL;DR** Love letter read request.

Ages 28M &amp; 27F. 

My wife and I have been married 6 years. We married following an accidental pregnancy. Our lives’ have been high-stress ever since we've met: planning shotgun wedding, planning an unexpected pregnancy, both of us graduating from a demanding college with a new baby, unable to find employment after graduation, me study for law school entrance exams, me enter law school for 3-years of intense study nonstop, new baby #2, us moving every summer for a different internship, me landing a top job far away from family, etc.

I have a high tolerance for stress and challenge, but these past 6 years have been relentless. Now it's over. I graduate in a few days and we move to a new city and start a normally-paced life. We'll hire a nanny and she can work if she wants, or she can go back to school for graduate work, or she can get a job, whatever she wants.

The issue is she says she's not moving with me to the new city. She says she is taking our kids and moving in with her parents. She says she has always felt that I married her just to do the right thing because of the unexpected pregnancy and I don't really love her. The thing is, I do love her. I just grew up in a family where nobody hugged and nobody said things like ""I love you,"" to each other; so when I try to say lovey stuff or make romantic gestures, I feel like a huge cheese-ball and feel dumb. That's what she wants, though. I think she interprets my lack of physical touching and my lack of loving words as disinterest, which is not how I feel.

So my idea is that maybe I can ease into things by writing her letters and poems. That way I can kind of ease in to the romantic stuff. I think if I try to say these things to her face-to-face I'll feel dumb and she'll interpret it as insincerity. I'm really certain that writing her some things is a good way to tell her how I feel.

With that in mind, I drafted the following note which I am considering giving to her. If what the note says is true, am I expressing it well and sincerely?

&gt;When a reader finishes a long, difficult, twisting novel he sometimes thinks, “There was a great fifty-page story hidden somewhere in those thousand pages.” Similarly, I think there is a great love story hidden somewhere in the past six-years of our marriage. Stress, transitions, and setbacks obscure our story and make its plot difficult to trace. I’ve let our story become so obscure that, sadly, you may now believe no such story exists. It does. I am going to tell it and I ask that you stay and listen.

&gt;Over the next few weeks I am going to write you a series of letters and poems that are my sincerest attempt to tell you our love story. What I write will be my own, not plundered from other sources. If my words are corny, style mediocre, or expressions dull, my pen has fallen short of my affection, not my affection fallen short of you.

&gt;Your husband,

24kmrg,1,2014-05-02,"help please. letter to my ex, letter will never be sent.",[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/24kmrg/help_please_letter_to_my_ex_letter_will_never_be/,"Dear x,
here are my thoughts. 

That Saturday when I came home from the dog's missed lesson and I was upset about missing the lesson, that the teacher was a bully, and then I was upset then about my job, then about our relationship?  And then I said to you something to the effect of ""maybe I don't want this relationship anymore""?  Then you said something like ""you don't need to decide this now, you just need some ""You-time"", and then you went home that night?  I think that was the beginning of the whole thing.

You went home that night (unusual for you), and then the next morning I saw that you were in touch (online) with your ex.   

You said that she had sought YOU out, but I think that YOU sought-out  HER.   You RAN straight to her in order to inflict a little spite and revenge on me.  That's what I think.  

Then, when you refused to talk about it AT ALL, you put me in the position of HAVING to make a choice.  You decided that you didn't care what I thought, you were going to let your ex send you inappropriate emails, and if I didn't like it, fuck ME.   You refused to even CONSIDER stopping contact with her even temporarily so we could talk things out.  You dug your heels in.    I've never seen you like this; it tells me that you really have serious ties to this person.

That's when I hacked into your emails FOR THE FIRST TIME IN OUR RELATIONSHIP.  Never did I do that before.  That's when I saw how duplicitous and deceitful, not to mention batshit crazy, your ""friend"" actually is.  

Was I wrong for doing this?  Absolutely.  Did I apologize for it?  Many, many times.  You didn't change your passwords immediately, either, which makes me think that there were things there that you WANTED me to see, like the fact that you have no problem flirting with your ex and encouraging her behavior -- which she keeps secret from her troubled / medicated husband.   

This whole thing reminded me of when you smoked crack with your once-patient,  even though it was a clear boundary violation because you were once his counselor;  it reminded me of when you took photos of your one patient so she could have headshots (also a mild boundary violation);  and many more incidents in general which further illustrate your lack of awareness of boundaries in general.  This is not your fault, that you have boundary issues, but by 46 years old, and being a psychotherapist intern (a nonworking one), one would conclude that you would at least notice these tendencies in yourSELF and try to solve them.   But this thing with your ex seems to illustrate that this is not the case, that you LIKE messy boundaries for some reason (obviously because they allow you to wield psychological power over those who care about you, and you feel chronically helpless to use any weapon BUT that).    And now, your boundary bullshit has hit ME square in the face.   AND THIS HAPPENED BEFORE I TOLD YOU ABOUT MY CHEATING ""CRIME"" -- so what's UP with that?  

So, in reaction / retaliation to that, I then confessed that I'd been with someone else earlier on in our relationship.   Why did I tell you?  Three reasons:  1) I wanted to get your attention, and it appeared that the only way to do it was to slap you in the face.  2), when it happened, it happened at a time when you were emotionally and physically pushing me away and I thought ""well, let's see what happens, since my current relationship isn't going anywhere""; afterwards, I realized that I'd made a big mistake, regretted it, and 3) I felt like if we didn't get a fresh start with the truth, we'd never have a real relationship again (I've been told by several counselors that I was wrong about that too.  So, I'm not too skilled in relationships, I guess we've all figured that out).  

Once I confessed that, it seemed it took you a week or two to let that register, and then you FRIGGIN SNAPPED.  You LOST it, and got as crazy or crazier than I have EVER been, telling me to fuck off, threatening me with the police, actually calling them on 3 separate occasions (maybe 4), threatening me with restraining orders, and threatening to file lawsuits against me for destruction of your property.  I was never more FLOORED to see you act this way.   That's when I had my locks changed; I became afraid of you.  

Later, when things calmed down, you texted me some nice things about how you feel about me.  I did the same.  

Then a few days later, we spun out again.  Police again, I blocked your phone number again, you called a go-between to contact me regarding your things.    

I relented and unblocked you, saying I wouldn't throw out your stuff as I didn't want to risk you filing a lawsuit against me, and that I didn't care anymore when or if you got your things, that I couldn't let your possessions keep me from doing what I need to do for myself.  

Things have cooled down, texts have been less hostile, and less frequent.   I apologized to you, told you that I loved you and missed you, told you that I wanted to work things out if it was possible, but that at the moment I couldn't get over the thing with your ex.   

It's still difficult.  You wanted to talk, I told you I couldn't get over the thing with your ex, and at the moment I still cant.   

I see on your facebook page that you talk to your ex in ways that encourage her to stay in contact with you, and that you talk to people about hot girls or hot pics of girls, whatever.  I guess you're ready to move on. 

You tell me its difficult for you but you could stop all of this right now, just by dealing with the thing with your ex and showing me that you are willing to make a ""sacrifice"" at least temporarily, in the name of fixing things between us.   But you simply will not do it.  We can't even talk about it without you calling me a bitch, telling me to fuck off, screaming at me, hanging up on me, and calling the police repeatedly.  

My thoughts now are that if you really wanted to talk to me, you'd just do it.  But you don't.    So, what am I to conclude??


Tomorrow is your birthday.  I can't help thinking about how when we first met, it was also almost your birthday.  Are we to end on exactly a 5-year trajectory, right near your birthday, each time???  Am I to disappear from your life, are you to disappear from mine, just as quickly as you came into it?    Did we meet just so we could hold onto eachother like we were eachother's rebound-liferafts for awhile?  Is that all we were to eachother?

Five years.  Now what?  Is this what you want, ultimately?  To be away from me, to be chronically busy, so that you don't have to deal with your feelings, ever?  Then what?  

Your birthday is tomorrow.  I don't know what to do. 


I don't want to let you go, but it appears that I have no other choice.  You won't talk, you won't contact me.  I CANT contact you. 


Is this it?

24ku63,1,2014-05-02,[Academic] Master's vs. PhD programs without an official Geology B.S. - what are my chances?,[deleted],geologycareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/geologycareers/comments/24ku63/academic_masters_vs_phd_programs_without_an/,"Hello. I am a girl who, at a young age, repressed her math skills and inclination toward the sciences by going to liberal arts school and studying subjective/social things. This certainly helped me develop certain cognitive skills, for better or for worse. Since moving to the west coast, I have embraced the earth sciences more and have been pursuing an academic path that is fully geology-oriented.

I am considering applying for graduate programs that begin fall 2015, but really have no clue if I stand a chance of being offered admission. Would be incredibly grateful to anyone that can take the time to hear me out and offer their wisdom. 

In return, I can offer dogecoin, personalized comics, um, beer if you live in the Bay Area, eternal gratitude, etc.

Anyways, here's what I've got...

**Academic history:**
* BA (2010) from a top school in American Studies &amp; Environmental Studies, with minimal upper-level enviro courses (those liberal arts schools really let you get away with a lot as far as major requirements go). Did an ecology field camp when studying abroad. 
* GIS mentorship after graduation in an archaeological field camp in Serbia (got a grant)
* a whole lot of undergraduate credits from a city college over the past few years which include
    * completion of a GIS certificate program
    * 17 credits of earth science/geo courses including labs, A's in all of 'em 
    * one year of calc
    * one year of physics w/ lab
    * one semester of chem w/ lab
* good GPA at all schools, though my calc and chem grades are less than stellar :/
* good GRE scores
* have NOT taken what seem to be the upper-level geology requirements for undergrads (sedimentology, petrology, mineralogy)
* zero published papers but plenty of writing samples (including scientific)

As soon as this semester's finals are over, I was planning on reaching out to faculty/researchers about their work; I am hoping to apply to grad school this winter.

However, a recent conversation with a Stanford researcher whom I met while doing fieldwork has got me doubting everything. He gave me the impression that PhD students almost always have received their Bachelor's degree in the same field. Now I fear that if I apply to PhD geology programs, the committee will take one look at my application and laugh. 

I don't know what to do! Not eligible for financial aid for those upper-level undergrad courses because I already have a degree. Feel like I have done everything that I can.

Will I prove myself worthy? What steps should I take? Should I suck it up and just apply for a Master's instead, and will that put me in debt? Can I even get into a Master's geology program with my background? Should I try find a grad program that specifically embraces science-loving, post-liberal arts identity crisis-having, cliched snowflakes like myself? Help!

24kvcy,2,2014-05-02,[Academic] Master's vs. PhD programs without an official Geology B.S. - what are my chances?,[deleted],geologycareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/geologycareers/comments/24kvcy/academic_masters_vs_phd_programs_without_an/,"Hello. I am a person who, at a young age, repressed her math skills and inclination toward the sciences by going to liberal arts school and studying more subjective matters and social histories. This certainly helped me develop a specific set of cognitive/analytical skills, for better or for worse. Since moving to the west coast, I have embraced the earth sciences much more, grown passionate for geology, and have been pursuing an academic path that is fully geoscience oriented.

I am considering applying for graduate programs that begin fall 2015, but really have no clue if I stand a chance of being offered admission. Would be incredibly grateful to anyone that can take the time to hear me out and offer their wisdom/advice. 

In return, I can offer dogecoin, personalized comics, um, beer if you live in the Bay Area, eternal gratitude, etc.

Anyways, here's what I've got...

**Academic history:**

* BA (2010) from a top school in American Studies &amp; Environmental Studies, with minimal upper-level enviro courses (those liberal arts schools really let you get away with a lot as far as major requirements go). Did an ecology field camp when studying abroad. 
* GIS mentorship after graduation in an archaeological field camp in Serbia (got a grant)
* a whole lot of undergraduate credits from a city college over the past few years which include
   * completion of a GIS certificate program
   * 17 credits of earth science/geo courses including labs, A's in all of 'em 
   * one year of calc
   * one year of physics w/ lab
   * one semester of chem w/ lab
* good GPA at all schools, though my calc and chem grades are less than stellar :/
* good GRE scores
* have NOT taken what seem to be the upper-level geology requirements for undergrads (sedimentology, petrology, mineralogy)
* zero published papers but plenty of writing samples (including scientific)

**Non-academic:**

* current internship with NPS geologist studying mineral resources in park, includes GIS work and fieldwork

I'm selling a lot of year-old furniture that needs to leave ASAP. I'm also going to post on Craigslist but obviously I'll give a better price to Reddit people. Here's a rough list of what has to go:


A tall square dining table,


A coffee table,


A couch,

A bed frame / mattress,


And two cheap ass target lamps.

Message me if you're at all interested, I'll send pics and we could negotiate prices. Everything's less than a year old, as I bought it all new last fall.

Also, if you want to move into a beautiful 2/2 on Archer and 34th (Stoneridge), I'm subleasing my apartment. I currently live here alone and use the extra bedroom as an office; you get a lot of bang for your buck! Rent is 725/mo, plus utilities Let me know if you're at all interested and I'll give you details. Ideally, I'd like to sublease it before the end of May.

If you want to sublease with all the furniture, I'll sell the furniture really cheaply. I'm really trying to get rid of this place/my stuff, as I secured an internship down south. 


Thanks r/GNV! "

So I'm graduating in about a month, and I just got an official job offer: I'll be starting in an agency mailroom (one of the majors) in the fall. 

I'm really pumped to get in there and learn about the industry at the ground level. I know what to expect as far as work environment goes (I did an internship there last summer) but I was hoping to get some advice from you all. 

If you're a signed writer who's spent some time in an agency, a mailroom person/alum, or anybody who knows what it's like working in a similar environment.... how do I make the most of the experience as an aspiring writer?

Repped writers, what is your relationship with agency assistants?

The ultimate goal is to work the desk for an agent repping an up-and-coming writer I respect, and sign on as that writer's assistant, and hopefully start a writing career that way... I'm sure there will be other possible routes to take though... any advice on that front?

I don't want to get fired for sneaking my scripts into an agent's mailbox, but I figure there might be a chance to get read by somebody while I'm there. Hints on how to play this kind of relationship?

Any other general advice/tips would be much appreciated. 

Thanks for reading!"

24lmz9,3,2014-05-03,[Different] [NSFW] .. Someone explain my life to me,[deleted],confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/24lmz9/different_nsfw_someone_explain_my_life_to_me/,"tough love.

I've been in a relationship for almost 2 years with a Chinese woman 7 years older than me.

We met when I was doing a year long internship before I finished the final year of my university which I'm currently doing. We met in London while I was working at a prestigious company and we spent a lot of time together soon after we met, and ended up moving in together fast.

She was emotionally unstable and manipulative and I realised this straight away, but stayed with her, I convince myself out-manipulating eachother is part of a game we each play with eachother knowingly - not all the time, far from it, but sometimes.

She had problems with her visa to stay in England and this caused a lot of problems, we had a lot of fights as she didn't feel enough commitment from me and I, to be honest, was unsure of my intentions with her, and as she's older she wants commitment.

Anyway, long story short, we stay with eachother for almost 2 years and then she has to go to China. I make the decision to go and stay with her after i graduate.

Strange things in our relationship - she was obsessive about me cheating on her constantly, she would always check my phone, work phone - but this is common for Chinese girls and question me constantly - this was our biggest and main problem and made us fight.

After about 6 months of this getting worse, as i traveled for work during that time, i cheated on her with a transexual prostitute.

She found out, as she was able to re-dial the last number on my phone and googled the number.
She confronted me and we broke up for about a 2 weeks as i moved back to my parents - she never mentioned it was a transexual, even though she confronted me with the ts' blog and told me she showed one of her friends. - My gf knows I only got a blowjob, she asked if i licked the hookers pussy (I said no, even though i really sucked the TS' cock), but i don't know if she was provoking me to come clean or was genuinely curious - given that her English isnt native level and the ts' was passable and didn't show a cock and only had the word 'TS' mid-paragraph it would be difficult to know.

I travelled to go and see her and apologised and we got back together.. things were good for a few months, around 4, then things got worse.

I ended up moving out, and she came to visit me at my parents asking me to come back, I ended up getting my own place in London again - while I was alone i posted endlessly on CL and browsed it - i wanted a hung guy to suck. never found any partners, but i paid £20 to stroke a guys cock. i didnt want to have to commit to doing anything to a real person. i chose the guy because the pic was like 8.5""x6 big.... it was fake, his cock was shorter than mine but at least 50% fatter..

While we are apart my gf was begging me to be together but i said no, and she started going out to clubs - she claims to make me jealous, but i thought she was meeting guys, she sent me some pics with guys at the club, but made sure to always take pictures returning to her friends house after the club.
During this time - as my girlfriend had told me i have a small cock when we get in arguments (despite her telling me its long other times, i take that to mean a thin cock as i am above average in length and below in girth), i developed a fetish of being cuckolded.. and masturbated thinking of her fucking guys in her pictures (only 2 pics)... this led me to discover the hotwife community on reddit, which i then checked endlessly.
My girlfriend keeps asking me to move back together and I said no, although we ended up spending a lot of time together and she moved to my new place with me - we still had seperate places. Then when my lease was up (short term) i moved back with her for 3 weeks before i returned to uni...

Some reasons Im pretty sure she cheated on me to some degree - when we first got back together she stood on her tip toes to kiss me - she never used to do that as she doesnt need to.. and one of the times we had sex she wrapped her hand around my cock.. seemingly measuring its thickness.
but my thought process was that i cheated on her first, so she was allowed one in return - i've asked her this and she denied it.

When i went back to uni we went through a lot of indecision of whether or not to stay together... again.. she went out to clubs a few times. Again. I had the same thoughts of her cheating on me and was turned on (a mixture of rage/sadness/horny). I don't know what her intentions were of going to clubs - she claims to dance, and her and her nerdy friends do like to dance. But part of me is suspicious.

Anyway, after a month of me being at uni her work contract runs out (visa issues) and she asks to move in with me, i say yes, (i should say she's financially dependent) and we move in together again.
Again, things go great, then go terrible, due to the fact i had to do group work with other women and one of them, who admittedly I liked and she liked me invited me to her house for coffee.


we argue about this a lot, as i had a running project with the woman.
Around Christmas time with things flipping between great and shitty, I have been continuing to browse reddit's hotwife forum and eventually made a post one night when i couldn't sleep - responding to a guy about sharing his fantasy of someone fucking his wife and that I was nearby and would be able to help him out. I did not message the guy because I was really willing, it was the first time i messaged anyone and just fantasy.
My girlfriend saw the message when we were at my parents house staying for christmas... again.. we broke up.... again, she confronts me, talks about the pic on the site with a woman being taken by two guys - says its disgusting, accuses me of wanting to fuck other women.

Heart in hand I tell her the truth, because my family was asleep downstairs and i didnt want her to tell them, that i fantasize about her having sex with other guys, she doesnt believe me, we talk for a few hours, and eventually leaves apologising to my family that we have to break up.

She goes to stay with friends while I stay at my parents, I rejoin her on new days eve and we spend the new year together, i apologise, we agree to try to make things work out for the next few months as she leaves the country soon and we go back to my uni house together. Before we go back together, we have some serious arguements and she says hurtful things - during which time i stopped seeing her and then she came to me to beg me to come back- such as, she shouldn't be with me because i'm poor (she's rich, im not white (Chinese girls worship white guys), im not tall, not funny, have a small cock, she never mentions that im socially awkward though I am.
We talked once about my cuckold fetish very briefly and she said i spend too much time on the internet and don't spend enough time in reality. she didnt seem to give it much consideration, but she went to London a few more times and went to clubs, again, she says to dance (again, she went with some of her nerdy friends) - she didnt have a job and frequently got bored at home as I was busy studying a lot. Again, this turned me on a lot though I never told her - i never told her the full truth - that i want a hung guy to fuck her, because i think it would make her not respect me - she treats me like shit sometimes, but i feel she still respects me)

Another time during sex she asks me if i think have a big cock, i avoid the question by saying its the only one ive ever had so i don't know if its big or not, or average, or say it doesnt matter i cant change it.... once when she asked she said she had once been with a guy this thick.. and put her hand around her wrist... at the time i wasn't super-excited, but i have thought about it many times since... we didnt really talk too much as we were mid-fuck.
The past few months we spend a lot of time together and its good, she then leaves the country and i'm due to visit her at the end of march and stay with her in China - i'm happy to relocate there - or at least see how things go.
We have a very good sex life, she cums 99% of the time and we have sex 5-7 times a week, she offers blowjobs, she cooks, share bills etc.
Since she left I was with a trans girl with a hugely thick cock once."
24lw2j,4,2014-05-03,Me [26F] is concerned with mother-in-law's [43F] and sister-in-law [8F] living situation. They may be without a place to live.,helpwiththeinlaws,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/24lw2j/me_26f_is_concerned_with_motherinlaws_43f_and/,"This will a long post and I sincerely apologize but please bear with me. I have also given fake names for everyone involved as the post is too complicated to read with just age and genders. I [26F] and my SO [26M] have been together for almost ten years. We are getting married later this year, so it’s not like I don’t know my in-laws. I have known them since I was seventeen. I love all of them very much. However, his family situation has always been complicated and tumultuous. Please allow me to explain the general background to his behavior and then explain the problem at hand. 

My SO (Jason) has always been somewhat detached and aloof from his family. His parents divorced when he was a small child. It was not an amicable separation and his mother (Gloria) and father (Joe) had very limited contact with each other despite sharing custody of my SO and his sister (Michelle) who is now 23. For the most part Jason and Michelle lived with their mother. They were very poor, and I am inclined to think that his mother had many rough (possibly wayward) years. I remember once that Jason said he never really thought of Gloria as a “parental figure”. Likewise, as a teenager Jason also had a strained relationship with his father who lives out of state. All this culminated with Jason moving out of his mother’s house just a few days after he turned 17.  From then on Jason lived with a relative until he went to college, and would stay at this relative’s house or at my house during the summer breaks. As soon as he was ‘on his own’ so to speak Jason’s relationships with both his parents improved greatly, BUT even though his family has always been a part of our lives, and us in theirs contact has been mainly focused on short visits and holiday interactions. Like I said, Jason prefers to remain somewhat distanced. He is very insular in regards to this distance, and has said repeatedly that only the “three of us” (meaning him, me, and our son [1yr]) is what truly matters to him. 

So Jason also has another sister. His baby sister Emma (now 8) was born after he moved out of his mother’s house. Since Jason had moved out, it was just Gloria, Michelle, and baby Emma. This was a difficult time for the three of them. Gloria had to rely on Michelle for childcare help so that she could work and support her daughters. (Emma’s father was not in the picture at this point, and generally remains uninvolved in their lives). Gloria has chronic back pain, as she was in an accident when she was younger, and through the years her health has noticeably declined. This has made it extremely difficult for her to maintain steady employment. The situation became more complicated when Michelle had a baby right out of high school, and her boyfriend Mike moved in with them. Michelle and Mike’s son (Jacob) is now 4 years old. 

This is the problem. The relationship between SO’s mother Gloria [43F] and his sister Michelle [23F] has turned to shit. This is what is going on. After Michelle’s and Mike’s relationship fell apart (Mike was often drunk and abusive towards Michelle) Gloria  stayed home to take care of the children (Emma and Jacob) while Michelle worked and attended university. However, both women are absolutely terrible at managing money. When I say absolutely terrible I mean it. Both women ended up maxing out Michelle’s credit cards of which she had many. After Mike left, Michelle also had a very wild phase. She went out partying and clubbing, ignored her son, and started becoming increasingly hostile towards Gloria. Then Michelle found religion, started attending church, and focused more on school. 

However, Michelle’s attitude towards Gloria is simply horrible. Every time Jason and I are around his family, it is so hurtful to see Michelle’s thinly veiled contempt for her mother. I know they have issues, but I have not heard Michelle speak to her mother in a civil tone in ages. Plus, Gloria is basically a slave to Michelle’s childcare needs. Gloria spends so much time with Jacob that he calls Gloria “Nana-Momma”.  Recently Gloria has had some serious health issues, and all Michelle can do is complain about how it’s such an inconvenience. That being said, things have recently come to a head. 

Michelle is leaving for a summer internship in a few weeks. She has refused to let Gloria keep Jacob for the duration of her time away. At first Michelle said that she was going to leave Jacob with this couple from her church. Yeah, she is friends with them, but they are essentially strangers. Michelle was then dissuaded from doing this. Then Mike came back into the picture. (He had been absent for the past two years, with only a few phone calls to his son in that time.) Anyway, Mike has temporarily moved back in with them, even though he and Michelle are ‘not together’.  Gloria recently confided that Michelle and Mike have been fighting, and it’s gotten physical. Gloria is scared of Mike and sleeps with a knife under her pillow. So then instead Michelle has said that Mike will keep Jacob for the summer. NO ONE in our family thinks this is a good idea because there is a very likely chance that Mike will take off with Jacob and take him abroad. Finally, Michelle has terminated the lease on their apartment, saying that Gloria and Emma have two weeks to find a place to live. Essentially my mother-in-law and 8 year old sister-in-law will be homeless! When I asked Gloria what she was going to do, she said that she has applied for housing assistance in two nearby communities, and if that falls through she and Emma will stay in a Motel. (The last one seems improbable since Gloria has no source of income). 

For the past several weeks, Gloria has been calling to speak to Jason, but because of Jason’s work schedule he is usually not home. I have told him to please call his mother, but he has yet to do so. He is avoiding it. I believe he is simply exasperated with all the drama that’s been going on over the last several years. After I learned about everything that has been recently going on, I immediately told Jason everything. I urged him to try to help his family in some way. First, he said that he no longer wishes to have any real relationship with his sister Michelle. He has basically said that she is being extremely selfish, and is alienating those who would help her. He considers her a bad mother to Jacob, and that if Mike takes Jacob out of the country because of Michelle’s bad decisions, then he is completely disowning her as a sister. In regards to his mother, Jason remains at a loss. I suggested that maybe Gloria and Emma could stay with us for a little while. Jason was not keen on this idea. We live in a very tiny 2 bedroom rental and there is very little room for Jason, myself and our son. Jason also voiced concern that his mother and his baby sister would end up staying with us “permanently”. He went on to add that if they did indeed stay with us, he would have to sit down with his mother and have an earnest talk, being very clear in expectations. Likewise, we are living on a single income. (Jason is currently working, and I am currently a grad student/stay-at-home-mom) What money we do have is the result of frugal living. Right away Jason said we would not be providing any monetary support. At first I disagreed but then conceded, given Gloria’s history with money. He knows his mother better than I do. We have not revisited this discussion, even though it’s been several days. 

I feel awful as there isn’t much that either Jason or I can do to help. I do love Gloria and Emma very much. At 17 Jason and I were just kids when we starting dating. Gloria has always made me feel welcome in her family. I cannot say the same of my family in regards to Jason. Even though she has a checkered past, Gloria fiercely loves her children and owns up to her mistakes.  

Is it wrong to not offer to let Gloria and Emma stay with us? I feel so incredibly bad about it, but Jason has valid concerns about them overextending our resources. I keep trying to tell Jason that I am concerned for his mother’s mental health as well as her physical health. She is so depressed about the whole situation, and has a history with painkillers. I also suggested that maybe Emma could stay with us for the remainder of the school year so that she wouldn’t have to switch schools. As far as Jacob is concerned I have no earthly idea what to do. I feel so badly for him. He is such a bright and caring child and soon he will be without his primary caretaker, his mother, and his “sister” as he calls Emma--to be put in the hands of a man he barely even knows. Finally, I know that right now Jason is incredibly upset with Michelle; however, her life hasn’t been easy. She is a vivacious and high-spirited young woman with very big dreams, but she has a lot of unresolved issues. Plus, it’s not easy to break out of an abusive relationship. She is also selfish, and bitter, and I agree with Jason that she isn’t necessarily a good mom, but she is also very much a child, and in so many ways she is so naïve. Very soon her decisions are going to catch up with her. I feel awful about questioning Jason’s wishes in severing a relationship with his sister because it makes him feel guilty and callous.  What to do? Any advice on this mess is greatly appreciated. Are there any resources or organizations that I can look into to help out Gloria and Emma? 

TL;DR--Basically I want to know how to help my SO’s mother [43F], and little sister [8F] who may be homeless in a few weeks.

When I got into the third week of my streak I started having trouble sleeping. Most of the time I would just lay in my bed, being half awake. This started taking a toll on me.

I'm not mad at myself for relapsing. I didn't relapse in a bad way, it was fast without any pron. I've also gone an enormous way out of my comfort zone (going to the gym, new job, internship, cold showers) this time. I guess my willpower had to be at a low point sometime. 

I'm still a bit lost in how I'm going to improve myself this time. I will at least keep up on my new healthy habits and maybe try to approach some girls some time. I will also try to go out of my comfort zone ever further, by aiming for a month (and beyond).

Well this was it. I don't really have an advice for you fapstronauts on how to prevent this. I guess I was just worn out by all the effort it took, and now I can restart without the pressure on me."

I'm writing this here because well, it's tough to say but plain and simple I feel too ashamed to let anyone close to me know the details of my last relationship. I dated a girl for quite some time, lets call her Lisa. and that ended 2 years ago, and it's not like I want her back but more of the fact how amazed I am at how people can be. We started dating our Senior years and it was always something that we wanted to happen. Years prior we always knew we enjoyed eachothers company but me being me I never wanted to ask her out because I was already anticipating the no, and she had a family friend who she was really fond of(I'm talking they were friends in diapers, had sleepovers as kids,  you get the point) in our grade also he's Jeff, he'll be important later. It was like the cliche' movie setting, I finally grew a pair and asked Lisa to prom, had a great night and the coming weeks we spent an insane amount of time together. I had finally asked her to become my girlfriend it finally happened, we were together and it seemed like everything was falling into place. We both graduated and attended community college, (I'm still here I swear this place is like vortex from transfer lol.) and now that I look at it, that first semester seemed so great because we were essentially playing house. Study in the library, grab lunch, my house/her house, don't leave until late sometimes sleeping over. The whole first year of the relationship was something I had imagined time and time again back in high school. I was getting good grades, see I never really focused on school in high school(due to personal/family problems), and when I graduated I told myself high school wasn't going to define who I was so when I started college I faked it hard but it paid off with the grades and time with Lisa; I felt like I had it all figured out. A year and a half in I noticed she was texting a guy from class a lot, let's call him Vince, and at first I just assumed it was for the homework but the way she sounded whenever he called, I knew something wasn't right. Eventually it got to the point where I would meet up with her after I got out of class and during small talk just asking how her day was going she would mention she was just with the guy at the cafe. That's when she started making excuses, Lisa all of a sudden stopped being there for me, I would call her and she wouldn't answer, sometimes she would answer and I would be convinced that I heard Vince in the back. We argued about him and she swore to never be alone with him ever because she didn't want to ruin our relationship. Fast forward to two years in, things were actually okay again, Lisa started singing and I would drop her off at her vocal lessons since at this point we carpooled everywhere. See this had been my longest relationship and with how things were going at school and the job I had gained through an internship, it was easy to feel grown up. Couple weeks after we hit the 2 Year mark, I got a call and voice mail from who turned out to be Vince(got my cell through facebook), confronting me saying that he and Lisa had been talking for the last 6 months and that me being her ex, I should just back off. Her ex, I had been dating her for 2 years, how was I her ex? She wouldn't cheat would she? She wouldn't lie right in my face would she? I more I listened to the messaged I was outraged, I couldn't recited the details but all of it was throwing me into a loop. I confronted Lisa and she denies what Vince had left me in the message, from then on we watched each other with keen eyes. Things changed I wasn't sure if Lisa was a cheat or if Vince was just a guy infatuated with a taken girl. Now, during the span of dating Lisa I had become friends with her best friend Joann, and to this day I'm still friends with her because of marriages in our family. Joann became the mediator between us both when things changed and I'm thankful that she never had a biased opinion when trying to help us out. After the voicemail we never recovered, the arguing never stopped it was like we kept each other around to see who would fold first. And it drove us insane, and everyone could see it in our eyes, hear it in our voices. During this time we started finding comfort in other place, I buried myself in classes and well, remember Jeff? He makes a return. Jeff joined the Navy and had gotten stationed back home, during the time of accusation and arguing Lisa could not have been happier. Time passes and Lisa and I break up. I couldn't tell you exactly how it built up to it but we just broke up, I couldn't take it anymore and I don't know if you're suppose to pre determine this thing but one day when I was sitting in the evening thinking, I just told myself I didn't want to be with her anymore. So the next morning I asked her to talk and I told her it was over. It was a lot to take in, but I got through it thanks to Joann. Not long after we broke up she started dating Jeff and who could blame em? They were really good childhood friends, if anything he was exactly who she needed with all the craziness in the air. A couple months go by and I haven't seen Lisa around anywhere, she stopped going to school and started working full time. Joann who at this point is my family because of said marriages, we started hanging out a lot on Sundays(church, bbq's, family time). We were hanging out in the backyard one Sunday and me and Joann had a few beers. The topic of Lisa came up when Joann asked how I was holding up, I on the other hand wanted to know every dirty detail Lisa never told me. And well the girl was a dirty cheat, remember we got together couple weeks after Prom. Joann explained how after graduating high school Lisa fucked Jeff before he went off to boot camp, but she stayed with me because she knew we'd both be at the same college. That Vince guy? Well turns out he wasn't lying either, Lisa told him we had broken up but the reason why we spent so much time together was because we were too comfortable. She fucked him too, more than once. I spent a lot of time after the break up feeling bad for myself but all of a sudden, I was relieved, sure I got cheated on more than once but in my Sunday buzz it hit me. Jeff had been parading Lisa since he got back from overseas but he I doubt he knew the details, who know what story he had been told by Lisa, I wonder if he knows about Vince? Joann never told me any of this back then because she was Lisa's friend first, and to be honest I respect that, it's actually because of this that we get along so well, her loyalty to her friend stayed even though she didn't quite agree with the actions. And now that we're friends I know that I have that I have a great friend by my side now, the two haven't hung out since Lisa got with her new guy. And that was what went down, nowadays I focus primarily on my school work. This story is something that I never told friends, family, or therapist, but I suppose you could say Joann know's the story by association. I'm 21 now and as much as I don't want to say it, Lisa was a big part of my life, it sucks that a girl like that was a big part of my life, but in the grand scheme of things, I learned a lot from her. It's no point now to try and call her out personally on these things because quite frankly it's no use. The only thing I could do now is focus on my maths and hope the future will be bright. I appreciate whoever took the time to read this monster I honestly feel like I needed to let this out somewhere and putting it in words was the best choice for me due to the fact that I still don't like talking to my friends and family about the things that have hurt me because I want to show them I can be strong on my own two feet. Have a great day everyone. "
24m60s,1,2014-05-03,"Me [26 M] with my fiancee [23 F] for 2.5 years, long distance troubles and worried it could cost us our relationship",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/24m60s/me_26_m_with_my_fiancee_23_f_for_25_years_long/,"I have been with my fiancee for two and a half years now. Last August we decided she was to take a job that was 700 miles away from me. I had to complete a yearlong internship (which just ended) back home so the plan was for her to move away and I would find a job where she is when my internship was ended.

Over the course of the last 8 months, she visited home twice (once for Christmas break, she's a teacher) and I have visited her 5 times. Now, despite the distance, we got engaged this past February. I drove down and proposed to her. It was something that we had been talking about doing (and wanting to do) for a while now and so we did it. Awesome right?

Well, right after the engagement, we had to go two months apart; the longest we'd ever gone without seeing each other. It was hard and I personally did okay with it (a minor bit of sadness here and there but fine nonetheless) but when I visited her in early April, she essentially said she wasn't sure if she still wanted to marry me. I'm sure I don't have to tell you guys that was a very difficult thing to hear.

We talked all of our issues out at that time and we mostly widdled it down to the stress of her job (first year teacher in a very crappy school district) and my internship (a teaching one) that were weighing on both of us. The fact that were live 700 miles apart and could not be there for one another is tough when going through stress and it may disguise itself as other issues in the relationship.

During our talk at the beginning of April, it was revealed that a guy in her group of friends down there had kissed her at the bar one night. She told me that she immediately pulled away and didn't talk to him for a while since (yay for me?) My fiancee is a very outgoing person who draws people to her because she is so likable, so it was no surprise that this guy wanted to kiss her (I can't blame him!) I was not mad at her at all and we even ended up going to the bar with the group of friends that included him. I was nice to him the whole time, not giving a hint I knew because I didn't think it was an issue.

Fast-forward to this past week when I visited. It is clear that she doesn't feel *right* about our relationship at the moment. It seems like it's hard for us to communicate when we're in person. Sometimes even thinking about what to say, which is clearly not something we are used to with one another. I keep assuring her that the distance is what's making it so hard. I'm going back down there in June when her school year ends and we are driving home together. I then move in with her in July.

She agrees about the distance and the stress-factor but she also told me how she still finds herself drawn to this guy whenever they all go out. She told me that seemingly no matter what, she ends up talking more with him than with anyone else in the group. She has assured me that it's not a romantic thing but that she just misses the companionship that I usually give her (but obviously cannot right now). This wouldn't worry me so much if this guy hadn't already kissed her, despite knowing she was engaged. I trust her 100% so I have no reason to doubt her, but I just don't feel particularly good about the situation.

So I just really wanted to vent a bit and see if you all have any advice. It's been a very difficult year because of the distance and I really don't want to lose her. I love her more than anything and know that once we can finally be together full-time that it will all be okay. How can I assure myself that I am right about this and that she just hasn't changed her mind about us? I really would take any advice on this because as you can see, it's a pretty tough scenario.

---   
**tl;dr**: Fiancee and I have had to spend this year 700 miles apart despite being inseparable beforehand. She doesn't feel *right* with our relationship right now but I think its about the stress of her job and the distance moreso than us changing. Also there's a guy in the mix who she swears is no threat to us. How can I assure myself that I am right about this and that she just hasn't fallen out of love with me?"

Since then I've been living in Austin, I've held down two steady jobs and make about 1500 a month. Unfortunately I'm forced to live in the most expensive part of town because I have no car, and I need to be close to work. 

Despite this I've saved enough to go to community college this semester. I have an internship lined up in the industry too at the company I work at that will support me during the school year.

The issue is that I can't work half time and go to school if I have to use public transit. There are also a lot of job opportunities that I miss out on since they aren't close to the center of town. If I move to a more peripheral location, with less public transit, it would save me about 300$ a month. 

To remedy this I wanted to lease a Smart car. I enjoy driving them, I've rented them many times and they are pretty perfect for Austin.

If I lease it directly from the dealer it would cost 139 a month but they denied me due to my lack of credit experience. 

I wanted to take over someone's lease with a lease trading site. I have enough money socked away that I could pay the remaining amount of the lease for some of the cars as one payment today and still have enough for school. Is that feasible or would my credit history still be important? 

Does anyone have any experience with trading leases? 

I have no one who will cosign, parents pretty much disowned me when I left. "

I posted to /r/GNV and they redirected me here.  I'm selling a lot of year-old furniture that needs to leave ASAP. I'm also going to post on Craigslist but obviously I'll give a better price to Reddit people. Here's a rough list of what has to go:

A tall square dining table,

A coffee table,

A couch,

A bed frame / mattress,

And two cheap ass target lamps.

Message me if you're at all interested, I'll send pics and we could negotiate prices. Everything's less than a year old, as I bought it all new last fall.

Also, if you want to move into a beautiful 2/2 on Archer and 34th (Stoneridge), I'm subleasing my apartment. I currently live here alone and use the extra bedroom as an office; you get a lot of bang for your buck! Rent is 725/mo, plus utilities Let me know if you're at all interested and I'll give you details. Ideally, I'd like to sublease it before the end of May.

If you want to sublease with all the furniture, I'll sell the furniture really cheaply. I'm really trying to get rid of this place/my stuff, as I secured an internship down south.

Thanks r/GNV!

The positive response to the first installment and the many requests for it to become a weekly feature inspired me to continue and flesh out the cosmology of this world. This is part 2, and puts a lot of pieces in place for what will probably end up being a 5- or 6- week series, depending on the response I get. Thanks for reading!

***

I had gotten to the bar fairly early, around seven. After last week’s experience, I was sort of taking it on faith that Satan would show up again. Because if he didn’t, I didn’t want to know what that said about my mental health. Besides, where else was I gonna go on a Saturday night?

After the football game on the main screens finished, I moved from the bar to a recently-vacated booth, where I had a clear view of Spike showing one of their biweekly Star Wars marathons. Of course, it was more commercials than movie. I nursed my beer as the clock ticked later and later. The noise of the bar died down to a consistent buzz, accompanied by the staccato clinks of glassware.

“So I guess I was crazy after all. And I just wasted a Saturday night,” I said to myself, pulling out my phone to look up what ‘prolonged audiovisual hallucinations of Satan’ might be a symptom of. 

“But I promise you, you won’t have wasted your Sunday morning,” said a familiar voice across from me. I jolted to attention, startled, and fumbled my phone. It clattered loudly to the table.

I looked up and saw a pointed face, vaguely middle-eastern looking in a three-day beard, intense eyes staring into mine. I couldn’t tell if he was wearing the same look he had last time - I’m terrible at faces even when sober.

“Come on, you’ve got to stop doing that shit,” I said, secretly breathing a sigh of relief that I hadn’t just imagined last week. Or that if I had, at least my psychoses were consistent.

Satan laughed, and it couldn’t help but sound like an evil chuckle. “Sorry man. I was drinking before I came here,” he said, holding up the same glass filled with the same red liquid. “Your stuff doesn’t quite cut it for me.”

“Why the fuck are you so late?” I asked indignantly.

Satan looked at me quizzically. “Late? Didn’t you… fuck man, I didn’t know what year it was, but even I knew it was Sunday by the time we met last week.”

“Well I didn’t know when you said ‘next week’ you meant a hundred and however the fuck many hours exactly, I assumed that it was still counting as… know what? Whatever. This is stupid. We’ve got bigger fish to fry.”

“A hundred and sixty eight hours,” Satan said.

“What?”

“A hundred and sixty eight hours in a week. Multiply twenty-five times seven, subtract seven. It’s simple mental math.”

“Yeah, well, I’m on my seventh beer, so…”

“Not entirely true. Like three of them have entirely passed through your system already.”

“What, so you can see into my liver now?”

“What do you mean now?” Satan laughed. “I can see a lot of shit. Try not to get freaked out by it. There’s enough real stuff to freak you out.”

“Yeah, yeah, sure. Listen, thanks for bothering to show up again anyway. I’m sure you’re a busy guy,” I said, sensing that my initial indignance had been taken poorly. I was really feeling pretty lonely - new transfer to the school, older than most of the other students thanks to two years of sitting on my ass in the army. I had talked to one new person in my entire time in this bar, and it had turned out to be Satan. I didn’t want to fuck up the only relationship I’d formed, however weird and metaphysical it might be. Plus, he might turn me into a leech or something if he got angry.

“Oh, it’s… it’s not a problem, man. I don’t experience time the same way you do. Well, I mean, I do, but I also experience it several other ways. But you’re not interested in that, are you? What was it you asked me about last week?”

“Oh, it was… fuuuuck. I forget,” I said, rubbing my eyes.

“Doesn’t matter, you probably wouldn’t have understood my explanation without more groundwork anyway,” Satan said matter-of-factly. He seemed less drunk that he had been last week, while I was decidedly more hammered. I wasn’t sure I liked the new power balance that resulted.

“You sound like my fuckin math professor. What, have you got a… a curriculum for me? Is this an independent study in… whatever the fuck the opposite of Divinity is?” I pulled up my phone’s thesaurus app.

Satan gave me an appraising look. “Actually, that’s not a bad way of thinking of it.”

“Huh, opposite of Divinity is given as ‘devil’. I guess I was righter than I thought,” I said, putting the phone back in my pocket. Satan gave another smile, this one tighter, more strained.

“Anyway, the Godset,” he said. There was no way to transition smoothly into the topics he wanted to talk about. They were too big, too weird.

“The Godset,” I parroted.

“And I say the Godset to differentiate from an individual God that you or your Jewish Aunt or that Muslim dude over there believes in. They’re all elements of the Godset, but they’re nowhere near its totality.”

“Okay, I’m with you on that, but… okay, formulating a question. You sort of skipped over the steps between God and Godset. Like, what the fuck happened? How does the Roman Empire suddenly make an infinite being?”

“A good question. It’s… tough to explain. There’s a finite amount of belief provided by humans, and it only increases with population - but… okay, think of the belief as volume. The volume can occupy different shapes, and as the gods take different forms, the belief sort of bubbles around like waves. God, before he became the Godset, was like a rogue wave, a monotheistic force with a lot of belief behind him that rose up and dominated the rest of the pantheons around him, and when the Romans turned their belief from their pantheon to Him, it was another rogue wave rising up and joining, constructive interference, a Wintermute/Neuromancer kinda deal - he became the Sum Total. It’s that fucking thing from Calculus - the, the… what’s it called? Gabriel’s Trumpet! Ha, appropriate name. Still a finite volume of belief, but the shape it forms now has an infinite surface area. It is fundamentally changed. But instead of conversing with another of his kind in the Alpha Centauri system, he reached out and found…”

“Okay, wait, slow down, geez, I need to google like half the shit you just referenced,” I said, typing frantically. “You just folded in fluid dynamics, an obscure calculus shape, and a fuckin… cyberpunk novel? You’re like a Wikipedia of nerdy shit over here. Last week it was Vision this, Star Trek that… can’t you just use sports metaphors? Those stick with me even when I’m drunk.”

“No!” Satan said, with surprising intensity, his fist impacting the table in a way that seemed to mostly reverberate in ethereal dimensions. “Sports metaphors are for human-sized things. We’re talking about shit way beyond sports metaphors. There’s deeper truths to the universe, and it’s your science-fiction writers, your mathematicians, your comics artists - they’ve explored a little bit of the shallow end, whether they know it or not, whether they think it’s imaginary or not, and they’re doing their level best to tell you a little bit about how it feels to get your toes wet. A few hundred years ago I couldn’t talk to anybody but the best fucking philosophers about anything, and it was filled with these stultified Latin terms that even they didn’t quite understand. Your culture is providing a fucking gold mine of ways to talk about this shit, and I’m gonna fucking use it whether you’re willing to put in the effort to understand it or not. Do you want to keep going, or should I go find some other sadsack to unload my soul to? It only took a decade last time…” he trailed off, and for the first time I felt I saw in him an experience I recognized.

I’ve always fancied myself pretty smart. There’s a burden to being the smartest guy in the room, and I fucking wallowed in it when I was thirteen and thought I was hot shit for being in Algebra 2 and Civics Honors. Then I moved on to high school, and met the kids who were way smarter than me, and sorta-kinda made friends with the one who was smarter even than them - Dana, the girl who sat silently in almost every class, while quietly going to the national science fair and getting short stories published and working at internships designed for Phd candidates during the summer. Satan reminded me a lot of her, actually - the way she talked in metaphors, abruptly brought up topics that most people would want a semester to prepare to discuss… and the loneliness behind her eyes. She had made peace with the fact that she would find nobody on her intellectual level, at least not in high school. Last I heard, Dana had gone to work for NASA - her best hope for finding like minds. Even she hadn’t had an excuse to feel that loneliness, not in the long run.

Satan did, though, I realized. Satan was the only one who really did. He wasn’t just the smartest person in the room, he was the smartest person in the universe. Looking into his eyes, the utter solitude of that position hit me like a ton of bricks.

24o9xm,2,2014-05-04,Me [20 M] with my GF [20 F] for 15 months. Tonight she called me in tears about feeling like she didn't have enough time for the relationship.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/24o9xm/me_20_m_with_my_gf_20_f_for_15_months_tonight_she/,"We have been together for 15 months, and she has changed a lot since she started dating me. She was a very innocent conservative girl before she met me, but I brought out a slightly more wild and honest side of her after a while. She called me because she is working a managing job at the school newspaper, an internship with a company and taking classes and feels like she won't have enough time for everything. She seriously considered the idea of breaking up because she felt like she didn't have time for the relationship, but she couldn't do it because she said she probably wouldn't make it a day without me.

I'm not sure how to feel about all of this. She has been in relationships basically since 8th grade with different guys. She is older now and hasn't really had any freedom, although I'm not sure what she would be doing even if she had more freedom, she doesn't drink or smoke or even like having sex. I'm not really sure what I am keeping her from. 

I'm just not sure what to do. I think she called with the intention of breaking up with me, I really do, but as we talked she changed her mind. I wasn't trying to change her mind, I love her to death but if she wants out I'm not going to stand in her way, if it's what she really wants. 

This is my first relationship like this, and I am in over my head. I don;t know what to do, or how I should take this, or what. I wasn't exactly over the moon when I heard her say she didn;t feel like she could give the relationship 100% and then said she couldn't go on without me. We live an hour away, so in the summer it can be difficult I know, I offered to loo kat apartments so we could move in together and she said she didn't think we would be compatible living together.

I just don't even know. And it might be a smaller thing but hearing she really hasn't been having fun or enjoying sex that much is really a blow (before me she  had never even had her pants off in front of a guy, even though she had dated some of them for 2-3 years). All this time I thought we were having fun and getting close or whatever and then she tells me that she still isn't really enjoying it much or into it. 

I don't know. 

---   
TL;DR: What should I do. I'm in over my head. "
24omay,2,2014-05-04,"I know this sounds childish, but how do you move on when all that you want is for things to be the way they were? I just want to be happy again.",[deleted],gaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaybros/comments/24omay/i_know_this_sounds_childish_but_how_do_you_move/,"I used to be so fucking happy.  It was the summer after high school and all of my friendships were at an all time high.  I had a great summer internship and every day after work I'd go swimming with friends and laugh until the sun went down.  

That was the best summer of my life and the highlight of it was the first love.  He hit me by surprise and came out of nowhere. We'd drive for hours with nowhere to go and lay out in my field counting shooting stars under the light of the fireflies and the milky way.  He slowly stole my heart and I slowly stole his.  Between him, my friends, and the job I loved, it was the best summer of my life.  The fall was great with him too.  Then came the winter. 

In the winter everything went to shit.  One cold winter night we were busted and his parents gave him an ultimatum.  He could have me or lose everything.  In the end he chose to have life back over me which is perfectly understandable. We tried to make it work in secret but it couldn't work out after what happened.  One day he asked me if I would be his again and I said no. I wanted him to have a normal senior year of high school and actually enjoy his time with his friends.  It was the toughest decision I made in my entire life and it still keeps me up at night.  

He graduated after having a great senior year, went to one of the biggest colleges in Arkansas, joined a fraternity, and seems to be living a happy life.  All of his dreams seem to be coming true and I'm so happy for that, I just wish I could be a part of his dreams again. 

My life has went downhill since that happened.  I go to a different and much smaller college and feel like there is nobody for me here.  My old friends and I don't talk anymore.  I also am a member of a fraternity and my brothers are one of the bright spots of life right now, but I don't want to bother them with my petty problems.  I feel like I'm slipping at work and also my grades are falling.  

I'm feeling trapped.  I'm stuck here in Arkansas in a culture that's brutal towards me.  My grades are falling and I'm slipping at work.  I'm lonely.  Extremely lonely and when I'm lonely all I can think of is how happy I used to be.  


I'm sorry for the rant guys but I just don't know where else to go to vent so I went here.  Most of you are probably in better places than me, but I'm sure at least one of you understands how hard it can be to be in a small town.  I just feel lonely and isolated.    Does anyone know what I mean?"
24on3j,1,2014-05-04,Looking for advice about possibly joining US military,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/24on3j/looking_for_advice_about_possibly_joining_us/,"Not sure if this breaks any rules so I'm sorry if I did. To be honest I just read something about depression awareness week or something on another subreddit and I figured I go to reddit for a lot of things maybe a subreddit for this exists and would help?

I'm also sorry that this is probably all things I should tell to a therapist but I've tried therapists and had some bad experiences. One therapist I told that I was trying to get back to college and part of the terms for coming back from medical leave is to prove that I am receiving help so when I asked him to write a letter or email to my school he flat out refused after I had paid him in cash because my insurance didn't cover the Boston area. I also know that I shouldn't feel this way as I've been told it's a chemical imbalance in the brain, but I can't help but feel embarrassed and ashamed to tell anyone that I am depressed. I'm also a little suspicious that they're just telling depressed people that to make them feel better. I do feel a little better doing this over the internet where I'm (kind of) anonymous. 

Also I realize my post is a ridiculous wall of text and the TL:DR isn't much better but I felt like some details may provide better insight to my situation and I really would like as much advice as I can get since I'm potentially signing a few years of my life away. 

Anyway the TL:DR for this is I suffer from depression and have taken medicine for it in the past. I ended up taking medical leave twice in college, haven't managed to go back and try to finish again, but am out of money to continue trying. I'm not sure if I'm ready to go back to school (actually I'm pretty sure I'm not) but regardless I need help to try to pay off some college loans. Knowing that I may not be in a great state of mind but have financial woes, would joining the military (would like to go Air Force) be a good idea? Would they even accept me knowing about the depression?

Here are full details. 

I started going to college for electrical engineering in 2007. After a very bad breakup freshman year I started smoking a lot of pot and drinking to help me get over the breakup. Once the next semester began I stopped drinking so much but didn't slow down on the pot. Throughout that semester I would go to classes high and gave a very half-assed effort on anything. By the time finals rolled around I told myself to stop smoking so that I could study and just finish out the semester. 

Then I got a call from my family telling me my grandmother was in the hospital and they weren't sure how much time she had left. I drove home to see her and she died 2 hours after I arrived. 

After all this I went back to school and somehow scraped by although I lost half my scholarship and was put on academic probation because of poor grades. 

Then I did an internship at an engineering firm. With no more need to study I quickly went back to weed. 

After that internship break from school, the next semester I had to go back to classes but I stayed part-time at the internship on days I was free. I handled classes the same way as before (going in high) and on days that I worked I would immediately smoke when I got home from work. This is when I started becoming reliant on pot to get sleep. 

Then I got a call again. This time one of my coworkers who I had grown very close to had died in a car accident. He was one of two people that I had ever met through a job and continued to be close friends with outside of work. He was also just a few years older than me and used to be in the air force (partially why that's where I want to go). He was my mentor and everything I aspired to be. He was 29 at the time and I always thought to myself if I was anything like him at 29 I could consider myself a success. I was completely devastated.

After his funeral I tried to continue the job as normal but lost any enjoyment I had out of that company. I started not showing up for work without calling in. Those days I would hear my alarm clock go off and know it was time to go to work but I just couldn't find the motivation to get out of bed. I would just lie there and to be honest I don't remember what was going through my head. I would just lay there and hours would go by without me realizing it. Eventually I got enough calls from my old job about people being worried about me so I would show up to work once in a while. Then they told me they didn't have the funds to keep paying me on the days I did show up so I was laid off. I think it's pretty obvious that funds had nothing to do with it but that I was just becoming useless.

As finals got closer I found myself trying desperately to study but since I hadn't been going to classes I was basically trying to learn the semester courses all at once in a very short time period. With my friend's death in the back of my mind I just couldn't focus. Come finals day I remember going to my final, looking down at the piece of paper, 2 hours passing, then me handing in a completely blank final exam. 

I was raised by immigrants who came here from another country. Their reason for coming was to seek better opportunities here in the states where in their homeland would have been impossible. In that regard I was always taught that failure was unacceptable. My dad came here without speaking a lick of English, graduated second in his class with an engineering degree. Me being his son and being born here, that was the bar that I had always felt I needed to surpass. Having just handing in a blank final exam, I just felt like that was it. I just failed. I didn't know what else to do so I ended up climbing to the roof of the school's parking garage. I don't know how close I was to jumping but my sister called to check in on me. I don't remember how the conversation went but she convinced me that I needed to see someone. 

I talked with a school counselor and they decided I qualified for medical leave and could take the semester off to seek medical help. I went home and found a psychiatrist/psychologist (I always forget the difference but whichever one prescribes the medicine). She told me she thinks I am depressed and I was self medicating myself with the weed as it is an antidepressant and that's why I would break down after taking breaks from smoking a lot. She prescribed me an antidepressant and something to help me sleep. 

After trying this a while, I lost my appetite and any motivation to go to the gym. I would feel sick if I tried to eat more than 1 meal a day. Also the sleep aid knocked me out for 12+ hours and when I woke up I'd be groggy unable to function. My doctor prescribed me new medication that was supposed to help me sleep but not knock me out and help with my appetite as well as the anti depressant. 

This sleep aid did nothing for me nor did it help my appetite. My parents of Asian descent suggested I try an herbologist and acupuncture as they knew one that was supposed to be reputable. I tried that for a while and saw no results. I know eastern medicinal practices tend to take longer to see improvement but it was getting expensive and I couldn't justify continuing to pay without seeing any results. 

Admittedly I went back to weed. My justification was that I knew it helped me sleep and the munchies I get while high would help my appetite. As long as I only used it to help me sleep and I continued to take the anti depressants I'd be fine.

After a school year had passed since I took medical leave I hadn't had any suicidal thoughts or anything so I thought I was prepared to resume school. After dealing with therapists and medical leave coordinators, I finally got enrolled back to school although a few weeks late. I figured I was retaking all these classes so even though I started a little late I'd be fine. Since I was coming back from medical leave I wanted to start school again fresh and ready to learn the right way so I stopped smoking. As classes started I found myself just completely unable to focus. I thought I'd give it time. But without smoking or a sleep aid, I found myself lying in bed for hours trying to sleep. 

By the time I would actually get to sleep it would be time for classes so mornings started becoming a decision of should I go to class or should I skip just this one time so I can get some sleep and be able to get to class tomorrow? I got to the day of the first exam of the semester and slept right through it. 

My school advisor found out quickly and asked me about it and she determined that I wasn't ready to be back in school yet. 

Now I'm employed as a security officer working overnight shifts. I haven't touched any of my school loans and I'm making just enough money to cover rent, utilities, cable, and sadly weed. I've lost more than 35 lbs as I haven't been able to eat more than 2 very small meals a day and don't go to the weight room anymore. 

I just feel like a complete waste of life. I've always hated my kind of people. I know I'm not a complete dumbass. I know I'm good at some things. I just no longer see a point to any of it. I used to play basketball and go to the gym 3-4 hours a day. Basketball used to take my mind off things and be fun. Now it just seems pointless. The simplest way to describe me is ""wasted potential"". 

Which brought me to this decision. I am obviously very unhappy with my life. I'm 25 and have absolutely nothing to show for it. I don't know if I'm capable of having a family or having a significant other or even just finishing school. At this point in my life I've done nothing but leech off my parents. I don't know if I'll ever be able to repay them. 

This is why I think joining the Air Force could be good for me. I clearly lack discipline as I've repeatedly gone back to smoking weed despite knowing that I start becoming reliant on it if nothing else but mentally (I don't think there's anything physically addictive in weed but I don't know). I need help paying college loans which I hear the Air Force could help with. 

I just feel like my life has been a waste so far. If I serve for the military, at the very least I could say I did my best to serve my country. Probably not the best mentality but with suicide not being a legitimate option, going out while fighting for your country would be a pretty good way to go in my eyes. 

Right now my options are to keep living like a piece of shit, paycheck to paycheck, won't ever climb out of debt. Or I could move back in with my parents and mooch off them more like a piece of shit. Or I can actually do something with my life and serve for my country. 

I am wondering though if I would even make it to the military? Do they care about depression? Would they not take me if they knew? Should I try to lie about it? 

I just really want to be able to say I had at least one positive influence on this world before I die and as of now I've got nothing. 

If you read this far I am impressed by your stamina and (hopefully) willingness to help. Any advice is greatly appreciated. I do have some time before I have to make a decision so I'd like to make sure I think it completely through before I make a decision but every time I wake up I just feel like another day of me being a waste and wasting away my life. I've been doing this long enough I need to try something. 

Thanks again. "

I’ve been absent from /r/longdistance for a while now. Unfortunately my relationship ended after 3 and a half years, and after moving countries and living together for almost 2 years. 

But now I’m back!

Recently connected with an old friend who lives.. well, **900 miles** away from me now. 

He told me a few weeks back about his feelings towards me, an we did talk about the possibility of a LDR. Now, I for one know that a LDR can be so rewarding, the heart really does grow fonder, but he’s never had this type of relationship before. Not really sure if he’d be able to cope?

At the moment, we are talking every day on Skype for a few hours, and fall asleep together on it. He’s extremely sweet to me, and he makes me feel happy, which isn’t something I’ve felt for a long time now.

We’re both in university, and I know that if we did get into a LDR, it would realistically be about 4 years until there would be an end date. Whilst not impossible, I know that it would be difficult. 

My family know him, and his family know about me, and I am good friends with his brother too. Everyone appears to be happy with the situation. 

However, every summer he comes to the UK to do internships, so I know that for at least 3 months a year, we would be able to be together. 

My head really is all over the place. We both have strong feelings for one another, and are both happy to be in a LDR. My friends are saying it’s not something I should get into again. One of my brothers says the same thing. I see their reasoning, but surely it is better to give it a chance than to never know what could happen? 

We’re on the **same page** in the book. We want similar things in our lives now, and in our lives 5 years and 10 years down the line. I don’t want him to be the one who got away and live in regret. 

Any advice or help would be appreciated. 

*Edit: I forgot to mention that he will be coming to see me in a few months, and we're going to have a super in depth chat about what is the right decision. Eeep.*"
24p2yz,21,2014-05-04,"I [20 M] am not sure if I should stay with my girlfriend [21 F] of two years. We are constantly under stress and argue a lot, but have the occasional good time.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/24p2yz/i_20_m_am_not_sure_if_i_should_stay_with_my/,"Sorry for all of the text, I tried to make it as concise as possible.


My girlfriend and I have been dating for two years now, and I basically went from one long relationship straight into this one. For the most part, everything in our relationship has always been great. However, she has some serious emotional problems, is extremely focused on academics, and wants to spend more time together than I do.


The emotional problems: She has extremely high stress and anxiety about doing well in school and getting into medical school after graduating from undergrad. I occasionally will help her with her homework (mostly just looking up research articles, etc...) and she will get mad at me often. Usually she is just mad at herself and taking it out on me, saying things like ""I can't do this,"" ""I should just leave campus,"" etc... Because she goes to school several states away from her home, going home would mean failing the semester. There have been many times that I have to keep her from getting into her car and leaving, which often results in her saying that she hates me or something of the like.


Academic focus: As I stated earlier, her absolute goal is to go to medical school, so all of her free time is spent doing class work and preparing. This has resulted in her not really having any hobbies or doing anything for fun (which I don't think helps with the emotional problems). I try to help her out with her work as much as I can so that she can have some time to relax, but it doesn't always work (as stated above).


Time with her: She likes to spend as much free time together as possible. Which would be different if it didn't mean her working and me either helping or just sitting around bored. Sometimes spending time with her means I have to abandon my friends, which has begun to take a toll on those relationships.


But: We have so many good memories and get along well when there isn't the additional stress. Next semester she will only be working an internship full time and will live further from me on campus, so I believe I will have some more space and she will have fewer academic stressors, but I don't know if that is true. She might just make more mountains out of molehills.


Finally: I have been thinking about ending it, and I have talked to her about it. We've gone through a similar situation in the past where we thought about ending it but instead tried to step up our game in the hopes that we could make it work. We made it work for a while, but here we are again. She has told me that she will do anything to make it work, will fight for me, that I'm the only one for her, etc... But I just don't know if it is a good idea to stay together. Especially if it means we will go through this again and continue to hurt each other.


/r/relationships: Let me know your thoughts or ask me questions, I really need your help.

24p8bf,2,2014-05-04,Coming to Beirut,[deleted],lebanon,https://www.reddit.com/r/lebanon/comments/24p8bf/coming_to_beirut/,"Hey redditors,

I'm aware that this type of posts have appeared on this board and I've read all of them, but I'll still add another one.

This summer (september onward) I want to come to Beirut to learn Arabic and visit the city, country and culture.
I'll stay for 3 months and then probably start an internship.

I have a couple of questions to both Lebanese redditors and foreign redditors living in Beirut.

How high are the average costs of living if one is not particularly interested in clubbing or american style restaurants, as I've seen these two frequently being mentioned as the costliest things to do?
What are the average costs for a single-bed room or small apartment? Are some places actually unsafe to live in or is it just something foreign tourists are told in case they flaunt their ipods and pads around?
I've lived in S.E. Asia for half of my life and i've discovered that so called ""dangerous"" or ""sketchy"" parts of town only pose a threat to the rich and oblivious tourist who don't know how to keep a low profile.

Since my arabic is barely there at this moment, what other languages are in use that I can use in the beginning? (English, French, etc?)
How big is cycling in Beirut, how easy is it to get a bike and would you advise me against doing that?
What are some of the things one should do and see, what neighborhoods are not to miss? And i'm not asking what's the most exiting, but what do you guys like, where do you hang out,where do you spend your time?
I'm probably dropping by Beirut for 5, 6 Days in July to take a first look and check in at the language center I will have probably decided on by then, so I'd like to know for what to keep my eyes open.

I hope you don't think ""Oh, another one. Just read the previous stuff."" and I thank you for your help.

24pbwm,5,2014-05-04,22 [F4M] NW Ohio - Looking for friends or maybe more,[deleted],r4r,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/24pbwm/22_f4m_nw_ohio_looking_for_friends_or_maybe_more/,"I'm a 22 year old female with a year left in my Computer Science degree. After exams this upcoming week, I will be working full time as an IT Intern. I'm kind of your generic CS friend, who loves video games and movies, but seriously, those things are awesome. I'm pretty big into League of Legends, so if you want to play with me, we should totally play (but I am low elo, as a warning). I also just saw the new Spider-Man, so we could talk about that.

What am I looking for? I just want to talk to people. And, admittedly, I am kind of growing jealous of my two best friends. Recently, they've been asked out and I feel a little left behind. So, really, I'm looking for friends to talk to but maybe a little flirting too. 

So, what's the catch? I can be described as demisexual. Not the biggest fan of labels, but it does describe why I struggle pretty well. And for the lazy, demisexual can be defined as: ""characterized by a lack of sexual attraction toward any person unless they become deeply emotionally or romantically connected with a specific person or persons."" What this means is that I am friendly with everyone but I don't flirt well because I want to be friends first.

What this means for you, dear reader, is that if you are looking for a FWB or someone to swap pics with, you're not in luck. In fact, I will ignore you as soon as you start asking for that stuff. (I don't like it when people ignore what someone is saying.)

If you're looking for a friendly chat and a (digital)shoulder to lean on, I'm the (wo)man for the job. I love talking to people and learning about their lives and interests. 

To conclude in the words of anyone giving an oral presentation in school: So... yeah."

In June, I'll be going over to London for a month, for an internship. While I'm over there, I'll also be meeting my girlfriend's mom, to ask her permission to marry her daughter. My girlfriend has already told her mom that I'm planning to ask, and her mom is quite happy with this, and is totally fine with saying yes.

However, while I'm over there, I'll also be meeting my girlfriend's best friend's parents. They're like a second set of parents to my girlfriend, and they're very protective of her, and a little more conservative. The first time she flew over to see me (we're in a long-distance relationship; I'll be moving over there next year), they didn't seem to keen on me, because they had no way to verify that I am an Actual Person, and not an African prince with a lot of money to invest.

My girlfriend really wants me to meet them, so that they'll have the chance to realize that I'm not a scam or anything like that... but from the questions they've already asked her about me, I'm starting to get a little bit nervous. She says that no matter what they say, she isn't going to change her mind about me, and I appreciate that...

...but I am so in love with her, and I want things to go smoothly for her sake, so I'd really like it if they ended up liking me enough to be like, ""Okay, you're good enough for her.""

I know what they think probably doesn't matter to her as much as her mother's opinion of me (and her mother loves me), but her best friend is like a sister to her, and her best friend's parents are pretty much like her second set of parents -- she's over at their house every weekend, etc., so I'm pretty sure that what they think will have a bearing on her best friend, and inadvertently, have a bearing on my girl.

So... ladies of AL, what are some rules that I should apply when I meet them?"
24pgma,25,2014-05-04,"Abuse of Power in the Church and ""Introverts Can't be Pastors."" A Rant About the Last Six Months of My Life...",[deleted],brokehugs,https://www.reddit.com/r/brokehugs/comments/24pgma/abuse_of_power_in_the_church_and_introverts_cant/,"I think many folks here know me (or knew me.) I've been off reddit for the last six months, interning in a Methodist Church with the hope of getting approved to go into the probationary pastor phase. So that no one is sitting around in suspense, I didn't get the recommendation from the charge conference. Hence the need to rant a bit. 

(For those not ""in the know,"" a ""charge"" is a church or group of churches under the oversight of one pastor/pastoral team. In this case I had two congregations and one lead pastor.)

So I'd been working in this church for six months, pouring out well overe 100% of my time and energy to put on the best impression and really support the congregations. And I know it was over 100% because my lead pastor at one point demanded that I keep track of my hours (because he didn't believe I was putting in enough time.) My average week was at least 50 hours, sometimes fluctuating as high as 70 hours. For six months straight. With my lead pastor continually and sometimes passive-aggressively claiming that I wasn't working enough. As he claimed this, he continued to foist more and more of his duties onto me, so that at the end I'm not entirely sure what he actually did as far as pastoral work other than the occasional worship service.

I liked the congregations. One of them immediately seemed to take me to heart and embrace me. The other one was a bit more distant at first, but we warmed up after a bit. I thought of these folks as friends and I was deeply grateful to many of them. I worked as hard as I could to go out of my shell and meet with other people. I know I'm introverted. I always have been. That's just who I am. But I know that I have to get out of my shell for much pastoral work. I thought I was accomplishing this to a decent extent. In fact, I thought I was accomplishing this in a surprisingly quick amount of time. Six months is nothing timewise in getting me to really try and change something. 

And all the feedback that I got from the parishioners was always positive. A retired District Superintendent in my congregation was always helpful and supportive. Church members would come up to me and tell me that they thought certain sermons were really great, or something was really neat. Only my lead pastor really had a fly in the ointment when it came to feedback, and then he would beat me over the head with what he thought I did wrong. But he'd never send me into anything new with any kind of clear directions or suggestions. So I never knew if I was doing things wrong or not. I always had to figure shit out on my own. Then afterwards he would tell me how I did it wrong.

The stress towards the beginning of Lent was so bad that I decided to fast ""hating my body."" I have gender-identity... hmm... differences. So having body image problems has been the norm for me. But that, coupled with working 70-hour weeks, really put me in a place where I found out that I had come to hate my body. I was eating maybe one meal a day. I only weighed 118 lbs. to begin with (5'9 tall). That's fully normal for me. Underweight, but normal with the normal amount of caloric intake. I just have one of those metabolisms. But then by the time of Lent I had lost something like 5-10 lbs. Way too much for someone as skinny as I am. I had one day where I had to run up four flights of stairs to catch my train for a worship service and I sat on the train for half an hour pouring sweat, shaking and almost vomiting because my body had been so weakened. That was when I realized that my internship work was not playing well into my existing body-image problems. That was when I tried to fast ""hating my body,"" which basically meant eating at least three meals a day. And, to be honest, I felt ambivalent about skipping the meals at the beginning because of my image problems. You think male-sexed people can't develop eating disorders? I may well have, or have gotten pretty close to getting there.

Anyway, towards the end of these past six months, I thought I had reached a decent equilibrium with my lead pastor at least. We still had communication issues, but I figured that we both knew I'd only be around for another four months or so and we could just deal with it. Then the Charge Conference came along...

I was to present my report on my work, then go out while they discussed me, then come back to await their judgment. Oh boy was it judgment. I came back in to find that they had decided that introverted people can't be pastors. They said I'm too introverted and (here's the kicker) *I can't change or develop that.* No chance to defend myself. The vote was done. I just got to sit there as they judged my personality and their perceptions of my ability to change. I just sat there as I heard that they voted 2-to-1 against recommending me, in spite of the fact that I had not a single inkling that things were this bad before. My lead pastor and I had problems, yes, but he never so much as hinted to me that they might be bad enough to KO my recommendation. But what burns me up more right now is this idea that I find fucking ridiculous: I can't change myself. How can any charge conference, let alone any Christian believe that? How can we believe that a person *can't change?* 

But, also, how can two entire congregations just let me sail on blissfully unaware that they're torpedoeing my future. Or, at the least, blissfully unaware that they have concerns? If someone had come to me with concerns I could have worked harder to address them. I could have tried to do *something.* Nope, just let me work in ignorance until you drop the hammer on my head. What bullshit. And who the hell thinks that introverts can't be pastors? What's up with that? Does that mean that only extroverts can be pastors? Does that mean that we profess a theology that God can only call one *kind* of person? What a weak and limited view of pastoral work. I think we need pastors of all stripes. Introverts, extroverts, sci-fi fans, fantasy fans, who cares? Seriously, I think without pastoral diversity a church can get really skewed. You might as well just say that we don't think bearded people can be pastors or some other ridiculous bullshit criterion.

Luckily my District Superintendent and even the Bishop agreed that the charge conference decision was bullshit. However, they have no power to override the charge conference. So I'm out. No more ordination track. It's over. Except that the higher-ups were at least able to offer me work as a ""trained theologian in congregational life."" In another congregation. Which basically means non-ordained pastor-like work. There *may,* conceivably be a possible future route around this charge conference decision to get me onto an ordination track through the backdoor as it were, but who knows?

They gave me so little time for a decision, so I said yes. But at the moment I just have no fucking clue. Some days I think, ""I can do this."" Other days I think there's no way I can do that. I feel like the well has dried up. And so I'm left with a shattered future, a weakened body and little/unclear faith to start again with something... It's fucked, it was betrayal, it was abuse, it's poor theology and I'm totally burned out...

End rant.

I lived here when I was younger and after I moved I noticed my former friends started getting paid quite well at Gitex and DIFF (back when they still paid volunteers at the film festival) while they were like 16, and they seemed to have these week-long jobs. The amount they were paid per week was still more than I would be potentially be paid in two months once I get a full time job after graduating.

Even if it's not possible, it's cool I guess I can learn a lot of other stuff online. A lot of free online courses available these days!

Also, since I'll be graduating in a year, I suppose I'll be looking out for a full-time job anyway. I understand Dubai is not really the place for Computer Engineers, especially not those fresh out of college, but I've got family here so it would be neat if it were possible.

Is there a career fair during the fall term for internships ? If so, then which month is it in ?
Do all folks in ECE end up with calls ?

I am aware that CMU is quite systems heavy. I do have offers from other top-10 ECE schools, would you suggest I choose other schools for my areas of interest ?

The longest we've ever been apart is a few weeks, so 3 months seems like forever.

There is no question of cheating, we plan to get married within the next year or two. What I think I'm upset about is just the fact that he won't be around in person, and his internship will keep him away from his phone and online during the day (we text all day long normally). 

I know I'll be okay once he's gone and we're like a month in, but in the meantime, I'm just so upset all of the time. When I'm not busy, I can't stop thinking about him leaving. It doesn't help that I just graduated and am stuck at home until I get a job, and none of my friends are here. I have an internship and a part-time job but they haven't started yet. All I can think about is him leaving and how little time we have left. Even though he has about 2 weeks still, we're about an hour away and I don't have a car, plus he works all week. 

I hate that I'm being like this, I feel so clingy. I know the separation will be good for us and it will help me get over this thing (I tend to cry whenever we have to be away from each other for more than a week), but in the meantime this is killing me. It hurts to think about him leaving, and it bothers me that I get so upset. 

I don't know what to do, what to think about instead. I just don't want to get so upset in anticipation of him leaving. And, when I go out to visit him this summer, I don't want to spend the whole week upset that I'd have to leave shortly. I appreciate your help in advance!

I'm a university student (male) in my 20s and I'm looking to get back in the gym. I haven't really been working out since October. I used to hit the gym 3 times a week with my good friend, workout and bar buddy. However, last October during our fall break, he was driving on I-40, had a seizure and was killed in a car crash. I took it pretty goddamned hard, stopped going to our gym and our bar etc. because I was super upset. 

However the summer has rolled around and I need to move on and get my life back in order. I'm moving out of town for the summer for an internship with a great company. I'm using this opportunity to make a number of positive changes in my life: First, I've quit smoking (tobacco). I'm currently five days smoke free and I've switched to vaping and it's going great. My lungs and my heart are already feeling so much better for it. Plus, I don't smell like cigs all the time. Second, I'm improving my diet. I've cut down a ton on soda, energy drinks, etc. and continuing to improve my eating habits. Since March I've lost about 20 lbs. I'm 5'11"" and I'm down from 200 even to about 180. 

The last step is to begin hitting the gym. I've been doing situps, pushups, etc. in my room to start off. Since I quit smoking, I can now run a mile and my endurance is only getting better every day. Could a few of you experts on /r/fitness hook me up with an easy routine I can do for a few weeks to get back into the habit of lifting? I don't want to overdo it and be so sore I can't move for days because I'm moving out of my apartment and into my new place this friday and I'll need to walk about a mile/day at my internship. Also, does anyone know of any good upper back exercises? My posture has been declining lately and I want to get a few exercises to help with strength in my back and to improve  posture.

My ex-gf is 19 , a senior in high school and a soon to be Freshman in college at a school across the country (3+ hour plane ride). We met 3 years ago when she was 15 and I was 17. We started hooking up for a few months and slowly developed a relationship. In the beginning of the relationship I was not very enthusiastic about her and went through the motions. After about a year I fell head over heels for her and she changed my life completely and utterly, she grew on me. 


I consider her my best friend and we have intense compatibility. We have been through a lot together, we've had several breakups - most lasting a day or two but one lasting 2 weeks and the most recent lasting a whole month. In addition, very very early on in our relationship she kissed another guy. At one point I also cheated on her. I ended things and we didn't speak for a while. We went our separate ways for a few weeks. During this time I was with several different women. When we decided to get back together I ended giving her an STD that we both now still have. It was a traumatic experience for both of us (moreso her). Although it was a difficult time the whole dynamic of our relationship changed. We went from having a standard teenage relationship to a very passionate and intimate relationship. We spent all of our time together and in some ways had began to speak our own language. 

The relationship was perfect. We never fought, had good sex, and had lots of fun. For both of us this was a period of growth. I should also mention that throughout the relationship I felt as if she was always a little bit more invested than I was. After about a year I got accepted into my dream school across the country. (15 hour car drive, 2-3 hour plane ride). We took a short break in our relationship as I got acclimated to my new environment. We began a long distance relationship and began to see each other on breaks and at east once during the semester. Things could not have been better. We were both excited about the relationship. Never fought. I was focused on my health and on school and she was doing her own thing.

 I spent a month and a half with her during winter break and it was the happiest time of my life. I went back to school this January and the semester was rather shitty. I missed her a lot and had trouble readjusting to being away from her. I saw her for a total of about 15 days over the course of 2.5 months (not bad). Still, when I got back from break about a month ago I felt it in my heart that I could no longer continue the relationship. I was feeling depressed and 'held back' for having a long distance relationship, and I also knew that she was going to college and moving farther away in the future. So long story short, I ended an otherwise perfect relationship because I felt 'held back'. A month has gone by. Both of us in this time have been working on ourselves and seeing therapists. 


In the past month I feel like I have gotten my independence back and am overall much happier. Still, I felt miserable sometimes because I missed her and felt like she resented me for ending things. We were 'no contact' until about a week ago. We've been talking every few days. Every conversation we have has been absolutely amazing and nothing like we ever had before. I'm taking steps to be a happier person and so is she. We have both agreed to focus on ourselves and be less co-dependent. Since we started talking I am even happier than I was because I know that she is 'ok' and doesn't hate me. I'm also happier because I just simply have a blast talking to her.


 Now this is where I am conflicted. I know without a doubt that me and her could start things back up if I proposed it (at this point I wouldn't consider us broken up, more like 'it's complicated'). After breaking up with her, I decided to keep my job down here at school and classes for the summer instead of getting an internship back home where I would spend about 2.5 months with her. Things are going really well and I feel like if we got back together with this newfound optimism we would be successful. 

We've broken up before and upon getting back together the relationship was typically much better. Or, should I just let this girl go and move on with my life? 

tl;dr 3 yr Longterm/Longdistance relationship, broken up for one month. Considering restarting it, need perspective"
24qqfv,15,2014-05-04,KIA - A Lesson Learned,gungrande,NoFapWar,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFapWar/comments/24qqfv/kia_a_lesson_learned/,"With a heavy yet excited heart I am writing this. I am nervous about it, but I promised KnightGwain, so here I go!

About 20 minutes ago, I fell in the line of duty. Today was a rough day; for context let me explain why:

Today is my roommate's bachelor party. He had asked me to be in the wedding over the summer, but because I did not know my plans at the time, he and the best man (another roommate) thought it wise to not include me in the wedding plans. I come to find out later that I did not get the internship I had hoped for and was planning to attend the wedding. By this time, however, plans were made and it would be bad to change them again. So here I am, with only me and another roommate (he had similar circumstances) being in town but not able to participate in the wedding ceremony as originally intended. Basically because of this I was not allowed to come to the bachelor party tonight though everyone else was.

I felt very lonely, hurt, and angry. Today and days in the recent past I have felt people have abandoned me. 

I was edging a lot today. I came up with stupid excuses, and in so doing fanned the already growing flame. 

Yes, my heart is sad that I felt it best to give in once again to an enemy I knew was not for my good. I have fought this enemy so many times, and I thought I knew the dangers. But alas here I am.

I may have given in and stumbled, but I am not giving up. I am standing back up to face the enemy again, because *I have learned some valuable information in this last successful attack*:

* Loneliness is a trigger for me.
I can now add it to the list of other root triggers such as Stress and Boredom. Discovering this weakness has revealed to me that for so long in my past I have used porn and masturbation to help me through my loneliness (there has been a lot), just as I have done with stress and boredom. The strange thing however is that porn creates loneliness and stress, thus creating a  vicious cycle. I can now address my loneliness head on, now that I know it exists to the point where I have to self-medicate.

* Edging will lead to no good. Ever. 
In this fight, I must... Keep. My. Hands. Off. No excuses. No reasons.

It is my desire that I this post will  motivate you all to continue in your own battle, to see where your own personal weakness lies so you can address them. The last thing I want is for this post to cause one of my fellow soldiers to fall. 

Like I said in the beginning, I am sad, but also excited. I'm sure you all know why I am sad, but I am excited because I am getting back up and applying what I now know of my enemy. Hopefully, my counter will sky rocket, as will my self esteem, and self-love, leaving this failure on earth, but remembering what I have learned from it.

Love you all."

Started off as once a day, into a few times. Then, i'd only stay with friends that would smoke during times i wasn't at school. During summer, i'd smoke all week, then started buying for myself and smoking while i was home too ( Took the dog for a walk 3 times after school, he sure enjoyed that :P). Then i basically only hung out with 2 or 3 friends, talk about life; This is when i felt like i got an extremely analytical view towards life. Every little bit of information i read or saw on a screen was scrutinized. It made me very mature for my age according to the majority of the new people i met between 19 and 21. At 19 i quit college and enrolled in a professional degree in IT. The teacher saw that i was very different than the other in the way i processed information; Not saying i'm a genius, i flunked most of highschool, redoubled grade 8 and graduated with a C average. I was in 426/526 ( level 2?) math and science and excelled with B+ averages up until grade 12, where i failed science so i went into a business program in college ( Passed Cal 1 in my first semester without studying :S). Back to my IT school, i would smoke before class most days, not a single classmate knew unless i told them. After school i'd smoke until 1am most days ( Started class at 1PM). Then, i graduated after a 2 month internship and am now 1 year in at my first corporate job ( I actually really like it...) About 3 or 4 months in, my 1 friend i'd still see regularly got a gf ( No gf at all during these times for me...)Started staying home more often, then...I just stopped answering a lot of calls...ignoring people because i just want to stay home after work. Weekends feel like hours and weeks like a few sleep cycles. My first year at work honestly feels like it was 3 or 4 months at most..I see a friend maybe 2 or 3 times in a month, usually to smoke a joint with, or buy weed from. I stay home, smoke my bong, browse reddit,  jack off and eat after works and on the weekends.

If i quit smoking weed now, i might lose the anxiety,but i won't forget what i learned either, that's what gives my anxiety too...Knowing or trying to figure out things most people don't fathom at all...I can't listen to or talk about music with people, talk about women with the guys ( I'm straight, a virgin, but straight. I've had experiences with girls before, but not for about 3 years because i stopped seeing people groups of friends who include the girls i knew or other i might have met.), movies are meaningless to me...And it feels that it's all people want to talk about, so i avoid that all together.

This is a mix of depression and anxiety from what i feel...The jailing at home is a result from fear of my friends seeing me, knowing i smoke so much weed ( Pretty conservative jewish community; Yes some other friends smoke, but only do it to ""party"")...My personality has changed 10 fold since the time my friends would regularly hang out with me. I'm not the same anymore as a result of weed making think way out the ""box""; Feels like I'm staring at a warehouse with pallets of boxes sometimes. When confronted with anyone or any new place ( I live a very small radius, 2 or 3 KM at most), my heart starts beating, i'm usually high if not at work, so fear of getting caught by cops or seen by someone i know is always there.

So again, i don't want to quit weed because i'm scared that my personality will be the same, that i still won't have any friends and that i'll just get more depressed...I'm very willing to quit, though, i can't seem to think of any possible scenarios i can walk forth to. I have so many options in terms of long term achievements to enroll in such as academics, but those just mark time with barriers where i am not myself. I want to change, but i don't know what to change to, so i don't do anything. I still do my very best at everything i currently do."
24r3ud,1,2014-05-05,"I (20/F) adopted a new ""moral code"" in order to become more dateable. But I don't know if it has any backing-- opinions?",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/24r3ud/i_20f_adopted_a_new_moral_code_in_order_to_become/,"Okay, so I went through a bad break up in July that ended in being stalked and lots of crazy court stuff (that's another story). After all of that, I decided to take a walk on the wild side (heh) and had sex with multiple people-- lots of FWB situations. No feelings, just fun.


However, I realized around January that the line between what I wanted to do with others and what I felt I had to do was blurring. I felt that I had to go down on a girl, give blow jobs to men, and have sex with both regardless of how I felt. I also realized that I wanted to get into dating (REAL dating) and not just fucking around. So I decided to not have sex (oral, vaginal, anal-- anything that's not making out and heavy petting) before monogamy.


But then this guy who is pretty awesome comes along. We do the whole cutesy holding hands and cuddling thing that I've never done before... Then we make out one night, which leads to another night of heavy making out, and then finally last night where I was like I WANT TO HAVE SEX WITH YOU. But I didn't. Because, at the end of the night, we were post-cuddling and having a conversation about DTR and he said ""wait-- you don't think we're dating, right?"" Me, ""no, friends... with benefits right?"" Sounding relieved, he said ""Yeah, I'm just not looking for a relationship right now.""


Yeah, ouch, whatever, I would like to maybe date him because only three weeks into this I'm really impressed with him. And I like him. However, next week he goes off for the summer for some internship-- we'd be a couple hours away. It makes sense, but naturally (because I am plus size and a little bit insecure) I think it's because of my weight that he does not want to date me-- good enough to fuck around with, but not date. Of course, that's neither here or there.


I would like to know what you all think about the no sex before monogamy thing. If having sex with him before the summer hurts my chances of maybe having something romantic in the fall. I don't want to get stuck in the whole ""why buy the cow (heh) when you get the milk for free"" deal. I don't think he'd think of me less as a person (we've talked about slut shaming, etc.), but I want to present myself as someone to DATE not just FWB it with. Make sense? 

side note: It's only been 3/4 weeks. We get along really well. Conversation flows wonderfully and have been to dinner together and watched a couple of movies-- but nothing like dinner or public since the physical shit started. We've just hung out, and this is not a ""omg he's perfect and I'm in love thing"" at all. I just seem some potential maybe.


---   
**tl;dr**: I like this guy and we've made out three times and I really want to go further. But I'm trying not to do sex before monogamy. He says he's not looking for a relationship right now. I'm interested in a relationship maybe at some point. I really want to have sex with him, but I want to still make myself as ""datable"" and not just ""fuckable."" Would having sex with him in any form make me appear undateable? "

1- I’m transgender. Looks like a girl, feels like a girl, still has a penis. Don’t call me shemale or tranny, please and thanks. 

2- I want to get into some detailed and ongoing roleplays, not chats, in interesting settings. I want scene setting and exploring and foreplay and perhaps even character development. If you like stories, let’s play. 

3- I like guys and girls and everything in between but have, almost, ZERO interest in penetrating anyone. Period. 

4- I may have played with some of you in the past before I sort of vanished for reasons I won’t get into. Sorry about that, and don’t take that leave-taking as a reason not to message me. 

5- I prefer quality to quantity and may not respond for hours or even days. I’d like the stories to go on and on and hope to find others who prefer the more pen pal style exchange rather than an erotic chat. I am in bed but plan to be awake for a few hours, but I am hoping more to set things up tonight rather than finish them off if that makes sense. 

6- If you have questions about transwomen I will answer, but I have a strong distaste for the fetish-level curiousity some people exhibit online, so if you have a “OMG Am I gay for liking transwomen and what does that mean about me?!” hangup you want to explore then I am not the gal to chat up. 

In previous posts I presented some sample scenarios. I don’t necessarily want to do these, but this is the kind of thing I’d like to do. I’d love to hear you pitch an idea for a scene or roleplay. 

IDEAS:

We are two friends traveling the world. We were part of a larger group of college students or 30-somethings or whatever, but we did our paperwork by hand and everyone else let the travel agency do theirs. There was some snafu at a border and they couldn't carry on. We'd prepaid, and now it's just you and me on a series of foreign stops. We fall for each other as the trip progresses.

The other is, maybe you'll think it's silly, but about intrigue. I'd like to be spies, or ideally members of a resistance movement in an occupied country. Maybe court members Game of Thrones style. But mainly I'm thinking a sort of Noir' early '40s occupied Paris and beyond. I'm a young German-American girl with a flawless accent and memory sent to help the resistance infiltrate German communications in Paris and if successful, beyond. My local, bodyguard or military escort or teacher spy or fellow German infiltrator or whomever you'd like to be, and I fall for each other.

Another is to be on a boat. I'd prefer something like a research vessel or small yacht tour of an area to something big like a cruise ship. But just an extended dynamic at sea. Whether that's coworkers on a small but cozy research boat or teacher and student on an internship class studying Greek mythology on the Mediterranean or whatever or even performers on a luxury cruise ship... It's all groovy, just as long as we are on a boat and its warm.

Fourthly, we are on-air TV journalists at rival networks in a big market, New York, LA, Chicago or the like. We are seated at the same table at an annual awards banquet. The table is empty except us due to a series of events that don’t matter, and we hit it off and sleep together. This kicks off a very carefully kept secret romance. We aren’t rivals, but our stations are and our job is to beat the competition.

You are a world renowned actor/actress rock star or something similar, and since you are hopelessly disorganized and far too famous for details, you have a personal assistant follow you everywhere. I am reserved and shy but beautiful, and eventually you decide to pursue me, try to warm up the cool, professional exterior.

My internship starts on Thursday and I'm going to live together with my workmate in another city.
I'm a bit anxious... for the first time I will live on my own. Apart from doing daily duties all alone, I also have to be responsive to my colleague.

This may sound whiny to some of you but this whole new situation really burdens me.

Please pray, that I am able to put the Lord first during this time, because He is more important than 1000 of internships. Please pray, that He will stand on my side, because I feel so weak right now, I will fail on my own.

I hope, that I can be a good friend for my co-worker and that he won't get sick of me. I hope, that I will do a good job. Please pray, that I may not be proud of myself if everything goes well, but give God the glory.

But even if I fail hard and everyone is going to hate me, it's ok as long as I don't lose God. So out of all requests, please pray, that my Lord may guide me and that I stay on His path, because I want to love him and feel so distant from Him right now...

24s9g9,582,2014-05-05,Has anyone else found university thoroughly disappointing and almost a step-backwards in life?,Fwub,unitedkingdom,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/24s9g9/has_anyone_else_found_university_thoroughly/,"I'd like to preface this message by saying I am a first year student at a top 20 UK university, currently studying a course involving computing and business. These are my experiences but I know these incidents are not isolated to my university or course. 

I would like to give you a somewhat brief summary of the nitty gritty of what has happened to me this year at university, and explain why I've been left with a sour taste in my mouth. 

Maybe it can help a few of you influence your decisions and future choices, or just give you an excuse to rant with me.

**Accomodation**


* Today, somebody just **pissed up the wall** outside my block after exclaiming, 'ha, he's doing work' whilst walking past my window.
* Near enough every Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday night I get **woken up** by drunk people **screaming** outside my window at **2,3,4 o'clock in the morning**. I've had to **buy earplugs**.
* **Food goes missing** out my cupboard regularly. My squash drank itself. I had one drink out of it and then it just mysteriously gradually evaporated. Should've filled it with laxatives.
* Somebody **cracked the fridge** slightly at the bottom. **Cosmetic damage only**. It was still fully functional. A **new fridge** was bought. We were **each charged £21** for the replacement. I knew nothing of the damage until an email about the charge came through.
* The **new fridge didn't even have a freezer** compartment. I complained. **One and a half months later** we got a fridge-freezer. I looked up the model number. Found it for sale by John Lewis. Worked out we were **over charged by £50** on this price.
* Somebody else managed to smoke out the whole block - all 3 floors - by **leaving garlic bread in the microwave for 15 mins** on a microwave setting instead of oven setting.
* I'm catered 5 days a week. **I don't have an oven** for the weekend. 
* Catered menu consists of about **20 dishes** for the whole year.
* Someone **broke down their door with a hockey stick** as they were drunk and couldn't get in to it.
* **Common room was smashed to pieces one night,** broken glass everywhere, walls damaged, pool table ruined.
* Common room damage was done by people living in the same halls.
* Had to pay out another **£20 in damages for things I had no knowledge of** as someone kicked the toilet door, and damaged surface in the kitchen.

There are many more incidents that I've had the pleasure of witnessing, but that's enough to get started on. Now for the lectures, teaching and pricing... Jesus, this really makes me annoyed.

**Teaching**

* £9000 split between 2 semesters, with 12 weeks in each, and around 13 lectures each week lasting 50 minutes each equates to **£34.62 per hour of teaching.** 
* One module this year consisted of **95% GCSE maths**. I'm talking y=mx+c kind of stuff. It's a joke. Having achieved a - by no means special - B grade in A-level Maths I found this unbelievably trivial. So trivial in fact that **I gave the first couple of worksheets to my niece in Year 9 who could do them without difficulty**. 
* I must have **answered at least 95/100 questions correctly** in 'tutorials' for this subject and **answered many in-class questions**, as well as did **way over my fair share of group work**... **I got 63/100 for the tutorials**. I enquired as to why. I got a meeting with the head of the module. He said according to my tutor I hadn't answered all the questions. I had. He asked if I could prove it, assuming I hadn't kept all the work. I had kept all my work. I showed him. He remarked it. **Bumped it up to 70/100**. Said nothing more could be done as **other marks were due to 'in class contributions'** which couldn't be remarked. 
* **Peers with other tutors** who had come to me for help numerous times got **80-90/100** on this coursework.
* I got 92% on the actual proper test as if that's any consolation.
* Other subjects include **programming**, taught by a **lecturer** who is **so inanimate and robotic it is impossible to follow him**. I'm sorry, I've had bad teachers in the past, but this is beyond a joke. After researching the material after the useless lectures **I could turn around and teach them better than him.** In fact, **as a group we often had to go and learn everything off YouTube ourselves** and teach ourselves and each other. 
* **Awful teaching is passed off with the excuse that, 'you should be doing independent learning'**, yet they provide no resources except for textbooks with no illustrations or anything of even the slightest hint of engagement or excitement. These books are quite frankly, **shit**.
* **Lecturers often plug their own books** which **cost £40+** and are no use anyway.
* **The programming coursework was nigh on impossible given the teaching we had been given.** The only way our class scraped through was via the help of a student who had done this stuff in his spare time for the past 3 years and could give advice as to what to do. **Teachers weren't allowed to assist** in this coursework. **No unmarked related practice work was given previous to this coursework.** We were literally thrown in at the deep end with no help available.
* We had a Chinese lecturer who's **English was so bad that 80% of the class left halfway** **through** due to a lack of understanding of what she was saying. 
* Had a **computing lecturer who's demos failed near enough every week** and had to be **corrected by the class**. In one class **I even solved a problem** after the teacher was scratching his head for 30 seconds looking at the code. **I am utterly shit at programming** and don't even know what I'm doing and still managed to do this.

These are just isolated incidents, and there are many more, but this is getting long-winded by now so I'll leave it at that. 

Besides, I've got to go and revise for my tests now and make sure I get my £27,000 certificate that says, 'yep, he can do stuff that he could do at the end of sixth form anyway', at the end of this joke that is a university education.

Any incidents or comments regarding your university experiences would be much appreciated, thanks.

**TL;DR My university is overpriced, full of drunk idiots who are costing me money and keeping me up at night, and it isn't teaching me anything I couldn't learn for free anyway at a much faster rate online from YouTube.**

 EDIT: This is really blowing up. Thanks for all the comments. As a thank you, here's a couple of pics of the fridge that needed replacing. [WARNING: Very badly damaged fridge pics inside NSFW.](http://imgur.com/a/nmCdS)

EDIT2: Someone just smashed a bottle of beer off a lampost outside my window putting glass on the grass as some bank holiday party thing is going on on the green behind my block. Fuck me, this is a joke. 

EDIT3: There are some absolutely amazing responses in this thread and I've learnt a fair bit today about what I need to do to make it all worthwhile. Now I've got my angry rant out the way, here's an amalgamation of what others have taught me today: 

**Top Tips**

* Regarding accommodation, it's a lottery. Some halls are quiet, some are rowdy. It's down to chance what hand you get dealt, just make the most of it and try and be as care-free as possible. There is pretty much sod all you can do about it for the first year... Just find some like-minded mates and make it to your second year intact!

* The library is infinitely better to revise in than your room. I personally need to get off my lazy arse, make the walk to it and get my work done. 3 hours in the library smashing out work is better than 12 hours half working, half redditing and half getting distracted by flat-mates and neighbours. 

* Lecturers may appear half-arsed and crappy at face value, but that's because they have a lot more on their plate than what meets the eye. I had no idea they were so involved in research and PHD studies previous to this thread, so before you get angry at their piss poor performance send them some emails and ask for help... If they still aren't any good, then you can be angry.

* Do something worthwhile in your spare time that you can slap on a CV at the end of it all and be proud of. The amount of time off is ridiculous so learn a hobby, partake in sports, internships, clubs, societies, instruments, languages, whatever, just go for it. Be purposeful!
* If you do something related to the field of work you want to work in then that's even better!
* If you get totally fed up of work, revision and halls then just make a revision thread bitching about university and post it on Reddit. It'll sort you out and put you right back on track. ;)

Cheers!"

(long-time lurker giving thanks to this great community),EconomicFacepalm,electronic_cigarette,https://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/24sjga/how_vaping_saved_me_from_picking_up_smoking_again/,"The last 6 months or so have been the toughest of my life.  By no means am I trying to reap some karma but I wanted to emphasize the importance of vaping, all I have come to learn, and how it prevented me from hitting the analogs again. 

A little bit of background:  I started smoking at roughly 13 years old and continued until roughly 21 years old until I quit using Chantix.  I picked the habit back up a couple years ago for a few months until I realized what the hell I was doing and immediately quit again. I have been analog free since.  

November 2013: I was in the last semester of my undergrad and found out my mother was receiving biopsies over a cancer scare. Also, I found out my dog I received for my 10 birthday had cancer.  And, on the same day I found out my grandmother had cancer from smoking her whole life.  We ended up giving my dog some unconventional methods in which prolonged his life as he was quickly deteriorating.  He his doing better now but by no means is he going to be around much longer. 

December 2013: I graduate Magna Cum Laude from a private business school in Finance and Economics.  I was working full time throughout my schooling and was trying to get an offer put together from my employer.  Our CEO was working my position into the budget but we were waiting on some funding that was overdue.  

I loved my job.  In December 2012, I was selected for a program through my school that sponsors my internship and places me into a position in a company that I share great passion for.  This is only given to one student and is an incredible honor if selected; truly great news.  I ended up being hired as a contractor by the company in May 2013 at a reduced salary until I graduated in December 2013. 

January 2014: My grandmother dies.  I still have yet to receive my offer for employment. 

February 2014: My best friend and neighbor since the day I was born is killed in such a horrific manner I cannot seem to grasp it to this day.  He and I started smoking together in our youth. This is a continuing matter that really isn't getting any easier. 

A few days beforehand I bought my father a simple ego setup after a ton of research (reddit, online non-biased periodicals) to try and rid his habit. I wanted to smoke. I wanted to smoke so badly I tried smoking again and was horrified by the first hit.  I still wanted to smoke though.  I remembered the setup I just bought my father and was awaiting his arrival from being out of town.  I filled it up with now what is horrendous juice and started vaping.  I loved it! I knew I wouldn't smoke again using this device. 

March 2014:  Funding hasn't come through and, in fact, we're informed the funding is not the amount needed.  Also, the funds that were being used to compensate me have dried up.  I'm let go.  

April 2014:  My fiance and I's dog died in our arms.  He was originally my fiance's dog when we met and became our dog as we have been together for 10 years.  He was the most loyal and caring animal and anyone who knew him is deeply saddened.  He literally made a point to get up multiple times and check on everyone in their sleep during the night. All he cared about was his family and I miss him so much. 

Here I am hitting the job market; never had so much time on my hands in my life. I have experienced multiple setbacks, emotionally and professionally, many times over the course of a few months, but I am not smoking again thanks to vaping.  I dropped my nic strength down from 18mg to 6mg and I am looking to upgrade to a mod [I have been hitting the classifieds to purchase a used mod setup (currently have PT2 mini and multiple egos) and I thought about picking up everything for a new mod setup but that wouldn't be financially responsible at this time.]    

Thanks for all your advice as I have yet to contribute to this community. Over the last few months I have been lurking and learning off other people's contributions and I have learned so much from this community's knowledge that I cannot possibly show my gratitude in the appropriate manner. 

TL:DR Vaping saved me from picking up smoking while experiencing the most horrifying and tragic events of my life to date. Thanks to this great community for all the knowledge I have gained.

1320 E. Hall St. Tempe 85281
 
I'm a sophomore at ASU studying in Iceland over the summer and need someone to fill my room for the last few months of my lease! I'm looking for someone for the months of the rest of May, June, and July. I am pretty much all moved out and you would be able to move it right away. The house is very close to campus and just off the light rail station. It has a beautiful backyard with a garden, chickens, and a bunch of fruit trees. My room is normal size painted light gray with a built-in dresser and a walk-in closet. 

I am very very desperate to find someone right now so please don't hesitate to call, text, or email with questions!

If you are a student looking to stay in Tempe over the summer for a job or internship, I did the same thing last year and I loved it! If you just want to live in Tempe over the summer, this would still be an awesome opportunity to get a taste of the city without signing a year lease. Right now I'm offering $400 a month plus utilities, which is average for a room so close to campus. 

There will be two roommates and if you are interested, you can certainly meet them and check out the place. Let me know if you have any questions or want to schedule a visit!

24sn4h,2,2014-05-05,I (F/20) have a new moral philosophy of no sex before monogamy-- does it really even matter?,throwaway4stupidq,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/24sn4h/i_f20_have_a_new_moral_philosophy_of_no_sex/,"Okay, so I went through a bad break up in July that ended in being stalked and lots of crazy court stuff (that's another story). After all of that, I decided to take a walk on the wild side (heh) and had sex with multiple people-- lots of FWB situations. No feelings, just fun.

However, I realized around January that the line between what I wanted to do with others and what I felt I had to do was blurring. I felt that I had to go down on a girl, give blow jobs to men, and have sex with both regardless of how I felt. I also realized that I wanted to get into dating (REAL dating) and not just fucking around. So I decided to not have sex (oral, vaginal, anal-- anything that's not making out and heavy petting) before monogamy. 

I meet this guy a couple of weeks ago and we hit it off. We do the whole cutesy holding hands and cuddling thing that I've never done before... Then we make out one night, which leads to another night of heavy making out, and then finally last night where I was like I WANT TO HAVE SEX WITH YOU. But I didn't. Because, at the end of the night, we were post-cuddling and having a conversation about DTR and he said ""wait-- you don't think we're dating, right?"" Me, ""no, friends... with benefits right?"" Sounding relieved, he said ""Yeah, I'm just not looking for a relationship right now."" I now recognize that I should have been upfront about wanting to not just be FWB, but what's done is done now. Also, he could just not be into me for a relationship. Totally cool, but I was really confused because most FWB Iv'e been in are not cuddling and kissing goodbye type of deals.

But his response makes sense, as in a week he goes off for the summer for some internship a couple hours away. We spoke briefly about seeing each other over the summer, but ideally I'd like to see where things go in the fall and possibly open the old doors of dating. But I'm worried that since the FWB status has already been established, he probably won't think of me in any other way.

**I would like to know what you all think about the no sex before monogamy thing. If having sex with him before the summer hurts my chances of maybe having something romantic in the fall. I don't want to get stuck in the whole ""why buy the cow (heh) when you get the milk for free"" deal. I don't think he'd think of me less as a person (we've talked a lot about slut shaming, etc.), but I want to present myself as someone to DATE not just FWB it with. Make sense? **

*I am using this situation as a way to receive feedback on this new ""moral philosophy."" Sure, I'd like to date the guy, but obviously that's not happening right now.*

side note: Conversation flows wonderfully, natural chemistry, and have been to dinner together and watched a couple of movies-- but nothing like dinner or public since the physical stuff started.


---   
**tl;dr**: I like this guy and we've made out three times and I really want to go further. But I'm trying not to do sex before monogamy in order to become more dateable and less FWB-able. He says he's not looking for a relationship right now, which I respect and understand. I'd like to possibly think about a relationship with him in the fall if things go well. I really want to have sex with him now tho, but I want to still make myself as ""datable"" and not just ""fuckable."" What do you think about the ""no sex before monogamy"" deal?

24snc4,3,2014-05-05,I [25 M] am thinking about breaking up with my girlfriend [22 F] of 1.5 years. Am I thinking rationally?,fullofunknown,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/24snc4/i_25_m_am_thinking_about_breaking_up_with_my/,"This will be slightly lengthy, so please try to read it all (or most) to understand. 


In June of 2012 I began talking to a friend (female) that I met at my best bud's birthday party in January of that year. At the time of meeting her I had a girlfriend. I didn't pursue any action at the time, nor did she push anything on to me. I did find out later that she found me attractive right away and was disappointed that I was in a relationship. In June we started hanging out more and more. Now I just came out of a relationship in May, so I was trying to keep my distance and be careful. We dated for 6 months before I asked her out. At the time, that was the longest I'd ever waited to do that. I had a good time with her up until about the ending of summer 2013. I was moving away for university and she was too (although not as far). Let's just say we're almost on opposite sides of the state now and it's about an 11 hour drive. During the time I was moving we had a talk where I thought things would end between us. I decided prior, because of my own experiences, that I did not want to try a LDR any more. I agreed to doing a LDR with her though.


Fast forward to today. This semester of school is coming to a close. The first year wasn't horrible, but it has definitely taken it's toll. We've seen each other a few times over the course of the school year. She's stayed with me and I've gone and stayed with her too. Here's the thing. The relationship is fun and I enjoy it when I'm with her. When we're apart, things aren't so hot. I've started to dislike talking to her each day because I never feel like I have anything to talk about and I feel emotionless towards her. I want to spend time with her over the summer, but I also want to stay where I live and enjoy things here and spend time with my family and friends. I'm feeling pressured about how I can split the summer up to spend time with everyone. I feel like she misses me a lot more than I miss her. I feel guilty because I'm constantly attracted to other females on my campus and where I live. I feel like if I was truly happy, I wouldn't really think twice about that stuff. 


The other thing is that I have a really, really difficult time opening up to her. Something about her personality and the way she displays herself is a turn-off. What I mean is her mannerisms on the phone or over video chat. Even text messages can be total freaking bitch mode to me. It just seems like she doesn't laugh and joke about things like I do, which make conversation fun. It just doesn't flow with her, more times than not. It's gotten to the point where I don't like talking to her because of it. I don't have any fun. I don't open up to her. I have other friends I'll share stuff with, or even other female friends and when I share things with them it's like I'm having an interactive conversation with someone. It's nice. 


Recently (via video chat) she asked me if I was going to sleep in the next day and I said, ""I'm not sure. I'll probably sleep till 9am or 10am."" I leave it at that, like I do with all my friends and anyone I speak to. She replies with, ""So... that's a yes..."" It's not so much WHAT she said, but the WAY she says it and I've brought this up before. Or she'll tell me she's watching a show and enjoying it and I playfully say, ""You should watch two more seasons! :P"" She'll reply with, ""I have a life."" At the time she was doing homework so I joked and said, ""Babe, staying in your room all day doing homework =/= having a life."" And she will come back with, ""Yes."" It just makes me feel like shit. I've never had an issue with someone like this. 


I think we'll end up wanting to live two different places post-graduation. She'll want to move in or at least live in the same city together. Currently there's no way in hell I would move in. I think it would be crazy. I don't feel like I was able to spend enough time with her before we moved to even make a judgement call on that, not to mention all these issues I'm feeling with distance. I want to apply for internships over the summer and stuff and I'll feel guilty if I were to get one and wouldn't be able to visit over the summer. She'd be very upset and I feel like it's preventing me from doing that (even though I know we'd both agree it's fantastic for our career futures).


We don't share the same religion/spirituality (Catholic vs agnostic). She always has something to say about the food I cook myself too and it's really starting to get on my nerves now. If I cook anything with some oil, butter, eat a cookie, ANYTHING remotely sugary, fattening, or anything along those lines and I get a ""That's not healthy."" I'm just sick of it. Seems like ALL the little things are getting to me now, all the time. Am I overreacting and should I not ""sweat the small stuff?"" 


Time to wrap this up. I've been feeling this way on and off for months and I'm really thinking that things just aren't going to work out and it's a flame being smothered. I'm the one letting go and she's holding on, clueless. She's got a nice family, they like me, my family likes her and she likes my family, my friends like her and her friends like me. It's positive from the outside I suppose. And then in the back of my mind I worry that I'm feeling this way just because of the distance or maybe I'm paranoid and depressed and it's affecting the relationship. I don't know. I just want some advice and to see what you guys think. 

   
**TL;DR:** Thinking about breaking up with LDR GF because she's driving me crazy with... her personality I suppose. Maybe what we want is too different? "
24soad,7,2014-05-05,"Me [27F] with my boyfriend [29M] of 2 mos, didn't want to bail him out of jail",yeahwtf,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/24soad/me_27f_with_my_boyfriend_29m_of_2_mos_didnt_want/,"TL;DR -- New boyfriend has a bunch of crazy shit happen and needs me a lot over a short period of time. He moves in with me during his finals, supporting him feels like a bit much for me to handle. Matters come to a head when he frantically calls me thinking he's about to be arrested and wanting me to bail him out, we fight over my refusal. I basically kick him out, haven't really communicated since. Can we work this out when he's done with finals?
___________________________________________________

**EDIT: Thanks everyone for your comments, seems like there's a consensus. So he texted me after his final asking if he ""should put himself back on a website."" I called him and we had a talk in which I told him that I really care about him, but that the past week had taken a toll on my well-being and I wasn't sure I could handle him having a pattern of such incidents. He said that he felt that I had judged him unfairly, hadn't taken his side, and had led him on to believe that we had a relationship we didn't have per my reluctance to bail him out.**

**I then reminded him that we have only known each other for two months, and he said that he would be willing to put up bail money for a total stranger if someone was in need.**

**I wished him luck with that and told him I felt we weren't compatible, and he agreed. Guess that's the end.**

We met online in early March and hit it off pretty quickly. Neither of us had had much in the way of sex or relationships for a while, so we were stoked to have found each other. Intellectual chemistry was great, sexual chemistry was off the charts. He is in law school and seemed to be going in a good direction, so that was a bonus.

As things progressed, I saw several warning signs that I chose to ignore at the time. After all, I've had a somewhat crazy life myself and like to be with people who have had their own weird experiences. I should add that at this point, though, that I have my shit together and don't depend on anyone.

Basically, the warning signs were these: He's paranoid with super high anxiety and pretty much addicted to pot, which makes him feel better in the short run but seems to worsen his anxiety overall. He has some rather out-there schemes and theories. His life pattern involves friends going psycho on him and housing situations falling apart (will be relevant later).

Also, he kept mentioning how he likes the aspect of a relationship where people help each other out with major stuff. He half-jokingly asked me to do his laundry and grocery shopping, which I shut down, and he did coax me into helping him prepare for his finals. Maybe I am the one who is too reserved about this stuff - I've been used before and am really wary about it happening again, possibly too much so. He said he would always be willing to help me out in similar ways.

So all these signs had been cropping up, and I had been rather concerned but still loved being with him. About 9 days ago, things started coming to a head. He was going through finals then and is still in the middle of them - they're spread out over a few weeks - so he's been understandably stressed. He wants to transfer schools, so his grades are VERY important.

Nine days ago, we had hung out in the morning. I then went to work and got a series of frantic texts from him in the afternoon saying that his roommate had hacked into his email and sent out a threatening message. He and his roommate had mostly been friendly, but the roommate sounded a bit crazy and they had recently gotten into a dispute.

He needed a place to stay, so I offered him to stay with me and he accepted.

Over the next several days, I began to have more and more doubts. There was a totally weird situation where he asked me and a campus police officer to go with him back to his room so that he could retrieve his stuff - he was afraid his roommate would be there and start something/accuse him of stealing, and I felt that was really paranoid. Maybe I'm wrong though.

Also, he needed a ton of emotional support during this time. I'm a fairly reserved person and this was draining on me. However, I am willing to accept that this is probably my issue and that I need to work on being able to support a partner during a crisis.

About five days into him staying with me, we had a talk about him finding a hotel room for the next night - he said that he was totally willing to do that, but then he checked his bank balance and found that he only had about $600 left to pay for a hotel for about ten more days until his roommate would move out and he could move back into his room. I offered to have him stay with us if he chipped in on my roommate's portion of the rent and if she was cool with that, but I honestly wasn't really feeling it. Luckily, his best friend called during this conversation and offered to loan him money for the hotel room.

The next day, he had left and I was at home. I got a frantic call at around 4 pm in which he told me that the police wanted to speak to him right away and he was afraid they would arrest him. He needed two things from me: 1) to corroborate his story, and 2) to bail him out of jail if necessary, since he couldn't be there with more finals coming up.

Reddit, this is where I freaked out. In retrospect, I suppose I can understand why he was afraid, since he's been arrested before for weed. However, this totally came out of left field, and I definitely didn't handle it well - started yelling ""What the fuck!?"" and stuff like that. Mostly that was a response to him asking me to bail him out. I really did not want to post his bail and asked him to ask his mom or his best friend to do it. He said that whoever bailed him out needed to be there in person (which still puzzles me) and offered to give me money to do it; however, as mentioned above, he is totally broke and I was estimating that I would be liable for a lot of money if he missed his court date.

I started getting ready to leave and talk to the cops with him. Honestly, I knew then and now that I would probably end up bailing him out if it came to that, but I really wasn't happy about it.

He then texted me back saying that it was a false alarm - the police had asked him if he wanted to press charges. I was pissed at this point and texted back asking if he had found a hotel room for that night. We then talked on the phone and he informed me that he had not found one and had not talked to his friend who offered to pay for it. At this point, I was still pissy/abrupt and he told me he thought I was being really rude to him, and then he said that even though the bail thing had been a false alarm, he felt that it was an excellent test.

I again told him he needed to find a hotel room and that I was retracting my offer to have him keep staying with us. The conversation ended on a pretty sour note.

He came by that evening and packed up his things. We were both civil the whole time, didn't really talk about what had happened. Apparently his friend did end up paying for his hotel room. It seemed to me like we were done, but he mentioned something that indicated otherwise: We had talked before about him renting out his place as an Air BnB during the summer, staying at my house and giving me a cut of the proceeds. As far as I know, he doesn't have anywhere else to stay if he rents out his place, but he brought up renting out his place as something he definitely still planned to do.

When he left, it was Thursday night; it's now Monday and he has not contacted me. I know he has another final today and one Friday. I only reached out to him one time - I was looking at internships for myself and found one that would be right up his alley for summer, so I sent him the link.

**After all that, my question is this: Should I view that as a bunch of craziness at the wrong time in a new relationship and try to patch things up once he's done with finals?**

Also, I'm not sure what I should be doing right now. Should I leave him alone, or should I reach out? I am thinking about him taking his final today and want to send him a text later asking him how it went.

I mean, I am sure that his version puts me in a pretty bad light too. Girlfriend emotionally distant during a turbulent time, makes him move out during finals, and is willing to consider leaving him in jail over the weekend before an important exam. I can see how he would feel betrayed. We both could have handled things better.

I should also mention that I have a history of my mom asking me for large sums of money (a couple grand at a time) in very similar ways - the phone call out of the blue, the sudden financial demand, the refusal to understand that I'm not made of money and this really stretches me. When I got the call from him, it triggered all those memories and scared the shit out of me. Perhaps it was unfair, as rationally I know he's not her.

My friends have been telling me to run (by the way, some of them are redditors, hello to you guys if you ended up reading this). But I'm sure that his friends are equally on his side. I'm hoping to get a less biased opinion, which is admittedly hard when you're only hearing one side of the story. Is this salvageable or should I move on?"
24t1ie,1,2014-05-05,23 years and I don't know who I am.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/24t1ie/23_years_and_i_dont_know_who_i_am/,"I feel lost and soulless and without direction and purpose.  I’ve always leaned more towards the depressed state of mind, but I was always able to find help and pull through.  It seems as though being enrolled in college, having an internship, and a long term boyfriend distracted me from the fact that I was a depressed shell of a person, just doing the bare minimum to get through.  Now, 1 year out of college, a recently started relationship, and full time career are not distractions enough to keep me from thinking about my depression, anxiety, and border line personality disorder.  The aforementioned 3 items are constantly on my mind, ripping apart every minute shred of hope that I have left from the time I wake in the morning until the time I rest my head at night.  I’m paralyzed.  I have no enjoyment from anything anymore.  I am too anxious to get anything done at work and I’m scared that soon, my cover at work will be blown.  They will start to catch on to the fact that I am not able to do much.  I am completely withdrawn from everything.  In conversations, I am an awkward bystander not able to contribute anything to the conversation because of my fear of harsh criticism from my friends.  Even in my new relationship, I am scared to add anything.  Not even a thought or a comment about the subject at hand.  Even when I do get a glimpse of courage and speak up, I have no relevant stories or anecdotes to add.  I feel as though I know nothing. I know my bleak world and I can talk about that, but no cool personal stories to add.  I can ask some fantastic questions, however.  My questions are the only thing keeping the conversation going.  One day, I fear that my partner will realize this and leave me because I am too boring.  

My brain is constantly going, continuously churning with fears.  I am not good enough. I am not thin enough.  I am not smart enough.  I have nothing to add.  I have no hope.  I have no dreams.  I am a hollow body filled with a rapidly shriveling brain. When I do work up the courage to change my life, my brain strongly advises me to stop while I am ahead.  I feel like I am fighting a war with myself on a daily basis.  No one wins, but everyone suffers.  It is a pointless battle that is slowly killing me.  I do not see the point in living.  I often think about what it would be like to no longer be alive, but I do not actually want to kill myself.  Perhaps because deep down inside, somewhere in the corner of my brain, I think that things might get better.   If I lose weight, I will feel better.  If my acne cleared up, I would feel better.  If I had more experiences that would yield better conversation, if I had whiter teeth, if I tried harder, it would all magically disappear and I would be happy. I don’t even know what happy means. 

I don’t even know what would make me happy.  People ask me all of the time what I like to do for fun, what hobbies I engage in, etc.  I honestly don’t have an answer for them.  For the longest time, it was school.  But I cannot use that excuse any more.  I try to have fun and be happy by all the wrong ways.  One thing that has been killing me is my relationship.  I’ve never experienced such a strong duality of feelings before.  My partner and I have been dating for almost an entire month now, but it feels like so much longer.  From the moment we met, I was instantly attracted to him.  I knew without a doubt that I wanted to be with him.  I’ve never felt that way about anyone or anything.  He makes me feel incredibly loved, and when we are together, my anxieties and depression subside… that is until conversation arises.  Conversation is brutally painful and I hate every moment of it.  He talks about his craft with such conviction, passion, and dedication and it makes me sick to my stomach.  He can go on about how his line of work is extremely detail oriented, how much he knows about it, and how he wants to progress with it in the future.  I am bothered by all of this information for many reasons.  I am extremely jealous, almost to the point of pain, that he has found something that he loves, that he cares for, and that he is able to be extremely good at.  I hate that he found that and I haven’t.  I hate that he loves something so much and I know nothing about it.  When he talks about his line of work, I sit there like a dumb idiot nodding my head and trying to get by with my questions.  I have nothing to add to what he does, conversation wise.  I’ve contemplated doing research about his work so that way I can know more and eventually, add more value to the conversation and myself.  When I think about researching what he does, an immense wave of anxiety creeps over me and I get scared.  I’m scared that I will never be able to remember anything. I’m scared that I will research the wrong things.  Scared that if I do research it and bring it up in conversation, he’ll think I’m one of those needy and clingy girls who are only interested in what their boyfriend is interested in.  I don’t want to be that, but that’s what I feel like I am doing. I desperately long to have a passion of my own.  I want to be heard.  I want to add things.  I want to be confident in my speech when I talk to him.  

When I talk to him, or anyone who I feel plays a higher status “role” in my life, I freeze up and agonizingly dissect ever word that is about to come out of my mouth.  I stumble over words, chose not to say big words for fear of pronouncing them wrong.  I have a meek, unconfident speech.  An almost stable, non dynamic tone.  Who would want to even listen to me?  My lack of confidence is apparent in all that I am.  I don’t take care of myself.  Why should I?  I hate me.  I dress in unflattering clothes, barely put on makeup, smoke cigarettes, eat junk, slouch my shoulders, assume uncomfortable body posture.  It’s all in everyone’s face, especially mine.  Why can’t I just get it together and have some confidence in myself?  I deserve it, but I can’t bring myself to believe in me. 

What can I do to find my soul?  To find my purpose?  I’m not finding myself by sitting in a sterile office for 40 hours a week pushing paper, waiting until 5pm Friday afternoon.  When I get home, I’m too depressed and broken to get myself out there.  I am constantly in a state of mental and physical fatigue.  So much so that I don’t even care enough to muster up the energy it takes to take a shower or brush my teeth before bed.  I can’t invest my energy on improving my life because I have no energy to give.  

All of these thoughts plus countless of other agonies run through my head all day, every day.  And they are all hidden behind a relatively put together young 23 year old woman who always answers “I’m doing great, thanks!” to someone when they ask me how I am.   "

I had no idea who the guy was, we casual talked for a few minute and he mentioned he was in environmental protection, (which is related to my major) I asked him a few questions (that actually made me sound intelligent!) and he handed me his card, said shoot me an email some time and left. 

After doing my research this place is exactly the type of place I want to work, and this guy is the founder of it! 

So I have a few questions.

I plan on emailing him tomorrow morning (or should I email him tonight?) I'm not sure what to say. Can I just email him saying I enjoyed chatting with him, and would love to take him out to lunch? 

Assuming he likes me should I ask him about internships, knowing in august I will be in school 2 hours a way 4 days a week? 

Does it look bad that we were introduced by my therapist? 

What should I say? any advice would be appreciated! "

*Edit(in a dorm building)*
The first week was ok.  However after 2 weeks we had a ""family meeting"" to discuss things like cleanliness(pick up after yourself), guests(pre-warn for overnight guests and otherwise no guest between 11p and 10a(understandable people are sleeping or bathing during those times)) and things like that.  2 weeks later we have another meeting because one individual(Penny) is trying to be ""mom"" and going around to peoples' doors knocking to ask if you left something out or if you are going to put something away(however we didn't name any names we basically said we are all adults, treat each other as if we are we have moms at home who can yell at us).  It continued and Penny would make rude comments(like telling the single roommates that they will find a love like hers someday), so we had yet another family meeting where we kind of called her out on all of this.  It got to the point where we would be hanging out in the living room area and as soon as we saw her coming we would all book it to our rooms.
Another one of the girls(Phyllis) drank, a lot.  We didn't mind that she drank, as long as it wasn't to excess and she kept her stuff in her room.  Phyllis was one of the messier girls in the townhouse(I am not particularly clean, but i wasn't as bad), there would be times that she would make cookies and take half of them off the tray and leave the rest, or leave food out over night(like a chocolate pie, with some on the counter).  One day she saw an earwig in the bathroom and decided to bug bomb the bathroom, and forgot to turn on the vent or let anyone know, so when Penny went to go take a shower in the only full bathroom we have, she got a lung full of poisonous bug gas.  Phyllis also at the end of the semester left a lip gloss sized vibrator on the coffee table in the living room.
Myself, my good friend Jill, and one other girl, Meg, who happened to live right next to each other became very close which bothered Penny and Betty who lived upstairs with her.

Spring semester:
Penny has asked some of the blondest things i have ever heard of(I am a natural blonde and these things make me go ""WHAT!?!?!?""), like asking if she could use a freezer bad and not put it in the freezer, or knocking on everyones' door in the middle of the day when people are either in class or out on internships, because the microwave is not on, but is plugged in(the outlet for some reason keeps popping a fuse).  Another day she asked if she could put pasta she just cooked in a plastic dish, or would it melt.
Phyllis has been gone all semester on an internship in another state, but Meg met a guy and took Phyllis' place of annoying me.  The fact that she met the guy is not what is annoying, what is annoying is that he has a girlfriend that he has been with for over 3 years.  She made clear to him that she was having feelings for this guy, and he told her that he too was gaining feelings for her, but he has a girl friend.  He keeps making moves towards her (knowing well that he is still committed to his gf and that my suite mate likes him), like giving her long hugs and lifting her off the ground, and smacking and grabbing her butt, and telling her that he wants to kiss her.
Spring break comes and myself, Meg, and Betty stayed on campus because i was working in a classroom during the week and they had internship.  They had decided that it was going to be a no boys week(mind you they are both technically single). So i went along with it but had asked early in the week if we could end the ban on friday because it is my break too and i would like to have my bf or just guy friends over during that time.  I understand giving them the week since they have stuff to do.  I did not get a determinative answer from either of them.  Friday night comes and around 9 at night i get a message from Meg saying that my boyfriend can come over  Which at that point We'd get there, have a little bit of time and then he would have to leave because it would be 11, and we have to give a 2 day notice on overnight guests because the girls are insane.  I get home at 11:30 and out walks Meg with the guy she is ""dating"" with alcohol in their hands.  When she asked where my bf was i told her at home cause it is after 11 and i wasn't able to give a 2 day notice(hint hint).  The guy left around 6 the next morning and i learned that in their drunken extravaganzas they had ""relations"".
After months of myself and Jill telling her that she needs to do something about the guy she finally was like ""look you need to figure your shit out, you need to decide if you want me or your gf.""  And then when she gave him a time limit and the time was running out she was like ""Well maybe, if he chooses his gf, i'll tell her that he has been dating me and we had sex""
She also has a tendency of ignoring when i ask if my bf can spend the night

I'd rather live with guys they are so much better than girls."
24tn1q,45,2014-05-05,"/r/Filmmakers, Let's talk about resumes...",wildlikechildren,Filmmakers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Filmmakers/comments/24tn1q/rfilmmakers_lets_talk_about_resumes/,"Having worked in Production Offices for several years now, I've seen a lot of resumes go through the office from all different departments. On some shows I'm the keeper of the resume email that is often on local union reports, film commission websites and various production reports. I get anywhere from 10 to 75 emails a day so it's safe to say I've seen way too many bad resumes. I sort through these resumes by department and forward any along that may be of good use to a department in need. Most of these ""bad"" resumes are from those who are just starting out or trying to get their foot in the door. 

This morning I received an email to my personal email from what seemed to be a guy fresh out of college. The resume attached was just plain awful. I should mention it also looked just like mine did when I first started out. It wasn't a resume, it was an essay and everything was wrong with it. I unfortunately had to learn the hard way about my resume so I kindly replied and offered advice if he wanted it. So now, I've decided to put this advice in long form and present my formula for a solid resume. I'll give you examples and answer any questions you may have below. This advice does not pertain to all industries. This advice is strictly for those looking to work in TV and Feature Films. 

[This is a simple formula I think would be useful follow. Formatting and whatnot is all up to you. 
](http://i.imgur.com/f4s5B9n.png)

**Your resume should answer the following questions:**

* What is their name and contact info? (I should not have to look for this)
* Which Department do they work in?
* What kind of experience do they have working in that department? (Absolutely Include position &amp; picture title, Maybe include Department Head, Line Producer/UPM, Studio, Location, Dates)
* What special skills/software do they have that pertain to this department?


**Your resume should be all these things:**

* Simple and Clean
* Straight to the point
* Organized
* Show proper font usage 
* One page (The only reason you should have a second page is if you have a kit to be rented, IE. Construction Coordinators, Steady Cam Ops, Video Assists, DITs, Etc.)
* in .PDF format 
* Cohesive. Who ever you give it to should be able to look at it instantly and know which department you want to work in. It's great if you've dabbled in different departments but what are they supposed to do with a resume that has Grip, Set PA, 2nd AC and Set Dresser right after each other? You can always have multiple resumes created specifically for a certain department. Departments want to be confident that you want to work in their department and have experience working your way up in it. 


**DON'T do the following:**

* Explain or describe your position, [like this](http://i.imgur.com/n32OsEV.png). I oddly see this a lot and half of the time the descriptions don't fit the position's requirements on a union show. I know what a Set PA, Grip, Camera Operator and Art Director all do and so do the Department Heads. Now, If there is special paperwork or required skills that pertains to your department that you know how to do then that would go under your ""Special skills"" part at the bottom of the page. For example, if the position above you has different requirements/paperwork and you know how to do these, then that is what you should list. [Here's an example.](http://i.imgur.com/EILM0Ch.png) [Example 2](http://i.imgur.com/ZVLa8Fn.png) [Example 3](http://i.imgur.com/JJNIgYv.png)
* List your self as a department head if you are starting out. You may have been the Key Grip on your student films or the Director of Photography on the short film that your buddy wrote but you are absolutely not any of those things if you are looking to work in the TV and Feature film industry and just starting out. Some may disagree but I personally see no problem with taking your credit as the DP and making it ""Camera PA"" or your Art Director credit on your friends music video and making it ""Art PA"". You worked on that short film, local artist music video etc. so give yourself a credit that will be relevant to the job that you're trying to apply for. When starting out, you want to show that you're willing to work from the bottom up. Just be smart about this. 

**What if I don't have any credits?**

* We all start somewhere. Don't get discouraged, you may just have to network and hustle much more than what makes you comfortable. Slap up a little resume with your contact info, education and skills and your interests. Get in contact with your local film commission, get the numbers/emails of local productions in the area and offer yourself up as an intern. Some productions' insurance companies don't allow them but often times they do. Send in a resume with the words INTERN all over the subject and email. 
* Utilize Facebook. Join your local filmmakers facebook groups and meet people, reply to crew wanted ads. Stay away from craigslist.  
* Volunteer at local film festivals. It's at least something film related to put on a resume and the connections you can make there are always beneficial. 






I'm not an expert but I hope I'm able to give some clarity. I've been writing this for a couple days now so It's a work in progress. I'm sure I'll think of more and I'll be more than happy to answer questions below.

**TL;DR - Cut the bullshit and keep it simple.**"
24u1n1,2,2014-05-05,Starting tonight.,[deleted],NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/24u1n1/starting_tonight/,"I just discovered this subreddit and I'm ready to make a change in my life. I've known that I have a problem for a long time now but haven't tried to do anything about it.


I don't think I really developed this problem until about a year and a half ago when I moved 8 hours away from my girlfriend for an internship. We had been dating around a year and a half at the time. We were pretty sexually active, although we never actually had sex, and after I moved away began doing the deed with much more frequency than I had been when we were living in the same place. 


Shortly after moving, while my girlfriend was in town for a visit we did something very stupid and my girlfriend became pregnant. A few weeks later she found out that she had had a miscarriage. This was unbelievably taxing emotionally and caused us both an unbearable amount of stress, compounded by the fact that we were 8 hours apart and couldn't be there for each other physically for more than two days at a time.


Fast forward a few months and I'm still watching porn way more than I should be. My girlfriend and I take a trip to a B&amp;B where we plan to have sex with protection, as she's been on birth control ever since the miscarriage (about 3 months).


This is when I really realized that I had a problem. I couldn't get it up for her that night no matter how hard I tried. We were both so emotionally drained and exhausted from the past couple of months that I was afraid that night was going to irreversibly damage our relationship. The next morning I woke up and was able to get an erection, so I eagerly tried to start sexual intercourse with her. We had sex, but we both felt fairly unsatisfied emotionally afterwards as there hadn't been any romance or love in what we had done, which I can see was entirely my fault for simply wanting to do have sex while I was still hard, like I was checking something off of a to-do list. 


As it turned out, my girlfriends birth control wasn't working and she became pregnant again as a result of that night, and shortly after had another miscarriage.


Outside of my closest friend I've never told anyone about the above. It's been a little over a year and my girlfriend and I are still together and live in the same city again, although it's been very challenging. Since the second miscarriage our sex-life has been nearly non existent. I completely understand how my girlfriend feels and I haven't made any effort to push the issue with her. I know she needs time and I'm not in any hurry. However, I've continued to watch porn and fap obsessively to compensate for the lack of sexual intimacy in our relationship and I believe that cutting out this behavior will make my relationship stronger and improve my life in other ways as well. I'm looking forward to starting this journey.

24u2on,5,2014-05-05,Letter to a friend (debating on showing this to her or not),[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/24u2on/letter_to_a_friend_debating_on_showing_this_to/,"Dear Friend, 

I would like to formally apologize for making this friendship much harder than it ever had to be. I am pretty good at doing that. I want to take this time to explain myself and hope to help you understand the struggle that is my life. 
Let's begin with the previous summer, when we were first getting to know each other and in some 'in between' relationship that wasn't a committed relationship but wasn't a friendship. Those three months may have been the best three months I have ever had since feeling the effects of my depression 5 or 6 years ago. You made me want to be a better student, a better guy and overall better person. 
Things went wrong, and we had a few shaky months in there. School started going south, and my depression has been worse than ever. 
Please don't take it the wrong way; it is by no means your fault. You did not make my depression worse, me bottling it up and not doing anything about it for years made it worse. 
But, now we are at the friendship level of talking every single day. I have talked to you about my depression and you have responded with some advice. Here is why I have not been the best friend in the world lately. 

I fell in love with you very quickly and very unexpectedly. I never told you that I loved you, out of fear of losing you, but I was. Better yet, I still am and it is so hard to not tell you how much I love you. The other day, at the fashion show, when you walked out on stage, looking better than ever before, I felt like I had fallen in love with you all over again. Everytime I see you, I lose my train of thought and want to cry. I have constant dreams with you involved and I wake up in tears. Waking up with you next to me on my birthday gave me a tiny reminder of what it felt like to have such a wonderful person want me in their life even if I didn't understand why.

But, I am suffering from a disease that takes over my entire state of mind. I no longer feel the motivation to get out of bed, do my homework, talk to my friends, go out to the bars or really anything at all. I have to leave social events early on consistently because I know I am about to start crying uncontrollably and would much prefer to do that in the comfort of my own bedroom. You are leaving for three months to go to LA for an internship and its the longest I will have gone without seeing you since we first met, and it scares me. I know you don't want to hear all this, but I have to be honest, I am so afraid of losing you in my life, but I am so good at pushing those close to me away. When I hear you talk about your ex, or some guy you went on a date with, or some guy that was flirting with you, I lose my train of thought and am stuck in this whirlwind of 'why doesn't she love me' and 'what did I do wrong.' I don't know how I would handle you not in my life, because those daily texts from you are the only things I look forward to every single day of my life, even if we aren't quite talking in the way that we used to.

24u9ga,8,2014-05-06,Update + Membrane Sweep Symptoms? (40weeks +1day),goomygoomy,BabyBumps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/24u9ga/update_membrane_sweep_symptoms_40weeks_1day/,"Here's an update, plus I have some questions about membrane sweep. I am officially overdue. It sucks. Have gained about 55 lbs. the entire pregnancy, and I feel like a bloated beached whale. SPD pain has been hard to deal with since about week 20, and I am just physically and emotionally exhausted, but I am still excited and can't wait to give birth. I am planning on a natural birth, but I am not opposed to changing my plans or intervention in needed. SO and I have mostly everything set up in our nursery space, only thing left to do is a little bit of organization that my SO said he'd take care of. For the time being we have to co-habit with the baby in our room since we are living at his grandparents house. Luckily the room is large enough for all three of us. We plan on moving out once I can return to work, hopefully with in the next 6-12 months we'll have our own place with a room just for baby. Anyway, today earlier this morning I had a 40 week ultrasound (almost peed myself. I hate the whole having to have a full bladder thing) everything on the ultrasound came back looking good and baby was very healthy looking even though he's measuring above average. Estimated weight is about 8.5-10 lbs. In the 80th percentile in growth. This scares me a little since I am worried about tearing a lot. I am a pretty small person 5'2"" and everything about me is small except for this huge new baby bump. Anyway later on today I had another appointment to go over ultrasound results with OBGYN, have a membrane sweep, and talk about induction. If baby hasn't arrived by Friday I have one more appointment with my OBGYN and we'll set an induction date for sometime in the beginning of next week. I hope it doesn't come to that. Membrane sweep was very uncomfortable and a little awkward since my OBGYN had an intern with her and she helped out. I almost cried after it was done, not from pain or discomfort, but I felt a little violated, but I chalked this up to my hormones raging wild, and it being a little awkward with my SO in the room with me. Now here is the kicker about an hour after I got home I just crashed and felt really out of it, and I am wondering if these symptoms are normal to have after a membrane sweep. I got really sleepy, so I cat napped all day probably getting in about 6-8+ hours of extra sleep. Then upon waking up my hands and feet are swollen worse than ever, my face is flush and I'm very warm (took my temp. it's normal at 97.6 fahrenheit), and now a slight headache and some cramping anytime when the baby moves. Is this normal? Should I consult with my nurses line at my clinic? Also I just want to say I am so thankful for the community here on r/babybumps. I lurk almost everyday and it keeps me so positive, and the advice/community has really been supportive throughout this whole process. I love you guys. I hope I can update you soon with a birth story and pics. Good luck to all of you."
24uefc,1,2014-05-06,I was going to rant about not being able to talk to girls but I decided to talk about more important stuff,the_axe_minister,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/24uefc/i_was_going_to_rant_about_not_being_able_to_talk/,"I guess if I'm going to rant and get everything off my chest, then I'm going to have to go back a while. I would rather write a history for the rather than a rant, because it bursts out of me and I want to shout about it and explain it to everyone. Being mostly rational, or at least repressed, I haven't told all of it to anyone but my therapist. She's heard it backwards and forwards, but I have the chronic, strong urge to tell the story to someone else, get fresh ears on it. 

During finals week of college, five years ago, I tried to kill myself twice. After the second time, my parents drove me back home and I checked into a psychiatric hospital. I spent 3 weeks in the hospital, got out for about 5 days and had to go back in because the Abilify they put me on gave me unbearable akathesia, then got out again in mid-June. They diagnosed me with severe depression with psychotic features, which by my reckoning was a pretty accurate diagnosis (even though I probably could also be manic--see below) and put me on Risperidone, which really, really sucked. I was crazy, legitimately crazy during that time, all I could think about was either taking drugs or wanting to die or both. In August I went back in because I made another attempt and ended up in the hospital again, spent a month there, and then a month at an inpatient program and then 3 months at a farm for sad drug addicts which I left because I had health problems. That was January. As a result of me being crazy and also the treatment for craziness, I had gained about ~50 pounds from stress eating and medication, I had skin fungus, I didn't shave, etc.

For about two months I was like that, basically I smoked a lot of weed and tried to order drugs off the internet and was so, so stupid, so unbelievably stupid. Then my psychiatrist at the time diagnosed me with ADHD and a Learning Disability then gave me a bunch of Adderall and Vyvanse, and that made me even crazier and more desperate for some kind of chemical help. I stole money from my parents to buy weed and a couple of times cocaine, almost got a possession charge, and did a lot of other dumb stuff. It was like I couldn't stop—I don't remember how I felt then, it's years ago now, less than five years but more than one, but from my actions it appears that I just couldn't , whether it was mania, or Adderall or whatever, I'd just keep doing the same stuff over and over again. Like I'd go out in my parents car to smoke weed with my friends even though my mom was begging me to stop, just to feel slowed down for a little bit. At the time though, I loved the Adderall, it gave me the motivation to shave and shower consistently and it made me lose a bunch of weight. And somehow I felt it even made my personality better like girls were more attracted to me when I when I was on it. It was weird because I was crazy on one hand but accomplishing things on the other. During this time I graduated from a six month full time culinary program, took two creative writing courses and made plans to return to college. 

The summer made me crazy, or my culinary program ending gave me too much time. I went to raves and did a bunch of molly which was fun, but I ended up in the hospital again because I tried to commit suicide by overdose. That was stupid and I knew it was stupid because I read so much about how to commit suicide and knew that overdose rarely works. After that I spent a month in a mental hospital and somehow convinced my parents to send me back to college. By the time that month in the hospital was up, I gained back all the weight I had lost on Adderall (they took me off of it) and stopped taking care of my appearance. In addition I was on about 15 milligrams of Zyprexa, which as anyone who has been on it, will make you blow up like a balloon.

Call it gumption, or maybe some level of privilege, or maybe just the effect of time, but somehow I've been stable since then which is to say I've been stable enough to stay at college for three years. Next semester, I will graduate college with a bachelors in computer science from one of the best undergraduate programs in the country. Getting this far was hard, for me at least, I don't know if it would be hard for anyone else. One of the fictions that tided me or comforted me during that lost year was the idea that I'd come back from this crucible or whatever it was and write a novel or something beautiful that would keep people alive, or maybe I had some profundity to impart to others like I was a prophet shouting in the desert. Never really worked out though, I realized about a year in that I didn't have the temerity to make it in the literary world, got drunk one night and decided to become a Computer Scientist. 

Now here I am after my fourth semester of doubling and tripling on Computer Science courses. I'm trying to find internships and I've wondered if the application process would've been easier if I hadn't been concerned with fiction and literature, or spent more time doing extracurriculars,. or had started my Computer Science major earlier, or had double majored in math, or my GPA hadn't sucked because I was either suicidal or on heavy antipsychotics for several years, etc. But you know those are good things to wonder, good problems to have compared to where I was three years ago. I'm not actively trying to kill myself or crazy on drugs and even though I'm really emotional and anxious all of the time (as always), I can control it. In addition I quit smoking and joined a sports team so even though I still have a barrel stomach and stress eat a lot, I'm pretty athletic and have lost a decent amount of weight. When I started this rant, I going to complain about not being able to talk to girls or whatever, but I had to start from the beginning to explain why that was, and ended up telling you what was/is really on my chest. So yeah."
24ufq4,1,2014-05-06,"I'm considering hard-mode, but GF is nervous.",[deleted],NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/24ufq4/im_considering_hardmode_but_gf_is_nervous/,"Summer vacation is coming up, which is a major relief. However, I've had trouble with PMO for about a month (probably due to finals). Once I get home, I'm going to start off with a strict regime from dawn until dusk, including cardio, lifting, reading, writing, possibly job, meditation, diet,  and working around the house. I've been considering a few hobbies as well. I also have an internship, but it will probably only take up 10 hours per week.

I've been struggling with PMO addiction for about 6 years, I've been with my GF for 4. She's enthusiastic about helping me get over it, but it is also a huge source of worry and stress on her. It has been a long and tough road trying to understand this addiction, and I have to thank NoFap for helping enlighten both of us. My GF will be working during the week at a camp and will be unavailable for most of the day. Also, both of us live with our parents. She lives about 10 minutes away. 

Because of each of our pasts, my sex drive is way more active than hers, which is an obvious dilemma in any relationship. I'm considering trying Hard Mode over the summer in hopes to reset my drive in some way. However, my GF thinks that it may be too risky, and I'll just be setting myself up for failure (not exactly what she said; she tries to remain as supportive ad trusting as possible). Also, she would miss the experience (i hope).

Should I try Hard Mode over the summer? Even if i don't, there won't be many opportunities over the summer anyway. Will this even help curtail my sex drive? Are there any added benefits to Hard Mode? 

Thanks for any responses."
24uhru,1,2014-05-06,Rock bottom... Hopeless..,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/24uhru/rock_bottom_hopeless/,"I feel so low right now... Despite being depressed ever since middle school, my feelings of hopelessness have escalated to a new level.

I've had low self-esteem and was depressed since grade 6... I was severely bullied by my ""best friend"", and she spread all these false rumours and had other people bully me as well. They were so mean, I felt worthless from such a young age and used to cry every day. I told myself that once I graduated and got to college, everything would be different. I had high expectations for college and thought that I would be happier.

I'm 19 now, but I'm now realizing I will never be able to escape from my past... I'm now a crazy, depressed, angry person with social anxiety, and I'm sure it all roots from the bullying. I was so excited for college, but once I moved into rez, I became afraid. My anxiety came out. I ended up sleeping around for a bit (I wanted to feel loved), which I really regret. I actually lost my virginity to a guy I met at a frat, who forced me into it. I kept resisting and he kept guilt-tripping me into doing it. Later, I even slept with a guy who had a girlfriend (I did not know at the time, though). I found out afterwards, and she found out about us. He threw me under the bus, blamed everything on me, and they basically just went on with their lives leaving behind the ""hoe who tried to home wreck their relationship"". I never got closure from this and I still feel pissed off about it. 

I was so focused on my depression and emotions that I neglected my studies and got kicked out of school. Now I'm back home and my parents are so disappointed in me.

So now I'm just angry, irritable and depressed every single day.

* I'm still pissed off about he guy who fucked me over... There's no closure for me and without it, I can't move on. It's been a while but I rage every single day.
* I'm pissed at myself for allowing myself to get into that kind of situation. I hate myself for sleeping around for that period of time... I can't believe I fucking did that. Some people may feel okay with that, but it's not okay for me- it only made me feel sadder.
* My parents used to be well off but due to a major investment fail and a few stupid financial decisions, we are now struggling to survive. They used to tell me not to worry about college funds and that they've got it all covered, but now that is no longer the case and I don't have any money at all saved. I suppose it doesn't matter since I got kicked out anyway, and I'm 19- old enough to work to sustain myself.
*BUT, I have issues with work. I've had four jobs before, and the longest I've lasted was four months. At my last job, I got angry, couldn't control it, and made a scene at work. Obviously, I got let go. The job before that was a sales associate job. My social anxiety got so bad when ever I was on the floor and my manager told me that she could not have someone like that at her store, and I got let go. I just scored a new job a few weeks ago; today was my first day, and the manager already told me he was going to let me go because he does not think the job is suitable for me. I'm good at interviews, but when it comes to the job, my real self shows and I can tell managers always regret hiring me. It's disheartening.. Makes me feel worse about myself than I already do. I really need money.. Yet I just can't seem to keep a job.
* I've lost pretty much all my friends (not that I had many to begin with). Everyone is doing well at college, involved, doing well in school, scoring internships, etc. I feel so left behind... The only friends I have left are just like me - no ambition, lost in life. 
* A part of me really wants to get somewhere in life, yet I have come to realize that I have lost all my passions. When I was younger, I had so many interests.. I loved to read, I loved soccer, I was interested in computer programming, etc. Sometime along the way, my interests disappeared. Nothing appeals to me, all I want to do is sleep my life away. 
* I've seen a counsellor and numerous doctors, and they all got frustrated with me and told me I'm too confusing. 

I've never felt this fucking hopeless and low in my life before, and I've had MANY lows. Wtf is wrong with me. I hate this I just wish I can start over in life.. But that's impossible I either have to live with this horrible feeling of being depressed and apathetic everyday or just kill myself"
24ulti,6,2014-05-06,First proper appointment at the gender clinic.,Naidje,transpositive,https://www.reddit.com/r/transpositive/comments/24ulti/first_proper_appointment_at_the_gender_clinic/,"A few days ago I finally was able to see someone at the hospital’s gender dysphoria clinic. This is a pretty big deal for me, because up until now I’ve been stuck on a waiting list. I’ve sought out a therapist and a support group on my own, and have gotten a head start on permanent removal of my facial hair, but finally seeing someone at the clinic means I’ve taken the first concrete step towards starting HRT.

The system concerning transgender patients in my country (The Netherlands) isn’t exactly ideal. Informed consent does not exist here and self medicating is very difficult. The vast majority of us are forced to go through so called “gender teams” of which there only exist 3 in the country.  Of those 3, there’s one at the VUMC hospital in Amsterdam that basically has a monopoly position, treating 85 percent of all Dutch transgender patients. Because of this the waiting lists are incredibly long, and because of the sheer numbers and lack of funding by insurance companies they’ve stopped accepting new patients since january this year. I was very lucky to have contacted them a mere month before they closed applications and as such I’m now able to receive care from them.

They maintain a very strict protocol for treatment with the first phase consisting of establishing a diagnosis of gender dysphoria. This is quite a lengty process that takes about 6 months on average. A patient has monthly meetings with various professionals. Mostly psychologists and psychiatrist, but also endocrinologists. Once the “gender team” has to their satisfaction established that gender dysphoria is present, the patient moves on to the actual treatment phase, which is HRT and transitioning to living life as their preferred gender.

So anyway, that’s how this stuff works in The Netherlands. It’s a very cumbersome process to say the least, not even going into the problems with lack of funding. Unfortunately it’s just one of the hoops I’ll have to jump through in order to start living my life authentically. I’m happy to have made it this far and be making proper progress.

The first appointment at the clinic was pretty scary. In my day to day life I’m still presenting as male. The only time I’ve ever been out in girl mode was going to my support group meeting. It still feels very new and awkward to me and I don’t quite have a lot of confidence in my appearance yet. However, the more apparent my wish to live as a woman is to the gender team, the sooner they will greenlight me for HRT, so it’s in my best intererst to present myself as feminine as possible to them.

I asked a good friend to help me out and she was amazing enough to agree. She helped me pick out which clothes to wear, and accompanied me to the appointment like the champ she is.

I had just received my fourth IPL hair removal session only 4 days before, and my face was still very raw. My skin was really still too sensitive to shave properly, but I did the best job I could and used makeup to cover up my beard shadow.

The ride over there was kinda scary as well. I don’t like using public transport to begin with, and I just had the feeling like everyone was staring at me. Thank goodness my friend was with me. I could focus on her and feel less self consious. Once we arrived the man at the desk was incredibly kind and referred to both of us as ladies, which felt awesome. After a minute or so the psychologist came out to meet us.

Most of our time was spent by him explaining what I could expect from him and the clinic in general and clearing up any questions I had. Later on I told him a little about my life. Mostly about college and my internship and a bit about my psychiatric history. It really was more of an introduction than a proper session, but next time we will go more indepth. I’m also registered as Nadia in their system instead of my old name, which makes me incredibly happy.

All in all, the talk itself wasn’t that spectacular, but it does represent a big step on the road to starting HRT."

(http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/23z3cw/update_3_update_2_update_me_21_f_with_my_father/)

So I received my internship and forwarded the acceptance to my dad. It's my finals week and I couldn't hold off much longer in not talking to him so I'm sort of weening the communication back in. I woke up to texts and emails of course. His wife is saying we all need to be in family counseling together to ""handling this in a loving and mature way."" My stepmom says not speaking to him for weeks when he's been ill has to be addressed and we all need to go.

I'm not sure if I mentioned this or not in any posts but I may have in comments. We'v had family ""meetings"" in the past where the two of them would gang up on me on things that weren't really issues and I'd become extremely isolated. However, this was never during therapy. My dad has mentioned in the past that in his therapy sessions with his wife, she takes control often and is overbearing.

I do not think it's her business and do not want her involved in our session. I told her I agree that my dad and I need to go to therapy which is why the therapist reached out to him in the first place, however, from my understanding he refused her help at the time. Well now she's saying he did apparently go. I assume this was not when she first reached out but when he realized I was serious about not speaking to him...most likely a long while after he refused to let her speak to me.  

While I do agree therapy is needed, we have never had my stepmom there for the reason being that I refuse. And I continue to refuse. I assume my father thinks that this issue is so drastic, completely from my end, that she needs to be there as well to help him maintain control. They cannot and will not force me to go if I am uncomfortable with the circumstances.

My father cannot use therapy as a weapon against me. His wife acted as if I should have known he spoke with the therapist. However, as mentioned in a previous post, he did not allow the therapist to update with me. Obviously I assumed that he refused help as well since he refused for me to get help from her. Now that it's convenient for him, and he's so ""ill,"" I'm the monster in all this and it ""needs"" to be addressed with the entire family. 

Of course, I received not one, but several emails from my dad. He didn't mention therapy or not talking to me. They all consisted with him trying to take control and telling me what to do. Things I need to get done, things I need to get started on. I already subleased my apartment and did a lot of the things he mentioned. It's not like I'm completely clueless in this process. But of course, he needs to feel like this is his internship and not mine...

Anyway, thank you all for your help these past few weeks. I have therapy in an hour to discuss this, but I'm not sure how to transition from not talking to him or how to make it clear I will not have my stepmom involved in this. It's not like I can physically keep her from driving to the therapist's office. She may seem gentle right now, but knowing her, she will put down the act and push her way there and threaten me in some way since I've been so inconsiderate of my father's illness and this needs to be done as a family and group effort.

TL:DR; Got the internship. Let my dad know. Now we need to have therapy involving his wife apparently. How do I get her uninvolved without having a war?

EDIT: [This comment](http://ud.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/23z3cw/update_3_update_2_update_me_21_f_with_my_father/ch3gyg7) mentions our past family meetings and what my parents are like in general. If you'd like me to give a more detailed example of these meetings, I'd be glad to."

We arrived in Albuquerque yesterday and are currently staying in a hotel. We have been looking for places to stay, but so far the best places will not be available for a couple of weeks. We have called a few places and have a few that we can settle for, but I wanted to confirm that there wasn't a better deal anywhere else.

There are two of us (males). We would prefer a 2 bed 2 bath that is somewhere near Eubank or UNM or near the Sandia labs themselves. We are willing to pay up to 1200 a month if utilities are included. We would also prefer if the place was at least partly furnished, but this is not a strict requirement. We will only be staying for the summer (3 months), no pets and no smoking. Anyone know where I can find such a place?"

I have become really dependent on a stupid machine that owes me nothing whatsoever.

Last Thursday, my computer refused to start. I remember I installed some Windows updates the day before. After trying and restarting and using system repair and nagging my engineer boyfriend about fixing it and seeing him try basically everything he could, the machine still refused to turn on. I did the ""math"" in my head and decided I didn't need to try and save my files. Everything I really need and cannot replace is backed up in the cloud, and everything else (like video game mods, series, films, music, etc.) I could download again. 

I was gone from Thursday evening until Sunday afternoon.

On Sunday, I booted up a Windows disk and reinstalled the whole thing from scratch. It worked. Perfectly. I started reinstalling my mod manager, Office, etc. I went to bed early and let it install its Windows updates, which were 148 updates. Quite a lot, don't you think? While reinstalling stuff on Sunday, I had my laptop open to fiddle on the internet while waiting. When I shut that one down

Monday morning, my PC won't start. I asked my dad (also an IT consultant) to look into it, but we are none the wiser. I thought, well, it's not the same, but I'll use my old laptop, at least I'll be able to work on my thesis or something, but... it wouldn't start up! Exactly the same error message, exactly the same problem.

What do the two have in common? Right, both installed (probably the same) updates prior to not starting up again. I tell my dad this, and he doesn't believe me because ""mom has the same windows with the same updates and she doesn't have the problem"". 

Meanwhile, Windows' System Repair has done something good for a change and got my laptop back up but... god damn it. How did I end up so addicted to that machine? My hobbies are on there: video games, music, films, Photoshop, web design. My school work is on there: thesis, exams, reports. My ""job"" is on there. Everything in my life that isn't going out with friends (which I simply don't do during the week because of my internship and my friends' similar thinking) needs a computer. 

I feel terrible and I hate admitting it, but I can't live without that machine. "

No, they weren't technically breaking any rules, and no this isn't a post to build a case and go after them, they're still a good company. It just sucks. Details inside",MR_MOOSECELS,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/24vlq2/lost_my_internship_because_i_got_time_off_of_work/,"I got into a car crash a few weeks ago (quick search through my comment history will show its been a topic of discussion for me in a few subs). Anyways, it screwed me up. That car was the only thing I owned beside this laptop I'm typing off (which isn't even paid off yet) and I worked for 2 years to buy that damn thing cash. While I got over the fact that Cougar was gone, the physical repercussions stuck around. I got a concussion in the crash.

No, this wasn't a wild crash, no the airbags didn't go off, and no I didn't black out, but a concussions a concussion and I still have headaches. I only took two days off from work post crash because I *really* cared about my internship, hell you could call it my full time job I was putting in 40 hours a week, and I just wanted to get back. Stupid, I KNOW, but the day I went back I felt fine. As projects and deadlines started mounting, my headaches began returning, and my depression which I was diagnosed with in December started ramping up my life became miserable. The last couple weeks of my life were a struggle everyday. Shit, I don't even know how I made it so long. I took yesterday off after I had broken a lot of shit in my room (moved back home to help cope/keep myself safe) and the doc said stay out of work for two weeks. Went to the psychologist later that night and told him what's up and I felt like for the first time in a long time things were really lining up for me. I'd have a week; I didn't want to miss the whole two weeks and told my doc that flat out, but during that time I could explore new interests without unnecessary stress. I went out and bought a drawing tablet yesterday to hook up to the mac, I bought a bunch of dogecoins because hey who knows lol, and today I'm learning to drive stick. Life looks on the rise for me. But, there's a catch.

I shot out an email this morning, real genuine, telling the team that I'm gonna be out for a bit and that the doc suggested two weeks. I scanned his note, put my cell in so people could call and ask questions, and I said full disclosure about everything I DID NOT want people think I was bitching out of anything. So I just got an email from HR/the leader of my intern program saying that since the three weeks built into the schedule after May 15th fall after my suggested May 19th return there's no need for me to come back and my time is complete with the company.

Really? I feel like I was drug (dragged) into a back alley and shot, like how could they send me out like that? I get that the time *is optional* but still. From the start I said I'd do it, I WANTED to do it. Now I feel like I'm walking out of this without finishing. Meanwhile, a major point of discussion and thought about a source of my depression is that I lack followthrough and this is just really a kick to the dick. I know its an opportunity to go do new things, get better, and become awesome, but shit guys and girls. That job..that's all I did. Yeah I'm trying to explore new hobbies, but shit. I put everything into that job man. Everything. Nevermind the fact that I'll miss the people there and I didn't get to say goodbye. 

I don't care about the recommendation, I can throw it on a resume and with my other experience/GPA/school I go to/connections I've built up I'll be fine finding a job. That's not the problem. I just wanted to finish this. I wanted to do it, to wear that suit on that last day and give them the presentation thanking them for giving me a chance when I was down. I wanted to thank the CEO for shaking my hand on the first day, unbeknownst to him only 5 days after I was diagnosed with severe depression. I guess I'm gonna be on here a bit more since I don't have a job now...but yeah. So, that's where I'm at, going to the gym soon, telling the people in my office at school that my co-op is..done, and I guess I'll learn stick shift later tonight. Not the worst day I've had, but its definitely a life-defining one. 

**TL;DR** Was already depressed but getting through the day at work then suffering once I got home. Got in a crash and the concussion compounded things. Was told to take 2 weeks off from the doctor, started getting a plan together to take advantage of the time, and my return lined up with the middle of the end of my time working and they told me don't bother coming back. Feelings mixed, jimmies slightly rustled.

Any thoughts/comments/coping mechanisms are appreciated."

So there you have it, my summer goals. Now, brutalize me with inspiring quotes, criticism of my goals, subs to look into, advice to take, and sites that will help me along the way. I want to come back here every week and give a report on how everything is going. I know a lot of the things I listed may seem linked, irrelevant, or strange, but these goals are actually really important to me. I don't think I've ever set goals for myself, and I certainly have never check up on myself to see how I've come along with my goals. I'm trying to move forward and create a better life moving ahead. Any support helps, and I'm looking forward to this sub.

I'm going to be an intern at Sandia National Lab this summer. I'll be there for three months, from approximately May 15 - Aug 15. Though I can find a place to stay until June 1 if the room isn't open until then. I'm looking for any place that has nice roommates, a kitchen, a bathroom, and is within a 30 minute commute of Sandia/Livermore area either by car, bus, bike, or anything. Not super picky.

About me: I'm a 23 year old male computer science grad student at UT Austin who likes climbing, kayaking, and outdoorsy things. I really like cooking too.

Although I really, really love being friends with my roommates and hanging out, if that isn't your house's MO, I'm still interested. I'll only be there for three months, and I'm good at entertaining myself.


I'm neat, quiet at night, and I can also keep to myself pretty well if need be. I'm almost always down for a movie night or a house project if people are into it. I drink, but I don't smoke at all - totally fine if you do, I'll probably even sit outside with you.

I would rather write a history for the rather than a rant, because it bursts out of me and I want to shout about it and explain it to everyone. Being mostly rational, or at least repressed, I haven't told all of it to anyone but my therapist. She's heard it backwards and forwards, but I have the chronic, strong urge to tell the story to someone else, get fresh ears on it.


During finals week of college, five years ago, I tried to kill myself twice. After the second time, my parents drove me back home and I checked into a psychiatric hospital. I spent 3 weeks in the hospital, got out for about 5 days and had to go back in because the Abilify they put me on gave me unbearable akathesia, then got out again in mid-June. They diagnosed me with severe depression with psychotic features, which by my reckoning was a pretty accurate diagnosis (even though I probably could also be manic--see below) and put me on Risperidone, which really, really sucked. I was crazy, legitimately crazy during that time, all I could think about was either taking drugs or wanting to die or both. In August I went back in because I made another attempt and ended up in the hospital again, spent a month there, and then a month at an inpatient program and then 3 months at a farm for sad drug addicts which I left because I had health problems. That was January. As a result of me being crazy and also the treatment for craziness, I had gained about ~50 pounds from stress eating and medication, I had skin fungus, I didn't shave, etc.


For about two months I was like that, basically I smoked a lot of weed and tried to order drugs off the internet and was so, so stupid, so unbelievably stupid. Then my psychiatrist at the time diagnosed me with ADHD and a Learning Disability then gave me a bunch of Adderall and Vyvanse, and that made me even crazier and more desperate for some kind of chemical help. I stole money from my parents to buy weed and a couple of times cocaine, almost got a possession charge, and did a lot of other dumb stuff. It was like I couldn't stop—I don't remember how I felt then, it's years ago now, less than five years but more than one, but from my actions it appears that I just couldn't , whether it was mania, or Adderall or whatever, I'd just keep doing the same stuff over and over again. Like I'd go out in my parents car to smoke weed with my friends even though my mom was begging me to stop, just to feel slowed down for a little bit. At the time though, I loved the Adderall, it gave me the motivation to shave and shower consistently and it made me lose a bunch of weight. And somehow I felt it even made my personality better like girls were more attracted to me when I when I was on it. It was weird because I was crazy on one hand but accomplishing things on the other. During this time I graduated from a six month full time culinary program, took two creative writing courses and made plans to return to college.


The summer made me crazy, or my culinary program ending gave me too much time. I went to raves and did a bunch of molly which was fun, but I ended up in the hospital again because I tried to commit suicide by overdose. That was stupid and I knew it was stupid because I read so much about how to commit suicide and knew that overdose rarely works. After that I spent a month in a mental hospital and somehow convinced my parents to send me back to college. By the time that month in the hospital was up, I gained back all the weight I had lost on Adderall (they took me off of it) and stopped taking care of my appearance. In addition I was on about 15 milligrams of Zyprexa, which as anyone who has been on it, will make you blow up like a balloon.


Call it gumption, or maybe some level of privilege, or maybe just the effect of time, but somehow I've been stable since then which is to say I've been stable enough to stay at college for three years. Next semester, I will graduate college with a bachelors in computer science from one of the best undergraduate programs in the country. Getting this far was hard, for me at least, I don't know if it would be hard for anyone else. One of the fictions that tided me or comforted me during that lost year was the idea that I'd come back from this crucible or whatever it was and write a novel or something beautiful that would keep people alive, or maybe I had some profundity to impart to others like I was a prophet shouting in the desert. Never really worked out though, I realized about a year in that I didn't have the temerity to make it in the literary world, got drunk one night and decided to become a Computer Scientist.


Now here I am after my fourth semester of doubling and tripling on Computer Science courses. I'm trying to find internships and I've wondered if the application process would've been easier if I hadn't been concerned with fiction and literature, or spent more time doing extracurriculars, or had started my Computer Science major earlier, or had double majored in math, or my GPA hadn't sucked because I was either suicidal or on heavy antipsychotics for several years, etc. But you know those are good things to wonder, good problems to have compared to where I was three years ago. I'm not actively trying to kill myself or crazy on drugs and even though I'm really emotional and anxious all of the time (as always), I can control it. In addition I quit smoking and joined a sports team so even though I still have a barrel stomach and stress eat a lot, I'm pretty athletic and have lost a decent amount of weight. When I started this rant, I going to complain about not being able to talk to girls or whatever, but I had to start from the beginning to explain why that was, and ended up telling you what was/is really on my chest. So yeah."
24w4wh,2,2014-05-06,Trouble with female authority?,[deleted],BPD,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/24w4wh/trouble_with_female_authority/,"I've found most women in position of power in the workplace, or female authority figures, and I, do not get along. Most male authority figures really like me, and tend to be more helpful on average than their female counterparts. This is causing much turbulance in the workplace, and even in my job search. For instance, just today, i got an application from one retail store. The female manager who gave it to me looked down her nose at me and frowned, and told me to turn it into a store at a different location. I turned it in at the store nearest my apartment, as was my intention in the first place, and the male manager there right away gave me a big smile, said they're always looking for great people, gave me a mini impromptu interview and his business card and said i'd hear back in a week once the app was processed.

These are vastly different opposing treatments.

Even at my current workplace, the male managers often look out for me, stand up for me when the female managers unfairly try to punish me, diminish my hours, try to write me up, or fail to pay me for days ive worked. Im a good worker; hardworking, show up on time, fill in for people who dont bother to call off or show up, get work done on time, multi task, good customer service. Im often getting customer compliments. 

Female teachers ive had in school would pick on me as well... 

i really do not understand why female authority figures go out of their way to make work/school difficult for me, or to talk down to me, tell me my work is poor and im not good at what i do...while male authority figures are often telling me how great my work is, offering me more work hours, offering me internships at their companies, and so on?

is this a bpd thing? Why dont women like me? (i am a lady by the way, if that factors into anything).

edit: i also dont think im treating female authority poorly or in a way that would warrant them treating me differently. It seems to be from the get-go, as soon as i meet them, im pegged as different and am ""tested"". There has been one exception: I started work at a different location for my current company, and it  only has female employees- they treat me well, and a lot of them have more ""masculine"" personality traits while at the same time taking pride in the fact we're all ladies. everyone is treated fairly. I dont know if this is because there are no men to compete with or what. 

I am also fairly good looking, and competent, maybe women see this as a threat? 

i really do not know. 

one thing i know for sure is that i like being treated with respect, and i dont have an issue with authority unless they start something with me - testing me, setting power plays. one female manager even told me she accussed me of shoplifting and humiliated me in front of customers because she thought i'd just take it, and didnt think id say anything about it. Another female manager told me that the customers are smarter than me (despite my computer science degree) and to just accept that. It blows my mind how crappy people can be.

24weh3,2,2014-05-06,Goddammit I didn't even get her name.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/24weh3/goddammit_i_didnt_even_get_her_name/,"There was this nursing student interning at the hospital I worked at. She's pretty, smart, caring, in the reserves, all that good stuff. She had a genuine smile and a good head on her shoulders.

And now she's gone...

My only concern is that I didn't get around to asking if she was seeing anyone. Or even get her name. I suppose one of the nurses who work can tell me that but I don't want to be or feel creepy about it. Now I'm thinking she really was interested and maybe wanted me to make the first move.

I've gotten better at talking to women amd can actually hold a decent conversation now. I thought I could ask with confidence if she was seeing anyone but it turns out I couldn't.

Now I could have been seeing something there that wasn't.  Maybe she was being nice and had no interest at all. But she's gone since her internship ended today and now I'll probably not see her unless she gets hired here or comes here for other reasons.

Missed opportunities will haunt you."

First build!
 
I've always wanted to build a PC but never understood the parts/process until I came to buildapc and used pcpartpicker. Through a few weeks, I did lots of research and came up with these parts. I got some good deals but probably overpaid on the keyboard and some other parts. 

Had these parts for over a month and finally got the H440 to build inside of this past weekend. This build is for gaming and Java development and testing. A little present to myself for the internship I am starting this summer.

**CPU**: chose the 4770k for its hyperthreading over the i5 as I'm planning to use this computer for work/school Java development.
Overclocked this right now to 4.4Ghz (29 Idle, 65 Load)

**CPU Cooler**: looks good with the Case/280mm cooling/didn't want to use a H100i, there are so many builds with that.

**RAM**: Mostly for the looks, got a good deal on the 1866Mhz speed Dominator Platinums.
Got the 2x8gb set upgradability in the future. Maybe video editing? 

**Mobo**:Originally wanted a sabertooth but the formula comes with better components, integrated sound card, wifi, crosschill (watercooling coming in the near future) for only ~70 dollars more

**SSDs**: put these in RAID 0 and backing up to the HDD. 

**HDD**: Going to be holding more games if I fill up the SSDs and also for photo storage/editing storage

**GPU**: Was planning on getting a normal 780 for 1440p gaming but got a sweet deal on the Classified version. Overclocked to 1200Mhz currently with temp target at 72 degrees C. Boost clock up to 1397Mhz

**PSU**: Considering SLI in the future when the ROG swift comes out. Sleeved cables were not as nice as I expected so I got the Bitfenix extensions.

**Fans**: Considerably quieter over stock fans.

**NGFF SSD**: Got this to utilize the NGFF SSD Slot on the Formula and it's currently being used to cache for the HDD. 


Will be posting an update once I get the chance to stitch the cables."
24wlnt,0,2014-05-06,25/M and I need advice on how to keep myself from sleeping with my intern 22/F,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/24wlnt/25m_and_i_need_advice_on_how_to_keep_myself_from/,"This is going to require a bit of background and a certain degree of undertanding that I'm in this situation and the easy solutions (which seem logical) aren't possible... I may ramble a bit and I appreciate you bearing with me on this.

So, I'm a Vice President in my father's company, I was fortunate in that I was drawn to our line of work from a very young age and have been groomed for my position (and to be in my dad's position as CEO/President in less than 5 years) since I was very young. This gives me the unique advantage of being able to closely relate to what an intern needs from there term with us, as well as having an immense knowledge and skillset in my industry. This means that any interns we take on, are trained by me, and this has worked out great for us, we hire almost 40% (up from less than 10% before I took over) of the interns we take on.

Well, for our summer intern program it was decided at this particular sub-company (my company owns a majority in this other company, but we aren't the day-to-day management. We also sell things for this company from our main business and the ""root"" company) that my time was going to be so limited I could only take on one intern, no big deal we've been running the program at max for 2 years now a break will be nice.

Now to the crux of the issue and why I'm almost having a panic attack... That one intern? She's attractive... no that's not it, she's drop dead gorgeous. How do I know? Well I got her info today to start the paperwork and I did what I always do whenever we start working with/for anyone... I did some Google stalking. I stumbled across her instagram, and it appears she bar tends at a bar that requires very little clothing, as well as models for a sexy lingerie company, and oh yeah she's a cage dancer at a night club on occasion. You guessed it, we pulled her from the well known party school in our region.

Now, I already tried backing out of bringing her on, but it turns out her dad is exceptionally well know, wealthy, and involved in our industry. So we can't kick her to the curb. I've had attractive interns in the past and had no issue keeping it in my pants. While I'm pretty average in the ""looks"" department, I know I still get a big help  because of my status in the company, income, potential career benefits, and similar age to the interns. I've had three interns in the past cross the flirty line with me while I did there required two week ""business trip"" and had no problem nipping that in the butt. In only one of those situations had the intern been drinking, surprisngly enough. Please don't think I'm generalizing all women's behavior here, but there's a reason 80 year old billionaires can marry beautiful 20-30 year olds...

This girl is a different level of attractive/sexy/hot, and judging by her ""odd jobs"" while she's at college, she's more than aware of what men think of her. Hell, she could make a great sales rep, talk about opening doors! And again those same pictures tell me she has no issue using her good looks to get ahead.

So, here's what I need. How can I make her no-longer sexually attractive to me? Or at least get the though of how awesome sleeping with her would be out of my head. In the past the possible consequences/stigma were enough of a deterrent, but this is different, I can't make that *click* in my head.

I know it's a leap to assume she'd be attracted to me, and maybe that's another idea (make myself seem unattractive). On top of the ""attractive features"" I listed above, I work mostly in sales, and I'm really fucking good at what I do. Being a proficient salesmen also affords me the ability to easily read people (body language, response type, etc) and manipulate a social encounter to my advantage (basically, I've never had a problem picking girls up in bars, it's not great for relationships but it works fantastic for finding strange). If I get on the road with this girl and decide ""ahh screw it lets do this"" I have very little doubt I could make it happen. This has me terrified to a point of panicking. I feel trapped, one half of me is saying ""hell yeah you're gunna tear that up!"" and the other half (my logical/adult/not horned up half) is saying ""This could destroy your reputation, or worse, you CAN NOT sleep with her, flirt with her, or even stare at her boobs too long dammit!""

Any help/advice/tips is very much appreciated. I hope this doesn't come across the wrong way (I understand I'm in a position many men would envy), but this job and company is my life... and I feel like if the wrong head makes a split second decision, I could make a mistake that could potentially be very hard to come back from. I don't want to be known as an intern fucker, not to mention her dad's position in our industry and... yeah you get the idea."
24wrtb,1,2014-05-06,Deprive me of sleep? Deprive you of Internet access! [Very Long],pettyinternetdenier,pettyrevenge,https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/24wrtb/deprive_me_of_sleep_deprive_you_of_internet/,"[This is long, so please scroll to the bottom for a TL;DR.]

Setting: Shitty apartment in a group home in a major urban area with extremely high cost of living. [For those not familiar, group homes are houses often in expensive areas that try to minimize housing costs by maximizing tenants of a living space.]

Actors: Myself (hereafter listed as ""M""), terrible roommate #1 (hereafter referred to as ""R1""), terrible roommate #2 (hereafter referred to as ""R2""), and terrible landlord (hereafter referred to as ""L"").

Story: I recently moved to a new area and was in dire need of a place to live. I had very little money, was currently unemployed (but had a full-time internship in hopes of getting my big break), and needed somewhere with a bed for a few months. I found a shitty place on craigslist that was listed as a ""group home."" It was more of a slovenly cave in the basement floor of an condominium building, with barely enough room for 1 person and a fish bowl. It had 3 tiny rooms, a shitty kitchen and living area, and a couple of bathrooms. It was a terrible living space, but it was very cheap (relatively, of course--for its price, you could live like royalty in the midwest) and my only option. I signed a short-term lease and moved in.

R1 and R2 seemed very friendly at first. Or rather, they didn't seem unfriendly. But my very fucking first night was terrible, and it's the beginning of my quest to enact petty revenge. I had returned from my internship and got in bed by 11 PM. They were noisy and talking in the main living area, but I didn't mind. Eventually they left the apartment and I got to sleep. Suddenly I woke up. It was 3 AM and they had brought friends over. They were drinking, already drunk, and screaming and hollering about something stupid.

M: [Peeping my head out of my room] ""Hey, is everything alright? I heard some screaming.""

R1: ""Erwhat? Yeahiswear we're fine we're fun hahaha omg yeah we just wentout and danced SO FUN OMG haha oh you were sleeping? SORRY!!! HAHA omg I'm so drunk.""

R2: [Laughing and kissing some guy.]

At this point, a lead-lined mantle of regret was laid upon my shoulders. I knew exactly what I had gotten myself into. I had to choose whether to put up with this shit or duke it out. As I laid down back in my Harry Potter-esque, under-the-stairs-closet-style room, I decided I would just get along, finish the lease, and move to a place with respectable roommates. I just needed to play nice.

That decision didn't last long.

THE VERY NEXT NIGHT THE SAME SHIT HAPPENED. They were watching a movie and being boisterous at around 2:30 AM. Mind you, this is on a Tuesday. I'm not being a party pooper, I'm being an attempted-member of society trying to do well on an internship to get a job. I needed *some* sleep and I needed to get up very early.

M: ""Hey can you guys keep it down? I didn't sleep well since you had company last night and you're being really loud again...""

R2: ""We didn't ask you to go to sleep early!""

R1: ""It's not our fault you work during the day. We would evenings so we like to have fun after work. Not our problem.""

I retreated to my room again, defeated. I drafted a text message to my landlord that basically contained a complaint and a request to require peace and quiet late at night. I didn't think that was too much to ask. Apparently it was.

After sending the text message, I heard back from the landlord.

L: ""I'll try to talk to them but they have every right to make noise. You should buy ear plugs.""

M: ""Wait, what? At 3 AM they do not have the right to make noise. At 3 AM I have the right to sleep!""

L: ""There are no laws saying you can't make noise in your own home at night. Ear plugs will help.""

Fuck me, right? After a couple of nights of this shit occurring, 1 incident make me snap. The roommates were binge watching TV shows on one of their laptops in the living area (they could have done it in one of their rooms) at around midnight. I popped my head out to get some info for my revenge.

M: ""Whatcha watching?""

R1: ""Scandal. So good.""

M: ""Oh, big TV fans?""

R2: ""Yeah we watch shows every night.""

M: ""Oh... Cool..."" &gt;:)

The next morning I checked the wireless router in our ""apartment"" and found it was a simple Linksys router. Oh, this was going to be good. Typing 192.168.1.1 into my browser with knowledge of the default username and password cleared a wide berth for my plan. I found their MAC addresses for their phones and laptops through some snooping on the connected devices on the router's history. I added all devices except mine on the 24/7 restricted list.

That night when one of them returned from work (right before my bedtime) I heard the most satisfying shriek ever uttered by a living creature. It was the sound of harpy having a conscious amputation of its wings. To most, it would be agonizing and very alarming. To me, it was the sound of Jimi Hendrix making love to a guitar; it was the taste of a buttery, salty, sweet caramel; it was the feeling of a cold silk pillow on a warm morning.

M: ""Woah, what's wrong?""

R1: ""The Internet is down! UGH!!!""

R2 showed up later and echoed R1's anger in the Internet's ""inability"" to serve their needs. I shrugged it off, put in my newly purchased ear plugs, and smiled for the first time in a while.

This continued for about a week. I feigned ignorance every chance I got (""The Internet is still down? That's so weird!"" and ""Nope, I don't use the Internet. I read books. Hope it works for you soon, though!). Eventually one of them called L. He came by, couldn't log in either, and scheduled the cable company to come by and take a look. Oh no, my plan is foiled!

Not really. I just removed the restrictions on the day the cable person came.

After the cable company couldn't find any issues, the restrictions were back. After continued complaints by R1 and R2, L bought a new router. Magically, the Internet was back on! Until I reinstated the restrictions. It was a bit of a challenge on the new router, since it was a different brand. But with my limited computer savvy I figured it out.

The anger and frustration I witnessed in them was incredibly validating. I'm a very loving, friendly person, but the repeated times I asked for some consideration and respect were shoved in my face. So I decided to act. And it was glorious.

The apartment was significantly quieter from then on. There were the occasional parties and gatherings, but with ""unreliable"" Internet, our apartment was *not* the place to be. And so I managed to get by.

Towards the end of my lease, I found out one of the Rs had their community college finals coming up. All were online. Being the person that I was, or at least hoped to be, I did some prodding and removed the Internet restrictions before finals started. Expecting studying to be going on, and quiet to be a byproduct of studying, I felt fairly safe with my unrevenging. But the INSTANT I had the Internet back and running, music was blasting every hour they were home, shows were watched without headphones, and noise was rampant at all hours of the night. 

That was their one chance, and they blew it.

The very next morning the restrictions were back on. Cue the returned anger and complaints of R1 and R2. They spoke to L and didn't get a satisfying response. 

R1: ""But I have finals!""

L: ""I don't know what to tell you. The cable company says the router and connection are fine. It has to be your computer.""

R2: ""But my computer doesn't work either!""

L: ""I don't know what to tell you.""

R1: ""Hey M, do you have a computer?""

M: ""Me? Oh, yeah. I do. Why?""

R1: ""I have to use it and mine isn't working and I have an exam tomorrow and omggggg I need it now let me use it!!!""

M: ""... Not my problem.""

I never found out how finals went, but I do know that things stayed fairly quiet for about as long as my lease had left.

**TL;DR: My new roommates were avid online TV watchers, but didn't show any respect or consideration for quiet at night. So I put their devices' MAC addresses on a restricted list on our apartment network. I gave them several chances to quiet the fuck down and be respectful, but they got what they deserved. Oh, and I think one of them failed a final or two because of it.**"
24x69f,2,2014-05-06,I have no idea how to put this in words,secretsecrets11,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/24x69f/i_have_no_idea_how_to_put_this_in_words/,"I don't know if this is the right place to put this... maybe there isn't one. I suppose I'll start with a little back story. I grew up in a ""privileged"" household. I am an only child, and the only time I didn't get whatever thing I wanted was for moderation's sake. We were not millionaires, but definitely upper middle class. The best way to describe my mother was a romantic. She loved the good books where an honorable and upright man learned to love the strong-willed, wily, beautiful woman. They probably appealed to her because she always found another facet of herself in them. My father was a man of math, domineering. Living is a sum to him, measurable in the number of trips to the golf course only in a positive amount if the ""domestics"" comply to his wishes. Not that he was openly abusive then, but the charismatic and charming man of Mother's dreams was far from the deprecating man she married. Not that this was my father's only characteristic. He was always a curiously generous host, and often times the jokes he picked at my mother could be easily rebutted and laughed at instead of broiled over if she had but a sense of humor. It it a shame she didn't. 

From descriptions to events, I suppose things culminated and began to boil and roil over the sides a day a short number before Christmas. Mother had taken an innocuous trip to the bank only to discover that her name was nowhere on the paternally plastered savings account. Years later, I remember that car ride. Her frame trembling as a thin veneer over the tumultuous emotions within, a sum of about two thousand dollars from some offshoot account in her pocket the only money she had acquired from fifteen years of marriage. She had no scruple in letting that hurricane loose in the car. The sounds of her sobs are as unforgettable to me as the sound of the hellish storms that roar through our area every year, and no less terrifying. What words can describe the helplessness a spoiled feels while watching her Mother sob herself into pieces? 

She managed eventually to calm herself enough to call a locksmith to provide his services. I remember the irrational giddiness I felt at my father being unable to let himself in that day. My mother calmly walking to admit him, with me smiling all the while like a trickster in on another great joke. What followed over the next few days is trite and I therefore feel no need to delineate, especially considering that there is over two years of what is possibly One of the Worst Divorces in history, and some years following that left to tell. 

Father moved to his parent's house before he procured an apartment, a fifty year old man parodying a new college graduate. The only thing I feel worth mentioning about those preliminary days is this: I sat in my bed moping over the preponderate weight of a sad thing happening to me, me, of all people! Mother came in and declared in her wistful way of dealing with the bad, ""Oh daughter! Everything will be alright!"" I mention this only because her own words now seem like a sick joke. I suppose you know already, from the very posting of this to this subreddit, that things were not, in fact, all right. Shortly after this, my mother took to having me watch her sleep. I do not remember when this came about, such as when one hardly notices the boundary between a mist and a light rain. This progressed to placing precariously balanced bits of plastic supported on wood or some other sort of material over her head. Think a plastic storage box lid suspended over wooden sides of a desk with her ensconced underneath. Her explanation: people were shooting chemicals at her while she slept. I was immune because it was professional stalkers my father had hired to do this to her, to force her to relinquish custody over me, precluding him from the necessary child and other fees that he would have to pay in proportion to his substantive income. Things progressed to worse yet. My mother had designed our house to be open, with large windows in nearly every room and a preponderance of doors leading to the outdoors. I feel in is worth mentioning we live surrounded by woods, on land my grandfather purchased and gifted to him and his brother. We neighbor my father's brother to the right, and he is to the right of my grandfather. Back to the living conditions, five or six different mechanisms for locking were common for every entry in the house, with often times, to complete the regalia, a metal bar, specially made for this purpose, jammed under the door handle. She did this to keep the ""stalkers"" out, as she called them. We do live in a southern state, and she concluded that we were harassed by some masochistic group, bent on terrorizing gays and women with chemical weapons or other harassment techniques to gratify their desire for power. 

Mornings were the times I collected most of this information. She had not steeled herself for the day yet, and in the paroxysms of rage and hysteria that followed, I was exposed to the horrors that she claimed plagues her existence. Among these claims were that they were doing illegal medical experiments on her at night, (explaining the numerous locks on the doors), and harassing her in public through people hired for this purpose. She was at this point, working only on her education, (my father paid for all living expenses), for a degree as she had never finished college. At one point, she asked one of the people she identified as a lackey to the Stalkers how much they paid him. He grinned and replied, ""enough to pay for college."" She claimed she was raped. She claimed she was molested nightly. She claimed once, that she tried to wake me, but I was so deeply asleep it was obvious I had been anesthetized in order for them to mess with her without disturbing me, (remember, I had ""immunity""). I would like to pretend this is all one a schizophrenic delusion, as the doctors tell me her behavior was, but there are nagging things that I have seen that do give this terrible story credibility. I saw once a card to a strip club on the office desk. I can state, honestly, that neither of us have ever been, nor had the inclination to go, to a strip club. When asked, she sighed and responded resignedly, ""they do this all the time to mess with me."" She had also taken to wearing hats, to protect her head from the chemicals they sprayed at her from inside her car. On the freeway, a man drove past us with a sign that read ""nice hat."" It was inexplicable to me then but it now haunts me as sign that this may not all have been a delusion. I try not to think on these parts of my life when I do not have to, but the newly occurred event that prompted me to write this is dredging up things and making me consider them from a perspective that only one out of danger can take on one in it. What else could have possibly brought that man to hold such a pertinent sign to her case? I can think of no explanation other than the one supplied by my mother. Remembering this occurrence, I can still picture the smile that man had on his face, even though I haven't seen it in four years. Even more disconcerting, my mother has those fake veneer teeth to cover hers that were permanently stained by asthma medication as a child. They were implanted at a time when the technology hadn't advanced to where it is today, so every tooth was ground down in an excruciating process to make room for the false one.Even then, I remember thinking about how odd that was as a child. The office that had been outfitted with a flowing fountain and verdant vines to appease the calm men in white coats seemed odd, juxtaposed to the primitive thing they were about to do to her face. I digress. After a spur of the moment decision to visit the dentist who had given her the teeth, giving the Stalkers no time to bribe the dentist, my mother was told that the teeth she had now were not the teeth she was given, affirming her suspicions of the medical experiments. On the legal side of things, she switched attorneys no less than four times during the divorce. Once, when she went to collect her paperwork from an attorney who had served her use, the interns and whoever else collected it for her were visibly terrified and obviously wanted my mother and her things away. She believes they were bribed.

 I, on the other hand, suffered no physical harm besides the caustic living conditions I became used to. The house was rarely clean, with possessions dumped wherever was convenient, and a dog that was never potty trained so the whole place reeked of urine. The dog problem was solved quickly however. She had never been trained, so at any chance that presented itself to bolt from the house, she would. This time, she crossed the road and was ""hit by a car."" This is in quotation marks for I still know not of the truth. Here is how things progressed, however. After a fruitless search and searing cries of her name out to the uncaring trees in the darkness, I left for my room to let my mother continue the search. She entered to tell me the dog had been hit by a car had been found dead in the road. I was hysteric at this news. I would have been immensely sad at the death of my companion anyway, but I now lamented with all my selfish heart the deplorable condition of my mother. She, the aforementioned, had called my father. He appeared miraculously quickly to bury her and console me. Keep in mind he lived at this time thirty minutes away. I noticed nothing of the oddness of this; I was curled up around the hole in my stomach and bawling my soul out. Later, at my asking for the story some years later, she revealed that the corpse, on her inspection, seemed to bare knife marks, as if she had been stabbed. Mother also said the carcass was coated in a sticky substance, one she claimed was a favorite for them to shoot at her. Once, at the defecation of one of our dogs on my uncle's lawn, (remember, he lives next door), he threatened to shoot the dog. He was a man of an appreciation to alcohol's tint to all daily things, so I never took that threat seriously. I probably should have. Skipping around, our house was also broken into twice. As I stated, my mother designed our house, and fulfilled her dream of an indoor garden with its completion. The atrium is surrounded by windows opening to the dining room, living room, and master bedroom. On one occasion, we returned to the state of the art alarm system, (that my mother swore on her being was compromised), blaring and the doors to the atrium wide open, as if the malevolent personnes had had no time to make it a clean break in. Nothing was taken however, and if following the ""logic"" my mother presents, that was probably only a scare tactic. The other occasion, I saw the window screen in the master bedroom torn, as if someone had used it as an entrance. Mother had not even bothered to call the cops. She insisted the Stalkers were intimate friends with all law bodies and possessed tendrils extending all throughout the infrastructure of our small, local government. 

Life, during this time, seemed like one long storm with no shelter to relieve me from the rain. Everything was wet, so nothing was wet, but nothing was surely dry. I visited my dad at his apartment twice a week and every other weekend, but I felt it betrayed my mother to enjoy this feeling of comparative normalcy. I was scathingly jealous of my friends with closely knit, supportive families. Father acquired a second woman, who is honestly the sweetest and most pleasant woman in the world, if a little too submissive for my taste. Not that you could ever knew I thought this of her. I suppose I took my mother's hatred for my father out on her. We are on good terms now, but she will probably never get the apology she deserves from me. For that to happen, she would need to know my circumstances fully, and just writing this is chaotic and exhausting. I cannot imagine trying to tell it. Anyhow, I came out of the ""Dark Days"" as I call them, with the help of my tormentor and guardian and angel and helpless protector: my mother. If anyone has seen Breaking Bad, I suppose her method is comparable to the one Walter used to absolve his family of blame. She called my father, and told him everything that she knew he already knew. He was a diligent pupil, took his notes smartly, and within a week I was in custody. In my mother's view, he had finally accomplished his goal. 

I fear I must take myself back into this life though, or the event that has transpired will end it forever without me ever knowing the truth. My grand mother died a day ago, and my mother is now traveling to her hometown for the funeral and the final business. Though my father's main goal was custody of me to avoid paying child support, a sub goal  on his List of Super Malevolent Goals is to get my mother to leave this town and stay in her hometown, one clear across this country. She called me and told me of how when she went to the gym pool, she floated. She believes the injections from the stalkers have continued, and actually welcomes them, for she feels that without their ""medication"" she would surely perish. These she believes to be oil injections into muscle, as she looks flabby there. She told me that if she dies in her hometown of a heart attack, to know what really happened. Through this ordeal, I have lost any trace of religion I have ever had, (not that I have ever instilled with much in the first place), but strangely enough, I comply to and enjoy looking for ""signs."" Whether there is truly some cosmic being proving extra-terrestrial aid, or if desperate people simply cling to the most substantive of nothings, I feel it is finally time to tell something of my story. Reading back over this, I realize the discursive nature of it, but trying to put this in any chronological order is difficult for me. When one thinks back on their life, it is usually comparable to a constellation. The bright spots of light are remarkable events that easily come to mind and are fully seen. Connecting these spots together though, with beams of light, requires some imagination. As when looking at the real stars, we have to imagine the scorpion its tail or the Orion his belt, some effort is required to see the person in one event as an extension of the person in the other, and it is with even more difficulty that we can connect the person we are now with the person we were then. My late childhood denies me a lovely, clear cut constellation. My stars are not clear points of light, but a nebulous fog that scatters all light, enveloping me, leaving me as lost and helpless now as I was then.  "
24x7e3,2,2014-05-06,"[22/m] I am considering moving in with my GF (22/f) to a different state, with no job. I would appreciate any advice!",throwawaytxgf,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/24x7e3/22m_i_am_considering_moving_in_with_my_gf_22f_to/,"tl;dr Gf moving out of state, make or break situation. If I move in with her, I keep a healthy relationship, but risk not finding a job in my field. If I stay back, I break everyone's hearts, but may have slightly more opportunity (but still run risks of a state/city that's not in the greatest of shape in comparison to the one she is moving into). 

Hello, for the past couple months I have been torn. I will try to explain this as best as possible. First, thanks for your time in reading this.

My girlfriend and I have been dating for a little over 3 years. Met freshman year in college and we recently graduated. We have been having the time of our lives, and we really do love each other. We click very well, and have so much in common. We get along really well with each other's families as well. The last semester of college, I was doing an internship in one state, and she was doing student teaching in another state, so it was pretty tough, but we managed to get through (I visited her once, and she visited me once). Before leaving for our respective states, we talked about what we thought should happen....we decided to stick it out together. And we made it. Now, she was offered a job in the state she taught in, and I have no job offers at this point. 

Initially a couple years back, we talked and agreed that careers come first, and relationships second. I believe that this mindset has changed, as she asked me to move in with her, despite me having no positions lined up. I have talked to my parents about this, and they are not sure what to think. From the sound of it, they are suggesting to not move in without a job. Their argument is that where I live there is plenty of opportunity (big city), and that I have established connections/networks here. My parents are really smart people, and I trust them, although they can drive me a little crazy at times if I stay in the house too long. On the other hand, my gf has been waiting and waiting and waiting. I almost feel like I owe it to her by moving in. I really did miss her the past semester. I have stayed over in her house many times in college, and I can definitely see myself living with her. Additionally, her argument is that I can find a job no matter where I go (it's a different matter of finding the job in the field I want to go into, however). The city she is moving into has been experiencing a lot of job growth, especially in comparison to the city/state I live in now. I will say that parents on both sides are supportive of whatever decision I make. Another note I should maybe make is that my financial situation at this point is relatively sound, and no college debt. 

I have stated to my gf that I would feel bad/guilty not contributing a lot to living expenses, that I would be a burden. She has said constantly that it would not be a problem based on the salary that she will be receiving. I don't know how/if this mentality will change over time.

Very recently, she has been putting on a lot of pressure to make a commitment. She has told me multiple times that she would feel that if I were not to go, then our long distance relationship ""would be for nothing."" I couldn't bear breaking her heart. I have been constantly going back and forth between moving in or not, and have been telling her what I wanted to do without trying to sound like I was committed one way or the other. I have applied to multiple jobs in the state I live in now (where she also lives), and she hasn't been too happy about it because while I say I want to move in with her, I am applying for jobs in other places. It has been extremely difficult to make any sort of commitment. I have applied for a couple jobs to the state/city she is planning on moving to. It is very difficult, however, to apply for positions out of state. I understand her frustration with my lack of commitment. She likes to get her hopes up about things, and as soon as she does, I tell her I applied for another position somewhere else. She has said that if she was in my position, the decision would be much easier than I am making it out to be. And this is where I get most upset, because this has been one of the hardest decisions of my life. If I go, I get to stay with her, but run the risk of not finding a job in my field. If I stay, I break her heart, and while there are plenty of opportunities here, I still run a risk. 

I have been torn for months. One day, one option will be the most perfect idea ever. The next day, I am realizing it is the worst idea ever. I want what is best for the greater good, but I realize that sacrifices will be made no matter which way I choose. It really is a bad position. Again, thank you so much for your time and advice.

If you need any more clarification, please let me know. "
24x9vx,3,2014-05-06,My goals for the summer (and the second part of my NOFAP journey).,IrishP,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/24x9vx/my_goals_for_the_summer_and_the_second_part_of_my/,"Hello all. This is my second post today. Today is my first day of summer, so I sat down for twenty minutes and wrote down all the things that I'd like to do this summer. Here they are. 

-Get 5 girls phone numbers

-Make out with 2 girls

-Have sex

-Save $1000 dollars, give my dad $1000

-Go on a bike ride of 50+ miles

-Do voice-over work

-Learn to code; spend an hour a day learning coding.

-Get on a solid schedule. Wake up at 6 am, get in bed by 10.

-Show my friends gratitude.

-Get an internship for the Fall.

-Read 16 books.

-Get back into shape.

-Learn to cook.

-Learn to garden.

-Volunteer 40 hours.

-Quit smoking weed.

Play 10 open mics.
-Get paid to play a show.

-Keep my room clean.

-Upgrade my wardrobe.

-Read every night before bed.

-Travel somewhere I've never been before by myself.

-Get a hard drive and flash drive.

-Get on a budget. (Was thinking $35 a week, did some calculations and came out to $45. I'm thinking to limiting myself to $40 a week. -Stop using my debit card.

May be a lot, but I think that if I start tomorrow (I started today, but not really) I'll be good. I'm thinking about not posting on here for my second trip to 90 days, but we'll see. I just feel like I spend too much time on this sub. 

In particular, I need to focus on the first three. I'm not saying that if I don't do them all, I'll be upset. Instead, I just want to make sure that I actually pursue women. Recently, I've been broke and flatlining. I just got a job, and am coming out of the flatline. There's a girl in my class that likes me who I'm going to be meeting up with later in the week. Hopefully things go well. "
24xdmo,3,2014-05-07,I think im a lost cause now,[deleted],Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/24xdmo/i_think_im_a_lost_cause_now/,"long story short I have pretty much given up on the Mental Health Care industry for any help after 12 years of failure.

Been diagnosed with Depression and PAnic Disorder since 2002. Have a history of hospitalisations for suicide attempts. Most recent one was over the last few days. After severe increase migraines and anxiety each day over the previous week I pushed myself to work through the week as I had taken day off the previous week.
Well by the time I got to Friday night I pretty much collapsed mentally and physically and went into a complete force 9 Panic Attack with waves of at times severe suicidal urges, which lasted until Monday. 
On Monday morning I couldnt take it anymore and decided to either kill myself for good or check myself into the mental ward, or at the very least get some meds to try and hopefully break the cycle for good. I got my wife to drive me to the hospital, although I freaked out on the way and got out and walked. My headspace by that time was a complete mess, it had reached its critical mass. I tried to explain as well as I posisbly could at the time what I was going through and that I needed urgent help.
Basically I was then interviewed with the exact same questions from three different people, a nurse, an intern and then a psychiatric emergency doctor and a trainee. Basically at the end of all the questions they just asked me why I was there and what I expected them to do to help. I was almost in tears and asked what else I should have done or whereelse I should have gone and they psychiatric doctor gave me a card with the emergency mental health number on it.
He then told me ""I dont want to come across as patronizing, but its really great you made the choice to come in here and that you had been doing exposure therapy. So thats really good. But we dont think its in your best interest to give you any medication right now as we dont want it to interfere with your exposure therapy, and we think admitting you would be worse for you right now.""

and that was basically it, all he offered was someone to give me a call the next afternoon if I wanted just to see how I was. I asked him point blank, in the meantime what should I do if I have a serious suicidal emergency. He told me to call the number on the card. And I said what if I am having that suicidal emergency RIGHT NOW!
I got a blank look from him and then he said I should talk to them and they can recommend to the hospital if I should be admitted or not.

So that was basically it. I asked if I had to check out or see anyone or blood tests or anything and he said no. They gave me a phone to call my wife to pick me up. I was physically shaking almost violently at that point. I tried multiple times to call but it came up engaged each time. I took a break to go to the toilet and come back and try again as I had no other way to get home. But the room I was in they had taken the phone and the psychiatric doctor was no where to be seen. I didnt know what else to do so I figured I would just go home, distraught and practically in tears. Another doctor walked past me and asked if I was ok and I said no. He obviously sensed something wrong as he asked if I minded stepping aside and talking to him for a minute.
I did my best to explain my current situation and he agreed I could probably do with some immediate help, went and talked to the psychiatric doctor but then came back again saying the exact same thing they didnt want to prescribe me with anything, and they didnt want to admit me in the hospital.

So I walked out and caught two buses to get home, and a few hours later I called the Emergency Mental Health line again because I had more of the panic/suicide waves coming back again. The guy I talked to was helpful but said he couldnt really do anything other than try and talk me through the crisis or recommend an emergency room.

I somehow made it through Monday night without much sleep and made it to work and got through work somehow, purely by focus, distraction and lots of coffee. Although I was unable to eat anything. Again by the time I got home, or even on my way home the waves of panic and suicidal urges started again. This led to the most serious panic attack I may have ever had. In the space of about 1 hr I got into an argument with my wife, asked for a divorce, had another phone call with the mental health service. Although when I called the emergency number on the card the Psychiatrist gave me the lady got mad and said I called the wrong number. I was distraught and said that was the only number I had and that was what the doctor who refused to admit me or help medically said I should go to.
She said obviously I got it wrong and gave me the number I ""apparently"" should have called (which no one had given me). The lady on the other end was nice but couldnt really do much either. I got my wife to drive me to the hospital again but a different one this time as I felt I ran out of options. They were very busy though, I explained my predicament and the severe anxiety and panic of being in th eroom and having everyone looking at me funny or not wanting to approach me. They promised to get me a quiet safe room I could sit in while waiting but it never happened. I kept getting hot sweats and nausea and went outside multiple times to throw up.
Eventually after a couple of hours I gave up and asked to call my wife. Again it was engaged, so I said to them I am just going to go. She said ok.

So I walked to the closest train stop and got off at the closest stop to my house and got home after about an hour. Well then shit had hit the fan because apparently the hospital called my wife because they realised I had really left and were worried about if something happened to me. I figured none of them could give a shit and had just gone home. And yeah I still feel guily about that now.
But anyway my wife said when she got there the nurse came straight out to talk to her directly and a doctor came out too. My wife was amazed that not only they let me go in that state but I had no one even come out to talk to me even briefly during that entire time.

I couldnt help thinking that being 37, male, sweating, figeting, shaking, vomiting, agitated, that I was some kind of drug addict or abuse husband or something. Basically no one has followed up with me since, and I have been doing a lot of thinking and I need to go it alone for a while.

I have decided to take a break from Exposure Therapy and Group Therapy for a month or two, find a different GP, get my meds sorted with a different Psychiatrist, and never go to the Mental Health Services if needing urgent assistance again. Not really looking for advice but happy to listen to it or if anyone has similar experiences. But I really just needed to get this off my chest today.

24xn5d,4,2014-05-07,Should I stop being a vegetarian?,[deleted],makemychoice,https://www.reddit.com/r/makemychoice/comments/24xn5d/should_i_stop_being_a_vegetarian/,"My SO and I are going to start living together soon and we both have tight budgets. Its hard enough now buying different ingredients and not being able to ever eat the same meals, but I have been a vegetarian for so many years that it feels like a big part of my personal identity (I promise I'm not one who constantly rambles on to everyone about being one, I just feel really personally attached to the lifestyle). And on top of that, I'm trying to lose weight and keep the weight off, but a lot of healthy and quick (I'm going into grad school, while working an internship and job) vegetarian options are out of my price range. I'm so conflicted and I don't want to talk to anyone in my life about it because I feel like I will only receive criticism. My family didn't support me when I because a vegetarian and I can imagine all the snarky comments they would throw my way if I stopped.... But I want to do what's best for me, not worry about what other people think. Uggggh! I'm lost and need the opinions of others! Please make my choice, Reddit! 

Edit: I also want to include that while I'm open to the idea of starting to eat meat again, I'm genuinely scared. If  I do change will I get sick?"

My name is (name). I am a student at Loyola University New Orleans and I came across your job listing. Though it it a few weeks old, I hope you are still considering applicants. I started programming in high school while in statistics class, after completing lecture material and homework and after being told by the principal that wandering the halls during class wasn't an appropriate use of my time. so on my TI-81 I programmed most of the common functions that I encountered in stats as to leave more time to i guess program more niche stats problems (and eventually adding additional prompts to make the programs more user friendly for classmates to use). This continued in college for basic math, physics, and chemistry problems until one day a teacher told me about a more advanced programming class that they were having trouble filling seats in, and with electives to spare I took it. In this class I was thrown in the deep end, but I learned a few valuable things mostly documentation and that you can loop without ""If...Goto"". And since the class had assignments that were available in several languages, I learned to choose the platform I was using carefully. after this I took the introductory Programming courses at Loyola in order to finish with a minor in Computational Sciences. 

One of the things that drew me to your internship is in fact that I have only dabbled in one of the languages (Ruby course on codecademy though I don't know if this is Ruby on Rails) you suggest that an applicant be familiar with (I'm gonna end this sentence with a citation instead of a preposition in case you are a stickler about those things http://www.grammarbook.com/grammar/probPrep.asp, if not carry on). I would love to learn new syntax and the strengths of a new language over the summer, especially while using it solve new problems and develop applications that make peoples lives easier and hopefully less stressful. All of this being a little behind my desire to start an internship that could help me start a career in development of other applications and tools.


So attached are my resume (Resume.docx) viewable in Microsoft Word 2010 or more recent, two sample programs: one that was used to calculate the temperature change and energy associated with a bomb calorimeter it will also measure the temperature change for a pressure constant calorimeter, though it will give an incorrect reading for the energy associated with it (calorimetry.vi) which runs in LabView. The input requires a tabulated text file of the temperature readings over time. The next program is a simple Postfix calculator that I made for class (stack.exe for the program, stackexedocumentaion.docx for the code and documentation) executable in windows and viewable in Microsoft Word 2010 or more recent. 

I hope these give you an idea of my qualifications, and I hope more than that, that I meet your expectations in a candidate. for any additional questions, you can email me at (email) or you can call or text me at 757.817.5128.  

Thank you for your consideration,

Decklist [published on NetrunnerDB](http://netrunnerdb.com/en/decklist/5179/payland).

Okay, I've been refining my deck for a while, and this is what I have now. This is the deck I'm planning to take to regionals if The Spaces Between comes in time.

In the beginning of the game, you want to get money, and score an agenda quickly. Money should be easy, with Medical Research Fundraiser easily getting you to Restructure level, and many of the agendas help with economy. The cheap stopping ICE really make it possible to score even without ^much money, but you need enough to rez ICE on your centrals and have 3 ICE on the remote.

In the middle game, it's rather important to get the runner to run into a rototurret or archer, but in case that doesn't work, 3* WoW, Power Shutdown, and Corporate Troubleshooter, can take up the slack and get rid of troublesome things like corroder, SMC, and Clone Chip. Interns is there to bring all of them back.

Once you're at match point, things can either be easy or hard. If you managed to get rid of their breakers in the middle game, you can comfortably score the last agenda. If they still have a sharpshooter, a clone chip, SMC, or Femme Fatale on a Personal Workshop (that last one stopped me from winning the Chronos Protocol I just attended), you need two Corporate Troubleshooters to boost two different things, and you need a lot of money, and you hope that you scored Government Contracts. During this time your remote is the most important thing to work on, and bad publicity is pretty much just a single credit for the runner. Medical Research Fundraiser is worse now, but it's still as good as an easy mark. The troubleshooter is the most important card now, and you want as many as you can get. You'll be rather far through your deck now, but it should be fine. This also the time for mindgames - trying to get them to waste their money on a will-o-wisp or sneaking through a project atlas while they aren't looking.

Some notes on cards I used: -Corporate Troubleshooter is the core of this deck, and you really cannot have them trashed. If you have them in HQ, ice it up well. -Inazuma almost has a ""trash a program"" subroutine. Corporate Troubleshooting it gets around sharp-shooter, one the greatest weaknesses of this deck. If you absolutely need to make a server taxing despite all the BP that is flying around, you can set up a server with this in front of archer. -Medical Research Fundraiser is really useful to stop Restructures from becoming dead cards, but despite that, they could be replaced with Beanstalks, which give more net money, which is important for troubleshooting those who use ninja or garotte. -The main weakness of this deck before The Spaces Between comes out is that there's not enough volume of program-trashing, and although WoW will pretty much always get trashed the first time, its effect is almost as good as a trash, and still rather good against expensive icebreakers.

Cards I don't have: -No scorched earth means that people theoretically could go tag-me against me, but most of the time people put up Plascrete against Weyland all the time and some of the cards best against this deck are resources, (Personal Workshop, Xanadu, Same Old Thing for recursion) If I really wanted to add tag punishment, I would probably add in Closed Accounts, which combos with MRF and pretty much means I can score one agenda while they're collecting resources.

-I really would like to have Reclamation Order, because it's recursion that works on whatever I have used most of, which tends to be what I also need the most (if I'm going full Power Shutdown, I need to trash every last thing, if I'm trying to score agendas, corporate troubleshooter is good, and if I have a set-up server and just need money, I have 3* Restructure) However, I really need lots of the influence. The only card I could imagine swapping out for it would be MRF, which only acts as economy and could be swapped for Beanstalks."
24xr5q,0,2014-05-07,"I, 27M, met someone that changed my outlook on my life. Now stuck with difficult decisions to make",updownleftrightB,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/24xr5q/i_27m_met_someone_that_changed_my_outlook_on_my/,"The other week, my internship took me out of state to a location I have never experienced before. So trying to make the best of my short time in this new land I opened up Tinder and began swiping trying to get local experience for fun things to do around the city. I've never really had a positive experience on this app before so I didn't really have any expectations. Soon after to my surprise a very kind local girl began a conversation with me. The conversation was very casual, what I'm I doing in the area, how long am I in the area while I asked for recommendation for dinner and fun places to go. This continued for another day until she asked me to continue sending my tourist questions to her cell phone number. Unbeknownst to either of us, we coincidentally crossed paths hours before she gave me her number. Later that night we both brought it up and laughed about how strange that was while complimenting on each other’s appearance. 


The following day after the conference that I was attaining ended we made plans to meet in the city to grab drinks. We spent about two hours at the bar chatting about how we got to where we were and shared interests. Her life was incredibly fascinating and explained her to how I was living vicariously through her stories because it was a life that I was very jealous of. I, myself, have lived in a single state and have traveled not very often; my biggest life change was going to college an hour and a half away from home. She explained that she was born outside of the country, moved young and then went to college. From there she followed her career path into another state, just picked up and did what she needed to, to enjoy her life. The conversation seemed to go very well with very few pauses, mostly to take a slip of our beers. Once the bar closed I paid for her drinks and we walked outside. We continued chatting for a little while as she walked to her car and I waited for my taxi. Once I got back to my hotel I message her about how much I enjoyed her company and was hoping we could meet up again before my trip ended and she said the same.


Unfortunately, my last night our plans to meet up again didn't work out. Before my plane took off I messaged her to again say it was really nice meeting and wished her all the best in her future adventures. I've been home for almost a week and the conversation has pretty much stopped and as you can probably tell I fell head of heels for this girl. I'm struggling with getting her off my mind and finding my tasks difficult to complete because my head is elsewhere. I'm beginning to think that the feelings are not mutual and I did not leave the same impact as she left on me. I sent her a message asking if she felt anything the night we met but she didn't respond so I figured now that I'm simply bothering this individual. Of course on Cinco de Mayo, I got a little drunk and sent her another message explaining that I was drunk but that she was gorgeous and wished her goodnight. The next morning I was greeted to her response saying it was a great text to wake up to.


Now comes for the plot twist and difficult road ahead part so grab your popcorn, I'll wait. Ready, let’s go!


As of earlier this year, I'm newly engaged. We have been together for over nine years and have been engaged for almost two months. I absolutely love my fiancée and care so much about her. I told her what happened and explained to her that everything was causal and that I never intended for our meet up to be anything more than lighthearted conversation while thanking her for helping an out of towner. She was not pleased and I completely understand why, she asked if I cheated, I said no which is the truth. Although it bothered her she believed me and has moved on. I did not tell her how I felt about this person but I did explain that this person’s lifestyle is one that I'm incredibly jealous of and one that I want to live myself. I explained how I feel that I've mostly lived a life pleasing others instead of pleasing myself. One that is very ordinary and not adventurous. I have had numerous conversations with friends about my position and they agree that I haven't been living my own life for a long time and that they see my relationship with my fiancée as one of comfort, that I've always stayed with her because I feel safe with her.


I explained to my fiancée that she has been a major factor for my decision to not continue on with graduate school which could be across the country. To my surprise she agreed and apologized for not being so supportive and that she will do her best to change that. Her lack of support has mostly been the idea of me being away from her. During my undergraduate, I was away and we would constantly fight because of the distance (which I was okay with dealing with but she had trouble with it), she would sometimes say that she wasn't the one that decided to move away, I was. These arguments were incredibly hurtful and largely made me think twice about going to graduate school. During her apology she said that she wants me to continue school but only if we were together, where ever my schooling took me and that our relationship will not work if we don't go together. Now she is also still in school and said she would be willing to continue where ever I went but I was hesitant in agreeing with that. I believe this has to do with the first time I went to school; I wanted to enjoy being away but never got the opportunity which I thought I would be able to get if I go to graduate school.


The other day while I was drunk texting, my buddy's tried something on me, they switched the contact information with the girl I met to their number and made it look like she responded to my drunk message. During this little test I got really excited about each message and would let them read my message so it didn't sound so pathetic. Eventually I found out what was going on and was heartbroken. They said this was good and that it showed what I really wanted, I wanted to pursue this other girl regardless of the distance. My friends all believe that I'm in my current relationship out of comfort and that I'm settling. I don't want to believe that they are right but I'm not sure where to go with this. I'm so committed to my fiancée that I feel I might be throwing away everything for absolutely nothing. My friends keep telling me that I'm in a hard position and that if I do act things will without a doubt get weird, feelings will be hurt but that what's most important is how I feel and I shouldn't base my decision to please others, specifically my fiancée. After I collected myself from the trick that was played on me my buddy set down with me and kept telling me that he doesn't think the decisions I'm making in my current relationship are the decision I want to make. He left by telling me that he believe the girl I met would contact me again which she actually did, in the morning (was actually her this time!). When I told him this he said that I had a made bigger impact than I'm letting myself believe and that this shows I shouldn't settle for what I have but for what I want.


My fiancée does suspect something is going on and I told her I will let her know everything on the weekend when we see each other again. Honestly, right now, I don't have a clue what I plant to say to her when the weekend arrives. I'm in such a mixed bag of emotions with half wanting to run while the other half is simply looking to remain comfortable. Did I mention we both have finals this week and graduate next week and that we have family traveling to see us both this weekend? I picked one hell of a week to question my entire relationship/rest of my life. I'm not entirely sure what I'm expecting from posting this but I just had to write down everything because I can't stop thinking about it. If you read all the way through this, thank you, I apologize for the grammatical errors and please let me know what you think.

**tl;dr**: went on a business trip, met a girl, she made a huge impact on me. I'm actually engaged, my friends think I'm settling. Having difficulty with deciding what to do next."
24xrrn,31,2014-05-07,Who caused Travis' Suspension and 9 Months without Interns?,jasonayeiter,opieandanthony,https://www.reddit.com/r/opieandanthony/comments/24xrrn/who_caused_travis_suspension_and_9_months_without/,"I know everybody reading this is saying Blind Intern Stevie right now.  But, there's something that nobody ever brings up about Travis' suspension.
 
Take a listen to 01:58-02:14 of this clip: 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBZJjCrxNfQ

This was about a week prior to his fight with Danny and Sam makes a vague reference to some of the crotch-centric harassment of Stevie.  He tells Sam ""Let's not even go there..."" because he knows the show could get in trouble.  So, who was the person who ultimately revealed Blind Intern Stevie got kicked in the nuts?  It was Stevie....right?  Go to 23:04-24:06 of this clip:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipg0lwDZIBM

It's Danny who actually brings it up and Stevie only gives details after being pressed on it.  He even says that he didn't want to talk about it on-air.  

Technically, Travis is responsible for his own suspension (he did kick Stevie in the nuts) but the catalyst is Danny.  Also, if you listen to the rest of the clip beyond the times above, Travis eventually realizes this could problems for him.  So, Travis tries to apologize and help his situation but Danny just makes it worse by mocking Stevie over it and making it seem that the show doesn't take it seriously.  There's a point where everybody on the show either distances themselves from inappropriate treatment of Stevie and/or tries to help Travis out.  Except Danny.    

Oh...and keep in mind that Travis was one of the people that Danny liked on the show."
24xwwg,5,2014-05-07,"My[24M] girlfriend[24F] of nearly 6 years has broke it off with me and giving me an extremely cold shoulder. Problem: We live together, she found someone else, only been a month. *Warning: LONG read*",RelationshipAdvice84,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/24xwwg/my24m_girlfriend24f_of_nearly_6_years_has_broke/,"I have been lurking here since my break up in order to try and relieve a lot of my emotions by reading similar stories, but I think it has gotten to the point where I would greatly appreciate some input into my situation.



I met the love of my life when I was 18 in college. She was my first girlfriend (but I wasn’t hers) and we lost our virginities together. It was something very special we both shared and I appreciated her a lot during our first two years together. 



When we first met, she was attending school nearly 3 hours away, and I was in community college. After 3 years, I was able to attend the same university as her, and we eventually lived together. This was great initially, but I found myself to be extremely stressed because I was forced to pay my whole tuition without any grants or my parents. This was due to my parents unwillingness to help me with my education. So, naturally I did what most individuals in my situation would do. I picked a major that would have the highest earning potential and wanted to work extremely hard in order to find a job that could pay off these loans(30-40k). STEM it is! 



During my first year at the university with her, problems starting really emerging after living with another. It was 4 years together so we pretty much knew our behaviors. Problems has always been lingering in our relationship, and the biggest two were the lack of sex and my emotionless self. I always took a lot of units and worked/ done internships, so I would often time be too tired to have sex or I would rush it. This would also make me very driven and I would have to avoid any overly emotional things so I don’t get distracted from my ultimate goal. These were a few of my biggest fault in the relationship. This in turned caused her to never receive an orgasm during our entire relationship. I have tried oral and fingering but she was never really too into it. At the end of my first year, problems got even worst.



5 years into the relationship. I found an amazing internship that allowed me to utilize my skill set and I learn a lot, but it caused me to stay up many nights with 3-4 hours of sleep. This was because I wanted to do extremely well in my classes and maintain this internship(paid if that matters). She always missed someone to cuddle with, talk to, and be heard. We sleep at different times and our overall interest was different. Mine would be extremely career driven and to achieve everything I want, so I would not regret anything when I am older. Hers would be a relaxed lifestyle that consist of eating food all day because of her parents paying her way through a lot of her life. At that moment in time, many days consisted of me telling her my problems at school and work, which I failed to see how self centered I was at the time. This made her feel like she was more of a friend or a companion rather than a partner. I didn't appreciate her enough and I understand that now, but at the time, I was so career driven that I couldn't see the value in a relationship.



After about 9 months of tolerating my lack of emotions and sex, she eventually broke it off with me, but we lived together.  So, she started going out with her friends more. She went clubbing and etc etc. During that time, I quit my internship since the amount of stress was over bearing. After about 2 weeks, I decided to seek out professional help of a therapist. I was told that I was not empathic enough with girlfriend and when she wanted to voice her option, I would brush it off and be highly irrational. Now that I have more time to be a student and learn to love and live again, I understand all my faults, but she does not want to give this relationship another try.




Today which is about a month later, I always had high hopes that one day we could be together. I just wanted to make sure that I would have a great job that could provide for my family when I grow old which is why I work so hard. In my last attempt to save my relationship, I did everything that I knew would make me a better overall person. I started to cook, clean, and be more empathic. But after this past week, I saw her talking on the phone and texting non stop, and it reminded me of when we first met. The way she use to talk to me and text me all the time. I asked her and she confirmed that there was someone new. 



This hit me like a ton of bricks. Knowing we broke up, that was one thing, but now I might not even be able to love her anymore. When we talked about it, she said in these words “It has been a month already, you should be over this break up.”….”Maybe you just need to get mad at me so you can get over me easier”….”I am your first girlfriend that is why this breakup is so hard for you”. She found someone within a month and I am still traumatized over the breakup. She makes me feel as though I am wrong for wanting to work it out. She doesn’t see a future with me, so she thinks it will save us both time since “there is someone better for us out there”.




I am absolutely stuck. I have been having a terrible final quarter at school due to this. It is extremely hard to write out every detail of the last 6 years but that was the general gist. I just want an outside unbiased opinion. What do you guy’s think of me and my situation. I am extremely open to criticism. Do you guys think this relationship is still worth pursuing? Is moving on so quickly after 6 years justified? I am still in love with her but she lost everything for me. Was my actions before so bad that it cannot be saved? I am completely lost and have become more emotional now than I have ever been in my life. I just would like your opinion whether it be good or bad.





&lt;bold&gt;TLDR: My girlfriend of 6 years broke it off with me, but we still live in the same household. I was extremely emotionless throughout the relationship since I was so career driven and she is the exact opposite. This caused us to have a horrible sex life and she never had an orgasm. She told me that she found someone new and the guy is completely different than me. She keeps telling me “Maybe you just need to get mad at me so you can get over me easier”, and I am completely lost. I love her, but I am not sure it is worth pursing anymore.

We’ve had to put off our wedding because he had a difficult time finding a job (after quitting one abruptly) and then he developed major depression as a result of his employment situation and health anxiety. He is currently doing an unpaid internship required for a professional license and I am going to be a FT student for another 3 years.

 He finally sought help from a psychiatrist and another therapist after my family and I sat down and convinced him and his parents separately. (his family is completely MIA and unsupportive). I love him dearly and I am probably more emotionally attached to him than he is with me but the only thing that is promising of a brighter future are my own lofty dreams and hopes. He only invests time and effort into his two dogs, this MMORPG that he plays obsessively and oddly enough, his mother. 

I feel like I’ve been dragging his weight and his problems- which I DO understand is a fact of being with a depressed partner. But he shows no gratitude, no initiative to try and speak to me about anything and when I approach him about any problems or concerns (i.e he stays up all night playing this game and does not show up to his internship, consecutively for almost 3 weeks) he shuts down and blames me for setting him back by making him feel guilty for his behaviour. 

I’m exhausted and miserable, everyone in my life sees this and is urging me to do what is best for me instead of opting to continue on this route. It just really kills me to see and know that he is someone I really love but cannot get my life started with-  the reason being a combination of real circumstances with his employment and his own mental state. I know ending our engagement is probably for the best but even then, I don’t know how to do so amicably.

**tl;dr**: Engaged for 3 years to depressed partner. No signs of improvement in his mental state or with our life circumstances despite seeking professional help. Heavily leaning towards ending our relationship but still in love with him and feeling distraught. "

I been lurking for quite some time now and am interested in some feedback",[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/24zg18/23_year_old_student_and_never_learned_anything/,"Edit: Please ignore the typo in the title. I can't believe I missed that.

Hi PF! I've been lurking for a long time and thought that, with the news of becoming a default subreddit, now would be a better time than any to ask for some feedback.

I'm an undergrad student studying for a BS in engineering in California. My goal for the next five years is to pay off, or substantially decrease, my student loans, and to start saving and investing for my future. I'm currently at the tail-end of a year-long internship. By August I will have about $12,000 in my savings and checking accounts. 

I have just one semester of college left, and unfortunately I am currently unsure about the cost of tuition for my last semester. 

My finances:

My internship pays about $3500 per month. 

* $535 goes to rent
* $300 to a leased car. I know it’s not ideal but I needed one asap for the internship and didn’t know where to turn. 
* $144 car insurance
* $130 fuel
* $150 groceries
* $250 eating out/bars

I have no CC debt. My only CC account was opened this January. I opened it just to build credit, and I pay it off every month. Credit limit was recently raised to $3,500.

Here are my debts (all student loans):

* $11,000 federal subsidized @3.4% and $4,000 federal unsubsidized @6.8%	
I pay $160 per mo for both of these (the minimum)

* $11,000 federal @5%
I pay $117 per mo for this (the minimum)

* $16,000 Sallie Mae @8.625%
I pay $200 per mo, and my father matches this with another $200 per month, totaling to $400 per month. I think the minimum on this loan is ~$180.

These total to just under $42,000 in student loans currently.

I only have a few more months left until I get back to being a full-time student. When I go back to school, my monthly expenses will decrease significantly: no rent, less fuel, and less in groceries. 

Until that time, I want to maximize the money and income I have now to match the goals stated above. Am I doing enough to take care of my loans? Should I double down on the Sallie Mae loan and pay off a large portion of it or keep paying above the minimum? 

The above expenses are approximately what I expect to see after I graduate and start working full-time as well, so I would like to hear your thoughts on how I'm doing now too.



Thanks for your time!

24zyvv,1,2014-05-07,Summer: Unpaid research vs paid internship,[deleted],premed,https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/24zyvv/summer_unpaid_research_vs_paid_internship/,"I have these two options right now.

The first is an internship for a nonprofit that serves to provide educational opportunities for children in community youth programs. 20 hrs a week, paid.

The second is a research opportunity with a radiology professor who is doing a ton of computational biology research. Option to continue for the school year, high publishing rates with opportunities for me to be a co-author if I'm good enough. Unpaid though, 25 hrs a week. Good interest in the material, a lot of image scanning and vertebrate physiology.

I'm also trying to network with a professor who is world-renowned in his field and does research in what I'm really interested in. Not sure what options are open for me though but I imagine he knows a lot of people who perform research in my interests in cognitive neuroscience. 

I'll have to find a part-time job if I do research, but summer classes appear to be in the evening so it shouldn't be too much of a hassle to find something - I can work in another department within my library for 15 hours at around minimum wage (just a little less than the internship). I'm also a little more excited of the research opportunity and am still strongly considering the internship because it's a paid summer gig as well..."

We are Mesmer Laboratories, center of scientific innovation for the man and woman on the go. We're looking for people to test out our latest line of ""intimate technologies"" as the lab boys like to call them. Me? I call them sex toys and boy are they something. Took a few home and the wife's still recovering.

***

These are the toys we have up on the docket for testing today:

**The Obeisance Marker:** Not really sure how this guy happened, but here's the gist: write ""happy"" on someone and they get happy, write ""loves giving blowjobs"" and you'll be sore for a week. Lesson learned there. You are only limited as your vocabulary. Be as open or as discreet as you like. Wipes off with hot water. Comes in anything from fine-tip to chisel.

**The Vibro-tail:** Our prehensile cyber-limb research yielded this little beauty. It's a butt plug (we're upfront about it), but once you've got it in, thousands of nanobots come out and start attaching the tail to your nervous system. CAT-001 produced several changes in the first wave test subjects, including but not limited to licking oneself clean, purring, increased reflexes and muscle density, pupil alteration, adoption of other feline behaviors and in rare cases, negative impact on higher brain function. Don't worry though. If that happens, we have top-notch rehabilitation facilities.

**The Constrictor Stocking:**  Slip a pair of these on and they'll tighten to the point of near-crippling pain. Now I know that sounds bad, but hear me out for a second. We included a painkiller distribution system that kills it before it even starts. Side effects of the painkillers include heightened arousal and promiscuity, enhancement of female physique and behavior patterns. Happens to men too. Super-estrogen does that. You may not be able to take a step longer than six inches, but by god they'll be amazing steps to watch. Note: for safety purposes, you must designate someone else to have permission to remove them. We found that people tended to get distracted otherwise.

**The Symbiote Suit:** Ever see Spiderman 3? Basically that. The notes say it increases libido, but that's basically everything we carry. Ah, here we go. Looks like you can morph this thing up quite a bit. The tentacles this thing puts out can stretch up to 20 feet and carry 400 pounds each. If that sounds a bit excessive, we haven't even found a limit on how many you can make, so go nuts. This thing can get sticky too, in case you want to do it on the sides of any nearby buildings.

**The Flux Mask:** Have you ever wanted to SHAPESHIFT! Well we had just the thing for you. The thing could make you look like anyone you'd like. Makes for a hell of a costume party when half the people there are Nic Cage. Long story short, we got drunk and we came into the labs in the morning to find that a small scale war had erupted near our vault and the original plans for this were missing. Personally, I smell CIA but they took it fair and square. We were prepared to let this one go, but one of the lab boys spent a week rebuilding it as much as he could. Only works for half an hour now, but still better than nothing.

**The Mod Capsule:** Ethics be damned, we wanted to make better people. Feed someone one of these and they enter a sort of pseudo-trance where you can modify their personality or behavior. Presto! Instant productive member of society, right? Wrong. The effects wear off after two hours and cause amnesia of the time in question. If you take someone on these out in public, they're your responsibility.

**The Anti-Whip:** I wanted to be able to inflict bottomless shame on my under-performing engineers, so I had them build this. Turn it to one of any number of emotions and hit someone with it. BAM! They feel it. Shame. Pride. Sobriety. Lust. Submissiveness. Primal fear. Current versions are USB enabled for the downloading of emotions as they are harvested.

**Amplification Gel:** Nanobots again. Rub a palmful of this on someone and their nerve endings in the area double. Enhanced sensation wherever you would like it. I rubbed some in my hair and stood outside when it was windy and boy let me tell you how weird that felt. Repeated application of the gel increases the effects.

**Engorger Serum:** Do you want to be bigger? Doesn't matter where because this does it. One small injection makes the surrounding area bigger, longer, firmer, or bouncier as desired. Remember how the gel gets more effective the more you use it? Well this does too, but it is nowhere near as pretty. Remember, sometimes less is more.

**The Control Band:** This simple collar goes around the neck and assumes direct control over the wearer's nervous system. It comes pre-loaded with a variety of entertainment and fitness programs as well as the ability to completely subjugate the human spirit. Accepts voice commands fairly competently and is WiFi-enabled.

**The Power Band:** When you clamp this thing on your wrist you may notice a metallic sheen spreading from the device. That's normal, don't try to take it off before its finished. When its finished turning your skin to metal, you'll find that you've become significantly more durable. Early testing showed the ability to deflect low-caliber firearms. Just in case you get into something you can't handle though, you can modify your own pain response or even turn it off. Color customization options are also available once fully initialized.

**The Harmonizer:** We pulled up a few tons of crystal from a jungle somewhere and after extensive testing, we discovered that it naturally induces deep trance. After more testing, we developed protective lenses that allow users to resist the effect. One-on-one testing showed that in addition to it's hypnotic effects, it acts as a telepathic bridge, allowing mental communication across great distances.

**The Swapper:** It used to be that when you wanted to switch bodies with someone, you'd have to lay out flat and swap brains by hand. Not anymore! Now all you have to do is grab hold of one handle while your swap-ee grabs the other. Presto, change-o, you're looking at your own handsome mug. Repeat the process to change back, easy as pie.

**The Feeldo:** Ladies, have you ever wanted a functional penis? Congrats, even if you said ""No"", science has given you the option. Just insert the knob and this normally hard plastic dildo feeds off of your natural body heat to power itself. This thing excretes all the right fluids, feels just like real skin and even hardens and softens like the real deal. Available in a variety of color options and with optional testicles, bullet vibe or bullet vibe testicles.

**The Limiter:** Available in any jewelry form factor, the Limiter tricks your brain into thinking you're a fraction as strong as you are. Originally developed as the DE-Limiter, we've got to find some use for them somehow. Do any of you fantasies need you to be weak as a kitten? If not, consider tricking your enemies into one.
***
Alright, the bean counters said that we don't have near enough money to properly test all of these things ourselves, so we're going to have to open-source things. They also said that we can't afford a senior staff, so everyone is getting demoted to interns. Upside is that interns are easier to insure. Downside is that we have a lot more room for interns right now. So that's where you come in. We need new interns to create more wonderful technology and more test subjects 
We're letting you in on the ground floor on this, guys and gals. Don't ignore Science's call. If you're interested, feel free to apply below or over PM.

I have a few questions:


1. title, is the Rosindale area safe?
2. What's the best way to get to Cummin's Highway from downtown? Google maps says Orange line to Forest Hills and then the 30 Mattapan station bus. Is the route along the bus the gentrified part of South Boston? Anything with Mattapan in it's name makes me wary."

My girlfriend (F20) and I (M20) have known each other for 7 years, been friends for about 5 years and only got together last year (we've been together roughly 5 months now)

Here's the thing, I love her, a lot, I know it's a little early in the relationship to tell but it somehow feels like she's the one; I feel comfortable around her and I've many plans for the future and they all include her! I know she loves me too, but there were a few incidences that happened over the course of the past 2-3 weeks that made things take a turn for the worst (I believe it's a rough patch but this is my first relationship so I'm not sure if it is...)

A month back, she started a pretty stressful internship (in addition to that, she's been pretty depressed about her family issues, university applications and a currently still ongoing pregnancy scare) 
Things started to turn a little downhill after the 2nd week of her internship where she started to have a severe lack of sleep. She was getting roughly 3 hours of sleep daily and had severe insomnia, plus her hormones was making things worst. Hence, she started to slightly more severe mood swings!

Now this was probably the tipping point, there was this one night where she apparently really really wanted to meet me and talk to me...but stupid me only heard how tired she was over the phone and constantly told her to go get some rest. After hanging up the phone, I kinda sensed that something was off so I went to buy some desserts and dropped it off at her house kinda expecting her to be very happy but she apparently got even more pissed cause I was ""here's the dessert!! I'm going to go now so please go get some rest ok?"" And she felt like I left her hanging the whole night... 
I didn't realize this till the next day when she canceled our supposed date because she felt like I was too busy and went to meet our friend instead. 

Feeling quite upset, I asked her what's going on and that's when she kinda laid most of it on me saying that I wasn't there for her when she needed me and that maybe I didn't understand her because I didn't realize that she wanted to speak to me. She did say afterwards that she realizes how high of an expectation that is and that perhaps her expectations of me were too high. We talked it out and I thought it was settled since this was the one off time I read her wrongly and That's when she told me this line which hurts till today...
""Nothing changed, just that when I have troubles you won't be the first guy I go to for help now""

It hurt when she said that but I was determined to win her trust back regarding this issue.
Then came our overseas trip! We were both super excited at first but the day before the trip she got into a car accident and she fell into a state of depression afterwards. This time I did manage to pick up the signs and went straight to her house with some macaroons (her favourite) and managed to cheer her up which was great! Now the overseas trip seemed like it was going to be great but...

Due to my lack of sleep + unfocused mind (I was worried because she was treating me pretty differently) I was a klutz throughout the trip. Taking out my phone in the middle of the road etc and she constantly had to pull me out of dangers way. (This only happened in the morning for some days though) 

And everything I did kinda ticked her off, be it my endeavors to cheer her up or me doing my own things. There were moments in the trip that made it feel like everything was back to normal and we were both super happy again but at the last night of the trip we were talking about our future when she suddenly laid this on me again 
""... I want you to be the one but somehow it feels like you're not""
""I love you, but something is stopping me from loving you more""
""I need a man, and you're more of a boy""
""I feel like I can't rely on you anymore""
""I like the man you want to be and not the person you are right now""

I don't blame her for saying this because I was indeed acting like a boy, doing childish things and basically being a klutz. But this isn't how I normally am back at home and despite her making me super sad during her mood swings where she pushes me away, I love her to bits and I'm willing to improve myself and mature more to prove to her that I can be the one!

One thing to note is that she's been a few weeks late in her menstrual cycle and we did get her checked and the doctor said that she wasn't pregnant but probably all the stress is causing her hormones to get screwed up. Which is a possible explanation as to why she's feeling so ""ugh"" to whatever I do and I'm really hoping that it is. I want to believe that this is a rough patch and we both did agree to work things out and give me time to mature but somehow deep in me it feels like things would never get back to the way they were.

What should I do? 

TL;DR
I wasn't there for my girlfriend when she needed me and acted like a boy and klutz in our overseas trip which led her to feel like she can't rely on me and hence she lost the feeling that I am the one."

I come to you with a desperate plea because I have no friends to confide in so I must confide with strangers on the Internet. At least you guys seem to be an amiable bunch that are more likely to help out than tell me to kill myself (which I have to admit has come across my mind more than a few times in the recent past). I've posted this on /r/mylittlesupportgroup and I don't know your rules on multiple posting, but if I don't get help soon, I fear what I might do.

I need life advice. 

Ever since I've left high school, my life has been nothing but a string of failure after failure. I was originally accepted to the University of Waterloo in Ontario, for an ambitious program that combined a computer science degree with an accounting degree. I originally wanted to be just computer science, but with influence from my accountant mother, she encouraged me to take CompSci with Accounting.

I moved out, then something in my head just switched. In high school, I was a responsible honor roll student who got all As with little to no effort. When I moved out, I just let go of everything. All my classes started failing, I got sucked into different computer games that sucked up all my time, starting with Skyrim, then into League of Legends. 

After I moved out of the dorm without steady internet, I realized how wretched of a person I could become. I remember that after every class, instead of going somewhere to study, I went to one of the common rooms with my PC, mouse and mousepad ready, hooked up and just played League of Legends until an ungodly hour before returning to my room to sleep. I've also downloaded a porn game and fapped to it until 5 am in the morning, making me unable to go to class the next day.

After a straight year of mediocre marks, my parents and I agreed that maybe Waterloo was too difficult of a university and that I should go to an easier university. Better to do well in a lesser university than to do bad in a good university right?

Well, moving to York University initially wasn't so bad. I did get good marks initially. But this year, I've once again failed my parents and myself. My League of Legends addiction stayed, causing me to play instead of studying, causing me to bomb my midterms on two of my major courses, causing me to drop one and end up getting a D in the other. I never paid attention in class, I was too proud and stupid to think that I needed to. ""I would read that on my own"" I said to myself, but I never did since my nights were filled with League. Since I also repeated an accounting course that I needed for an internship but didn't get the mark I needed last semester, but since I kept forgetting to do online assignments and didn't pay attention in class, I ended up getting a worse mark than before. I'm very lucky that the internship office said that they could make exceptions if my GPA was high enough.

Now, with the beginning of my new semester, my ol' faithful ASUS laptop that fed my addiction to all of my video games for the past 4 years has died and I've managed to get some time to think about my life. I decided that I would start paying attention in class, start studying and stop playing so much games, especially since the laptop I have now can only play shitty games.

However, my dad just talked to me about an hour before I typed this. He and my mom have been nothing but supportive of me throughout my failure at Waterloo, but my recent failings has recently driven them over the edge. My mom, who was usually a taskmaster behind me in high school and my main motivation for getting good marks often came from her, has become more dismissive and pessimistic about me and my schooling. My dad picked up on this and after hearing about me fucking up last semester has issued an ultimatum.

If I don't start pulling my marks up (and B's are probably not going to cut it), he said that he no longer wanted to feel like a failure as a father and wants me to live alone. For the past 20 years of my life, he has offered nothing but support and fatherly advice, but I have never done any of it. I can't blame him for wanting to kick me out. I've wasted so much money with my failure and appear to want nothing more but to play games all day and night.

I don't know what to do. I want to believe that I can study and do better in school, but I don't know if I can at this point. I have already promised myself the same thing multiple times in the past, but I always seem to forget the strife and pain that I went through just a few months before and fall into old habits.

I've already feel guilty about all the shit I've put my parents through and it's beginning to affect my head. Ever since I've failed those midterms last semester, every time I go through any kind of emotional stress, I've been getting these intrusive thoughts in my head. ""Maybe you should just kill yourself,"" they say. After I hear these things in my head, I always find myself going down a train of thought analyzing the benefits of suicide, how it would help my parents not have to feel as failures anymore and how I wouldn't have to worry about disappointing them anymore. I'm scared of what my own mind is doing that is seemingly out of my control.

Even with suicidal thoughts and all of my parents efforts, I am very afraid of falling back into the cycle of improving, then forgetting and returning to old habits that will cause failure. I'm lost. I cannot tell anyone in my life about this. All of my friends wouldn't know what to tell me and probably couldn't tell me much but basic uplifting tropes and shit. I don't want to put all of my emotional baggage on them. They don't deserve it, they have their own lives to worry about.

The only glimmer of hope I see is that I have been successfully working out at home using workout videos. Although most of my drive to get in shape was to get ""a pornstar body"" (I'm really fucking motivated by sex for some reason), it's about the only good thing I have going for me. Hell, that might be the only way I could make money when my dad kicks me out and I have to start whoring my self out.

Please, I need help. I need a third party to tell me what to do. I keep seeing the pattern of my life but I just can't seem to break the cycle. With my dad about to kick me out, I'm really afraid that if I don't pull my marks up and turn myself around, I may end up on the news no more than a year later as a dead man who hanged himself in a local alley.

Any kind of advice is needed, even if it's just a redirection to a larger advice subreddit. I've tried to find one but Google didn't help me this time. Please, I don't know what to do."
251028,17,2014-05-08,Not sure I want to pick him up at the airport anymore.,BloodAndAshes,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/251028/not_sure_i_want_to_pick_him_up_at_the_airport/,"[Warning: long]

Hi. Throwaway account.
I, 24F, have been in a relationship for 6 years with my SO, 21M. We live together in a small student-studio, and have been living there for 4 years. We rarely fight, and never really had issues. Recently, he went to Malta for three months, for an internship. 

Going abroad was something he'd really been looking forward to. I couldn't be equally excited, but I wasn't going to be in his way either. We made plans to Skype a lot, play Minecraft together a lot, and to watch movies together. 

When he arrived, none of these plans were followed through with. He was always watching movies/series with his new-found friends, or he went out. Eventually, we settled on Skyping 2-3 times a week, while playing chess and rambling. The rest of the time we'd send messages through Viber. I was lonely, but learned to adapt. 

After two months, I got the opportunity to visit him for a week. It was awesome, and everything felt like it was back to how we were before this LDR. Just being together was amazing, and we spent the week being very much occupied with one another. We also talked a lot and I felt like he really understood all my concerns and loneliness. I went home with a happy heart, ready to embrace those last three weeks. 

However, in those last three weeks, things have gone downhill. He lost his phone during our trip and now we can only contact one another through Hangouts. We chat during the day, but not overly so. Sometimes he leaves for half an hour or even several hours and he forgets to tell me. Most of the evenings he's going out. We've only Skype'd 50 minutes a week - and only because we watch Game of Thrones together. That's it.

Yesterday, I had a hysteroscopy because I had surgery a while back. It hurt a lot, and the outcome wasn't positive at all. All he was saying was how terrible he felt for not being able to be there with me, and I was the one comforting HIM over that. I suppose, it's an upgrade from him just belittling my issues, going 'Nah, you'll see, it'll be nothing.' or 'They'll just give you a pill to fix it, don't worry dear.' 

The hysteroscopy caused me to feel lonely, anxious and stupid. He wasn't there for me afterwards, either - he went out with his friends again. I sent him the following e-mail: 

*I know you're coming home soon.*
*And I really don't wanna nag.*

*But in the past weeks, the only Skype-time we've had is one hour/week, and only for watching GoT. We do virtually nothing together, except chatting.*
*I know you're just trying to make the most of your time there, and that you'll be here soon, but please forgive me for feeling a little 'off' about this whole thing. Especially tonight. Sorry.*

*Love you a lot. It's the chocolate talking.*

*Gnite.* 

He ignored it and sent me his usual 'Goodmorning honey &lt;3' messages. We chatted a little, but it seems like I can't feel any of the closeness I usually feel. He said he was sick and going to bed last night, very curtly, and when I asked him what was wrong, he simply repeated himself and logged off. I asked him if he was feeling better this morning, and what he was feeling, and he said: 'I told you I had sniffles.' 

He didn't tell me that at all. This is a recurring issue where he tells someone something, and then he thinks I magically also know what he's said.. 

I'm really engaged. I post things on his Facebook every two weeks or so - he ignores it, while I know he's online and talking to other people on Facebook. It's come to a point where I start freaking out about things I normally don't freak out about, like: 'Why is he ignoring everything I send him on Facebook, but he is liking other girl's pictures?' 

He's coming home in one day and a few hours. But I'm not sure I want to be there when he does. I'm contemplating calling my mother and to drive home with her for the weekend, and to just ignore him. 

On the other hand, I know he probably doesn't mean it this way at all. But it's hard for me to see any other perspective. 

Sorry for venting.

[TL;DR: Boyfriend of 6 years goes to Malta for three months, suddenly we're not talking as much anymore and all the time we'd usually spend together is now spent 'out with other people'. We Skype'd for 50 minutes/week for the past three weeks, and only for watching Game of Thrones. I sent him an e-mail, which he ignored. Not sure I want to be there at the airport when he comes home in one day. I feel really sad, distanced and alone.]"

Does anyone work at or know of an organization that I can volunteer at for IT help? I'm fairly proficient with computers and enjoy working on them and building them in my personal time. Any help would be appreciated, thank you.

EDIT: Adding some background info as someone mentioned it wouldn't be a bad idea. (reply from below)

It's taken me 10 years because I took 5 years off from school. I traveled to Europe and tried a career across the country that didn't work out. I found out real quick that I do not like Sales. I racked up full time bills so I've had to hold a full time job. I've been taking 3 classes a semester for the last 3 years.

I would consider my stronger skills to be hardware related, I absolutely love tearing up PC's, stressing and pushing hardware to its limits. I think switches and servers are fascinating and would love to tinker with them more but I have never had the access to one.

If I have ever had a problem with software I could almost always figure out the problem and never really struggled operating typical software. I have some very basic SQL knowledge and UNIX programming knowledge.

My biggest skill would probably be my Work Ethic. I always see the socially inept IT staff at the hospital and how they communicate with guests, patients, and other staff members and I just feel that they are all IT knowledge with no soft edges. I always think to myself given the chance and with the same training that they received I could always see myself doing a better job than the next guy.

I know I am going to have to start at the bottom of the bucket and crawl my way upwards, and I am perfectly okay with that. I am so willing to have a chance at a full-time position I would even work for free for months to receive training and a chance to see how I work and work with others. The problem is I cannot give up my current 6am-2pm job because of my bills.

[Original](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/24v7fn/my_21_f_roommate_and_best_friend_20_f_threw_out/)


I will try to make this as clear as possible, even though I'm typing it during a work break.




Immediately after I posted on Reddit, a lot of you had the same advice to report her to the nursing board, residence life, the nursing department at our college, to the police, to the sorority, and to her parents. I decided to report her to all of the above while hiding at the sorority house.


Early yesterday morning was when Sarah made her Facebook post about me, and it took only until after lunch for my sorority sisters to start texting me like mad. This was not the first time that Sarah had shamed another sorority sister for having an abortion, and that particular woman (we will call her Emily) was one of the highest ranking members. Emily was the one who called the meeting to have Sarah kicked out for breach of the code of conduct (treat all your sisters kindly, support one another, no gossiping, etc).

Meanwhile, Residence Life was busy trying to contact Sarah's parents after I showed them her facebook rants. After the sorority contacted Sarah, she flipped out yet again on Facebook and started to rant about how she wanted to die.

The RA on duty (also one of my good friends) had decided to go speak to her to see if they could help. At this point, it was clear to everyone that Sarah was not right in the head, because she was screaming at her through the door crack. Sarah refused to answer the door, so the RA decided to escalate it higher and no one saw Sarah until the sorority meeting.

**The Sorority Meeting**

At the meeting, everything seemed to be okay. Sarah was the last person to arrive and she just took her seat and acted normal. It was eerie to see her gush over everyone only hours after she pulled her stunt. Only about half of the sorority was present, but the president decided to proceed regardless. It only took two minutes for us to vote unanimously to kick her out. Emily sat next to me the whole time. To put it mildly, Sarah did not take this well. She turned bright red, spit on the ground in front of Emily and me, and ran out of the room screaming. We called campus police on her as she left.

**After the Meeting**

Sarah returned to our dorm room. The Res Life Administrator tried to speak to her, but she refused to answer the door for over 20 minutes. They had to call the police to kick down the door because she was holding the handle on the inside so they couldn't unlock the door. The police showed up, kicked down the door, and found the dorm destroyed.

All the furniture had been smashed (or scratched if it was too heavy), the carpets were covered in food from the refrigerator, and she had painted random swear words on the wall in what looks like blood (but she had no scratches on her, so who knows where the blood came from). The found photos of Harold covered in lipstick in her purse (this wasn't like a kiss mark from lipstick, but more like she used a lipstick to entirely cover Harold's face like a crayon). **She resisted the police trying to peacefully convince her to accompany them to the hospital.** Sarah was taken to the hospital and charged (I'm not sure what the exact charges were, but I am aware that it includes unlawful posession of prescription medication because they found my pills in her purse and they had my name on the labels). She is still in the hospital today undergoing a psych evaluation.

**The Hospital**

Sarah and I were both interns working for the hospital that operates the pregnancy clinic. I reported her to HR for theft, harassment, and privacy violations along with giving them screenshots from Facebook.

As of this morning, Sarah did not turn up for work so she was terminated for no call no show. HR had me in their office for an hour this morning asking if I would like to press for a HIPAA investigation (It turns out that some of her facebook rants had information that could only be obtained through patient records. I have no idea what information it was since it was the HR lady who found it). I said yes, because there's no way it would hurt for Sarah to be investigated. HR also notified the Nursing Board and the Nursing Department at my college independently of my reports.


So I think that's pretty much everything. Sarah has been arrested and charged, kicked from the sorority, fired from her job, kicked out of the dorms, and numerous reports were made to the proper authorities. I still care for Sarah with all of my heart, because I realize that she is severely mentally ill. I will always blame her for what she did to me, but I know that it wasn't the best friend that I knew for all those years. It was a different person who did that to me.

I am feeling physically fine after all of this. Harold and I are talking about getting an apartment off campus together. If that doesn't work out, I will stay in the sorority house. Sarah's parents have promised to pay me back for the abortion costs ($400) because they know I didn't do anything wrong. I'm grateful that I have their support.


TL;DR: Sarah has been arrested, everything turned out okay. You should probably read the whole thing for details.

251ux5,73,2014-05-08,"My (22F) brother (27M) and his fiance (25F) want me to declaw my 2-year-old cat prior to moving into their house for 1 year. I would never declaw my cat, but I don't know what to do.",Seinpheld,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/251ux5/my_22f_brother_27m_and_his_fiance_25f_want_me_to/,"I would like to preface this post by saying I completely understand why my brother and his fiancé would want my cat to be declawed. I am not ignorant to the fact that he could tear up their furniture. 


I am very close with my brother and his fiancé; we hang out regularly and get along great. They moved into a new home about 6 months ago and subsequently got engaged. We have all been living in the same city for the past four years, as they both have jobs here and I was at university. I recently was accepted into the dietetic internship through my university and will be moving in with my brother and his fiancé for a year starting in August to save (a lot) of money. They are doing me a huge favor by allowing me to live with them, and I couldn’t be more thankful. We are all very excited to be roommates.


The issue: I have a 2-year-old cat and he is my world. I would not have gotten through university without him. He is very well mannered and an all-around perfect cat. He does scratch his claws, as most cats do, but his scratching is limited to one black chair that he has used since he was a kitten and his scratching post. Before moving in, my brother and his fiancé want me to get my cat declawed. There is absolutely no way I would ever declaw my cat; I find it very inhumane. I am not saying that people who declaw their cat/s are terrible people or that no cats should ever be declawed, I just personally don’t believe in doing that. At first, my brother said I did not have to get him declawed because he knows how much I do not want to do that, and his fiancé was the one saying I needed to get it done. Now they have reversed roles and his fiancé is saying I don’t have to do it and my brother is saying I should and that he will even pay for the procedure. However, money is not the issue. I don’t want my cat declawed. I also think it’s unfair to take his claws away for the rest of his life because of a living situation only lasting a year.


So Reddit, I don’t know what to do. I have no idea what my options are. I don’t blame them for wanting my cat declawed, but I really believe he would be just fine if he still were able to use his two scratching items that he uses at my house. He responds well to the water-bottle approach, so if he starts scratching other furniture I believe this will work. Do I have any other options? I can’t live anywhere else and I don’t want to ship my cat somewhere else. But I also don't want to end up having arguments about my cat while living there. How do I help them to understand my side of this matter? Any advice is welcome, especially if you have been in a similar situation.


**TL;DR my brother and his fiancé want my 2 yo cat to be declawed prior to moving into their house. I would never declaw my cat, but I don’t know what my other options are. I don’t know how to help them to see my side of the story** 

**EDIT** First, I would like to thank everyone that took the time to read my post and provide comments and suggestions, they were so helpful! I would also like to say that I never forced my cat onto my brother and his fiance; they offered to take both of us in for the duration of my internship, and they really do love my cat and are looking forward to having a pet in the house. They just wanted his nails declawed as a precautionary measure (understandable.) Here's the good news! After reading all of your comments (both positive and negative) I decided to go over and talk to my brother and his fiance. I told them that I was not taking the fact that they are allowing me to live with them for granted, and that I am thankful beyond words that they are putting a roof over my head. I then explained why I am so resistant to get my kitty declawed, and used a lot of examples that you all had provided me. I was not forceful and just tried to provide them information without being biased. They were so understanding. They told me that they wouldn't want to put my kitty or me through that, and they especially wouldn't want him to acquire any destructive behaviors due to the procedure. We collectively decided that I will continue to regularly clip his nails, and if need be we will buy the SoftPaws :) I cannot begin to tell you how grateful I am to have such wonderful family members in my life. I am so lucky. Thank you, Reddit, for helping me find solutions to my problem! xx

252dss,14,2014-05-08,The Three Lessons I Learned Pursuing A Career in Psychology,Human_Gravy,DarkTales,https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkTales/comments/252dss/the_three_lessons_i_learned_pursuing_a_career_in/,"My dream was to become a psychologist. It began when I was a young boy and my parents thought a visit with a therapist may assist in curbing some behavioral and social issues they were concerned about. The office was welcoming in its warm and friendly atmosphere. The therapist was a sweet lady that asked me to sit down and spoke with me about anything and everything that I wanted. She gave me advice on how to handle my thoughts and feelings along with something she referred to as “impulse control”. Eventually, we began to confide in each other and I started helping her through her issues too. We saw each other for years until she retired and moved to another state. A long lasting impression had been made and right after high school, I enrolled in college declaring myself a psychology major.

The program was difficult with all the lecturing, research papers, and tests but that wasn’t fulfilling my desire to help people. I don’t know how they expect students to gain experience without interacting with real clients. Case studies were bullshit, I wanted the real thing. They say that if you want to start changing the world, you need to start in your own community so I began to console those in desperate need on campus. While it did not gain me popularity with my peers, it was a valuable first lesson: You cannot help those that do not wish to help themselves.

I tried to help the women first since my therapist was a woman and I felt I had a better connection and understanding of them. Not that many women accepted that their binge drinking, experimentation with narcotics, and sexual promiscuity was a result of their father’s molestation, paternal lack of attention or male presence in their life, or an unconscious emulation of their mother’s behavior. I expressed my desires to help the fix their obvious moral flaws but I was met with physical violence more often than not.

The men were equally as unresponsive to my diagnosis of their overwhelming desire to prove their masculinity. Their fixation on chugging beers, bedding women, and acting as an “alpha male” was due to underlying issues with unacknowledged homosexual tendencies and incestuous desires for their mothers. These encounters solidified my belief in helping only those that want to be helped. When I presented my theories to these troubled men, I was met with fierce emotional outbursts and threats of violence.

As much as I wanted to help my fellow students, I couldn’t save them from themselves. It’s not about nature vs. nurture. It was their environment that didn’t help them see the forest from the trees. I switched my approach and found a method to have those in need come to me. I applied for an internship at a therapist’s office where I was assigned administrative work. Although it wasn’t what I signed up for, I made the best out of it. When the therapist attended conferences and after closing time, I was able to gain practical experience by scheduling my own appointments with new patients. Over three months, I had developed a client list. I must have done an amazing job because none of my clients ever returned after a session with me.

The arrangement went well until the police crashed one of my sessions at the behest of the therapist. Some of my clients had called and complained about my treatments. The police became involved when some clients had relapsed and harmed themselves or others. I was shocked at that accusation that my patients had committed these crimes because of my malpractice. That’s where I learned my second most important lesson: you cannot blame yourself for client failures. You can’t win them all and some will fall between the cracks. Even though the weaker willed clients ruined my practice, the police were interested in having me do some work with them, pro bono, of course.

They escorted me down to the precinct where I was assigned a private room and two new clients waited for a session. They read me the Miranda Rights which was unnecessary. I swore that under the rule of doctor/patient confidentiality I would not disclose any information to anyone about them without their permission. They questioned my qualifications, experience, and competency. I can understand why that clients are interested in the lives of their therapists but these questions probed too deeply into my life. After I finished my session with those clients, they told me that they wanted to keep me on for a little while longer. I was escorted to a cell for the night. I couldn’t imagine why they would put me there but I did not ask questions. It was probably due to budget cuts that they couldn’t give me a hotel suite.

The next morning, I was bought into another session with a new client. The man introduced himself as my lawyer. I laughed at the joke and thanked him for the offer but I didn’t require his services. It would be a violation of ethical standards. The man didn’t seem to understand my refusal of his services and continued to act as if he was performing the duties of a lawyer for me. His case was very extreme but my job is to understand him, not argue about reality.

Like the clients before him, he asked questions about my credentials and services performed for clients. Privilege would not allow me to disclose any personal information about them. I redirected the questions toward the lawyer in order to better understand his obsession with his job. My diagnosis was a combination of grandiose delusions, narcissistic disorder, and he was most certainly a pathological liar. Compulsive lying for a lawyer is an understandable portion of the job but his attempts to convince me I was in trouble with the police were bordering on the line of delusional.

After finishing the session with the lawyer, I was taken into a court room to serve as an expert witness. I had never been in a courtroom before but I found it strange that the judge had referred to me as the defendant. I identified myself as an expert witness. The lawyer told me to stop talking which I took as an offense. We are both professionals. There was no need to treat me like a child. Why would they invite me here, as an expert witness, only to have a client keep me silent? Since the lawyer was the expert on law and court, I stayed quiet while I awaited the defendant to arrive. No one else showed up.

The judge asked the lawyer for a plea on behalf of the defendant. He responded: “not guilty by reason of insanity.” I finally understood what they needed from me. I had spoken out of turn and was reprimanded before. The lawyer asked me to take the witness stand and answer questions. Once again, my credentials were scrutinized until I was dismissed. I don’t know how I was much help to the defendant as I had never met the man or woman before and could not judge their sanity.

After some deliberation, all parties concluded that the defendant was unfit for trial. I’m glad I was able to stop them from putting a mentally ill man through trial. He wouldn’t even be able to understand what was going on around him. The judge was impressed with my work and assigned me to a new position at a mental health institution.

When I arrived, I was given an office with a desk, chair, and bed. The state must really be going bankrupt if this is how they treat their employees but that wouldn’t stop me from doing the job I was born to do. My client list consisted of daily sessions with other therapists that worked in the facility with me. The job required me to be there 24/7 but at least they were providing me with food, clothing, medical care, and restricted internet access. That’s where I learned my third lesson: always discuss your salary before you start doing a job. I never spoke with anyone in human resources about how much I was being paid for my services. I’ll have to discuss payment with them at some point in the future. For now, I am the happiest man on Earth. My childhood dream came true.

252exc,1,2014-05-08,Announcement: The letter to the editor contest,[deleted],WarOnComcast,https://www.reddit.com/r/WarOnComcast/comments/252exc/announcement_the_letter_to_the_editor_contest/,"The FCC will be making its newly proposed rules public a week from today, on May 15.

Elsewhere, such as [here]( http://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/24ein4/google_and_netflix_are_considering_an_allout_pr/ch6e4mb), I have proposed that we write letters to the editor and submit them to our local or regional newspapers.  These letters should call out our legislators by name and call on them to re-classify ISPs as common carriers.

[I’ve explained why the LTE is a useful tactic]( http://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1os8rz/how_to_get_your_senators_and_representatives/) on a number of occasions, but the core concept is simple: emails and snail mail to the offices of your legislators will generally be read by an intern or a low-level staffer, whereas a published letter to the editor will likely end up right on the legislator’s desk because he or she knows—while many of us forget—that older generations vote more reliably than do younger generations, that older generations still read the newspaper, and that a well-written letter to the editor can influence the opinions of other constituents, whereas a private message to your legislator will not. 

In order to encourage people to write letters and to provide examples for those who aren’t confident in their writing, we’re going to be running a contest with this thread and are encouraging everyone to include in the comments section here letters to the editor that they have submitted or will be submitting to their local  newspapers.  The winner will be decided on May 15, a week from today, on the basis of how many upvotes each letter has accumulated (downvotes will be ignored).  The winning submission will be featured in its own sticky thread for at least 24 hours, and this thread will be included in the sidebar of this subreddit so that anyone who finds his or her way to our here will have examples of letters to draw from when they write their own.

If your letter is a first draft that you’d like to have critiqued by other users, please make a note of it at the top of your comment.  And if you don’t want anyone borrowing phrases from your letter when they write their own letter to their legislators, please explicitly say so.

Note: I will be adding my own letter in the comments section.  If my letter—or a letter submitted by one of the other mods—has the most upvotes after a week, the winner will be the most upvoted submission not made by a moderator.

Without further ado, let the contest begin!

252hl7,6,2014-05-08,Feel like shit after exams. I want to quit I failed life.,LookThursday,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/252hl7/feel_like_shit_after_exams_i_want_to_quit_i/,"       I feel like shit I know I did badly on my first exam. It was a choose a or B and explain type question I knew I should have picked B. Not like, I was going to pick that, but like I really knew, the answer was this, but I was so fucking stupid and I did B.
      Second exam, I studied for weeks in advance. I read the questions too slowly and I didn't have enough time to finish. There was also a question I just didn't know how to answer that was 1/10th of the exam.
     Third exam is tomorrow, I haven't studied because I was working hard for the A's in my first two exams. I failed. I Fail. I failed. I don't want to go on anymore. I will after I stop being such a little bitch, but I think I am going to fail tomorrow.
I bought three chocolate muffins after the exam and that was pretty bad, I heard that's like the equivalent of cutting yourself in the emotional aspect (I wont physically harm myself, but I according to psychology I just did)

I failed at fucking everything and I failed everyone. I failed myself, my parent, my family and the people who are paying my tuition. (after I transferred someone decided to pay the other 5% not covered in my grant. I don't know what I am going to tell them when they ask me about my grades)

 Then I failed my fucking self by eating the muffins knowing they will take me back a month in the gym, because that is why I failed everybody. I gave up and had no discipline so I ate them to hurt myself.

I was terrible in school because of my time management. Otherwise I would do well on my homework assignments.When I was able to manage some time I failed at studying which made it pointless. I told myself I had ADHD and needed adderall to focus, but I know that's a fucking excuse I just need to focus more and stop going on the computer or day dreaming while ""I study."" I spend my time reading articles on the internet and end up going to bed at 5 am when all I wanted to do was study. No, I didn't spend time partying because I would always be ""studying.""

The thing that makes it worse is that I know what I am fucking doing everything wrong but I just can't fix it. I have done this before my freshman year went down to a 2.75 one semester after getting a C in a science class. Next semester I got a 3.75 which included a B+ in a more advanced version of the course I got a C in.

It is different now because now this is something I can't bounce back from. It would take 4 semesters of A-'s in all my classes to get to a 3.5. All because of one bad semester. Even If i get those A-s my employer won't care,  they will see only a 3.5. I would have to give up my extracurricular activities that have added something new to my life. I am terrible at networking, have no social skills and I don't know anyone so my grades are all i have. In fact I don't even know if I am just not smart enough for this school. 
I had a bad semester with no excuse other than I clearly wasn't responsible enough and I couldn't handle this. I could just have asked for the extended time which I qualified for it, but I told myself there is no extended time in the real world. I was so fucking stoopid. I just cried after reflecting on my life, I don't know if that is what you call self pity, I brought myself to a low point. I feel like an insecure, proud failure who tries too hard. The worst thing to be. Then I realized that if I couldn't handle this how could I handle a career in finance, as a business manager, as anything? I want to change my life.I want to cut this emotional bullshit. 


 I am not in tears at this point it has all passed, but I already wrote it so I might as well continue. I feel like I should go attempt to focus on my last test. It is the toughest one. The teacher is a super hard grader. I have to find a way to do this. 

I feel like I want the next school year to start. I want to get those A-'s. I want to change myself and gain discipline. I want to spend this summer studying. I couldn't find an internship. I have no friends to spend it with. what else will I do? Just wish there was someone that could help me through it all. Otherwise I am going to give up again. 

Its all gone now, nothing to write. That I want to succeed inspiration faded too. I wish I could just fucking focus and pump out these research essays for tomorrows exam like a normal person. Will i fucking fail this final I hope not. I just want to quit. 

Why is my life like this? Why am I like this? Why do I think so much?

253l0p,1,2014-05-08,"I'll be doing really well, and BOOM! I have an ""off"" day that culminates in a panic attack. I don't really know how to approach this.",[deleted],Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/253l0p/ill_be_doing_really_well_and_boom_i_have_an_off/,"I'm just wondering if this is something that you guys deal with. I don't entirely have it figured out, but it's happened twice in the past two months, and I have a feeling it will continue to happen. I was feeling really great this week. I actually socialized and kept myself busy and exercised on both Monday and Tuesday. But by Wednesday, I just felt really sad. I was on the verge of tears all day, and I kept crying for no reason. I went out with my friend hoping that I could stave off my sadness with some fun, but at the bar, I just felt even more depressed and alone. We went in her car and I just started sobbing and hyperventilating, it was like a mini panic attack. Last time this happened, it was full blown. 

I do have anxiety issues, but panic attacks haven't been too common for me (until recently) and the tricky part was, I couldn't pinpoint exactly why I was so damn sad. But each time, I had this morose feeling all day. I can't get myself to eat anything and I just have this feeling of existential sadness and doom. Then it just builds up to a panic attack where I'm crying my eyes out and barely able to breathe. I'm on antidepressants right now (Wellbutrin) but I think I want to try an anti-anxiety med or SSRI. My psychologist is reluctant to medicate me and it's frustrating because I think that's what I really need. I've had these problems since I was a little kid. I'm just trying to live my life and I want them to go away.

Do any of you guys deal with this too? I haven't really explored my anxiety issues outside of my depression and I think it's a whole other problem I have to figure out. There are some things floating around that are kind of stressing me out and making me anxious (internships, roommate troubles, etc.) but I didn't feel like those things were really what was getting to me. 

Honestly, it seems like my recent panic attacks have had to do with my dad. My parents are older, and while they're both healthy and happy and loving and smart, I love them so much that I worry about what my life will be like without them. My dad just got hearing aids and it made me realize that he's getting older. Sometimes when I think about him or see him, I just want to cry, because I'm often away at school and I don't get to see him as much and I feel guilty about it. Ugh. I don't know how to handle this. I'm actually crying right now thinking about it."

But I would appreciate any advice on the matter because I feel like I don't have anyone to talk to about this. And I do my best thinking when I'm talking with someone about my thoughts. 

A few years ago, I contacted my old high school teacher saying that I needed an internship. He put me in touch with one of his old friends who is a CEO of 2 different companies plus invests in a lot of things in SF. Me and 3 of my friends ended up getting hired at the real estate company for three months. The office was a small one. In the office there was only 3 full time staff, plus the four interns. (He had more employees working for him, but they weren't in the office) During those three months, we'd always go out to eat, we are close with each other and talked all the time. He'd include the other interns but they always joked that we had something more or that I was spoiled by him. At the time he was married and he has three kids. We always flirted, but I have such a flirty personality. I'd flirt with 80 year olds without thinking about it. Side note. His wife also accused him of having an affair with me during my internship (which is hilarious because I never crossed the line with him but she ended up cheating...)

After my internship, we still talked and we still went out to eat every time I came into town to visit. We'd always make the effort to try to see each other if we were in the same cities. About a year ago, his life fell apart when he found out his wife had been cheating on him (emotionally). I was one of the first few people to know, he filed for divorce and has been recovering ever since. And somehow we started to talk about our chemistry one day, we both felt like we could tell each other everything  and then he said that he always thought we had chemistry but never could do anything since he was married and loved his wife. 

Fast forward to last weekend, we wanted a night to smoke and drink with each other because it was way over due. I flew into SF as a layover and he booked a hotel room for us. He booked one with two beds, and always assured me that if I didn't feel comfortable we didn't have to sleep together in the same bed. We got into the hotel room really late, and stayed up all night just smoking weed and having a good time catching up. One thing led to another, and we started kissing. We kept it at that, and fell asleep together. The next day, we both worked all day (him in an office, and I work from home so I stayed in the hotel room.) Then for dinner, he took me out to a fancy restaurant, we kissed all night and strolled the streets of SF without a care for in the world. I gave him a blow job on the balcony overlooking SF, we kissed, we touched each other but we didn't have sex because auntie flo was in town. After the night was over, we promised we'd see each other again and we're making plans to see each other in the future. We also promised each other that we would never tell anyone about that weekend/future events because A- we think that we'd get black listed if anyone ever found out. We're a part of a small community that's very judgmental. B- He's a CEO, it doesn't exactly look great when he's hanging around a 23 year old. 

We have major chemistry, he's hot, he's smart and obviously successful. I'm only 23, and he's 42. There's a 19 year age difference. Even though we didn't have sex, I can tell he's going to be 100x better than any of my previous partners because of his experience and our chemistry. But before I actually cross that line and have sex with him, is this really the right thing to do? Is it really okay to be fucking someone who is 19 years older than you and to keep that a secret? I don't go running around telling people my list of sexual partners but am I shooting myself in the foot by screwing up our relationship by having sex with him? I understand I'm probably the rebound girl (he has fucked two other girls since the divorce) and this won't be anything serious. But a little part of me can't help but think ""what if"" we could be together, how sexy we'd be together. I should probably stop that considering the fact we can never be together. Should I just enjoy the ride and see how far it goes or should I cut it off now? Also, another thing about two years ago my ex boyfriend and I broke up. We still fucked for another year (basically together without the label). Since then, I've moved to two different cities, I tried dating other people and realized that I'm still not ready to give up my independence. I'm at a place in my life where I want to be successful in my life, be a better person, and be independent. I feel like if I have sex with this guy occasionally, I'll get the best of both worlds. Sex &amp; my independence. Should I just go with the flow and enjoy the good life. I'm also known to over think things quite often. Am I over thinking things here reddit?

253s3k,1,2014-05-09,Question regarding drug tests...,[deleted],trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/253s3k/question_regarding_drug_tests/,"Hello,

So I am a college student. For about a year, up until March 10, 2014, I would probably smoke daily. I stopped at that point because I was searching for internships. Fast forward to April 1, I smoked maybe a gram within about two days; I then stopped. April 25, I took maybe 4 hits off a dro-joint.

Anyways... I got an internship. I was hired around March 26 (by phone after we interviewed in person, etc)... My boss told me my first day, which will be May 14. He never mentioned anything about a drug test-- he just told me 'We'll see you May 14th!""... 

My question is this: Would I already have known about any upcoming drug tests for this internship? It is a relatively smaller firm, and as far as I know, I will be the only intern for this branch. To my knowledge, when drug tests are administered, do they not tell you of them prior to telling you your start date?

I am a little paranoid that I may be tested on my first day. If so, what are my odds of passing this test? I have a relatively high metabolic rate and low fat content.

Please help a paranoid ent out.

For more informatin, this is an engineering internship."

First off, I have a possible internship lined up in my field that was referred to by by my father, and I could not be more excited. This is a huge opportunity for me, and this will be the first time I'll be experiencing the environment that I could possibly be working in for a good chunk of my life. Working inside such an environment both fills me with hope and nervousness. I have a strong feeling in the pit of my stomach that this will turn out to be the beginning of the next chapter of my life, and I embrace it. Despite all the hope, I can't help but to shake the idea of myself disliking it and how I may be wasting my time with what I've been doing with the past three years of education and all the money I've spent in the process. I suppose it may just be the pressure of everything, and I sincerely hope so. I have high hopes for myself, and I have every intention of fulfilling my dreams. 

As well, I am becoming more confident in myself, I'm starting to get into shape, but I still have a good amount to go before I'll be completely happy with myself. When it comes to my body, I have always taken care of myself, but within the last year or so, I have let myself go more than I would like to admit. I have taken the first steps of a healthy lifestyle for the first time in a while, and it has been hard more than anything, but I won't give up. I take my health very seriously, and I believe that life is too short to be anything less than what I could have been.

On the romance front, I have had almost no luck with women. Coming out of high school, I was, ""A late bloomer"", and that has always been a rough spot on my confidence. I understand that from a biological standpoint that I had absolutely no say in what my body does. I was 17 when I started puberty, and wasn't done until just about last year; of course the confidence has been gained back and being so late has virtually no damper on my confidence now, but it has limited the amount of time that I've had to be romantic with a woman. That being said, when I finally did get a real girlfriend for the first time, she cheated on me. I understand these things happen, but between all of the other issues I'd had in the past, I couldn't help but to wonder if it was me that was the problem. I took a long break from even showing any interest in women, because I had to honestly look at myself and improve myself before I would be comfortable giving myself to a woman again. I have had a couple dates since then, but nothing serious, I do not plan on settling for anything less than I personally think I deserve. I am a firm believer in how a relationship is based on making one another better, not holding each other back.

That's all I have for now. May update. Thanks for reading!

253w82,15,2014-05-09,College Struggles,[deleted],aspergers,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/253w82/college_struggles/,"I hate going to classes with more than 20 or so people in them. I hate Power Points. I hate how obnoxiously slow lectures feel, I feel as though if the professor simply printed out their entire lecture on a piece of paper I could absorb it in 20 minutes as opposed to 2 hours. It feels pointless to sit in a room with 200 other people, and as a result, often end up ditching.

I have an above-average GPA. My problem is that I lack all motivation to perform at an A-level. My classes aren't interesting or stimulating, my major is one that I am good at (Computer Science), and have gotten good internships in, but I find that I learn much better hands-on.

My parents want me to do a Master's. I think this is highly unnecessary for CS. The only way that I'm going to do more school is if it's an online Master's that I can work while I do.

Does anyone else have troubles in college? How do you/did you deal with them? How do I do better?"

(kinda long and whiny, please forgive me)",throwstheacctaway,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/253yds/i_want_my_turn_kinda_long_and_whiny_please/,"I'll be honest - all things considered I've got it pretty okay compared to a number of posts I've seen in here. Nevertheless I just need to vent and/or ramble. Apologies for disorganization.

---

preemptive tl;dr - my life was previously a train wreck, I got through to stability on the other side with a lot of help, I desire a companion to share life with, I'm failing to find one for various reasons, I'm frustrated.

---

I grew up a bit of a loner, the only friends I really had were those made through my far more socially adept younger brother. Once I went off to college on my own, I was quickly miserable and struggled to fend for myself. I lost touch with anyone in my graduating high school class who I had any proximity to, later fell into academic suspension, and eventually was diagnosed with depression after basically hitting a rock bottom and experience suicidal ideation. I'm lucky in that I was able to recognize that I needed help and was able to reach out for it, not everyone is gets that sadly. Even with medication and counseling, school was still a mountain I struggled to climb. Part of that is my fault, at times I thought I was ""better"" and would stop taking my meds, then steadily slide back to right where I was before I started treatment without being able to fight it. I learned the hard way over the course of about three years of this cycle that I have a very real and chronic mental health condition - depression and social anxiety - which I can't afford to not stay on top of.

The one saving grace in my college career was a drive I've had since high school to make video games. In a rare moment of social bravery I was able to get involved with a video game club, which led to me getting a summer internship, which led to me getting a full-time job which I hold to this day, despite attempting to go back to school multiple times and the company all but folding at one point when money ran out following poor treatment from a publisher. For some reason I had blind faith that everything would turn out okay insofar as this company goes - I got in on the ground floor via a summer internship helping to make their first big game with three other guys - and somehow it's worked out. There's been some luck there too, as I would have never met any of the guys I work with now had I just gone through four years of college in-and-out like everyone else does.

I think I'm reasonably mentally stable now, given that I can hold a job and perform reasonably well at it. I am relatively independent at this point, I pay for my own apartment in the city, I just bought a new car, I can buy things I want on a whim (within reason), and I'll be able to live comfortably and continue saving money while paying for all those things. But I'm still alone. I'm alone in that no one in my office really hangs out with anyone after hours. I'm alone in that I still haven't found any sort of extracurriculars outside of work to engage in with other people. I'm alone in that despite four years of membership at several online dating web sites I've met exactly two girls for one-off dates, neither of which amounted to anything.

Which I guess brings me to my greatest frustration at the moment - of my entire life really - I want to be more social. I want to date people. I want to find a girl who's attractive, compatible with me / brings out a better side of my personality, and is looking for someone. I want to have the confidence to find that person. I want a damn chance. Hell, I just want a hug. That shouldn't be too much for a 27-year-old American male who gets to make a living doing something he's passionate about, who has a few outside hobbies and things he has the freedom and opportunity to partake in (video games obviously, but also guitar, an obsession with the NFL, the WWE, occasionally singing, and owning a cat), and who isn't a disrespectful asshole (referring to basically the brazenly open solicitations by some guys online basically treating women as objects) to ask.

I readily accept that I'm at least part of the problem here in that I've got to find a way to get myself out in front of other people and be more comfortable in my own skin. I've never done well in a dive bar, for example, and approaching a girl on a whim is still something I fail miserably at; I become a nervous wreck and just want to get out. I've always done better being introduced to a person through someone, or with a step of abstraction in between for the first bit to establish some sort of rapport (i.e. the online thing). But with respect to the online dating thing which again I've actually been able to handle, it's incredibly frustrating when I try to send out a first message to try and start a legitimate conversation with a girl based on something she's written about herself and just get absolutely nothing back, which has happened countless dozens of times at this point. It's repeated blows to my self-esteem and any attempt at my establishing validity to my identity as a male human being. I'm not exactly Bradley Cooper or whoever the in guy is these days, but I'd like to think I'm not repulsive.

I just don't know what to do, where to start, or anything to that end at this point. I'm frustrated and honestly a bit exhausted with my failures at the whole online dating thing. I continue to be absolutely terrible trying to initiate social contact on my own absent a layer of abstraction behind a keyboard. I don't want to go to a dive bar, drink my face off, make a drunken ass of myself, and throw myself at someone I'm not honestly attracted to at last call. I don't want to go to a strip club and pay money to have my male identity validated in some fake form. I don't want to otherwise throw money at someone to feign attraction to me. I just want to find someone attractive, smart, level-headed, and single who is attracted to me too and anything and everything that comes with that. I'd like to not be the only single person in my office any longer. Is that too much to ask?

So yeah, there's my whining. Constructive feedback and/or suggestions are welcome. Happy Friday!"

254nb7,1,2014-05-09,Software Engineering intern here. Was handed a set of wireframes for a web-UI... And I have no clue what to do with them,BlackoutBen,web_design,https://www.reddit.com/r/web_design/comments/254nb7/software_engineering_intern_here_was_handed_a_set/,"As the title suggests, I am a software engineering student on an internship where I have been tasked with creating a software control solution for one of our product lines. My project manager preferred a web-app design as opposed to a standalone application, so I've sort of been rolling with that. While I have a fairly decent programming background from classwork and such, I know very little about web design.

The result was a web-app that had all the right functionality working (the actual ""control"" stuff was done with python scripts on an Apache server that the webapp would send requests to via AJAX), but which looked like crap. It was usable, and it presented visual feedback based on the responses from the scripts, but my project manager put it best when he said ""It's pretty clear this is an engineering-designed interface.""

So he got one of our marketing people to draft up some wireframes in Axure and send them to me. They look awesome! BUT I have no idea how to implement them, or essentially how to go from wireframes to a working UI. I tried basically yanking certain elements and their corresponding styles from the wireframes and popping them into a new html document, but it took me two days to get even the ""shell"" around the page using this method.

In a 5-minute-meeting with my PM and another marketing guy with a background in web design, he implied I was going about it totally wrong, and offered to build the interface for me, saying he could do it very easily. While that takes a whole lot of pressure off of me with regard to the project and its deadline, I won't be learning much about the process of building a UI this way, which is something I was very interested in. Unfortunately the guy who offered to build it is also ridiculously busy, so there's really no good time that I could sit down with him and talk about how I should have approached it, what the proper way would be, etc.

So I guess my question is this: What is the ""proper"" or most efficient way of building a user interface from a prototype? Was I going about it right, but just taking a long time due to my inexperience working with this sort of thing, or was I just completely off the mark in my approach?"

Our budget was around $750/800. If the rent is closer to $900 we would want at least some of the utilities included. 

We have been searching for months and we either find cheap apartments in really ghetto places like E. Fowler where a weave tumbleweeded into the apartment the manager was showing us and doors had graffitti all over them along with half naked toddlers running off into different buildings with no parent any where in sight. 

OR 

the apartments were nice but way too expensive and didnt include any utilities what so ever.

We started looking for houses to rent but they all want us to take over mortgage payments. 

Ive been looking for months, the end of our lease is in a couple months and we havent found anything.. I am getting more and more disheartened and stressed out betweenmy internship, two jobs, summer school and still not finding a place. 

Can someone please please please help us? Let us know if there are other options im just not seeing or maybe theres apartments or condos or whatever that I dont know about?! I could really use some help

I just fucking love mathematics and I think this shit is fun.**

I'm a relatively well-geared Barb (I can solo T6 relatively easily). I am looking for one more piece of Earth gear so I can have the hoppy 'I Win' Barb Build.

Upon seeing the post with the Legendary drop chance I decided to do some calculations just to see how RNG influences my chances of getting my Pull of The Earth gloves I want so badly. Here goes:

**For those that don't give a shit about the mathematics just skip to the TL;DR**

Base assumptions:

1) There is a 85% chance any drop will be Smart Loot and a 15% chance it won't be. This is why I will sometimes get a WD drop on my Barb or a weapon with MS Dex roll. This means that this 15% will be absolutely useless to me so it doesn't even factor into my calculations.

2) I am looking for a Trifecta roll for the Pull of the Earth. While I'm dreaming big I also want to titfuck Kate Upton. But we won't even go into those odds because my life is sad enough as it is. (I'm writing a fucking odds analysis for a bullshit digital item from a video game that I want so badly to feel good about myself...that's sad as shit)

3) This calculation only takes into account what the legendary will be. It does not take into account the chance the legendary will drop. (If you want to take into account all of it figure out what the drop rate is from the torment you play on the most and multiply that by the final number)

**Here we go:**

For the Barbarian there are 27 classes of items out of the 42 total classes of items that are usable. By this I mean 27 items are of classes like mighty weapons, belts, necklaces, etc. The other 15 are things like crossbows, mojos, orbs, etc. shit that is completely useless to me.

**1)** our first calculation is the chance that when the legendary item that will drop will be in the class of Gloves. The chances there I will get a pair of Gloves that will roll Smart Loot (i.e. Main stat is STR) are:

*(1/27) x .85 = 0.03148 or 3.148%*

**2)** our next calculation is the percentage chance that from the gloves that dropped, they will be the Pull of the Earth. From the data, there is a 8.06% chance that Barbs will drop a Pull of the Earth when Gloves drop. This now brings our total chances of finding at PotE to:

*0.03148 x 0.0806 = 0.002537 or 0.2537%*

**3)** as I said before ~~tits~~ trifecta or GTFO. The PotE gloves are guaranteed 8-10% Critical Hit Chance and as I said before these are smart loot so for Barbs they will roll 626-750 STR. Then there are 4 Random Magic Properties; 2 primary, 2 secondary. Since I don't care about the secondary properties, I will be focusing on the 2 primary properties: Critical Hit Damage and Increased Attack Speed. These will randomly roll from a pool of 9 remaining Random Primary Properties:

* IAS
* Armor
* Regen
* Area Damage
* LoH
* CDR
* Resource Cost Reduction
* Vitality
* Critical Hit Damage

These are Dependent events since the second magic property depends on the first magic property. Imagine the bowl of marbles analogy: **There are seven huge piles of shit and two green marbles. What are the chances you draw a green marble on your first try, then without putting it back, draw a green marble on your second try?**

This calculation is: P(IAS and CHD) = P(IAS or CHD) x P(CHD | IAS or IAS | CHD) = 2/9 * 1/8 = 0.02778 or 2.778%

Keep in mind that this is just the chance FOR THE GLOVES.

If we take into account the chance for the gloves to drop in the first place, our new number is:

*0.02778 x 0.002537 = 0.0000705 or 0.00705%*

***This means that the chances that any given Legendary you find will be a Pull of The Earth set Gloves with STR and a trifecta of CC, CHD, and IAS are 0.00705% or a 1 in 14,184 chance***

just for fun, here are some things you have a better chance at than finding a Pull of The Earth with a Trifecta:

1. ~~Getting injured from fireworks: 1 in 19,556~~
1. ~~Becoming a Pro Athlete: 1 in 22,000~~
1. Person in the military ~~winning~~ being awarded the Medal of Honor: 1 in 11,000
1. Winning an Academy Award: 1 in 11,500
1. Bowling a 300 game: 1 in 11,500
1. ~~Chances **OF BEING FUCKING MURDERED: 1 in 18,000**~~
1. ~~Chances of being **FUCKING MURDERED WITH A GUN: 1 in 25,000**~~
1. ~~AIDS: 1 in 18,000~~
1. ~~Flipping a coin and getting heads approximately damn near 14 times in a row~~.



**TL;DR As a Barbarian, you have a ~~57.6%~~23.4% better chance of winning an academy award~~being murdered in real life~~ than you do of finding the Pull of The Earth Gloves with a Trifecta in a digital game....HAPPY FRIDAY!!!**

It seems there is enough interest in the community for this type of thing so I'll try and chip away at it this summer in-between my internship. Lastly, there have been questions asking me of what gear I'm running so here are some links to my current build of my WW/Frenzy Lightning build.

[**edit 3**]: Changed wording from feedback from /u/guilty_pleasure: ""You don't **win** the Medal of Honor, you jackass."" I edited this mainly because he had a very good point and he asked in such a nice, polite way that wasn't douchebagdickish at all.

[**edit 2**]: from /u/ksion: But the pedant in me requires me to point out that you have an error in (3). You are calculating the odds of specifically IAS followed by CHD -- that is, you implicitly assume it matters which is rolled first. In reality, you are as fine with IAS and CHD as you are with CHD and IAS, but you're only accounting for the former.
So you need to multiply the odds by two, which yields you the final result of 0.00704%, or 1 in 14,188. Better odds than being murdered, fortunately, but you might still want to prepare the speech addressing the Academy

**[edit 1]**: there are a lot of comments regarding enchanting (and titfucking Kaley Cuoco) with the thought that you only need one of the two stats to roll. So here are some more odds.

take the base chance for PotE Gloves to drop and then since you only need one of the two IAS/CHD to roll then your are now looking at 0.002537 x 2/9 = 0.0005638 or **0.0564% which is a 1 in 1773.75 chance**.

[**edit**]: from /u/ksion: But the pedant in me requires me to point out that you have an error in (3). You are calculating the odds of specifically IAS followed by CHD -- that is, you implicitly assume it matters which is rolled first. In reality, you are as fine with IAS and CHD as you are with CHD and IAS, but you're only accounting for the former.
So you need to multiply the odds by two, which yields you the final result of 0.00704%, or 1 in 14,188. Better odds than being murdered, fortunately, but you might still want to prepare the speech addressing the Academy"

Just after I got there, LO said something to me that just made my heart break for him. We we were sitting down and he turns to me and says, ""I think (BM's aunt) is my Mommy. Or maybe Maw-maw (SO's mother) is. I don't know."" It's been two years this month that his bio-mom moved across the country to be with a guy, and she's never contacted him once since she left. Nothing. No gifts, no Skype calls. Nothing. 

After this I did something I probably shouldn't have, and that was look up her Facebook page. It's just none of my business what she does. But a post from a few months ago says she's coming back for a visit this month (nothing about LO, just about being in state again), and as far as I know she hasn't contacted my SO about this or possibly seeing LO. I don't want her to see LO and say ""Oh I'm your mommy but I have to leave again in a few days! Nice seeing you! Okay, bye."" 

I just don't want her to hurt LO again. Should I tell SO about this? Is it my place to do so? He leaves at the end of the month, so he will still be here if she actually does end up visiting.

*SO has a great internship in another state for the summer, so that's what I was talking about when I was saying that he was leaving. LO's grandma will be watching him, and I will be visiting as well. "

255bzg,4,2014-05-09,Instagram Marketing Strategy Dilemma,cinemaclub,socialmedia,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialmedia/comments/255bzg/instagram_marketing_strategy_dilemma/,"Hi guys, I was wondering if I could borrow your collective social media expertise to help me solve a tricky Instagram marketing problem that I'm currently having. I've recently been taken on as an intern for a newly emerging tea company tasked with driving sales for the product. As 1 of 6 interns, there is heavy competition as to who can create the best account in order to win the job at the end of the internship. Now, here's where the problem begins... My strategy to win the customers (and ultimately land the position) has been to create well designed, original content aimed at brightening up followers Instagram feeds and generate love for the brand. This strategy has been going well so far gaining me a strong follower base, however other interns have had far more success using a much cheaper tactic; reposting pictures that are already popular on Instagram and posting supposedly funny memes that are vaguely relatable to the product. The message I've been getting from my boss is that the internship will be won purely by the person who can gain the greatest number of followers on their account. However I feel that I would be cheapening myself by copying other interns approach to achieve this, whist also alienating my current followers by downgrading the professional style of my posts. What do you believe would be the best strategy for me to take from here? And exactly what strategies can I implement that would increase my follower count but without me having to changing the current ascetic of my posts? Any advice on the matter is very much appreciated. Thank you! "

I think in a lot of ways he's immature (ha, funny right?) and doesn't appreciate me.

I love massaging my hardworking man- always have, and taking care of him w/ food and love because since I dont work (a light internship and school) I thought I could help however I could. I have done it with the few SO's I've had and my BF was no exception. I do stuff specifically for him also, if I dont think to, he asks and I do.

What bothers me is he **never gives it back**. He some times may rub one shoulder for a literal second, but thats it. Nothing for me, and he doesn't even think twice. Even in bed. What starts bugging me is I feel as if he's playing mind games. My internship is in a prestigious kitchen and I do stand for eight hours some days, and I tell him im exhausted before we really start to just spend time together. He later asks for something of me, be it sex, a massage, or something physical. I tell him no and once he finally gets that Im not playing hard to get (he always assumes I am) he turns over and literally pouts. Then I feel guilty and start things up. *""You dont have to""* he says but I know in the back of my head id rather him be happy rather than pouting and wasting my entire night.

Going along with the mind games, he loves looking at my phone. I dont care because I have nothing to hide and I know he's **insecure** because his ex cheated on him, so I allow it. But he knows there are two places he cant go- my notes and my recordings. My notes are basically like my diary but in poem/song versions (cheesy Im aware) and him not respecting my wishes has led me to delete things in fear ill be embarrassed or he'll find things no one can read about,like what a certain uncle did to me in the past. The other night he teased me, going to my recordings. I had one left and only kept it because I liked the melody I came up with. I tackled him and he dropped it, it was playful. It went on to him plugging my phone in to his giant speakers and blasting my shitty singing throughout his building. I died. Im a teenage girl and he decided to do that to me. The worst part? When I was still upset after a minute, he started calling me a 'grumpy ass' which was strange considering he's never called me anything with a foul word in it before, then he decided to pout and **I** started feeling guilty. *What?* Then I ended up giving him a BJ. As a strong woman who prides herself in *keeping* my pride, I was humiliated and disgusted with myself.

Last big thing, he's embarrassed of me which I will NOT put up with. I have higher self esteem then most, including him, and it just gets under my skin. He makes fun of my body, saying I know he's 'only teasing', but am I laughing? No. He wants me to dye my hair, acting excited what I talk about it, bummed when Its later rather than sooner. He tries to get pictures of us where I look older. I used to always have curly hair now all  do is straighten it for him. If he's embarrassed of my age and my braces then why be with a younger person? I thought he knew the multiple risks he was taking.

We've had talks, and probably the only great thing about us is that we're connected mentally. If ones thinking it the other is too, usually only with serious topics though. I've told him I dont love him and skipping to afterwards he always seems hurt. ""Im sorry"" I say. ""Why? You just said you dont care about me at all."" Which was a bit mellow dramatic. That night we told each other we care for each other, and I said how I wanted someone to be in my phone as ""The babe &amp;lt;3"" as cheesy as it was, and he said the feeling was mutual. He asked if I wanted to break up each time (We've had this talk before) and I said no because that would make me sad. He said he'd rather be with me than alone, at the time I agreed but I started to realize I could do better than him on different levels, and that I wont be alone no matter what. 

The thing is, though, im starting **not to care for him.** At all. Im starting to resent him and I feel like our relationship is only about sex, which he jokes about a lot. It has to be, right? We have no romantic feelings toward each other and he always feels like a brother, a little annoying brother with constant hard-ons.

What makes me want to make up my mind about ending it are two things. First, he's moving to the city, and as a teenager with a car but without a license and the city being 40 minutes away, it doesn't seem worth it to me. I think it would feel even more like friends with benefits. The second reason is because there's a boy in school I had a crush on long before meeting my Boyfriend. Everyone and everything is telling me to dump the insecure little man and go be happy with someone closer to my age and someone who makes me happy. I find myself rather being with this boy than my BF. Now, being faithful is no issue for me, dont get me wrong, but I just think I rushed into this relationship too fast.

The cherry on top is this Bf is whom I lost my virginity to. After a week of 'dating' (making out and grinding) it wasn't a big deal to me which tells me I dont love him and there are absolutely no chances of that happening. Now whenever we have sex I feel sick. 

Along with him acting like a little kid, never able to settle down, being annoying and being aware he is, and me getting the feeling he compares me too much to his ex, I think it's ready for me to end things, but I need second opinions.

**Sad thing is...I think I've made up my mind...**so im wondering if I want you guys to change it. Is that the mind games and slow brainwashing he's had over me or is that true feeling? I want to stay friends with him because I know we have a friendship, but thats it.

For a man with no friends, Im not very fit to fill everything he needs from people.

**tl;dr**: Should I break off a dead relationship to run to another in a cliche teenage way or should I give a shitty relationship longer and see if anything sparks? (Please try and skim the entire thing.)"

I'm a freshman college student and am going to have my first office job as an intern for a congressman in capitol hill. After talking to past interns, it appears wearing a suit everyday is the norm.

The most formal pieces of clothing I have are 2 Uniqlo OCBD's and [this](http://www.uniqlo.com/us/men/outerwear/blazers/dry-comfort/men-dry-comfort-jacket-092146999.html#03) blazer.

I'd love any help I can get on what type of suits to get, what brands to look out for, and how to avoid looking repetitive while being limited to ~2 suits. I also need to find a good pair of dress shoes. After lurking through some footwear albums I've really grown fond of brown wingtips and captoes, but I don't know if it would be appropriate/easy to match with the type of suits I'll be wearing. I'd also need advice for types and designs for ties! I'm about 5'9 and have a slim build (145lbs).

I'm a complete novice when it comes to this topic and don't know anyone I can personally turn to when it comes to work wear fashion, so please excuse my ignorance."

I'm an IT student about to start my senior year at a fairly large university, and around 6 months ago I scored a very nice student worker position in the desktop support department that deals mainly with staff members and university executives (which are handled by the full-timers of course). 

I love the job, and the bosses, but that's the problem I'm having. I have somewhat of a dilemma; I'm getting very comfortable with the job to the point that I have been hinted at being hired full-time when I graduate. Apparently, all the IT major student workers in the past have been hired full time when they graduate, starting around 40k salary. To me, that sounds great especially because I would be able to go for my masters paid for by the school. But, I don't have any other experience on my resume right now, and to be honest I'm pretty sure I don't want to do desktop support for the rest of my life. Am I shooting myself in the foot by choosing not to do an internship this summer and just working where I am now full-time? Part of me says any experience is better than no experience, and I definitely have a few solid references for the future, but the other part says I should be seeking internships at larger, more well-known companies. 

I'm mainly here to ask for advice because I don't want to end up stuck later on when so many other aspects of IT interest me as well. What do you think?"

So I can't do half of the things I'm used to doing.

I threw this together by looking at a few routines and some forum posts on Bodybuilding.com. I have no clue if it's even good or not, though.

Currently sitting at 6'1"" 180lbs. Started lifting at 145lbs about 9 months ago.

**Current lifts:** 

* Bench - 235 1RM

* Squat - 225x6 (260 estimated 1rm)

* Deadlift - 275x4 (300 estimated 1rm)

ABxABxx is the weekly spread. Everything is 3 sets (10, 8, 6 reps) unless stated otherwise.


**Workout A**

* Bench Press

* Leg Press (will be replaced with Squats when I move)

* Chin Ups (weighted)

* Rope tricep extensions

* Facepulls 

* Heavy dumbbell shrugs (3 sets - 6, 5, 4 reps)

**Workout B**

* Dips (weighted)

* Back extensions (to be replaced with deadlift)

* Bent-over rows

* Lat raises

* Bicep curls

* Chest fly

Is that any good, or is there something better I could be doing? I really want to stay on a 4 day split if possible.

Am I making the right decision?,_clevermeals,actuallesbians,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuallesbians/comments/256lft/my_mother_55f_is_kicking_me_22f_out_because_she/,"Hey, ladies of r/actuallesbians. I've got a huge problem, and I've decided to come to you guys for help.

Here's some background of what's been going on:

I'm in my final year of university, living at home -- because my mother won't let me move out. I'm on scholarship, and I finish in December. My mother is very Catholic, and she's suspected for a long time now that I'm gay, but I've always kind of refrained from bringing it up with her, because she always says things like, ""Oh, you can tell me *anything*."", and then proceeds to get really upset and abusive about the whole thing. This has happened over failed units at university, late nights out, etc.

Anyway, about a month ago, she went through my bag (did I mention that she does things like that?) and found some weed that I had in it, so she put me on lockdown for about a month. She's been starting to ease up, but this morning, she went through my bag, found my cigarettes, and started a shouting match with me. She threatened to hit me if I kept talking, and to cancel the internship that I have lined up for next month.

I asked her not to do that, and she basically told me that I have two options -- either I stay at home and listen to everything she tells me to do, without fail, or I move out and never come back home again. I called my cousin, and asked her if my dog and I could move in with her for a couple of weeks, until I sort my shit out, finish my semester, defer the remaining semester, and move to the UK to be with my girlfriend -- who was the one who suggested this plan.

I managed to sort that out, and she agreed to let me stay for the remaining weeks, until the end of the semester. My mom isn't too fond of this cousin, and I know that by going to stay with her, I'm going to push my mom away, even further.

So, ladies of r/actuallesbians, am I making the right decision here? Do you have any words of advice or wisdom to throw my way? Do any of you know anything about moving to the UK, and about bringing pets with you?

Honestly, I don't think it's actually hit me yet, because I've been fairly calm about this whole situation."

Today we'll be hearing from - 


-------

**The Art Conservator** 

**/u/art_con:** I work at a well known university museum in North America. Essentially, I help fix and maintain the paintings collection at the museum that I work for. Primarily, this involves preparing paintings for loans and exhibitions. I have also helped teach undergraduate classes and workshops related to the technical examination of art work, given gallery talks, and helped with condition surveys of large gifts to our collection.


I was always interested in both science and fine arts. I ended up deciding to go to a liberal arts university that had a decent fine arts program because I did not feel comfortable limiting my options by attending an art school. I ended up attending a university that offered an undergraduate degree in art conservation, learned about the field, and realized it was the perfect marriage of my two areas of interest. I have pursued a career in art conservation since then. I now have a masters with a focus on paintings conservation.




**The Museum Pros**



**/u/therewillBsnacks:** I have a BA and MA in Art History with special interests in contemporary art, participatory practice and art education. I have worked in community-based nonprofits for several years doing public programs- especially art-based initiatives which led me to work at a few art museums. 

The museum I'm at now is one of the largest in the United States, where I work as an educator (lead tours and art programs) but I'm also responsible for community outreach.

**/u/BellsBastian:**  I have a BA in History, but my background is in journalism. I took an unusual route to the museum world -- I was a military journalist and television news producer for 8 years, before I became an assistant curator at a small history museum in the US two years ago. 

As with most small museums (full-time staff of two!) I wear many hats -- in addition to collection management, I also do all of our marketing and public relations, program development, and exhibit planning. I also manage all our part-time staff, volunteers, and interns.

**/u/cpatterson:** I am currently working at the 9/11 Memorial Museum, which is tangentially art-related (I'm in Collections/Exhibitions dept) but mostly memorial. I handle all day-to-day administration of the Collections and Exhibitions departments, assist the heads of each of those departments, and coordinate various projects within the Museum as needed.  

I grew up in the US but completed my undergraduate (art history degree) and graduate (arts management MA) education in the UK. While in the UK I worked for some large art museums (Tate Britain, V&amp;A), a conservation/heritage charity (The National Trust) and a small gallery. Moved back to the States about a year ago and worked for the Indianapolis Museum of Art, then I moved to NYC very recently and just started my new job at the 9/11 Memorial Museum. In all of the above, I have been an administrator/coordinator within various collections, exhibitions and projects departments.

257bkc,2,2014-05-10,A cop pulled me over last night and accused me of being high.,josephgordonreddit,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/257bkc/a_cop_pulled_me_over_last_night_and_accused_me_of/,"Before anyone flies off the handle and does a tirade against all policemen in the United States, read what I write.

It was 2 AM. I was tired; I wake up at 7 every day, go to the gym, do some work (for which I'm not paid), and on the rarest of the rare occasions do I actually go out. I texted one of my best friends that I was bored; he responded by saying that he's going bowling with some of his old high school friends and that I should join. Obviously, you know my answer.

The other guys drink, I don't; alcohol doesn't sit well with me at all. Fast-forwarding through an unusually raucous bit of bowling, I'm driving home. It's foggy out; so much so that it's hard to see about 100 feet in front of the car when the street lights are on. 

I'm going around 65- I'm absolutely tired, after all, and I want to go home. I'm nearly there, too, when I see the lights glowing inside my car. I had seen the two cop cars a few miles back, pulling someone else over, to which I thought, ""sucks to be that guy!"" and drove on. Now I was that guy. 

The officer, who was bald and shorter than I am (which is saying something; I'm 5'8.5 on a good day), gets my license and all that good stuff. He asks me to step out of the car; when I ask him why, he doesn't give a reason. On a day when I wasn't feeling so exhausted, maybe I would have kept being a bit more, ehem, litigious, but I wanted to feel the warm comfort of my bed, so I stepped out. 

He asked me how much I've had to drink, to which I answered honestly, absolutely none. He then asked me how much I smoked today, which took me by absolute surprise; I've never smoked anything in my life, except for maybe some steaks back when I wasn't a vegetarian. I, again, answer honestly, except he doesn't believe me. 

He says that my 'eyes tremored' when I held my head back and closed my eyes at his behest. Now that I recall it with a clearer head, I realize that I was trying not to fall asleep, or at least fall over. 

Another officer comes along, says my car smells of both weed and alcohol. I'm starting to think that they're looking to incriminate me, but again, in this sleep-deprived state, it's hard to tell. I, riskily, offer for them to search my car. Who knows, if I had been someone else, slightly tipsy, or maybe even not white, they might have taken me up on it and planted something in my car. The only thing my car smells of is moldy carpets, which, last time I checked, is very far from weed. 

I ended up getting an $85 ticket, which, to me, is a shit-ton. I don't have an income (interns, hooray), and since there's enough documented evidence of me going 65 in a construction zone, there's nothing much to fight. I didn't see any signs because of the fog, but that's not much of an excuse.

It's weird to think that, even when I was being completely honest, the cop kept insisting that I tell him about any weed I've smoked during the day. Slightly scary as well.

EDIT: Officer also said I had a ""green tongue,"" which, upon checking my tongue in the mirror, wasn't true."

I am a student and I'm looking for a fun area around LA that has a reasonable commute by public transport (&lt;1 hr).

Does anyone have any ideas where to start looking? I've started looking for Craigslist posts in Manhattan Beach and Hermosa Beach but I have no idea if these are the right places for me on a student budget.  Any advice appreciated!"

       I just want to thank you for your experiences. Whataburger, mechanical bull riding, H.E.B, Rudy's, North Gate, 6th street, driving on the beach, helping friends with ranch work, I could go on for days of the memories I will cherish for a long time. I only wish I had more time to spend in places like Austin, College Station, Houston, and Corpus Christi.
              I originally came here on crazy circumstances, and I only have about 14 weeks left till I return to my home up north, and won't be able to return for a long time. It all started with a kid named Serhan, a Turkish foreign exchange student. 
He was very good at stocks, specifically currency exchange. When his dad gave him some money to play with, he turned 4k into 60k within a year or two, and bought himself a corvette. Probably about 6 years ago, he was at a night club in Houston, and when the valet brought his car up front, someone tried to carjack him, and ended up shooting him in the face and the arm. From there, he spent about a year in northern New Jersey at his Uncle's house, to have his jaw replaced with an Iron Bar, and his fore arm fixed as well, in a prestigious hospital in NYC. This is where I come into the story.
        As he stayed with his Uncle, who happened to be my neighbor, he sat outside most days, fairly bored on his porch. My buddies and I invited him over to hang out, and we ended up becoming best friends with the guy. At the end of his speech therapy and recovery, he went back to his school at Texas A&amp;M Corpus Christi.
     Meanwhile, I lost most of my friends in High school, sadly for neglecting them for my whore girlfriend, who cheated on me and dumped me. Worst part, I graduated early so that when I was done with my associates at a local community college, she would be graduating highschool( she was in the grade below me) So here I am all by myself, gf is gone who I dedicated my time to, I graduated early, my class won states for football my senior year which I missed, and then most people I knew went away to college. Within a few months I was heavy into drugs, specifically painkillers and hallucinogenics, and I was sleeping in my car for getting caught with drugs at  my moms. After a few suicide attempts, and getting pneumonia from sleeping in my car during a blizzard, I decided things need to change. I met some columbian girl, who, had a bf, and he was sorta known to be a little crazy. Long story short, I was jumped by him and a few of his friends, and when my friends went to his house to stick up for me, his family got involved, along with one kid that was mutually friends with me and the bf. The family all got charged with assault and my friends got let off on account of the family having weapons. For the record, this dad punched my friend in the face because he wouldn't get in the car, and to started a huge brawl. I felt horrible, I never wanted for anything like that to happen just because I was spiteful towards love from my previous gf. I was being threatened of being used by the family for causing ""gang violence,"" I was suicidal, a drug addict, and I was hating every second of my life. That's where you come in, Texas.
      My friend Serhan told me to pack all of my stuff and get away from everything to the beautiful waters of Corpus Christi, so I did. Sadly, within a few months, his gf got in a huge fight with him at out apartment, breaking stuff, and throwing stuff at him. When he threw, and I mean threw her out cause she was kicking and screaming, she got a bruise on her elbow and her face. From there she exclaimed, ""HAHA, now I'm gonna get you deported!"" She did, one day homeland security knocked on his door with plane tickets, and he had 5 days to leave the country. 
      Because of him, and the love Texas has showed me, I got my act together, will be finished with classes Tuesday, and graduating in August after I internship at a hospital downtown. 
   So thank you, Corpus Christi, and Texans all over. ""The jersey devil came to the body of Christ, and got redeemed"" my friends always say. But really, I wouldn't be here today without this state and wouldn't be looking at doctorate schooling for Physical Therapy without you all. If there's anything I should try and see in my last 14 weeks, please let me know. It's been a great four years, and I will always have a place for Texas in my heart."

This update is very bittersweet. I've been interning for 5 weeks on Monday, and I have absolutely been in love with working as a medical assistant. Everything had seemingly come together for me. And then I had the blow-out with my brother and his girlfriend. I took a half-day that day and asked my superior if I could go home, giving only fundamental details. She said it was no problem. So, I just went home and I chewed my brother out. I let out all of my anxiety, my anger...everything.

It's been affecting me everyday since. He won't take responsibility for anything that happened. I keep going over everything in my head. And yet, all I keep coming back to is that this young woman who I let into my home (sometimes all day and all night, literally), who would use my kitchen, use my amenities and whatnot, she was just watching me and picking up every little mistake I made and secretly held it against me. She would camp out in my home, seemingly just preoccupied with my brother but really she was coming in and secretly judging me. That is slowly sinking in and it's really really disturbing me. 

After a while, I knew she didn't like me. One of the very common things she would do, that kind of went over my head, was greeting my son then feeling his diaper, declaring it full and then just looking at me. I guess looking back, she thought she was the baby police. 

I can't blame her too much for her actions because my brother is more at fault than anything. He's abdicating taking responsibility for what happened. All he says is that he doesn't agree with what she said but, ""she's her own person and there's nothing I can do"". 

Unfortunately, this had lead to him showing me more disrespect. Today, he told me that before work he was going to hang out with her. I reiterated that she is NOT coming in our home. He just scoffed at me and said, ""I'm not talking about this anymore, you're going to have to suck it up"". So, I drew up a roommate agreement with all of my stipulations and I'm forcing him to agree with them or he's got 30 days to move out. I'm starting piece together that he's more in agreeance with his girlfriend than he is with me. 

Unfortunately, as a mother I feel like I cannot subject my son to all of this. I've been so much better about picking up around the house, I've gotten a better dish/laundry schedule going, and I'm going to start eating healthier and more at home. As a bonus, I got offered employment from my internship site, and I'm accepting. I'm just burnt out on all the drama and I kind of just want them both out of there because it just doesn't feel like very positive energy. I can't deal with my brother being dismissive and probably judging me/my home himself. I can't trust him. That's a horrible pill to swallow. 

Now, I'm incredibly sensitive and excessively worried about being a good mother to my son. I look at him everyday and it just tears me apart that someone would say that he doesn't deserve me, that I don't care about him or that I neglect him. 

I've taken a lot of the previous comments to heart and I'm going to try to move on as much as I can. "

I checked out 101 San Fernando and it turns out its $4000.. for a 3 month lease. Does anyone know of any nice apartment complexes like San Fernando that won't make me go broke?    
If I can't find anything, my last resort is SJSU intern housing but i'd really rather not live in dorms.   

Any help is appreciated, I've spent countless hours trying to find something reasonable.

Santa Clara is also a possibility."

However, today we got a call form Michael Rosales saying that he was in town and wanted to come over and host an impromptu event. Needless to say he stopped by and it was a great time. After enjoying the CoTM, Michael showed me another called the Intemperance BA XXI Envy. Its the same blend but in a short perfecto (5x50). It was a amazing cigar, if I had the funds I would have bought a box right then and there. It had one of the smoothest draws I have ever experienced as well as a almost perfect burn. Flavors included a wonderful spice with tones of cocoa and chocolate. The Brazilian binder and Nicaraguan/Dominican filler made for an very complex and satisfying smoke. If you like the cigar of the month, then I would definitely recommend picking up one of these! The event was great and Michael Rosales was an excellent guy, making me all the more likely to continue purchasing his cigars. "

What I’m looking for this time around: someone with a genuine interest in getting to know me and building a stable relationship (platonic or otherwise) where we can open up to each other (aka not a  situation where we talk for 2 days just out of boredom).

i'd prefer someone semi-local, and if not local, then someone willing to commit to make the drive to meet up if it ends up working out. (bonus points if you're near Conshohocken and wanna get drinks sometime)

also i realize that what i'm looking for is kind of a long shot, but i've found it before on here (as short lived as it was) and i'd really like to find someone to build that kind of connection with again. no harm in at least trying, right?

about me:

* i'm 21 years old.

* i'm a college senior, but home from school for the summer and starting an internship on monday.

* i eventually am hoping to get a job in technology consulting and software implementation. 

* my favorite restaurant is the cheesecake factory (lol).

259djy,1,2014-05-11,Can I use early withdrawal to MAKE money with the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP)?,BUTnothingHAPPENED,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/259djy/can_i_use_early_withdrawal_to_make_money_with_the/,"I have an internship this summer where my employer will match 100% of 3% of my pay and an additional 50% of the next 2% (i.e. if I contribute 5%, they'll match 4%).

Say I put in $500 over the summer, and my employer matches $400. Then I withdraw the money at the end of the summer. This withdrawal is taxed as income, so I'll lose ~20% after federal/state taxes (at least until my tax return...). I would also incur a 10% early withdrawal penalty, and be barred from contributing to the TSP for 6 months. All in all, I would end up with .7*900 = $630 after taxes, if I'm correct. In contrast, I would have only made $350 without the TSP. The 6 month barring won't affect me since my internship only lasts the summer and I won't begin work again until the next summer. Is this a loophole, or am I missing something?"

Nothing is going to get better.,fuckeverything0,MMFB,https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/259g9i/everything_fucking_sucks_nothing_is_going_to_get/,"I'm a college student who has lost all reasons to be optimistic and I don't feel as if anyone supports me. I know that my problems are nothing in the scope of the world and that in 20 years I'll look back at all of this and not care, but I don't have that luxury right now. I've tried therapy but it was a huge fucking waste of time and I ended it this week. 

I'm trying to keep everything as confidential and anonymous as possible since I don't want anyone I know possibly seeing this (even if it such a small chance). I'm an externally happy person, but internally I'm a mess.

1. After repeated efforts, I wasn't able to get a paid internship this summer (and I've interned a lot). There are unpaid ones I could do, but I've found a lot of them really don't teach me anything - my current internship is  unpaid and it has be do a lot of errands, including some that take 3-4 hours. I know that in my paid summer internships are harder to get since generally they're given to the kids of those already in the industry, but I feel it's a sign that I'm not going to be able to find a paid one in fall (and plus I know some people at my school who have paid ones). I'm convinced I'm not going to be able to find a job after I graduate next year since I'm not going to be interning this summer. I tried looking for a paid retail job but that's not working either.

2. I'm searching for a new place to live, but  I'm not sure if i'll find any place that I'll like. I've tried posting on Facebook groups and have done everything I can, but no one's biting. People are probably procrastating until August, but there's nothing good (and no living on my option is not an option)

3. Today we had a mixer about senior project, but I found it frustrating, awkward, and it actually me want to cry. There are various capacities that I have to perform as part of senior project, but it was awfully difficult. I had been talking to a friend of mine about working on his project as a lead person, but he chose another lead. Since I was looking at a whole bunch of projects to work on as lead (not just his), I felt that was fine. I asked him if I could be his second in command, but he said that decision was for his lead. I let the lead know about it, but I think she's looking at other people. The whole situation was awkward as fuck and Apparently this made my eyes tear up. Apparently out of all the times I wanted to cry this past month it was now. In front of people. I guess he saw and apologized for the awkwardness, but I felt like a complete fuck-up. I was able to keep it together and get home, where magically the tears went away.

Senior project has just begun the planning stages, but  I don't feel optimistic about anything. I feel like a pariah and I'd rather just drop out of school or commit suicide.

This may be because I told them I had home experience maintaining a Linux-based server during the interview, which is not strictly speaking true (my friend has an elaborate home server and he showed it to me, but I myself am inexperienced with computer technology and have no idea how it works).

They told me any problems will mostly have to do with Internet connections (wired and wireless). So my question to anyone who can help me is: what should I know/expect? Can you point me to any simple resources? If a connection is lost, what do I do? Do I reset the router? Or even the modem? What should be my basic course of action to solve any problem??

Anything helps! Thank you for your time!

EDIT: Just to clarify, I wasn't actually hired specifically for tech support. They simply happen to include that responsibility in the list of things I'll have to do because I'm generally good with computers. There are several interns, and they divided the jobs to do among us, and of all the interns, I seemed to be the most qualified. So the fact that I said I had some experience with server maintenance doesn't really change anything; I still would've ended with tech support. That being said, I don't think I'll be doing the work of a system administrator, just some low level Internet connection troubleshooting and the likes.

Now I feel terrible when he set me straight.,[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/25af9e/he_said_he_loved_me_and_fueled_a_fantasy_now_i/,"**TL;DR: After a year he tells me he loves me and I realized I loved him too. Over the school year I broke-up with my boyfriend and moved closer to him for the summer. Then he reminds me that for now we are just friends with benefits.**

**How it started:** 3 years ago I got a job at a summer camp and I loved it. So much in fact I went back the next summer even though it is halfway across the country from my hometown. That summer I met him (Let's call him Bill). Over the summer I started falling for him and made my intentions very clear I was attracted to him. Over the course of the summer I started falling for him. We kissed and some other things, but we didn't have sex. By the end of the summer he made it clear he could not really handle a long distance relationship. A few weeks after the summer we kept in contact and even tried to maintain this ""long distance friends with benefits"" thing. After awhile we sort of stopped talking and that winter I started dating another guy that actually went to my school (Let's call him John). 

Once summer rolled around Bill and I knew we would be working together again so we started talking casually. The first few days were fine but then I started relying on him for emotional comfort that eventually lead to us fooling around again (I knew I was cheating on John). With about 2 weeks left into our summer together Bill told me he loved me. It shocked me and I after a few days I realized that I never stopped loving him from last summer. When we finally said goodbye he told me that if ""there was ever any logic in the universe we will be meet again"". 

Once school started I continued to date John (I never told him, *please don't lecture me about this I know it was a bad thing to do*) and I actually went through a terrible 6-week break-up with him because it wasn't fair that I loved someone else and I was just staying with John to make him happy. The entire time being romantic with Bill long-distance.

Then during spring break I drove 8 hours to be with Bill. It was almost magical. I was so happy at it felt amazing to spend intimate time with him without worrying about the distance or worrying about someone else. I knew we weren't official but whenever I was sad he would tell me to look towards the future, that in the end we could be together. 

I worked to be able to spend my summer in near him. I got a different job and internship for the summer and I would be a short train/car ride away. I could actually know if a relationship with him would be worth it. If we didn't have to worry about distance what our relationship could be like. 

**The Twist:** less than a week ago he told me that he started a ""possible relationship"" with a long-time friend (let's call her Jamie). Bill and Jamie weren't dating they were just seeing if they could work as a couple. Bill tried to reassure me that our plans were still on track for the summer, but I couldn't help feel betrayed.

He told me that Bill and I weren't official and that we didn't have obligations to each other. And I understand that, but I just had no idea why this had to happen now. Bill admitted that he was an asshole and that he was wrong in feeding me this idea of relationship for so long when he wasn't as attached (because of the distance). But, I still feel terrible. Jamie will be away while I am in town so Bill told me that our plans can continue uninterrupted. 

In the end this summer I will be in a city I love and I can still have fun and be around friends other than Bill, but he was probably the main motivation. I want to spend time with Bill over the summer the way that *we* planned. If things change in the future I would still want Bill to be in my life, even if we were just friends.

But now it just hurts so much. I know I shouldn't worry about his possible relationship with Jamie. If they end up happy I want him to be happy. But, if it doesn't work out and we happen to meet up after our last year of college I would see where we could go. 

I just can't stop this terrible feeling in the pit of my stomach.

You lovely people are so comforting and wonderful I'm just looking for advice or guidance or anything really. I mostly needed to type this out."

I work extremely hard and have the highest marks/GPA in my class while double majoring in two engineering majors (electrical and mechanical with a minor in Physics too). Just in this passed school year, I worked part-time with my previous internship, am an officer in a campus club, received acceptance into an honors fraternity, received funding for a start-up company I'm doing on the side, and maintained a healthy relationship with my girlfriend of over five years. I don't know how, but I did it and worked my ass off. 

I started my internship search for this summer back in December and have applied to 97 different positions, locally and all around the country. This isn't my first time seeing I've already had two summer internship experiences. I thought with all my experience and skill, I would have the best chance to get a great internship. It's been five full months and counting and I have yet to solidify a position. I've had a few phone interviews but nothing much came from it. Every day I'm applying to more places and revising my portfolio/resume but nothing good is coming out of it. Last year I had eight in-person interviews and accepted a position at a great company which I was pleased with. They loved me there and even offered me the summer position for this year, however I turned it down thinking I would not have the difficulty I am now trying to get a position (I wanted a new experience and my manager understood completely). I don't know what it is, I just can't seem to get lucky. Last year I had no problem being offered interviews and hearing back from companies. This year it feels like I'm being ignored. All my friends have jobs, my girlfriend got her first internship on the second place she applied to and my freshman brother got a position his first try. I'm stuck 97 applications deep with more than 80 already declining me and no more summer positions being posted. And if I don't get a position, I may not graduate next summer due to my school's internship requirement. I'm a bit quiet when you first get to meet me, but I don't see how it's that bad. 

I don't feel talented anymore. I don't feel like I can be successful at what I do if no one can notice me, even when I'm working my absolute hardest. I've watched my parents struggle because of financial problems. Money has always been tight with my family and after my dad lost his job, we lost the house and had to move through apartments for the time being. Took him 20 months to finally get a new job after his own intense search. He now works almost 80 hours a week just to make ends meet. Four years later, the bank is still dragging us down. We're good, hardworking people who just can't get a break. We don't have fancy cars or nice things, just what we need to survive. I don't want to end up like them, but I can't even get a job. 

I know this isn't as bad as many other things posted here, just needed to say it and get it off my chest. I wish hard work did pay off. "

This summer, I'm heading out to San Francisco for a Computer Science internship. I'm considering enrolling in pilot school. I don't want to make a career out of flying, but I would certainly love to fly whenever I can. 

Is it worth it for a college student to try to get a sport/recreation/private pilot certificate? I really only want to fly for personal pleasure. I've taken sample FAA exams and have gotten ~90% and don't think that I'll need more than the 20/30/40 hours of flight time required. 

I honestly think that a recreational license is the best match for me due to the 180 days between Takeoffs/Landings to carry passengers.

21 y/o, college student

Home State: Pennsylvania

Internship State: Arizona

yearly wage: ~52k

Ok so I'm on this internship for around 7 months, ending this August. So that's around ~30k before taxes. I filled out the W-4 when I started in January and been having the ""FED withholding"" and state coming out of my paycheck so I end up seeing ~25% go to taxes. 


I'm completely oblivious as to what to do about filing taxes so I see the max amount of money returned. I was wondering what would be the better option. Being claimed as a dependent by my parents or not. I realize that being claimed as a dependent helps them with taxes but would that be a better option to see the most money returned and then I could split the difference with them? I would really really appreciate any guidance. I wish taxes were taught in school, because I feel completely lost and overwhelmed with all the different rules and regulations. 

Thank you in advance.


Edit:

So if I file as single (not dependent) I fall into the [highlighted bracket.](http://i.imgur.com/xdCeEjF.png)

-being taxed as the bracket lower for the 30k ≈ 5,300

-actual amount after 30k reported ≈ 4,000

And as a dependent that'd be $3,900 exemption on my parents. 


Follow up question: what would the tax rate be as a dependent? The same as single tax bracket?"

I got to where i am because of good academic skills. Other than that, i feel completely alone and lost. Everyone around me seems to have groups of friends and professional contacts established and knows how to follow social scripts. I have been trying to get involved, but no matter what I do, I feel quiet and don't know what to say and don't feel like a part of anything. College is coming to a close and I feel like my life is going nowhere. I don't know how to establish social skills because I do t have a social group in the first place. I grew up in an immigrant family without the language and got bullied early on so throughout school I was mostly a loner. never understood how to be social. I still have a big social anxiety complex even when I try to go out more. I feel like the crucial years to learn all this have gone by. I had some internships but didn't have a chance to make a good impression because I didn't know how to act. I want to get a job out of college. I want to move the hell out of the insular, cliquey city I live in. But, with my lack of social savvy and contacts I feel like i have no opportunitiees. I feel utterly stuck in the same lonely, confused situation I have been in all my life. I don't know how to break out and make things happen."
25bk2r,1,2014-05-11,Am I deluding myself?,haHAnothingmatters,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/25bk2r/am_i_deluding_myself/,"Hello fellow people,
I have recently felt much like I am flying around with very little control over my relationships or my life. I have decided, two years into my undergraduate education at a rather expensive private American university (and an enjoyable(?) semester abroad through said university in a large European capital) to withdraw from the American university and apply to the public universities in this country instead. I am a language student and came here mainly for the immersion and simply can't see myself justifying spending another two years of this ridiculous tuition in the united states for an academic career that would simply happen spontaneously if I stay here. I am an EU citizen, so the university tuition here... let's just say it would take me ten years of university in Europe to spend half of what I would be spending finishing my degree in the states. I have done everything very cautiously, and have kept my options open, so come August if none of the universities I have applied to here do not accept me I can restart the semester at the american university as if I had never left. 

I love Germany, and I feel as though I would never want to settle down in the United States. I just want to stay put for a while. Growing up I had to do a lot of moving around and my ultimate dream right now is to have the ability to sign a piece of paper binding me to a specific apartment for at least the next couple of years. Most people my age are obsessed with travel. I just want to stay here and study and work and start saving money. The truth is though, I keep finding myself realizing that ideally I would want to do this with someone by my side because I'm really afraid of the risks I'm taking.

I met a guy here a couple of weeks after my arrival. The first time we went on a date was a wednesday, I was so giddy and I could tell he was really into it. We kept hanging out every day after that until that Sunday he made it really clear that he didn't want a relationship, and somewhat shittily used my locational volatility as an alibi. He made it about the fact that I might not be staying here permanently. I also found out pretty quickly he had been involved in a variety of weirdly abusive relationships before I came along with women he would meet on online dating sites for casual sex. One of them was a girl he's actually made quite good friends with, and she is in an open relationship. Long story short, he has been having casual sex to no avail for the last 5 years and is pretty fucked up by it now I think. We started having sex and it was really great. I would sleepover and it would just happen and it felt really natural I think. 

Half a month ago we met up with the idea that we would discuss exactly what was going on, feelings wise. I really love him and care about him probably a lot more than I should. He admitted to being confused about feelings for his ""flatmate"" (who had been giving me dirty eyes ever since I stayed over for the first time in February) and I just told him I already knew about that because it was pretty obvious to me from the first day I saw them interacting that there was something there. I don't know where I stand with him at all anymore. He told me he needed time to figure things out and that it felt wrong for him to keep having sex, and that he doesn't want to have sex with anyone for a bit until he's sorted himself out. I guess I'm just really selfish and need to give him that space. The thing is, I'm leaving to visit my parents and friends for a month on sunday and have no idea what could happen when I come back here. Somehow, it could be great to just get the fuck out and let him breathe out whatever issues in summer air, but I also see there being a chance that I'll come back and any semblance of interest in me in his mystery of a brain will be a corpse.

Meanwhile, I have a situation that is somewhat of a timebomb waiting for the right moment to explode in Ljubljana. I met him three years ago now and we were long distance for a year. He came to the states, planning to live with me for 4 months during the summer, but everything turned sour really fast after the boston marathon bombings and they tightened regulations for his visa only a couple of months before he arrived. We were both completely devastated; he had to go work a shitty job the government recommended for him in the middle of nowhere while I was in New york working at an internship I got my hands on by some miracle. We spent a week together in new york before he had to go, and then another week when he came back to get his original flight home to JFK. We were so angry, and  only had each other to blame. I am getting tears in my eyes just thinking about how disappointing it felt and how horrible that summer was, and the feeling of being denied romance by him when he came back because he knew better than to keep adding coal to our masochistic fire. 

I don't know when I'll be able to see either of them again, I don't know how it is possible for me to love two people so much at once, I don't know why I am writing this instead of finishing my essay on freud's horribly depressing utopia.

I just want to finish the fucking semester and hug my mom and have a fucking place to live in that I know I won't have to vacate within half a year. 

what an interesting world we live in, where I can essentially write a diary entry and have people tell me what an asshole I am. thank you to anyone who was bored enough to read my blaabbing. here I attach my favorite gif because I've never made a post to reddit before and I feel it would be satisfying to accompany my inauguration with Libby.

I'm 22. I ended it because I'm gay.

I have 4 main guys in my life right now I hang out with. They are the world to me. I'm only attached because it feels good to be, they are supportive, not because I have to be attached to them to cope, but they mean a ton and I love them around.

One of them is my best friend I've known for 4 or 5 years now. We are insanely close, more so than the others, talk every day, hang out multiple times a week, rely on each other for a lot, always supporting and sharing every detail of our lives.

He has a girlfriend, she doesn't care, she jokes and calls me his boyfriend. My ex-gf never cared either, after her, I would spend almost the same amount of time with him. After him, I would spend a ton of time with my other friends too.

Now that my relationship is ended my friends are all I got. Well, now my ex-gf is my friend too, she's cool with our relationship being over (she realizes now it never worked properly, I never lied to her, I always said I was unsure).

-----

I feel really guilty, because any of these guys I would date. Especially my best friend. I have a crush on him. I've never done anything to make it more than what he can give though. I don't want to lose a friend over it.

I'm really worried about the future. I'm only casually dating people, not doing anything serious. Is it wrong when I find someone that I want to date to have these feelings about my other friends on my mind? I feel like I would need to lose them all in order to have a fair relationship with someone else. Especially my best friend, being that we are really close, and I have a crush on him.

-----

I work full time at an internship, 4 out of the 5 weekdays I have a friend lined up to do something fun with. On the weekend I always have things planned. I'm always texting friends. Is this too much being I am attracted to them?

-----

Right now I'm having a blast and a lot of fun, am I doing anything wrong right now just putting these feelings aside? In the future do you think this guy can still be my best friend? Or no?

25bmi8,22,2014-05-11,I think I might be too boring... help?,hobbiesthrowaway,AskMen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/25bmi8/i_think_i_might_be_too_boring_help/,"BACKGROUND: I'm a college senior with just one semester left (next Fall) before graduating, and for the past month or so been talking to this girl. We've known each other for a few years and only recently become more than friends. 

She's awesome. She's crazy smart and has been doing lots of different research in her field, biology. She's really into Jazz and knows a ton about it, and music in general, and she has taught voice lessons. Last Fall she was away in Africa doing research on animals and stuff. She has like 4-5 different groups of friends, all our age, and she regularly goes out to cool and unusual bars throughout the week. She's graduating this week and spending the next month or so finishing her current research on people's smoking habits. Then in August she's traveling around Europe, then in September moving to another city that she's applying to Fellowships in. She's a vegetarian, a really good runner, and decently health-oriented. 

These are all good things. The issue here is me. 

Next to her, I feel woefully inadequate and just plain boring. I'm a computer science major, taking 4.5 years to complete my schooling. I have an internship with a pretty decent company, but I'm kind of selling out. I'm fairly sociable, which is pretty much the only thing I've got. I really don't have any passions (I like to read and play video games casually) and my group of friends is mostly just my Fraternity, almost all of which are way younger than me, or people I know but don't *know*. I'm the type of person who's never really been bad at anything, but never really all that good at anything either. I've always done the bare minimum to get by and that's worked for me, up until now.

She has all these passions and hobbies and is good at a ton of things - not just passably good, like *really* good - and has a ton of friends and always goes out, while I watch TV or play video games or read mindlessly for hours and then go to a bar on campus or something with one or two people. 

I'm afraid I'm just too boring of a person to hold this girl's interest for more than a few months, and I don't know what to do. Have any of you ever felt this way? Is there anything I can do to make myself more fun?

P.S. I've been in this sub long enough to know a ton of the responses are going to be ""I do [this hobby] and I love it! You should try it out!"". I'm not *not* looking for those kinds of responses, but my major issue is how to motivate myself to get out there and be a more fun, active, well-rounded person. Thanks."
25bq2m,1,2014-05-11,"This isn't as serious as the other stuff here, but I've never felt so disrespected ...",[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/25bq2m/this_isnt_as_serious_as_the_other_stuff_here_but/,"I'm 22. I got dumped back in February and the feeling is still stuck with me. It's not like I even care about the girl or anything, it's just ... what she said, and *how* she said it pissed me off so much. It's bothering me ever since. I've had some dramatic break-ups and also some pretty tame ones. But this one was just a slap in the face.

&amp;nbsp;

So I met her back in September, we hooked up in October and then started going out. It wasn't that serious but I was pretty content. We'd snuggle and talk for hours, and that's exactly what I wanted.


She took an internship in January, somewhere far away. Like a 15 hour bus trip away. Not bad, but the relationship wasn't serious enough to prolong. We decided to stay together anyway and solve the distance problem by skyping.

&amp;nbsp;

It wasn't really going well. Skyping was rare. We texted sometimes but I tended to get irritated at gaps in communication. For me, it was either constant communication, or no communication with only scheduled skype dates. A few years ago I was in a long distance relationship that was super serious, and that crashed and burned. I guess I thought of this new girl as a chance to redeem myself. To show myself that I can handle distance. This relationship was about me, and I guess that was Problem #1.

The whole thing was pretty unhealthy. I wasn't happy with it but I tried to work it out and talk it through with her. I told myself that breaking up with her was giving up. If we had a problem, then we could work through it. So every time I felt we had an issue, I would bring it up. But she'd always say she didn't see an issue.

I asked her if were doing the right thing, like maybe we should stop talking and reconvene in May when she gets back. But she said ""You're a cute guy I love talking to and you make me laugh. How could this not be the right thing?"" That settled it for me.

&amp;nbsp;

In February she had asked me if we should send each other gifts for Valentines Day. I was pretty happy about that, because she hadn't been putting any effort into the long distance relationship so I was glad to see some initiative.

A few days later she texted me and asked to skype. Not like ""We have to talk"", she was being playful about it. More like ""hey I miss you, wanna talk?"" I was happy to hear that, again because she hadn't been putting much effort in before this. Combined with the Valentines Day thing, it got me excited.


&amp;nbsp;

I logged onto skype and called her. I asked her ""So what's up?"", and she answered with ""I think we should break up."" Sudden, but expected. The relationship wasn't healthy -- an LDR requires communication but we didn't really do that. She said that once she started thinking about Valentines Day, she realized that she wasn't that into this relationship after all. Makes sense, I mean she wasn't putting much effort in and that explains that.

I just said ""Well, okay."" She added ""By the way, I have herpes so you might want to get that checked out."" At this point I didn't really know what to say, so I said ""Uh, okay, sure."" Then she said ""Can I hang up now?""

And so ... she hung up. I really tried to work through our problems. Every time we had an issue, instead of just suddenly skype calling her and dumping her, I'd bring it up with her and try to be reasonable. Seems like she didn't really have an issue, she just didn't like me -- despite that ""cute guy who makes me laugh"" comment she made, which was just two or three days prior to the breakup!

But she didn't want to talk about anything. She didn't give me any time at all.

&amp;nbsp;

*""I think we should break up. By the way, I have herpes. Can I hang up now?""*

That still rings in my head, three months later. I felt so disrespected. I'd tried so hard and this is how it ended. After I had tried to work through all our problems, the whole relationship ... *I* was the one who wanted to dump her, but I didn't because I thought we could work through things. She was right to break it off -- that's not hard to admit. But FUCK the way she did it. *Fuck* her.

&amp;nbsp;

After that skype call, that was it. I haven't talked to her since. No closure or anything.

I've had much worse break-ups than this, in terms of drama. I realize that this is bothering me mostly because it's recent, but it's just bothering me so much now that I know she's back at school, even though I haven't seen her around campus. I dread seeing her at a party because I have no idea what I would say. Would I play it cool? That would feel so wrong, since deep down I know I'm pretty pissed at her for the way she handled that break-up. So I'm really not cool with her. But there'd be no point in talking to her about it any further.

So I just had to get this off my chest. I know it's not really an out-of-the-ordinary story, but thanks for reading."

Be as specific as possible, and include specific games or programs you will be using. 

* Running newer games like Watch Dogs, Skyrim, Battlefield 4, etc at High/Ultra settings. Also running programs like Visual Studio 2012, VirtualBox, Photoshop &amp; Dreamweaver CS6, and generic web surfing.

* What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes? 

* $1500 max budget.

* When do you plan on building/buying the PC? 

* Three or four weeks from now. Once that first paycheck from my summer internship comes in.

* What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc) 

* Everything except for the OS. I'm starting from scratch and this is my first build. I'd like to have two 1080p monitors (21.5"" - 23"") and I don't really care about keyboard and mouse right now. One of those $20-$30 combos will do until I can spend some more money.

* Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location? 

* Virginia so unfortunately I'm not near any Microcenter locations.

* If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated. 

* Not reusing anything.

* Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU? 

* Overclocking is not something I'm interested in right away. Maybe a few years down the line.

* Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc) 

* I don't have access to ethernet so I'll need WiFi. 1TB hard drive will be fine and I'm on the fence about the SSD. Is it worth it?

* Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components? 

* I don't care much about the case. Preferably I'd like it to have a window if the budget allows for it. But otherwise I'd rather spend the money on the other parts.

* Do you need a copy of Windows 7 or 8.1 included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference for one or the other?  

* Still unsure if I'll be doing Windows 7 or 8.1, but I don't need either as I can get it for free through my school's engineering department.

* Extra info if required:

I've been doing some research here and there for a few months now but I'm really interested in what people here would suggest. I've been leaning towards an Intel processor (i5) and I don't really have a preference right now on AMD vs. Nvidia for the GPU. 8GB of RAM should be plenty I would think."

Starting June 1st I'll be starting my internship. It will last six months, until December.

I am a male, currently weigh 195 lbs, 6' 1"" height. My BMI is 25.7. So I am rather healthy, but I can use some weight loss and muscle gain. Last year my BMI was 23.7 and so I'm rather disappointed in myself.

I want to look fit, not just lose weight. If I were to spend 1 hour per day at the gym (focusing first on endurance, then strength), and assuming I work out and eat as I should, how realistic is it for me to have a six pack? 

Now I'm not hoping for a full-on ripped body, but just fit enough to where my abs can appear. 

Your thoughts are appreciated. Thank you

I've done a few relevant class projects: I've created a media relations kit for the Tennessee Emergency Communication Association, a public relations campaign for my university's Health Services department, a fictional ad campain for a Jimmy John's Restraunt that had just opened at the time, and a fictional public relations campain for a local nonprofit that provides underprivledged kids with food who may not eat over the weekend. I have a few of those things still saved somewhere on my computer. But is it okay to use school projects in a portfolio or resume? After I polish them up a bit, of course.

My only official internship I've had was at the University Recereation department at my school. While I enjoyed it and I would love to work at an athletic center in the future, I didn't really do much in my internship other than busywork. Making copies, shredding papers, front desk work, stuff like that. I made a kickass Homecoming 5K flyer once but unfortunately I don't have it.

Despite that, I do have a bit of volunteer experience with my local running club as the Public Relations and Sponsorship committee chair. What I'm doing right now is approaching local businesses for sponsorships for our annual 5K/10K race in June. Last year, which was also my first year doing it, I nearly doubled the amount of sponsorship dollars from the previous year, with this year going just as strong. I figured I could show off the race's T-shirt with the list of contributing businesses I gathered.

As miserable as I am at my current job, I'm actually great at it. Basically what I do is take inbound calls from insurance company and OEM warranty customers who may need a tow, jump start, flat tire change, or whatever. We take their information then we dispatch tow truck drivers in their area to get some help out. We're measured on average call time, call quality, and customer service scores, and I'm consistently one of the top performers on the highest performing team in the company. There just isn't much room for advancement other than to something like supervisor, which I don't have much interest in. Anything toward the corporate side, including marketing, would relocate me to Boston, which right now isn't feasible at all.

Before that, I was a lifeguard. It started off as something to do over the summer when I was in high school and I kept working my way through college. I did the typical lifeguard thing, taught swim lessons, and eventually made my way up to lifeguard instructor and trained the new kids. For swim lessons I carved out a bit of a niche for myself teaching kids with special needs and triathalon training for older adults. I loved it but it didn't pay the bills, and again there wasn't anything for advancement, and I had to take the call center job.

I've had 3 years retail experience at Kohl's, too. Typical retail sales associate part-time thing: stocking and cleaning up merchandise, customer service, checking them out at the register, pressuring people into getting the store credit card. 

Learning basic programming in my spare time whenever I have a chance. Looking at HTML, CSS, and JavaScript right now. I know my way around InDesign and I know enough about Photoshop to at least be able to manipulate pictures.

The last job opening I saw that I longed for was for a digital marketing coordinator at the Nashville Zoo. I never bothered applying because I figured I wasn't qualified, so now this is my main goal. What are some tools and resources I should be looking at to make me more marketable? I've been looking around this subreddit, and I still have access to a Lynda.com account that I've forgotten about until just now. I keep seeing suggestions for everyone to make a blog and market it. I've been wanting to start up a cooking and food blog, and I could market it on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Pinterest. Would that be appropriate?

I apologize for the wall of text, I'm just very excited.

**TL;DR I have a lot experience but not ""formal"" marketing. Looking for a nudge in the right direction, and how I can use what I already have to my advantage.**

I HOPE to be making around 75k-90k a year before tax (and if I somehow miraculously get into google, then around 100 ish). Of course I don't exactly know where I'll be and how much I'll be making after I graduate, but an obvious lucrative option for me is the bay area and/or San Jose. However, one of the things for me is that I need to live alone. No sharing apartments/rooms.  
Just as a muse, I decided to look up studio/single bedroom apartment prices, and got distraught because it seems like living alone in SF would leave very little money for* my kind of expensive hobby (anime figure collecting).  
How do people afford living alone in the area, and is it financially impossible to live alone comfortably for a newly employed person on average (I know starting software engineer salaries are on the higher end)?  

edit* also started realizing why people hate taxes so much. Feels like you're getting fucking robbed (even though it's not)"
25dm95,1,2014-05-12,Life as a Charity Intern,andiking,Charity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Charity/comments/25dm95/life_as_a_charity_intern/,"What do I, Steve Jobs, Steven Spielberg and Bill Gates all have in common? Although some of you probably believe the answer to be that we’re all geniuses, the response I was looking for is… once upon a time we were all interns! Yes, even some of our world’s greatest minds started their careers out as interns, in search of valuable experience and mentors in a specific field that ignited their passion. Seven months ago I set out on a similar quest with TEACH with the hope to gain valuable hands-on experience in international development and specifically –project management. From research assignments to menstrual cup training, time has flown by and here I am a month past my original return date to Canada. My time with TEACH has proved to be hugely mutually beneficial and as such the opportunity to stay on longer and start employment with them was an exciting and obvious answer for me to accept. Below you can read a personal reflection on my advice for any other interns out there (now that I am a seasoned veteran) as well as my top ten Moshi memories thus far.


**Advice FROM an Intern TO an Intern**

**Laugh at yourself:**
Other than the fact that life is too short, a little humility can go a long way. When interning abroad you are bound to find yourself in countless situations where the best option is really just to laugh. Not too long ago my colleague Goodie and I were doing some research on bee farming. Unfortunately the weather that day took a turn for the worse and we were stuck (for a number of hours) in a kind Mama’s cooking shelter waiting for the roads to become somewhat passible. Although this meant we had to cancel other meetings and engagements for the day it resulted in lots of laughs and some bonding time for me and my colleague.

**Have Confidence in your Skills:**
Many interns believe their newfound position leaves them at the bottom of the heap, destined to complete random duties to prove their worth till the end of their allotted time. The reality can be far from this if you choose to speak up and demonstrate your skills. Interns are fresh, hardworking and often have new and innovative ways to tackle issues. Get involved in the organization, explore work areas out of your immediate assignment and namely ask questions. In doing this I have had the opportunity to visit different project sites and take on tasks that weren’t originally in my job spec that have further advanced my overall understanding and skills.

**Enjoy those you work with:**
I can confidently say that I know more than just the job title of all my colleagues at TEACH. While some people are more private than others there is a professional way to get to know your colleagues beyond the standard hello in the morning and goodbye at night. My TEACH colleagues have not only proved to be my Tanzanian friends and family but also the people I come to for help and advice. The sharing of stories and experiences has taught me many things about the culture, my field of work and living a productive happy life here in Tanzania.

**Explore:**
Just coming off a long Easter weekend in Karatu, this adventure is fresh and prominent in my mind. Take the opportunities to explore the area, meet new people, try new food and see the beautiful country you work in. It is equally important to get comfortable and get to know your prominent area of work but time always goes quicker than you think. So pair up with friends or go solo, do hikes, have picnics, swim in any body of water you can and take it all in while it lasts!
 
**Top 10 Best Memories (in no particular order)**
-Any field/ research days with Goodie
-Thanksgiving potluck
-TEACH Staff end of year thank you at Haria
-Orphans Christmas Eve/Day
-New Year’s vacation in Lamu, Kenya
-Zanzibar Music Festival
-Friday night ‘TEACH House &amp; Friends Of’ get-togethers
-Lazy camping weekends at Lake Chala
-Conducting &amp; Finishing the BTC Baseline Study
-Sunsets at Railway

I am thrilled that lessons learned and experiences here with TEACH will continue to grow with my new position but am also confident that the hard and practical skills I have learned thus far will be transferable in future job endeavours. Whether you’re reading this because you have to (Hi Mom &amp; Dad!), are interested in becoming an intern at TEACH (email: ACT@teachafrica.org.uk) or just happened to stumble across it, I hope it sheds a bit of light on what a valuable experience an internship abroad can be.

25dmu3,9,2014-05-12,"I [25/F] don't know what to do about my Dad [59/M], my 10 cats and having to move overseas. I need some ideas",toomanycatslady,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/25dmu3/i_25f_dont_know_what_to_do_about_my_dad_59m_my_10/,"Hello Reddit,

Well, I'll try to keep it simple:  


My mom and my dad had been together for around 27 years. Me, my brother, my mom and my dad are big animal lovers, and throughout the years we have saved many cats and dogs from the streets and gave them homes, but, as some of you know, not all of them gets adopted. 


As for right now, we have 10 cats and 1 dog. This number has been kept the same for around 2 years. 7 of my cats are older and 3 young ones.


Me and my mom are the ones that takes care of them, cleaning, feeding, medication, etc. My dad provides for all of us: my mom is a stay-home mom, I'm in college (4th year veterinary medicine) and my brother is going to college at a different city.


Things between my mom and dad haven't been great for years but they tolerate each other inside the house, until last year: my mom decided to leave the house and go live with her new boyfriend, not too far from where we lived. She would come home and help me with the house duty because I'm away during the whole day a couple days of the week to do internship at the hospital.


But now, she decided she is moving away to another city, leaving me and my dad on our house. I don't know how many of you have pets, but having 10 indoor cats and 1 dog (min pin but still), it is a LOT of cleaning. I'm no crazy OCD cleaner but I like a decent clean environment. Plus, I have now 100% of the house duties like cooking, dishes, washing clothes. My dad doesn't help, it's a pain to make him clean his own dish after he eats. I have talked to him about we surviving together without my mom and we would have to help each other, but talking haven't done much. I gave the idea of hiring a maid to help us but he doesn't want to, he is embarrassed of having 10 cats.


Well, and me, I've been dating my boyfriend for 4 years and we plan on getting married as soon as my school finishes (December of next year) and I'll be moving with him overseas, pursuing to continue my education (masters, doctorate, etc)


As for my cats: My mom's boyfriend doesn't like cats, my dad is unable to take care of them and I'll have to move out of his house some day.


My ideas: 

1) **Take the cats with me**. I don't know how much they would charge me to ship 10 cats on a 16 hours airplane trip, but I know it is a LOT, and I would have to take 1 or 2 at the same time only, demanding a lot of money that I do not have, since I'll be fresh out of college and newly married, and probably more broke than I already am since I'm going to have to pay for my school financing, AND I'll be moving in with my boyfriend that lives with his dad in a big house, until we have money saved to buy our own house. Btw I can't let my boyfriend pay for this. He is already going to have a lot of expenses when we move in together and he will support me until I find a job. He is saving almost all his money to buy a house for us.


2) **Donate the cats:** Well, my dad said he is going do that if I leave, but I refuse to let that happen. They're animals but they're everything to me. Some of them have been with me since I was a little girl and I just can't let that happen to them, I care about them more than anything, they're old and are going to start getting sick, no one is going to take old cats, which leads me to my option 3


3) **Don't leave**. Break up my relationship, do not pursue the continued education I have always dreamed of and find a job, work, pay for my financing while living with my dad. I'm willing to do this if there is no other option.


4) **Wait**. Well I can wait some more, ask if my boyfriend would wait some more until I find a job here, gather money to ship all of them with me while he buys a house for us. I don't think it's fair to him and it would probably lead to a break up, and I would be back to option 3.

**Orr**, if anyone has any other idea I would appreciate it so so much!

(sorry about my English, not my first language)

---   
**tl;dr**: Mom and dad separated, she left. There are 10 cats and 1 dog living with me and my dad and I have to move overseas. My dad cannot take care of them, neither my mom. What do I do?!"
25dplz,22,2014-05-12,Old Habits Die Hard,NOFAP_THROWAWEIGH,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/25dplz/old_habits_die_hard/,"I've been masturbating since maybe 4th grade (9 or 10 years old). I remember being very young, and touching myself until I started twitching uncontrollably, and it felt really good. I didn't fully understand what was happening - but I loved it. Soon after, I began to discover porn - my parents wouldn't really let me use the computer when I was young, except to write book reports for school. I wasn't too familiar with the internet at the time - but I discovered that if I typed in www.&lt;something here&gt;.com, I could put a link on my Word document that led me to that site. So I tried every female body part, or sex related thing I could think of. I tried boob.com, sex.com, you name it. Somehow - since the internet was not as developed at this point, I didn't find anything I wanted.

Eventually, I told my friends immediately about my discoveries. They told me about a site they've heard about that has what I'm looking for. Feverishly, during the next book report, I typed in their link, and lo and behold, I was introduced to the wonderful world of porn.

I felt so ashamed that I only let myself briefly glance at the pictures. There were so many words and categories that I was unfamiliar with. I clicked on the coolest-looking one that I could find; 'Hard Core'. I remember blurring my eyes as I looked at the pictures because I didn't want to see too much. I then exited Internet Explorer, finished my book report, and cried. I'm not sure now why I was crying. I probably didn't know then either. Maybe it was because I felt bad for the women, and I thought I was invading their privacy. Maybe it's because I knew I lost some innocence. Maybe I had a premonition that the rest of my life would be enormously impacted by that one little session. But soon, I wanted more. [Lactation, Lesbian, Anal, BBC, etc...](/nsfw) - To a boy at that age, these links meant nothing to me - so I started exploring. I clicked on each one - always a little frightened at what I might see. But I soon found my niche - I fell in love with [lesbian, and cunnilingus](/nsfw) porn. For a year or two, one site, and the daily video or two they would post would satisfy any desire I had. As I went through middle school, and puberty started working it's magic - my desires began to increase. I started fantasizing about the girls in my school. I remember this first time I actually ejaculated - I thought it was pee (I avoided any male porn with dicks in them, it made me sick) - and I wondered if any girls were into that.

As my fantasies grew in extravagance - so too did my addiction. I was older now, and the Internet was as well. By the time I was a freshman in high school, there was an enormous selection of porn available - and I had gotten into normal, hardcore pornography. Even worse, I had my own computer now. I could fap whenever I wanted to, in the privacy of my room. And fap I did. Throughout highschool my desires expanded exponentially. By the end of highschool, I had seen every type of porn, and it was all very old to me. I started getting in to weird things too. I went out of my way to find things that were taboo - [rape(not real), jailbait(I was &lt;18 at the time, so it's not too weird), violent porn, fisting, and](/nsfw) anything that made me feel guilty. I even tried [gay,scat,bestiality](/nsfw), but I didn't even enjoy it while I was watching it. I only watched it because I knew it was so wrong (not that there's anything wrong with that), and that it was messing with my mind. I was turned on by the extent of my addiction. 

And I was definitely aware that it was an addiction - I kept semi-trying to quit. Or rather, every time I would finish, I would say to myself ""That was the last one"". But it evidently was not. I also kept saying things like 'when I get a girlfriend, I can stop' or, 'Once this semester is over, I'll no longer be stressed out and I can stop'. Or, 'once school begins, I'll stop'. But I never did.

Then, I went to college. In my freshman year - this subreddit was made. I was one of the first people to lurk here - and that was the first time I made concentrated efforts to stop. I realized the extent of the damage I was doing to my body and mind. I realized that the reason for so many of my character flaws could by originated in this cancer of an addiction. In the next year, I had my longest streak of not fapping - nearly a month! It was refreshing and empowering. I felt a little bit more freed from my addictions, and I was disgusted by my previous behavior. But, old habits die hard. One relapse, and I was back to my old habits. I had forgotten about this sub. And continued on my journey into self destruction.

Here's where it gets worse. I'm going to be a Senior this coming Fall. In the past two years, the porn I've gotten in to is a lot worse. Desperate to get my fix, I moved on to weirder things. I started masturbating to [dead people. Yes, pictures of dead women. Something about it was *so* disgustingly taboo, that my addiction desired it. My facination with bestiality grew as well - the idea of a woman and an animal was appalling enough to enjoy. I crawled around on 4Chan, sometimes partaking in the CP that was posted. I also started searching all over for distension porn - and I developed a very strong desire for this obscure fetish. Overall, I just became entrenched in ](/nsfw) horrible porn. But that's not the worst part. Soon, watching women being subjected to whatever carnal whim I had was not enough. I continued to become desensetised by the porn I was seeing, and wanted to move onto something that not only looked like it had an effect on the people, but had an effect on me. 

I had always avoided for the most part, gay [as well as trap, sissy, shemale, etc...](/nsfw) porn. But I wanted to really destroy myself. I wanted to lose my own mind, by changing my sexuality. I started masturbating to porn like [Massive Cocks, Cross Dressers, Shemale, Cuckold, Pegging](/nsfw), anything that conditioned me to either be submissive, or desire the male form. I discovered captions [(Porn images with words written over them)](/nsfw), and soon after found [sissy captions](/nsfw), made to get the reader to become more and more interested in sex with a man. As my addictions grew, I started watching [CEI](/nsfw) vids. These are videos where a woman [talks to you, and then requires that you eat your own ejaculate. I realize how ridiculous this sounds.](/nsfw). I loved the idea that I was psychologically reprogramming myself. I also of course at this point now have a smartphone, so every night I can easily open up the entire universe of porn on my phone. This sometimes keeps me up until 3:00 in the morning, because it now can take me forever to find 'the right clip'. My school and social life has been suffering because of the lack of sleep, motivation and energy.

##~~                           ~~

I just ended my Junior year, and I have a very nice 9 to 5 internship lined up this summer. I'm afraid that my addiction to pornography will keep me up late, as well as sap my motivation and energy - and my work will suffer because of it. I also really hate what I've done with my mind, conditioning myself to only be turned on by extreme porn, and porn that doesn't match my sexuality. I want to stop, but I'm deathly afraid I'll never be able to. I've managed to be fairly successful academically - as well as landing a really high-paying internship - and I feel like if I can accomplish the amount that I have while bogged down debilitating addiction - I can do astounding things if I overcome it.

I don't know what I hope to accomplish by posting this. I've lurked here a lot - I know all the tricks - I know the benefits of quiting - I know the damage I'm doing. I just needed to write it out for all to see, I guess. I've tried quitting a million times. At this point, I feel as if there's no hope.

EDIT: I just read through this. I feel disgusting. I am disgusting. I didn't even mention the [incest](/porn) that I've gotten into as well. Not just fake stuff - the realer the better. The reason I wrote this is because this morning was the first day of my summer break - I start work in about two weeks. I spend about three hours this morning fapping. What a waste of time - not to mention I [finished on my face](/nsfw). Why the hell would anyone do that? It's disgusting and weird. I nearly threw up after. I hate what I make myself do. Also, I additionally spent maybe two hours last night fapping. My dick honestly hurts right now, because in the past 12 hours I've masturbated for maybe 5 of them. I need help. Reading this little report - it reminds me of something I'd read in a serial killers journal. Or Jeffery Dahmer's notebook. What the hell is wrong with me.

**TL:DR:** **Please read the whole thing. You can hit back and not read it, I realize this is pretty long, I wont be offended in the least. But I hope at least somebody reads this. I really need to get it off my chest.**

##~~

EDIT: Just over 24 hours in, and the cravings are really immense - mostly because I'm home alone and bored. But fate is now shaking her cruel fist at me - an attractive female friend recently partook in a nude protest, and posted a selection of pictures on facebook."

25egkt,47,2014-05-12,"Do's and Don'ts for bike shop customers, also former bike shop employee, AMA!",VITALY_CHERN0BYL,FixedGearBicycle,https://www.reddit.com/r/FixedGearBicycle/comments/25egkt/dos_and_donts_for_bike_shop_customers_also_former/,"**Introduction:**
Hello Internet, I am a former bicycle shop employee.  I have worked on and off at bike shops since high school.  I'd estimate that I have 7 or 8 total years of experience.  I have also raced mountain bikes for several years, worked as an intern for a major mountain bike publication, and worked as a freelance photographer for a couple smaller ones.   I am familiar will all sorts of bikes and disciplines of cycling, but I'd like to center the discussion around bike shop etiquette and fixed gear bikes.  

**Reason for This Post:**
It's no secret, bike shops do give preferential treatment to their favorite customers.  Said customers get discounts, fast turn-around on service and repairs, and will be greeted by their first name when they walk in the door.  
There are also plenty of customers who get referred to as ""that guy,"" as in, ""oh no, not that guy.""  Nobody wants to be ""that guy,""  he pays the list price for everything and gets told that he will have to wait 2 weeks or a month for his bike to be repaired.  
I want to give you a few pointers on how to fall into group-A.  Having a good relationship with a bike shop important for having a good experience as a cyclist.  
I also want to give you guys a chance to pick my brain and ask any bike, or bike shop related questions you might have. 

**DO'S &amp; DON'TS:**

* DO: pick a favorite shop, try and give most of your business to that shop.  It's perfectly fine to give business to competing shops if you need something your favorite shop doesn't have.

* DO: buy your bike from a bike shop if you are new to cycling.  It's tempting to save some cash buying used, or from the internet.  If you get a bike from a shop you will be sure you are getting a bike that fits.  Also most shops offer 30 or 90 days of free tune-ups and adjustments to your new bike, it's like having walk-in tech support.  There are loads of other perks.  

* DON'T: Buy *everything* from the internet.  My rule of thumb is ONLY buy things from the internet if you know EXACTLY what you need.  For instance, if you want to buy cycling shoes, it's really uncool to a shop to find out what brand/size you want, then buy them on PricePoint.com.  However, if you know exactly what tires you want and there is a discount on Nashbar, then go for it!

* DO have your bike serviced in the winter.  It's a little late for this tip, because right now is the busiest time of the year.  Typically in May-June shops run a 2-4 week backlog on service.  

* DON'T expect them to bump you to the front of the list.  2 week wait means 2 week wait.  ""That guy"" always whines about it.  Good customers DO get faster service, but they never have to ask for it.  

* DO clean your bike before you bring it for service.  This mostly applies to mountain bikers and triathletes (tri-racers pee on their bikes.)  Mechanics respect customers that care about their machines, and some shops will turn your bike away or charge a cleaning fee if it's caked in mud.

* DON'T ask for a discount on Labor.  Most shops are pretty firm about it because that's where a good chunk of their profit comes from.  If you want a discount, ask for a discount on parts.  They usually charge a high mark-up (100% profit is standard) and it only takes a minute to order a part from a catalog.  They are more likely to discount objects than time.  

* DO learn to work on things yourself.  You can learn to do just about anything on YouTube.  Knowing how to do this http://youtu.be/tP3uAy1YQpQ will save you $20 every time, and if you are interested, I can tell you how to do it without even taking your wheel off your bike!

* DO ask about the shop's return policy.  For example, most shops WILL NOT take a bike back after you have ridden it.  Most shops WILL take returns on saddles because it's hard to know if you'll like it until you try it.  They might even offer you a ""demo saddle""  to try for a week to see if you like it.  

* DO tip the employees.  I am not talking about money.  Tip with something they can share.  A 6-pack hoppy IPAs is great example, ask the manager first, but bike shops are usually pretty lenient about drinking on the job.  If they happen to have the lamest boss ever, naked goods like cookies or donuts work too.  It's a guaranteed way to score some points, and they will remember who their friends are when you need a discount or fast service.  

* DON'T act like you're shopping at K-Mart.  Remember, bike shops are usually mom&amp;pop operations and the policy is usually Employees first, Customers second.  Bike shop employees take pride in their job and tend to be jerks to customers who rub them the wrong way.  

* DO talk to employees who are into the same kind of riding you are.  Take a peek in the back and see if any of the employees rode a fixie to work that day.  Find out who he or she is.  That person will be more knowledgeable and more excited to nerd about fixies with you.  

* DO find a shop that deals with fixed gear bikes.  There are plenty of shops where employees know zilch about fixed gear bikes.  I hate to say it, but lots of employees are sort of prejudiced against them too.  It's a good idea to be up-front about it and ask if there is an employee there who rides fixed gear.  

* DO ask for a job!  If you are in college and looking for something to do part-time, it's way more fun than flipping burgers.  It's also an excellent way to make friends with other cyclists.  Right now is the time shops are looking for extra help, drop off a resume now!  Bike shops are picky about who they hire, but I can provide some tips on getting your foot in the door if you are interested.  

**AMA:**  
Go ahead, ask me anything!  **I'll am most helpful with:**

* mechanical advice

* cleaning/maintenance

* questions about dealing with bike shops

* applying a job at a shop

* gear/clothes/shoes

* should I get a steel, aluminum, ti, or carbon frame

* making your bike more comfortable/fit better

* choosing stuff like tires, handlebars, grips, bar tape, pedals, etc.

* will this part fit on this bike?  (I might ask for numbers)

**Not so interested in answering questions about:**

* is thing better than this other similar thing from a different brand?

* questions about non-fixed gear or single speed bikes (actually I'm glad to help, but send a note) 
 
* where can I get the best deal on this thing?

* what do you think of this bike I found on ebay or Craig's List (I might be willing to answer specific, informed questions about a used bike though)

That's about all I feel like typing right now.  Have at it!

I'm a fat 19F. I've spent most of my life hating myself and how I look. I yoyoed from 360 to 230 to 280 again. Now I'm at 270 with a light diet, but unfortunately have developed an eating disorder. I cant eat more than once a day without having horrific self hatred.

However, with my clothes on in certain outfits I feel like I look nice. I carry my weight well and my legs are muscular from sports as a kid plus walking several miles a week. My boyfriend lovingly insists he finds me ravishing and regularly kisses my belly when I feel glum. But in general, my clothes are old, ill fitting, and ratty. Not something a young starting business professional type person should were. (I'm considering myself an entrepreneur and an artist) 

Today, another plus size, older friend of mine took me clothes shopping. I had no idea what I was doing and she helped me pick out bright, workplace appropriate clothes that I felt pretty in. I sold my 3DS and pokemon X [ :( ] and had some money to play with. She took me to a thrift shop called 'one more chance plus' an d she helped me pick out cute business professional clothing since I had got a very awesome internship at a very notable art gallery in my city. And I got so many pretty things to wear. Two button ups (with no gaps on my boobs), light, flowy shirts, a perfectly cut to my size plum blazer, a black pencil skirt, a black a line dress and pearls. In total 8 or 9 garments that I can mix and match with my exisiting wardrobe to have a fun, business casual look that I so desperately want to achieve, all for about 100 dollars. 

And while trying on those clothes and looking in the middle, I hardly let my eyes linger on my stretch marks, or my floppy boobs in ill fitting bra (I know I'm not a DD, but I can't afford bras that fit), or my arms and the way they swelled.. instead, I saw how these cute outfits I thought girls like me couldn't wear, totally wearing it.

And I didn't cry in the dressing room for the first time in 3 years. "

Graduated last year with a B.Com in finance.
Trying to go the marketing route and get entry level marketing position like ""Marketing Coordinator"".

My experience so far is lacking. 3 month internship as SEO(mainly link building) for a website called wallstreetoasis. I did this to put anything on my resume. I wasn't into marketing back then.

Just recently I finished a 3 month account management internship overseas at JWT. I will be going back to Canada sometime before the end of the month.

I'm not really sure how to proceed at the moment as I'm finding job hunting to be incredibly tough.  I was wondering if anyone can provide insight on how I should proceed to start a career. I'm looking into temping as an option if I can land roles to start. Going to try to networking as much as I can as well. 

Any insights would be awesome.

Thanks!"
25emit,1,2014-05-12,Being a vegetarian is NOT a disability,Lobo_Marino,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/25emit/being_a_vegetarian_is_not_a_disability/,"Yes, being a vegetarian is my choice. Yes, I understand that there are some social sacrifices I will have to do with this decision. Yes, this limits my choices in restaurants and menus critically. I'm aware of this, and I continue to do so knowing this.

No, I will not push my beliefs on you. No, I don't expect people to make special accommodations for me over it. 

I work at an office with only about 13 people here. We recently hired this new secretary who has been a sweetheart since day one. She works hard, is funny, and tries her best to keep everyone happy. We couldn't ask for more.

Yet, this kinds of things do sort of strike a nerve sometimes. Today is the perfect example.

Our office (sans her) is a relatively ""healthy"" one. Nobody (but her) is obese whatsoever. We bring our own lunches, and when we eat out, you can tell the people don't lean towards the heaviest meal. I don't expect to see my coworkers at a Taco Bell any time soon, basically. 

So we hired a new intern, and we usually go to lunch to get to know them and so. Since today was a rainy day, we decide to stay in and eat here. She has the idea of ordering pizzas, and we're just like ""yeah sure, whatever"". So she starts ordering them, but then singles me out and goes ""What kind of pizza are you going to want to eat? Because you're the special one!""

This just fucking irks me. I appreciate the effort she is trying to do. If she didn't care, she would just order whatever, and I would not get to eat it. I understand she is trying to include me, and that's really nice of her to do that.

... but this is not a fucking disability! You're about to order a bunch of pizzas, and a cheese pizza is THAT out of the question? Or heck, you think I'm really the ONLY one who would eat a pizza with veggies? That everyone will just go for the meat lovers, or something?

So we sit down, she mentions what pizzas she got (obviously with a remark made about me when she mentions the vegetarian one). She puts down the meat lovers' one in the main table, thinking that it's going to be the most popular one, or something. Only one slice was taken from that one, and guess who took it?

Anyway, we eat, and everything is fine. Whatever. A bunch of pizza is left over, which is usually lunch/dinner for whoever wants it. 

So now I have to stay late at work, and I'm like ""yay! there's pizza left over!"" Guess which are the only pizzas that are already gone? -_- And I'm willing to be $100 that the meat lovers one and the pepperoni ones will spoil before anyone (but her) touches it again.

I don't want to bring this up at work because people are going to think that I'm ENTITLED to the non-meat food, or something. I don't want to try to ""educate her"" about like... Hey! Omnivores actually eat vegetables too, and people don't HAVE to HAVE meat on each of their dishes, unlike her. 

Again, I understand these preferences are on me, and this circumstances are more my fault than hers. It's just REALLY annoying when I run into her, and she goes ""I was thinking the other day of making a lasagna for the office, but then I remembered you don't eat meat, and I couldn't anymore."" Like... I guess sorry I foiled your plan, or something? ""Well... if you are set on ever making a lasagna, there are also cheese lasagnas..."", ""Oh, there are? I would've never thought about that!"" 

Jesus!

All I can do is slowly try to get her to see that our office eats relatively healthy, and she is more willing to please us if she goes 50/50 veggie, instead of 90/10 (like she is at the moment). The microwaveable meat she buys is slowly spoiling in the fridge/freezer, while people have taken on accident my veggie meals because they are more drawn to it than ""HUNGRY MAN"" boxes. 

tl;dr I'm hungry, and this fucking lettuce lovers ate all my food."
25eojv,1,2014-05-12,can i just rant for a second?,holy_shit_throw_away,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/25eojv/can_i_just_rant_for_a_second/,"

the story begins when I first started college.  I had everything figured out: I was going to be an engineering major, get by all my classes and land a great job making tons of money.  Here was what I ended up doing though.  One night I decided to switch over to Nursing as a major.  I wanted a career that would allow me to help people in the most positive ways possible.  I went in and talked to my adviser about changing majors and I was warned that nursing would be very competitive because you had to be accepted into the program in the beginning of your junior year after you had completed your prerequisite classes.  I decided I would do it.  I worked my ass off getting decent marks, A/B averages in the toughest of classes.  I was proud of myself and learning a lot.  Then the program changed, the prereq classes went from being things like anatomy, physiology, nutrition, microbiology and chemistry to things like english, sociology and other gen ed types of classes.  So what did that mean for me?  Competing for 1/100 open slots with 400 people who had worse marks than I did in the hard classes, but higher marks than me in the easy classes.  I didnt make it into the program and the only way for me to get in was to restart college.  yeah completely restart from ground zero.  

So what did I do next?  I changed my major over to psychology and graduated 6 months ago and now all my friends are starting families, buying houses and driving their new cars and I cant even afford to use my AC in 95 degree weather.

During college I had to work 30+ hours per week while taking classes full time in order to stay ahead of the debt.  I got an unofficial internship being a file monkey at the national archives but that ended when I graduated because I had to be a student to continue to work there.  I now make $10/hr putting grills together in the back of a big box hardware store while my $40,000 piece of paper goes to waste.

I have filled out countless applications.  I follow up, I call the HR offices and i never hear back.  I have had 3 job interviews this year which all ended up with getting emails saying they hired someone else.  I have a few friends who graduated with similar degrees saying telling me they filled out 6 applications and landed decent paying jobs.  When I ask how they got them its always the same thing, they knew someone.  These same people did not have to work during college so they had all the time in the world to network and do these internships that have helped so many people land employment.  I have the hardest time understanding how being a coffee getter and a photocopier for the supervisors for 3 months holds more weight than someone who worked their ass off for the duration of their college career.  

I probably have a bad attitude about this whole thing but at this point I am just frustrated with the whole process.  I will most likely end up living back at home in the next few months unless something miraculously turns up for me.  

For the past couple of months have shown little to no real emotion and carry a feeling of melancholia all the time.  I hide it the best I can, but when Im caught off guard I always get asked ""whats wrong?"" by the people who are close to me and I absolutely hate it because I can never answer without making myself look like a sad sack.  

its not even like my expectations are high at all for my desired job.  All I want is to be responsible for things more important than getting this guys grill put together on time.  

I try to explain my situation to my parents but its hard for them to understand.  Neither of them went to college, joined the air force directly after high school and were home owners within just a few years with more money than they knew what to do with.  


this was more of a rant than anything.   I know I am not alone in this shitty economy where only tech degrees are praised.  Anyone have any success stories or advice they can give me to help me with my life?"
25eqrh,1,2014-05-12,"I'm tired of not doing anything and I'm tired of being depressed. I really need some blunt, honest advice.",fk_sad,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/25eqrh/im_tired_of_not_doing_anything_and_im_tired_of/,"I don't know where to start... 

I'm a 17 year old introverted Indian kid living in America and a junior in a magnet High School. I live with my parents and brother (now that he's come back from college) in the suburbs. 

My typical day starts off with me waking up at 6:30, having my dad drive me to my school that's 40 minutes away, eating some goldfish crackers on the way there because I neglected to eat breakfast, sitting through hours of boring, repetitive lecture, taking the 40 minute commute back home by bus, getting home and browsing the internet/playing video games for basically the rest of the day until I sleep at like 2:00. Weekends aren't much different then what I do after I get home from school; I just fuck around the whole day until I promise myself I will do shit the next day. 

Basically I have two problems:
 
* I don't do anything productive in terms of bettering myself (sleeping earlier, exercising, hobbies, homework etc) which fucks me over in how I feel about myself. 

* I fucking hate myself because I don't have any willpower, motivation, or any particular reason to feel happy.

So basically this already seems like an /r/getdisciplined plea for help in accomplishing things, but it's not. 

I read all of the /r/getdisciplined posts. All of them. Everyday. Not all the time to the point where I'm browsing reddit all day just looking at the posts, but the point is, a lot. I've tried doing a lot of things highly suggested by them, but I always end up quitting after a few days of somewhat success from using them (for example: taking cold showers, using a timer to be productive)
and never come back to them.

In addition to this bullshit, I also get depressed like all the fucking time. I don't think it's manic depression, but whenever I have a bad day, I'll just be depressed for the rest of the day and I just wallow around feeling sorry for myself. I am constantly reminded and haunted of embarrassing and regrettable shit that has ever happened to me. Like for instance, I'll just remember about how in 7th grade I fucked myself over by trying out for the basketball team when I was absolute shit at it, even though it happened 4 years ago and isn't even relevant. It sucks. 

Along with the depression, I'm super fucking hypersensitive. Like if I'm talking face to face to a person and they insult me or something, that insult sticks to me like glue. But it might not even be an insult. It might be me fucking having my phone alarm (Do it Now by Mos Def which is REALLY FUCKING LOUD) blare in the middle of class and just having that embarrassment for like a week. I still can't listen to that song even now because I keep thinking about how uncomfortable and stupid I felt.  ALSO I think I might be ADD, but of course, taking an online ADD test isn't an actual diagnosis but still. I have an INCREDIBLY hard time focusing on doing homework or anything that requires mental effort unless I'm completely alone and away from everything (which is stupidly impractical and a really hard environment for me to find, considering I don't even have my driver's license and can't just drive somewhere secluded to do my homework), so my grades suffer. 

Also I get jealous a shit ton. Like I'm always jealous of my friends who have girlfriends. And also there's this one kid in my class who's pretty built who used to be the short, fat kid in middle school (who was also my friend and still kinda is). I remember I even jokingly called him chubby back then, but now the tables have turned because from being the sorta skinny kid in middle school, I've become overweight and he's become a fucking health nut. I get jealous because I see shit all around me and realize how I could have easily changed myself the same way (by getting a girlfriend, or getting a top-notch summer internship, getting ripped, and whatever the hell else) but I wasted my time jerking off the whole time. I have so much fucking regret about everything. The fact I'm kinda overweight now has also been a real reality check in how far I've let my laziness go. But everytime I convince myself to run for a day, I don't have the willpower to consist

Also, my parents hold the ""Asian standard"" of getting high grades and such. It doesn't help that my brother got #2 in his class when he graduated from high school, does a shit ton of volunteering, fundraisers, and other overachieving things. I haven't done shit to impress them. I'm a solid B student and the reason is because I neglect to do schoolwork even when I really try and I also am just straight up shit at remembering things so exams always fuck me over (especially the AP exams that are going on right now, fuck my fucking life). I don't have anything I can really write on a college application or a resume for that matter, so the prospect of going to college and whatever the hell else I need to do after high school scares me shitless.  

My social life is pretty shitty. I have like 1 close friend who was also cool about listening to the shit I've actually vented throughout this whole fucking block of text one time. The rest of my friends aren't really close with me. I'll talk to them about random shit but I never talk about serious real life stuff with them. I really wish I had a girlfriend to fill that void in me, but I don't. It sucks especially because I feel like such a fucking attention whore because I'm always yearning for people to notice me and to talk to me. Every facebook post or twitter post that doesn't get at least 20 likes really disappoints me (Which is stupid and shallow, I know). Like I want people to go out of their way and come talk to me, even though I know in my head that if I really want people to talk to me, I have to talk to them first. But being an introvert, small talk and idle chat are STUPIDLY FUCKING HARD for me. They ruin me. Therefore everyone who isn't an ""acquaintance"" or my close friend pretty much never talk to me. Including my teachers which sucks because I have to get teacher recommendations for college. Fuck.

I've been going to a therapist for the past couple weeks and telling her a few of the things I've mentioned here, but I'm also trying to appear as sane and polite as someone as internally fucked up as me can, which is why I can't bring myself to tell a complete stranger everything shitty about me. But at least on the internet I retain my anonymity (unless someone I know can figure out who I actually am in real life). 

Also, I'm an introvert and bubble all my thoughts in my head and can't ever express anything to anyone including my parents (except my close friend). So that's why I'm venting this all on a throwaway here. I try to tell my parents, but I feel like they would think I'm an absolute nutcase and be irreversibly changed about how they think of me if I told them the whole truth.

I'm sorry if reading this melodramatic 1st world problem bullshit made you want to rip your hair out. I know my grammar is shit and I use the word ""shit"" and ""fuck"" a lot, but writing the post resulted from a stream of my pretentious consciousness.  

Is it the hormones? Is it my pedantic teenage angst? Fuck, I don't know, I've just been feeling like shit for the last two years because of this.

I just want to find a long-term solution to my problems. "
25ex4e,10,2014-05-12,"I'm dropping out of college to go to Silicon Valley, and I'm worried.",mostuncertain,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/25ex4e/im_dropping_out_of_college_to_go_to_silicon/,"**TL;DR** I'm paying my own way through college, but my wealthy father's income increased, and now I will get no financial aid and have to drop out of this unaffordable Ivy League university. Interning for a great tech company this summer, and taking a ""year off"" to work hard and see what happens. I'm mostly worried about the change in opportunities not having a degree will cause for grad school and future employment and doing what I love.
____
My ultraconservative parents disowned me during my last year of high school -- from then on, I would live on my own and receive no financial support from them.

I was working a research-heavy programming job at a big company that payed $12/hr, so I loosened up focus on my already-pointless senior year of high school and worked long hours -- I was going to a fancy Ivy League university in the fall. My financial aid was based on my parent's income, which was high, so I needed to come up with about $20,000 to pay for my first year of school. No matter -- I worked longer hours and freelanced in my free time, took out federal loans (I have no one to cosign private loans for me), and I came up with the money for my first year of school. $20,000/year for a top-notch education is reasonable. I figured I would just intern over summers and work on the side and come up with the money every year after. I even won scholarships. It would all work out.

My father's already-six-figure income doubled this year, according to the financial aid office. I am no longer eligible to receive financial aid (I haven't received the final numbers yet, but it's ugly -- I would have to come up with at least $40,000 by the best-case estimates). 

The financial aid office still refuses to consider me an independent student, despite living alone, paying for school on my own, filing taxes as an independent, and so on. I won scholarships, but my university doesn't use them to lower expected contributions out-of-pocket payments remain the same. I live a more frugal and responsible life than many of the ""adults"" I know -- not out of a sense of elitism, but out of necessity. But no, I would not be considered independent for institutional need-based aid, and I could not appeal that decision.

I had a similar scare towards the end of last semester -- I wasn't sure if I'd be able to pay for my Spring Semester. It took a toll on my studies. I barely scraped by with the cash after freelancing another project and working over winter break. But here I am in finals week again, and I feel the same mix of dread and apathy. I don't know if I'll be back here next semester -- how can I study a damn thing? I haven't turned in a single problem set for some of my classes all month. It's impossible to think about meeting four-year major requirements when the numbers say I can't come back in the fall. I simply cannot afford it.

Starting next week, I'll be interning at a pretty amazing tech company in Silicon Valley. The hours are long, the work is challenging, and the pay and perks are amazing (I might make about $15,000 after the obscene costs of living are factored in). This will be an amazing summer.

My plan for the fall is to take a year off -- not to study abroad, but to work at more tech companies in California, simply because I can't afford to come back here without financial aid. My student advisor said listing ""stress"" as the reason would allow me to take a year of medical leave, which would make coming back an easier process (I wouldn't lose on-campus housing, for example).

I told a few of my closest friends, and they're sad I'm leaving, but ultimately excited for me. To them, this is the romanticized story of Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Zuckerberg. Instagram, Snapchat, WhatsApp, Tumblr, all worth at least a capital-B Billion dollars. Anyone with an idea can raise capital. We've all seen The Social Network.

What they haven't seen is the other 999,999/1,000,000. The people paying $1,000+ a month to sleep on a couch or mattress in a room with all the other soon-to-be-billionaires, coding in relative poverty.

I'm not afraid of being homeless, because for a short while last year, I was. I'm not afraid of living poorly, because I've already had to for months before college. I ate ramen, corn dogs, rice, beans, whatever had calories in it and kept me from starving while I saved up for college. Come fall, I'll probably have another well-paying internship at another fancy tech company. I don't think I'll be broke again, but if I am, I can deal with it. I've deal with worse for longer.

I am afraid of not being welcomed back into academia later on. I've always wanted to go to grad school and just become a researcher. I can't be a scientist having dropped out of college. I may take up side research at Stanford during my ""year off"" or transfer somewhere more affordable, or just officially drop out and work full-time for a company after the year off. Is that even possible without an undergraduate degree? Grad school certainly isn't, even with the right research and work.

The uncertainty of what comes next isn't new, but it still worries me. I'm confident in my skills and my persistence that have gotten me this far, but I'm worried about losing out on the experiences and opportunities of the next three years here (and potentially at grad school). I am mostly self-taught (again out of necessity), but there's so much more to college than the courses.

I'm aware of the opportunity in the tech industry right now, and I'm going to work hard, but I'm worried about not having the stupid credentials. I just don't know what's going to happen.

(Also, I don't mean to sound entitled or elitist or anything throughout all this. I understand I'm in a privileged position just by being here right now, and no one is entitled to a fancy education... I suppose I just misinterpreted the whole ""meeting 100% of your financial need"" bit.)"
25f3yl,7,2014-05-12,My Boyfriend [21/M] of 2 years just broke up with me [25/f]. Completely confused.,punkinkat,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/25f3yl/my_boyfriend_21m_of_2_years_just_broke_up_with_me/,"We started out as a long distance couple after meeting during an internship program.  Over a year ago, he moved to be with me.  We've always talked about a forever.

He is four years younger than I am, so he's always been up front with me that he wants to marry me, but not yet.  I've always understood because of our age difference. We've talked about when we get married, some day having kids, moving closer to our families together. We've planned a future.

This past week he started becoming a little distant, and when we finally sat down and talked about it, he said he just can't see being with me forever, and he needs a break to figure himself out.  

At this point I'm just confused as to what happened.  He says he still loves me, and still cares about me, it's just that as of right now, he can't see us being together.  At first I had hope that this is just a fluke of sorts, and in a couple of weeks he'd be fine.  We'd be fine.  Now (it's only been a day, but I have obviously thought through everything. twice) I just think he's just done with me completely. 

I've realized that space is what we need at this point, but we still live together and he keeps treating me like nothing happened.  (Bringing ice cream home for me, browsing reddit with me, etc.) He's in the process of moving out but seems to be dragging his feet.

Is there anything I could or should be doing? I want him back more than anything.  He's my best friend, and the love of my life.  

tl;dr: My boyfriend of 2 years decides out of nowhere, the future we've planned together is no longer in his future.  Broke up with me yesterday, but still carries on like nothing happened.

25f8eu,1,2014-05-13,What should a scholarship college student do to put himself in the best financial position?,[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/25f8eu/what_should_a_scholarship_college_student_do_to/,"Hi y'all. Firstly, thanks for reading this and responding.

I am a 17 year old young man (about to turn 18), and I want to make a plan for improving my finances. To summarize my situation:

* I'm going to a top-level school in the U.S. (I'm also a U.S. citizen).
* I have two scholarships from private institutions that, combined with my school's financial aid package, covers all costs of attendance (tuition, room &amp; board, travel, books, and incidental costs).
* I have just over $2800 in a CD that matures next month.
* I have a little over $2100 in a checking account.
* I have invested in a stock that I put $1000 in and is currently worth about $500. It does not make interest or dividends. I've held this stock for about 3 years.
* I have invested in a mutual fund that was worth $6900 and is currently worth $6400. This fund gives a yearly dividend averaging about $1000 in December. I'm not reinvesting the dividends (they are the in CD). I've also held this investment for 3 years.

Now, I need to explain my scholarships. They will cover everything my school puts on the bill, and I will likely be provided a stipend from each. I don't have confirmation of it yet, but I know for certain that a stipend from one scholarship can reach $6250 per year. The other will give me $1000 that will be distributed in $200 allotments my first three years, and then $200 each semester of the 4th year assuming I graduate in 4 years (I plan to do so). Unless there are major changes to my school's financial aid package, all of it is in grant form, and my family will not be forced to pay anything as long as my scholarships cover my costs. In the event of that my school does require my family to pay (under an Expected Family Contribution), one of my scholarships will allow me to take out a loan that they will pay in full, including interest, upon my graduation, as long as I maintain good grades. I am not using the full value of my scholarships, but they will only cover what my school doesn't give me in grants.

My scholarships require I maintain a 3.0 GPA, good standing, etc. - all things I know I can do. An important note is that one of my scholarships strongly recommends that I **not** work during college because they are already giving me the larger stipend and have more stringent requirements (mainly academic). This scholarship will also give me stipends for studying abroad and summer internships. If I do work, they want me to limit it to no more than 15 hours per week Additionally, my school will not grant me work-study status due to my scholarships. This means that I can't take the jobs specifically reserved for work study students, but there are opportunities for normal work. 

My plan is to focus on my academic work. I don't want to work during school, at least not at first, because my school is very difficult. My scholarships intend to give me the freedom to focus on schoolwork without financial stress. Because of the stipends I receive, I believe it is much more important that I maintain good grades. I intend to pursue a PhD, and my field of study (humanities) should allow me to receive fellowships for my further study, but I need to build up a strong academic career. I plan to spend my summers interning/researching/studying abroad. I will live on campus all four years, so those costs will remain covered.

So, onto planning. I believe that I need to get my money out of the stock currently worth $500. I don't foresee its value increasing in the near future. Any suggestions with this?

I'm not sure if I should stick with the mutual fund: the dividends are good, but the value fluctuates a lot, around 20% in the course of the past couple of years, and the value has not reached the price at which I bought it. If I do stick with it, should I reinvest my dividends?

Next, I have the CD coming due, and I don't plan to allow it to roll over since the interest rates are so low right now. I also have a fair amount in my checking account. I think I should set aside about $2000 for an emergency fund (my home is far away from school so things like travel get expensive). 

Finally, I'd like to get some kind of long term investing/retirement fund set up. Because I'm not planning to work, I won't be able to do a 401(k), but I think I can set up an IRA, and a Roth IRA seems to be the better choice. I can sock away at least a few hundred dollars in there every year. In terms of long term investments or diversifying my portfolio, I have no idea.

25fnyw,0,2014-05-13,The Road to Med School Thus Far,HotDirtySteamyRice,premed,https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/25fnyw/the_road_to_med_school_thus_far/,"WELL, what a roller coaster my first year of college was. Because of some personal/ family issues, I ended first semester with a cGPA of 2.82, and sGPA of about 3.65. I literally wanted to die, since I avidly follow this sub-reddit, in addition to my unhealthy obsession with reading admission statistics from the med schools I want to apply to in the near future, and know that you don't have a whole lot of room with the GPA when the averages are like 3.7 ish. 

BUT, hallelujah, I just finished this semester with a 3.84, over a whole point jump in cGPA, also finishing with a semester-sGPA of 4.0. So maybe my life isn't over after all, since I know I'm bright and I know undoubtedly that my passion is in the medical field. 

Tomorrow morning, I start my internship with a successful practicing Dermatologist (my ideal future niche in the medical field, as far as I'm concerned this early on in the game), which will last for the duration of the summer (4 months). 

THINGS ARE LOOKING UP! And after a restful summer, I'm excited to hit O-Chem, Physics, Bio, and genetics as hard as I can next semester. I just wanted to give you a little depiction of how things are going for me, to offer hope to anyone hitting some roadblocks! Remember that we're all only human, and we can't have the perfect application or the perfect life and perfect grades, but damn it we can work as hard as we can to get as close to perfect as we can! And WHEN you slip up a little, shake it off and come back stronger than ever! 

Encouragement aside, I was also wondering if anyone had any advice on what my next steps should be over the course of the next three years. I want to do something unique, not just for my med school app, but for the sake of my life and experiencing incredible things. If anyone has some suggestions on what my next courses of action should be (for the sake of always having a plan for the future), please let me know. 

In the meantime, for those getting out for summer, congrats on making it through another year! For those who still have work to do, fight on my brothers and sisters! 

Thanks for your time, guys. "

i'm not sure when i started noticing it. there were several traits that she had; several responses that i've never seen in anyone else i've talked to/worked with/lived with. i've also been suffering from untreated low self-esteem and anxiety issues my whole life, mainly from my parents pushing me to compete with the other ethnic kids who went to the same public schools, even after high school graduation. i distinctly recall many examples of not being ""as good as Mrs. X's kid"" even though our test scores and grades weren't that far apart.

i'm on an internship for the summer (college), living away from home. it's been weeks of not being exposed to my mother. i've been around my fully-functional coworkers (especially my boss, he's emotionally stable and fair) and building great relationships. i actually enjoy the work i'm doing for my company and learning a whole lot.

last night, i called home and talked to (mainly) my mother for the first time in a couple of months, to make sure she got her mother's day card, how was life going, etc.

and then she starts asking about my career choice, how it was never to her liking (she wanted me to go to med school, not engineering), how working for a relatively small company was detrimental to my career development; how i needed to get into a large corporation (like her's - it's a fortune 500) in order to have a ""good life"".

i asked her specifically why she wanted me to go to med school, and what part of living a ""good life"" comes from being a doctor, and what kind of lifestyle a doctor leads that would make a ""good life"" and she always reasoned that she always referenced meeting Mrs. Y at a party whose husband is a neurologist and he lives in a ridiculously large mansion and they always seem to be having fun.

cut a long story short, instead of just listening to her and say that i'll apply to more well-known corporations and try to climb the corporate ladder, i tried to communicate my thoughts to her on my current position and how much i'm learning and how great the environment is...

...which ended up, as usual, in her attacking me on several fronts, me being close to tears, feeling like my accomplishments and achievements (while never stellar) are inadequate, and me reverting to a defensive attitude (something i've noticed myself doing especially around my parents - i've been habit-picking it out and making great improvements on it at work/school and with my roommmates). 

as i've gained more financial independence from my internships and work experience and university life, i've been able to break many annoying habits, like being defensive, trying to appease whoever i'm talking to (appeasing my angry mother was the go-to answer at home - never talk back to her), and feeling extremely self-conscious at every single little thing i do, asking if it'll make mother angry later down the road.

i took a day off work today, not gettng much sleep last night. whatever sleep i did get was plagued by really bad nightmares. 

i was really in a bad spot last night mentally, trying to make sense of what the hell just happened. maybe i'm a really bad kid and just provoked my parents wrong. 

i started browsing reddit and read up on a couple of bad parent-child relationships, and believe me it's never been as bad as the sob stories i've been reading, but i came across this sub after a little and gathered enough courage to post this.

i want to deal with this the best i can, i'm open to answering any questions that won't leak my personal details, i just really need some answers."

Please advise.,[deleted],buildapcsales,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcsales/comments/25g9gz/i_need_help_deciding_a_motherboard_and_a_graphics/,"* I used to be an avid computer gamer back from 2004 to about 2008 (high school years). I played HL2, CS: Source, TF2, Portal, and DOD. In college, I basically lost touch with gaming and moved on to my laptop years due to heavy workload for school and internship. Now, I've been out of school for 2 years and want to get back into computer gaming.

* I've decided to build a rig myself. I plan on purchasing an Intel Core i7 4770K (through a friend at CDW via the Intel Retail Edge Program) tomorrow. However, I've been out of the loop for years on what ""good prices"" are for each piece of hardware. I also don't have a clue anymore on what motherboard and graphics card to get. This is where I need your guys' help.

* I would like a multi monitor setup (2 1080p 24"" monitors and 1 1080p 46"" TV) so help me choose a graphics card with the adequate output ports. The games I would like to play are CS: GO, COD: Advanced Warfare, Dayz, Far Cry 3, Borderlands 2, and Watch_Dogs. I would also like it to be future proof for 2-3 years. Nvidia used to be the king a decade ago; is that still the case? Do you get more bang for your buck by going SLI/Crossfire or a single higher-end card?

* My budget is $900 (taxes and shipping included) for Motherboard, RAM, SSD &amp; HDD, Tower/Case, Graphics Card, PSU, Heatsinks, Fans, and Thermal Paste. (remember: the processor is already acquired)

* How much RAM is sufficient? Which brands to get and which brands to avoid? What is a ""good sale"" in $/gig?

* Which motherboard should I get for my i7-4770k?

* Are all SSD's created equal? From what I've been reading, it seems like the Samsung Evo 840 is the way to go.

25gbsr,8,2014-05-13,Henry's Exposure Therapy - Patient Profile from The Three Lessons I Learned Pursuing A Career in Psychology [Part 2],Human_Gravy,DarkTales,https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkTales/comments/25gbsr/henrys_exposure_therapy_patient_profile_from_the/,"Link to previous story: [The Three Lessons I Learned Pursuing a Career in Psychology](http://redd.it/252dss)

Users have asked for details about my therapy sessions with my old clients from the internship. I was hesitant to release details of my patients and their treatments but the therapists I console have shown a great deal of interest in my treatment methods. They only asked that I use different names for clients and not to reveal anything that will make them easily identifiable to avoid lawsuits and maintain professionalism. Otherwise, these writings can be considered case studies. 


In the comment section of my first post, I described an experience with a veteran returning from an overseas conflict. If you have already read this comment, you know how the story ends but I have included more details in this entry and gotten some help from fellow therapist with information the case to shine a light on what really happened, if that still interests you. Otherwise, I shall begin with “Henry”, my first client. 


Henry phoned into Dr. J’s office where I interned doing administrative work and scheduling appointments. Unfortunately, Dr. J was booked for the next two weeks and Henry’s request was for an appointment as soon as possible. The closest appointment I had was in a month’s time after Dr. J returned from a conference in Arizona. There was something in his voice that told me that he wasn’t being impatient but desperately needed help. My instincts are rarely ever wrong when it comes to matters of psychology so I invited him to the office after hours so that we could have a session. 


After getting ourselves settled into Dr. J’s office, I asked Henry the purpose of his visit. As I reached for my pen, Henry jumped across the table and grabbed my arm. The look in his eyes told me that was in panic. It was a result of being afraid of something. I asked him to release me as I was only going to grab a pen. He held on for a few moments before releasing his hand from mine and sitting back on his side of the couch. 


He seemed embarrassed but asked that I not write anything down of our sessions. He didn’t’ to leave a paper trail behind of his visit to the therapist. That’s when he revealed to me that he was in the armed forces.  He didn’t want to use his insurance plan because it would be reported and noted on his permanent record. He’d never be considered for advancement again. I respected his wishes and told him we would discuss payment later. Always remember rule number three: Always discuss your salary before starting a job.


I was feeling hesitant before about scheduling the appointment but all that disappeared the moment Henry told me he was in the armed forces. Deep in my heart, I knew that I was doing my duty as a citizen of these United States and a psychologist to assist this young man in his time of need. We must always support our troops! 


The session lasted three hours before we finished. Getting Henry to speak about his problems was as difficult as pulling teeth on a patient with no anesthetic. Henry was guarded to the idea of discussing his service time overseas in combat. Most veterans of war do not like to speak about their experiences. It is understandable so instead we talked about his symptoms. He had extreme difficulty sleeping as he experienced flashbacks of his time in war during the night. The anxiety of awaiting an attack did not allow his mind to rest. Along with lack of sleep, this was causing a hypersensitivity disorder making him prone to emotional outbursts and bouts of rage. He was self-medicating with narcotics and alcohol to put himself to sleep.


As Henry spoke about his symptoms, I could see it in his face that he would be haunted for the rest of his life. Wartime calls for men and women to perform unspeakable acts of violence and horror to each other. It was a clear cut case of post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, and drug addiction. What worried me the most was Henry’s admission of contemplating suicide then lifting his shirt to show me that he was currently armed. He slept with the gun under his pillow and felt unsafe if he didn’t have a weapon in arms reach at all times. It was shocking but I am not there to judge the man. I didn’t feel threatened by him.  He wanted my assistance, unlike the others I tried to help before. 


As my treatment options were limited, I believed that the best option of treatment was exposure therapy. Henry was a young man haunted by the demons of the past and he needed to confront them without facing any real danger. How do you send a man to war without putting him into danger? In a flash of brilliance, I prescribed Henry a form of exposure therapy that would be exactly what he needed. The young man did everything as I prescribed him, except for only one part that he did not follow.


To confront his demons, I had him watch the opening scene of the Allies soldiers storming Omaha Beach in “Saving Private Ryan”. To stimulate the parts of his mind still hurting from combat, he would need to turn it up as loudly as possible. The simulation of actual combat would allow him to relive those moments of war so he can come to terms with his fear. He would realize that he was safe and that his time on the front lines was finished. Henry would also need to have his gun nearby as it would serve as an anchor of safety to reality. It would serve as the protection his mind needed against the demons of war. 


In my original comment, I guessed about what happened after the point of where Henry began to watch the film. With some corroboration from the therapists at my facility, they have informed me that my guess was almost correct.  Henry suffered a flashback or re-experience scenario where his reality became storming Omaha Beach in World War Two. I was wrong that he discharged his weapon at the television screen in his delusional state. Instead, the neighbors called the police about a noise complaint because Henry was using a surround sound system with the volume extremely high. 


In the middle of the movie, the police pounded on the door in an attempt to get Henry’s attention and unfortunately, they did. In his delusional state, Henry must have believed that German combatants were attempting to break down his door. He surprised them when he opened the door and fired his weapon into their heads at point blank range. The officers never had a chance to react. More police were called to the scene as a result of the gun fire and there was a stand-off between Henry and the police. Henry took cover inside of his home and began to fire out the window. With no other options, the police fired back at Henry and he was killed in action. 


Finding out that this was the reason Henry did not return for our next session was heart-breaking but getting back to lesson number two that I’ve learned: You cannot blame yourself for client failures. And as to the one thing Henry did wrong, I don’t remember if I exactly mentioned it to him but I’m pretty sure that I told him to unload the bullets from his gun before he started the movie.

25gvf6,1,2014-05-13,Does anyone have advice about retaking the MCAT? Thank you :),JamesCorcoran,Mcat,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mcat/comments/25gvf6/does_anyone_have_advice_about_retaking_the_mcat/,"This is probably just me freaking out but.... I am a college junior and my MCAT is Saturday and I am worried I will not do well.  I am thinking about my summer plans in case I do poorly.  If I have to retake the MCAT, I will apply to medical school NEXT cycle (not this cycle).

I won't know until June 15th what my score is, but I have to make summer plans now.

I have 3 options:

1) Do a full time (40hr/week) paid internship that will count as a course for one of my majors.

2) Take an easy online course the first summer session and do a 10hr/week unpaid internship (counts as a course too).

3) Do just the online course or just the 10hr/week internship.


I ideally would like to do the paid internship as I'm broke, but I am afraid if I do poorly on my MCAT, when would I retake the MCAT because it'd be hard to study enough with a full time job?  I need to take it before next December because after that the MCAT changes and I have studied for this version.  However, I'd ideally like to re-take it in September if I do badly because I don't want to forget what I have learned already.



Should I choose the unpaid internship in case I don't do well on the MCAT?  But if I do well enough, I'm gonna be pissed on passing up the paid internship because its with a very reputable company.

--

Also, anyone have any advice on how to sleep the week before the test?  I just lie awake all night worrying and even ambien doesn't work...

25hpmd,4,2014-05-13,"I'm addicted to gambling and the only thing that stops me is being overdrawn, help?",SoThrowed,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/25hpmd/im_addicted_to_gambling_and_the_only_thing_that/,"I'm an otherwise normal 27 year old guy. Finished my second degree earlier this year. I have drank and dabbled in a few drugs but have never in any way ever even craved them, let alone become close to dependent. I am otherwise not impulsive and believe I had a normal childhood where money was not comfortable but never needed to come up.

However, in late 2010 my coworker and my two roommates all turned out to be big sports and somewhat big blackjack players. It was a frenzy that overwhelemed me because I liked the rush, the money, and the struggle of trying to beat the book.

Initially it was great, I won so much money. Now, for some reason, I fear I still negate my negative experiences that have come with losing so much gambling b/c of the hope that I can get that first high I had when I first started. I liked being able to fly myself all over the world, buy clothes and useless shit, and not worry about money.


Obviously that did not last long, but even though I ran myself dry from time to time I was never too bad. However, the past year and half have been different. Besides a few times when I get a huge lump sum of money, I am practically always under $100 in my account and sometimes overdrawn for a few days or weeks. I think about it constantly since I often watch ESPN or watch a hockey/football game. 
I have told myself a million times I am going to stop, I tried to ban myself from one site(then I just signed up for another), I made my self swear to god I would stop, I even decided to give someone else my money in a shared account (which I then just went and withdrew the money secretly). I've come across a few problems, luckily nothing in the legal system. I have lost a few friends, my roommate kicked me out of the apt after I sold my gifts to bet on college bowl games and was left with no money. At this point I'm considering hypnosis or something like that because I recently received a bonus that I have to use to move cities and put down a few months of rent on and use to live until my paychecks can float me. Even knowing this I really don't think I can control myself. Sometimes I'll go for a week or so with no impulse, then I say I'll just do one. Then either I win and want more or lose and try to make it back, and there comes a whole long, terrible cycle after that. I had a summer internship last summer and despite knowing the money they gave me was for rent, food, and gas, I completely blew through my money mainly on gambling. 

I really think since 2011, I have lost something like $15-25k

This is primarily online sports betting so whenever I see a sport, a tv, or computer/phone I receive a reminder. I also, even last month, have won money and withdrawn, but inevitably I come crawling back and lose it all. 

TL;DR - I can not stop online sports gambling and I'm coming up on a large lump sum of money which I need to support myself for a few months and I need to know what to do to help in the long term and short term."

I'm so confused and don't know what is right or not. I'm 21 and male.

I didn't have many friends in high school, and spent a lot of time alone. I had one friend. She was my entire life. We still are best friends. We spent a LOT of time together and talked all day at school, and texted every time otherwise.

When I went to college, I met some other people. My social circle is pretty small. I have that girl, plus my male best friend, and 3 other guys I talk to and hang out with.

I'm working full time right now at an internship. Right now I still text that girl, and my other best friend all day on and off, usually every day. I text the other people occasionally too. I usually have someone to hang out with 6 out of the 7 days in a week. I love it. I feel really guilty about it.

The thing is, people think its weird enough I do this as it is. I'm sexually attracted to men. So any of these guys I hang out with I would date if they asked. None are gay, so I don't try.

I feel like this attraction part towards them makes it wrong for me to involve them in my life so much. I feel fake knowing I'm attracted to my closest friends sexually.

I try to distance myself and an unhappy, but when I let myself do what I want I'm always told to watch out that I don't break my heart. Or I get told its wrong to harbor feelings about friends that you won't get back.

these friends are totally willing to reciprocate, its not one way. I'm just told because of my feelings this is all wrong.

when I get a partner of course I would hang out with them and talk the most, but there is no way I ever see myself not loving everyone else a whole lot to.

Is this OK? Is it fine to love people like this? They make me feel so good and warm. Having an emotional connection with them makes me feel so good. I don't know if this is normal with friends, or only because I'm attracted?"

The thing is, people think its weird enough I do this as it is. I'm sexually attracted to men. So any of these guys I hang out with I would date if they asked. None are gay, so I don't try.

I feel like this attraction part towards them makes it wrong for me to involve them in my life so much. I feel fake knowing I'm attracted to my closest friends sexually.

I try to distance myself and an unhappy, but when I let myself do what I want I'm always told to watch out that I don't break my heart. Or I get told its wrong to harbor feelings about friends that you won't get back.

these friends are totally willing to reciprocate, its not one way. I'm just told because of my feelings this is all wrong.

when I get a partner of course I would hang out with them and talk the most, but there is no way I ever see myself not loving everyone else a whole lot to.

Is this OK? Is it fine to love people like this? They make me feel so good and warm. Having an emotional connection with them makes me feel so good. I don't know if this is normal with friends, or only because I'm attracted?"
25iaal,10,2014-05-13,I never want to live in student housing again.. A long ongoing air condition battle and a rant.,[deleted],badroommates,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/25iaal/i_never_want_to_live_in_student_housing_again_a/,"I've lived in an off campus student apartment complex for the past year and a half now. Last August I planned on living with one of my friends from back home in this same complex, but due to some really shitty circumstances, she wasn't able to move in with me. It didn't really effect me though because each roommate signs their own lease for their own room. I expected a random person to be assigned the second room, but no one ever showed up. I had the place all to myself. It was fantastic. I assumed no one would be moving in at all. 

One day about two months later, I woke up to find an asian couple in my living room. Okay. You would think someone would notify me as to whether someone else would be moving in later but whatever. She told me she wasn't a student but moved to Florida for an internship. Her husband was going to stay for the week and then he would go back to wherever they were from. I'm not sure if her husband spoke english because I only saw him that first day and he didn't say anything to me, but I just figured he was shy maybe. I didn't care that he was staying, they were very quiet. Didn't see her much because we both spend most of our time in our rooms. We didn't have and issues until the winter.. 

Every time the temperature outside was below 60, she tried to turn the heat on during the night. It was sort of an unusually cold winter for Florida, but I would never think to turn the heat on in the apartment. The temperature inside was never below 65 degrees on even the coldest days. I told her to please not keep the heat on at night because I cannot sleep when I'm hot. We discussed it MULTIPLE times. I didn't care if she turned the heat on for a little bit, even though I didn't think it was necessary, but to please remember to turn it back off. There were several occasions where I woke up sweaty at 6:30 am because she would turn the heat on when she woke up and would forgot to turn it off when she left for work. One night around 3am I turned the heat off because it was fucking hot, and she came out and immediately turned it back on, I went out to turn it off again after 5 minutes and she came back and turned it right back on again. This happened a couple of nights.

It's summer time now and it's getting really hot out! We have giant windows in our room which bring in a lot of heat. I don't have curtains, so I just cover it with a sheet in the daytime. Even with the window covered, it gets very hot in my room. I keep my fan on full blast and I like to have the air condition set to 'auto' at about 73-72 degrees during the night. It gets to 69-70 during and I think that's comfortable to sleep in BUT my roommate however does not. She has told me that she ""wakes up in the middle of the night because she is freezing"" when it is 70 degrees. It's not my fault that you are too stupid to put a blanket on.

The past couple of days I have been coming home to find the air condition turned 'on' and set to 76 degrees. I don't know what she is trying to accomplish, she's constantly complaining that she's too cold at night, so what's the point of keeping it on? It's not blowing cold air, it's just like having a fan on. Before she moved in, I accidentally left it 'on' and running one day and the AC unit broke. I had one of the maintenance guys tell me to keep it on 'auto' or else it will break. I have also told my roommate this but she absolutely refuses to believe me.

Last night really did it for me... Again, the ac was set 'on' at 76. I keep turning it off and trying to come out and catch her putting it back on so we can talk about it, but she's too quick. We went back and forth. I would come out and set it to 73 on 'auto' she would come out and crank it back 'on' to 76. This is an ongoing battle. I got so fed up with it at 3 am that I put a note on next to the thermostat asking for her to PLEASE PLEASE not keep the ac running all night long because it will break and at least have it below 75 at night and suggesting to close the vent in her room if she got too cold. Today I came home from 2 notes from her on the thermostat. She used one of those page holders to show me what the actual temperature is...As if I am not aware. And another asking to keep it set at least at 75 degrees during the night so she does not freeze and that she cannot close her vent because it is noisy.

My issue is.. You can put on more clothes or cover up more if you're cold but you can't do much about being hot. I'm not even home everyday. I spend about half of the week spending the night at my boyfriends house. Is it too much to ask that we keep it cooler when I'm there? This isn't about the electric bill either because all of our utilities are included in our rent, we never ever have to pay for it. I am planning on moving into a real apartment with my boyfriend after the summer and I would like to enjoy not having to pay for the cool air while I live here. 

I realize that this may not be as bad as the other stories on this sub but she is really getting on my last nerve and A LOT of the things she does annoy me. I feel like she does things just to spite me. One time my boyfriend accidentally used 2 pieces of her bread to make a sandwich. I apologized and told her it was a mistake, he wouldn't do it again. This was the only time we ever used anything of hers. After that she started tying her food up in plastic bags..A few weeks ago, I was taking a nap when I heard her using my bathroom. There's no reason she should have been in there. She has her own bathroom, IN her room. Mine is across the hall from my door. I saw her later that day and she didn't say anything about it and I chickened out about asking her because I don't like confrontations. I stay over at my boyfriends a lot and never think to lock my rooms, so I wondered, is she always using my things when she thinks I'm not here? Is she going into my room?? She locks her door whenever she leaves the apartment even if it is just for 10 minutes, it's not like I would ever enter her room, but is this because she is suspicious I will do the same to her? Also whenever she is out in the kitchen, she is ALWAYS running the sink. It will be on for 15 minutes straight. It doesn't sound like shes washing anything, it's just running. I've heard it running while she was slamming the cupboards and fridge door. Why is it ALWAYS ON? I am so so thankful we don't have to pay utilities because I cannot imagine how much money she would be wasting. Also last night I also found an entire egg shell in the garbage disposal. I have never actually heard her use the garbage disposal, there's just food in it I guess. She also started using a small plastic bag as her trash can. It was on the counter and now it hangs off the oven. I just don't understand the things she does. 

Another issue, unrelated to my roommate is the people that live above me.. I am not exaggerating when I say that they are CONSTANTLY moving. It sounds like an elephant running around. I can't imagine what they could possibly be doing up there or how any human being could move that much. It's like theyre jumping instead of walking. It lasts all night and day. I don't know when they sleep. I've been woken up by their booming at 4:30 am before. I thought the people that lived above me before this apartment were loud, but this is way worse. 

I am counting down the days until I can move out of this god awful apartment building. 75 days..."
25iha5,1,2014-05-14,Officially booked my tickets! 18 days in Japan beginning Aug. 29! Please help me plan out my trip,[deleted],JapanTravel,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/25iha5/officially_booked_my_tickets_18_days_in_japan/,"Hi everyone,

I posted here a little while ago talking about an internship I'm doing in China after which I'll be going to Japan. I've officially bought my tickets (my university paid for all airfare!) and now I'm trying to plan out my trip before all the accommodations get booked.    

Here are the details I have so far:

Landing Aug 29 evening at KIX    
Departing Sep 15 afternoon from NRT

Outline:
SOLO TRIP! I've been told I should spend half my time in Kyoto and the other half in Tokyo, so I guess I could plan on spending 8 or 9 nights in Kyoto with day trips to Osaka and Nara and whatever else is there, and the other half in Tokyo. However a lot of the japan-guide itineraries suggest ""spend x days at y place"", in which case I'd rather not be paying for both a hostel and accommodations elsewhere. I'll also have luggage from a 10-week stay in Shanghai (I'm hoping to pack light).    
    

One option I've considered is spend a few days in Osaka soon after I fly in and then go to Kyoto for the rest of the first week. Is Osaka worth staying in for a few days or would I be better off in Kyoto, simply making a day's trip to Osaka?

Housing: I've heard great things about K's house so I think I might just go with them for both halves of the trip. Seems like people book pretty far in advance, so that should be my top priority. If anyone has other suggestions, please enlighten me (but they're the cheapest I've found). 

Transportation: Seems like it would be smartest for me to get one of those 14-day JR passes. Any other suggestions? The Seishun 18 ticket will be in season and it's pretty cheap but I think it lasts only 5 days.    

Cost: I'm hoping to be on the (very) cheaper side of things.

Things I want to experience for sure:    
-Onsen    
-One of those ramen stands    
-Check out some shrines/temples    
-Fushimi Inari :)    

Aside from those, I really have no idea what I should be looking for. I know the language so I shouldn't have trouble getting around.

Itinerary (here's where you come in!)

* Day 1 (Fri Aug 29)    
 Landing in KIX at 6:30pm. Hop on a train to Kyoto hostel    

* Day 2-5 (Sat Aug 30 - Tues Sep 2)    
Explore Kyoto
    
* Day 6 (Wed Sep 3)    
Osaka day trip, probably check out Osaka castle and Dotonburi. (how late can i stay before trains stop going back to kyoto?)

* Day 7 (Thur Sep 4)    
Nara day trip? Seems like everyone does that, must be cool.

* Day 8 (Fri Sep 5))
Morning: Check out of Kyoto hostel, get on a shinkansen to Hiroshima and find a hostel there    
Explore Hiroshima    

* Day 9 (Sat Sep 6)    
Explore Miyajima

* Day 10 (Sun Sep 7)    
Morning: check out of hostel and head to Tokyo hostel. Looks like a 5-hr train ride.
    
* Day 11-13 (Mon Sep 8 - Wed Sep 10)     
Explore Tokyo?    
Akihabara?

* Day 14 (Thur Sep 11)    
Asakusa and Odaiba from japan-guide

* Day 15 (Fri Sep 12)    
Kamakura from japan-guide...maybe. Seems a bit far.

* Day 16-17 (Sat Sep 13 - Sun Sep 14)    
Keep exploring Tokyo?

* Day 18:    
Head to NRT, leave japans :(

Please tell me if I'm spending too much or too little time in certain places or if there are additional places that would be cool to visit. Again, I'm not particularly attached to this itinerary. I just have to begin at KIX and end in NRT 18 days later, and preferably not spend too much money. As you can see, there's a lot of work to be done. I'd appreciate some help/suggestions. Back to scouring japan-guide!    

EDIT: I don't meet the drinking age in Japan, so I guess bars and stuff won't apply    
EDIT: Added some suggestions. Think I should get the 7-day JR pass.    

Thanks! :)"
25ilay,0,2014-05-14,My [22 M] boyfriend blacks out and doesn't remember what he does. He is trying to change for better but I [20 F] don't think I can take much more.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/25ilay/my_22_m_boyfriend_blacks_out_and_doesnt_remember/,"My boyfriend has always been a free spirit, doesn't really get into relationships, and has always been on his own. I know this because I went to his high school, but we never interacted until we met in Miami when I was on vacation with another boyfriend at the time of 2 years.

We had an immediate electric connection, so much that I could not stop thinking about him and I ended up breaking up with my SO of the time because that is not fair to him. I have been together with my boyfriend every day ever since (about a year).

I broke up with him a couple weeks ago because whenever I look at his phone I find shady things (ex snaps with ex hookups). He is depressed and when he drinks he blacks out every time. He is currently getting help for his depression.

Since breaking up he is trying, but I still find a few things I don't like, such as today I saw he was in contact with a few girls I don't like and I know want to hook up with him. What really killed me and the rest of our relationship was one day, he went out drinking and came back to his house (where I was staying) completely trashed. 

He was being shady with his phone, so I took it out of his hands and it was a pic of his face with the words ""tits or gtfo"" and he was about to send it to a few girls. I broke up with him right there. He claims ""tits or gtfo"" is a ""saying"" and a joke. 

In about 15 days, I am leaving for a 2 month long time to Indonesia for an internship. We will still be broken up when I go because if I am worried about these things when I am in the same house as him, god knows what could happen when I am halfway around the world. I'm I am afraid of him moving on, but I know that nobody else will put up with his bullshit the way I do. 

I know that one day he is going to look back and wish he had never lied or been shady to me, because drinking and doing stupid shit is not worth losing what we have, and he knows it.

I am going to come back to a world that will not be the same. I love him so much but I don't know how much more I can take.

Any advice would be helpful. This is a really hard time for me and I don't want to ruin my experience in Bali because I am worried of what he could be doing at home. We are so in love, he loves me so much but his drinking is erratic and makes him into a different person.

**tl;dr**: Boyfriend blacks out, doesn't remember actions, I am sick of it and don't know what to do."

I have worked as a cashier at a supermarket for the last eight years of my life because my career as a graphic designer left me poor, with perhaps a few freelance jobs here and there, an unpaid internship, and little else. I have done so little for so long, and have felt like a miserable failure for a long time now. My shame has left me feeling pathetic to the point where I don't know who I am anymore. I even broke down crying at work a few weeks ago because I was at my end; I had failed at life.

But I don't want to feel like this anymore.
I want to believe that I'm capable of changing my life.
I don't want to be afraid anymore.
I want to feel like I can fail and keep going, no matter what.
I don't want to feel like a failure anymore.
I want to be happy.
I want to believe that I am worth something.
I want to feel like myself again.
I want to laugh and smile once more.

And maybe I'll figure it out. I will finish my Masters in Computer Science a little more than a week from now. Even though I don't have a proper job lined up, and don't have the desired work experience, I'll figure it out. I know I will. Somehow, someway.

And maybe all I really want is to just forgive myself for my failures. That's all.

Or maybe... maybe it's not forgiveness that I need. Perhaps what I need most is to make a promise to myself, and to fulfill that promise, no matter what.

I promise... to do the very best I can, and to remember that I'm not perfect, and that I will make mistakes; to always get back up, no matter how many times I fall; to praise my efforts, rather than pity myself for my failures; to take responsibility for what I do or do not; to remind myself that there is always a way to get to where I want to be; to know the difference between strength and anger; to remember that ultimately I am the master of my fate, the captain of my soul.

I will live by these words throughout my days, and remember them always. This, I promise."

Anyway, I've decided its about time for me to serve up some beetus for you lovely folks and tell you the tale of Production Ass aka PAss. 

Let's set the table.


&gt;be me: LuLaLuo, 23, 5'6, at the time 180,(becomes relevant later) chill, hardworking little production assistant, alpha as fuck.



&gt;you could be: RED, 27, my sarcastic, smoker, 5'4 130 pound, lezbefriends. Former classmate, all around kick ass. Associate of PAss.



&gt;NEVER EVER EVERRR FUCKING BE: PAss, 30, 5'6, 280, turtle faced, LAZY, rude associate of RED. My Cow-worker. 


Little LuLaluo, fresh home from doing a six month LA internship workin' in dat Hollywood. RED calls up sayin' she's on a job now working a *le gasp* cooking show. Another Production Assistant is sick and was sent home they need more helps. 

Lulaluo interviews over the phone with the Production Manager and was hired to work the next day. 

YAY. 


&gt;Datfreelancelife.jpeg [ohyeah!](http://imgur.com/gallery/nQCKkbH)


So I show up to set to work the next morning. Me and RED kill it, having worked together before. I was helping wash dishes (all the dishes, pots, etc) and stayed on top of it along with all my other tasks. I'm also a very pleasant, hardworker. Cooking staff loved meh, production office also loved meh, crew love meh. 

LULALOU WAS HIRED BACK FOR ANOTHER DAY! 

&gt;[likeaboss](http://i.imgur.com/GBgXd.gif)

Day 2 is where our fun begins.

Show up to set first, as you should as PA. P. Manager arrives and I start setting up Breakfast for the crew. All is well in Lulaland!

Suddenly, the ground shakes. The cups rattle off the table. Over my shoulder I see her. PAss [waddling](http://i.imgur.com/mp5RmrI.gif) up the drive way. PM points out she's another PA.

Oh goodie, more help(or so I thought)!!! The dishes soaking from last night need to finish getting washed. 

She gets to the garage and I introduce myself. She looks me up and down, says hi and grabs a bag of chips from the craft table and starts eating. PM says she hired me because of PAss being sick. 

PAss hacks into her arm at that moment. 


&gt;mrw[NOPE!](http://i.imgur.com/AeMDSt3.gif)

I head to the washer room to wash the pots and she says finish the breakfast stuff. 

Mmkay, cool. She's been here longer. Off I go. 

Now in film/tv its common to work 12 hours a day, actually that's what you expect. This show was shooting 16-17 a day, so RED who has been working these hours already for a week straight got to come in late. 

Now nothing has actually happened yet with PAss and me but something is off with the way she interacts with me. You know the [feeling](http://i.imgur.com/NQnoMGb.gif) .

While washing dishes:



&gt;RED: Sooooo about PAss, she can be a little difficult to work with. Just a heads up. She gets a lot of work out here so, yeah, be cool. 



&gt;ME: You know I get along with almost everybody Red. 



&gt;RED: True. 


Now the day progresses, dishes are a bitch but everyone pitches in. Producers to PA's. I wash and people come help dry. When you need a pot/plate for a scene, it happens. 

Well PAss decides she's my [boss] (http://i.imgur.com/zCtbl.gif). Delegating tasks to me while she sits on her ass, kissing up to the producers. Because her [knees] (http://i.imgur.com/VVNVXBr.gif)....

End of day, all wrapped out washing dishes while everyone is eating dinner. Red helping me out. [Us](http://i.imgur.com/tBJa1.gif).


&gt;ME: No offense but I don't think I like your ""friend"". I don't know if we're going to get along. 


&gt;RED: She's not my friend and I figured you wouldn't but it'll be OK.

FAMOUS LAST WORDS.

Bonus: Lulalou was hired for the rest of the show! YAY. [MONEY](http://i.imgur.com/YmPDkwq.gif)

25imgs,10,2014-05-14,"When there is a reboot of the Spider-Man franchise in the future, here are my story ideas for the first two films.",SuckaFreeBaust,Spiderman,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spiderman/comments/25imgs/when_there_is_a_reboot_of_the_spiderman_franchise/,"Please let me know what you think and what ideas you may have.

First film:

* The film begins months after Peter is bitten by a genetically modified spider on a field trip to Oscorp Industries. Peter is in his senior year of high school with his best friend Gwen Stacey (whose father Captain Stacey was assigned to the Uncle Ben murder case), Flash Thompson, Liz Allan, Randy Robertson.

* Spidey catches criminal Herman Schultz, second in command to Mr. Big, who escapes (accompanied by flashbacks of letting the burglar who would kill Uncle Ben escape)

* Peter and Gwen read an article from the Daily Bugle about “Mr. Big’s crime ring” and also an article about Wilson Fisk’s philanthropy. At school, Wilson Fisk makes an appearance to give a speech about success in the business world.

* Rather than going through the trouble of finding Mr. Big and forcing him to give up his crime rackets, the Kingpin negotiates Schultz’s release from prison. Kingpin offers Schultz a job alongside his Enforcers if he reveals the identity of Mr. Big and if he takes care of Captain Stacey, who has been meddling in his affairs. Gives Schultz the (Shocker) suit “from his friends at Oscorp.”

* Peter and Gwen start dating. When Captain Stacey (who is a widower) picks up Gwen at the Parker home one night, he shows an interest in Aunt May (based on the USM version, she is in her mid to late forties) and sets up a date

* Mr. Big is an ordinary guy named Frederick Foswell. The Enforcers capture him.

* On their way home, Captain Stacey is killed by The Shocker, while he spares Gwen. 

* Peter consoles Gwen and reveals he is Spider-Man. With flashbacks of the night he tracks Uncle Ben’s killer, Spidey finds and defeats the Shocker.

* The Enforcers bring Mr. Big to the Kingpin, who he kills with his bare hands. Peter takes pictures from outside the building as Spider-Man

* Spidey defeats the Enforcers/Kingpin in Wilson Fisk’s office

* Peter sells pics of Spider-Man and the Kingpin killing Mr. Big to the Daily Bugle/J. Jonah Jameson

* Film ends with Captain Stacey's funeral, Flashback of Uncle Ben's conversation with Peter about ""great power, great responsibility"" just before his death, Gwen's speech at graduation.





Second film:

* Begins after the first movie, during the summer before Gwen (who is an intern at Oscorp) and Peter (who works part time at the Daily Bugle) go to college. Spidey captures small time criminal named Abner Jenkins.

* At the Daily Bugle (with J Jonah Jameson, Robbie Robertson, Betty Brant) journalist Eddie Brock questions how Peter always gets exclusive pictures of Spidey. JJ sends Peter and Eddie to Oscorp for an unveiling of their new “Venom project.”

* Aunt May is having financial difficulties and contemplates selling the house and moving in with her friend Anna Watson when Peter moves away for college in a few months.

* At Oscorp, Otto Octavius uses his mechanical harness to handle the symbiote from a distance. In another department a few floors away, Curt Connors (who has been experimenting with the genetics of lizards) mutates into a giant Lizard himself and causes a huge lab accident. 

* Peter changes into Spidey to save Gwen, and the other Oscorp employees. The Lizard defeats Spidey before escaping, spraining his arm (a nod to the comics). Doc Ock is melded to his harness and chemicals damage his eyes, forcing him to wear googles because his eyes are now sensitive to light. After the battle, the symbiote attaches itself to Peter.

* When Peter and Aunt May have dinner at Mrs. Watson’s home, he meets Mary Jane and is immediately attracted to her.

* Peter wakes up in the middle of the night to find himself fully healed and patrolling the streets in the black costume. He once again meets Abner Jenkins, who now wears a poorly constructed Beetle costume. Spidey then proceeds to beat him viciously. 

* Doc Ock, who is driven nearly insane by the accident, wakes up from a coma and blames Norman Osborn for his condition. He intends to return to Oscorp.

* Intending to write a breakthrough article, Eddie Brock begins his search for the identity of the Lizard. Brock questions Gwen, who worked under Curt Connors at Oscorp.

* Under the influence of the symbiote, Peter uses the events at Oscorp as an excuse to breaks up with Gwen because “it’s too dangerous for her to be in his life.” Peter then starts pursuing Mary Jane.

* The Lizard ultimately returns to his home to gather the rest of his research notes. Spidey arrives and severely beats the Lizard in front of his wife and son. Realizing the negative effects of the black suit, Peter decides he needs to remove it from his body. Eddie Brock witnesses this and takes pictures as evidence, immediately posting online that “Curt Connors is the Lizard! Story to come.” Spidey takes his phone/camera and destroys it, leaving Brock without any evidence.

* Spidey arrives at Oscorp to protect Norman and Gwen from Doc Ock. The battle is taken outdoors, where there is a lightning storm. Spidey leads Doc Ock to the roof of a tall skyscraper in the middle of the storm. Gwen notices Doc Ock’s vision is impacted by intense light and assists Spidey. Peter realizes the symbiote is weakened by electricity and intentionally exposes himself to it. Peter loses the black suit while Doc Ock is blinded by the lightning allowing Spidey to defeat him.

* Peter realizes he still loves Gwen.

* The black suit finds its way to the newly fired Eddie Brock, carrying the knowledge of Spider-Man’s identity to Brock. Film ends with Brock fully encased in the symbiote as Venom.

25irb8,8,2014-05-14,Rant Alert! Hate the way the Indian side of my family treats their daughters.,angryhalfdesi,ABCDesis,https://www.reddit.com/r/ABCDesis/comments/25irb8/rant_alert_hate_the_way_the_indian_side_of_my/,"Hi everyone,

I am not sure if this is the right sub, but I think many ABCD's can relate to this.  I am a 19 yr old female - half Indian (mom) and half White (dad).  Obviously, when my mom married my dad 23 years ago, it caused massive amounts of drama.  She was ""disowned"" by her family until I was born.

Well things got better and I went to India every summer to spend time with my Indian family and learn the culture.  I always enjoyed it and loved being spoiled by my grandparents and other relatives.  It's summer again and I am in India right now.  I came here 5 days ago and only plan on staying for 2 more weeks before I start an internship back in the U.S.

Now that I am older I am starting to see how horribly my female cousins in India are treated.  I guess I was too young and stupid to notice it earlier, but the difference in the way I am treated to the way they are treated is glaringly obvious.  

The main reason is looks.  I admit that I am a pretty even blend of Indian and white features.  I am way lighter than mom, but darker than dad.  I am also 5' 9"" while my cousins are around 5'2"" to 5'4"" - pretty standard for Indian women.  My grandmother is downright cruel to my cousins because they are ""dark and ugly"" or ""so short that no one will marry you.""  She even says crap like ""I wish you looked like angryhalfdesi.""

Umm how ridiculous is this?  Why are they being held to my standard?  It's more than likely that my height and skin color can be attributed to my dad's genes.  Why are my poor cousins expected to look like a half-white person?

The comments are especially vicious because it's summertime in India and my cousins are more tan, while I am not.  I intervene and try to call them out on it, but it's pointless.  I gave my 18 yr old cousin a pink dress from BCBG that she wanted so badly and her own mom says in front of my cousin - ""Why did you pick this color, you realize that she is too dark for it right?""  It's awful and heartbreaking!  

Why are we(yes, I do consider myself Indian) so obsessed with light skin? Why are we ruthlessly destroying the self esteem of our girls by picking on things that they cannot change without crazy surgery or dangerous skin lighteners?  I am really want to come back.  I can't stand this.  I hope my cousins get the strength to deal with this.  From what I see here, it's not like they can move out for college or work.  Rant over.

Edit - There is no such comparison between my brother and our male cousins.  His being light skinned and tall seems have no effect on the way our male cousins are treated.  Such hypocrisy!"

My school year is rumbling to a rough end, but I always have to remind myself that I'm still young and can still make something out of myself. I have some huge finals coming up, but my driving force is what I want to get out of my life over the summer. Sometimes I lose myself and start forgetting who I am; I start giving fucks and get sidetracked from what really matters in life: Myself. 

I am a very goal oriented person, and setting goals for myself gives me clear direction with what I want out of my life. I am printing this out tomorrow, and taping it above my laptop, and it will stay there until the first day of classes of Fall 2014. I just wanted to share my list with you all:

Goals for the Summer:

Make a daily schedule to do the following (Priority Order).

1.) Complete the Internship. Do your best, be the best.

2.) Learn a code language. MATLAB, C++, whatever. Learn at least one. 

3.) Continue working out. Finish that 5K. Get cut. Get sexy.

4.) Write 1 Melody a day. 

5.) Write 1 song a week. Finish 1 song a week. Finish 12 songs by summer end.

6.) Release 2 EP's. 

7.) Visit SP. Be with friends, don't be a loner.

8.) Visit Home. Don't forget your family. 

9.) Get over her. She's your friend, respect that. Everything is going to be okay. 

10.) Have fun.


I just wanted to share my method of not giving a fuck about things that don't matter in life, and taking a grip on shit that does. If this helps even one person, this post will have fulfilled its purpose. 

I also wanted to take a quick second and thank HTNGAF for helping me out through some really rough times: Thanks. "

I'm doing an internship I need to create a new database and populate it, using certain data from a different database.

In this case, I have 1 table in the other database called SAT_RESOURCE.

In this table we have a LOAD_DATE and an LCR value.

I have a FACT_MAIN and a DIM_DATE.

In the fact main I have a DATE_ID which should be the same as the DATE_ID in the DIM_DATE. And an LCR value, which should be the same as the value in the SAT_RESOURCE.

However, I need to lookup the DATE_ID in the DIM_DATE to match the LOAD_DATE in the SAT_RESOURCE.

Right now I'm using this query to join them together:

USE proberen
SELECT *
FROM [dbo].[DIM_DATE] AS d
INNER JOIN proberenDWH.[dbo].[SAT_RESOURCE] AS r ON r.load_date = d.date_name
WHERE r.load_date = d.date_name


Now my question is; How can I load the result of this query in the FACT table?"

I'm so bored of meeting men/women, being asked what I do as a day job, and get nothing but looks of disgust and condescension. More so than the unemployed or office slaves.

I'm not some fedora toting neckbeard living in my mother's basement jacking off to Linux Monthly. I work out, I eat relatively well, I play and teach guitar, go to gigs all the time, I dress well and my job pays me enough to be able to travel regularly. It allows me to pursue my interests and have a good life.

Despite this, working in IT seems to be a black mark, and I've un-pulled girls after having great conversation, kino, eye contact, jokes to be shoved away at the last minute after being asked what I do during the day. What to do? The only options seem to be ""So what? I make more money than you, enjoy your unpaid internship, asshole"", plain lying, or saying I teach guitar part time and sort of half assed mention that I mainly work with computers.

Mentioning that I find it interesting, and that it affords me a good quality of life hasn't gotten me anywhere.

There must be other people who also work in traditionally unattractive jobs finding themselves in a similar position?"

Right now I feel like shit, I really want to drop out, but it's gonna be even worse, no employer would want a college dropout to work for them!Please tell me what you think, I don't care if you want to call me lazy, or tell me I'm an idiot, I just can't do this anymore.I really need some advice ..."
25jdn8,1,2014-05-14,"Determined to get into med school, but in need help, advice, comments, criticism, etc. on current status",[deleted],premed,https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/25jdn8/determined_to_get_into_med_school_but_in_need/,"Hi! I'm pretty new to this subreddit. (In fact, I'm pretty new to reddit.) So if you could please bare with me, thanks. I'm second guessing my decision to start applying to medical schools at the moment (when you see my GPA, you'll probably will too). However, I am determined to get into med school. Some how, some way and as far back as I remember, I've always wanted to be a doctor.

I graduated recently, just this past November. I'm chemistry major, and I minored in biology. I wanted to shift to psychology mid-way through college (after my devastating semester with organic chemistry), but decided I'd stick with my original major.

I grew up in the military lifestyle, so I moved residences more than couple of times. I am a US citizen and legal residence of California, but I studied and earned my degree in the Philippines at the University of the Philippines, Diliman. Why? My parents, being first generation immigrants, had a lot of doubt in being able to financially support me if I attended college in the United States. We tried to file for FAFSA, but it really wasn't enough to cover expenses. I also was unlucky with the GI bill as my dad's was not the post 9-11 GI bill, meaning he could not transfer the benefits to me. The logical and most sound decision was for me to study in the Philippines. It would be easier on the finances, and (as my parents put it) I would learn the the language and culture of ""my people"".

I'm planning on applying to UCSF, Baylor, JABSOM, and (the dream) John Hopkins. My cGPA is mere 2.8 with my sGPA at 2.7. (The language barrier and culture shock really affected my grades early on.) Some students (and a few professors) were prejudice towards me as I ""came from the immoral west"".

I have yet to take the MCAT; I plan to take it either in August or in January 2015. I have done some research: (1) I was first author and senior author of ""Primary Studies on the Toxicity of Jatropha curcas Linn. Leaves on Zea Mays and Eisenia Fetida"" (my undergraduate thesis), (2) first author of ""Risk Assessment of Jatropha curcas Linn. Extracts"" (which I presented at the 29th for the Philippine Chemistry Congress), and several other as a contributing author.

I have no clinical volunteering (unless the hours I spent in the hospital assisting nurses and the physical therapist with my bedridden aunt who has osteogenesis imperfecta can be be counted), but I've spent some time with (and earned certifications from) ARC and PRC (Philippine Red Cross). I haven't done any physician shadowing.

Other (non-clinical) volunteering I have done include the following: I assisted in relief efforts for both Typhoon Ketsana and Typhoon Haiyan. When our institute caught fire (and slightly exploded due to the heat wave of 2010), I lead several fundraising activities to help refurbish the laboratories (after all I need to, my advisers lab - where I worked - took a bad hit in the fire. Reconstruction of his lab delayed me for almost year!)

As for extracurricular activities, most were church activities; I did a lot of work with Children's Liturgy. Outside of that, tutor and mentored several student from the c/o 2015 and c/o 2016. I'm also a member of the American Chemical Society (ACS).

I was an R&amp;D intern at the Department of Natural Resources and Environment for 4 months (where I worked in the organic chemistry lab and the microbiology lab). In the summer before college, I was a lifeguard at outdoor pool at a naval station in Japan where my dad was stationed. I basically watched over the kiddie pool.

I have no immediate family members in medicine. My areas of interest are pediatrics, nutrition, and infectious diseases. I have no graduate degrees, but planning to finish a certificate course online.

I hope you all can help, give advice, comments and criticism (hopefully, the constructive kind) on my current stats."

However, the job has been a pretty big disappointment and I'd like to see what I'm able to land in the job market right now.

I've been applying like crazy and have gotten several follow-ups but wanted to see if this would help at all.

Bit about myself: graduated with a degree in supply chain management and an IT minor exactly a year ago. Been working in basically a QA/ops role since then. I have 2 solid internships under my belt in supply chain and worked during school in supply chain and another job in IT.

I know it's a reach as the field demands experience, but I'd love to get into DW/BI (data warehousing/business intelligence). I've been trying to master T-SQL and the Microsoft SQL Server stack with classes through UW. I'm also teaching myself R and the big data stack of Hadoop+MapReduce+Hive. I'd say I'm pretty proficient in R but still working my way through the big data stuff. I'm a big fan and user of Tableau, so that's one thing I've been trying to really master as well. 

So with all that said, I know a business analyst role would be really nice to get a good mix of everything, but I unfortunately haven't gotten any response (call backs, interveiws) in that field of work. I've got experience with Python and can make programs/scripts pretty well. I know C++ as well, but it's been a while since I last wrote a line of code in it. Another position I'm interested in pursuing is DBA"
25jh9y,10,2014-05-14,I'm done letting weed fuck up the things I care about,I_pirate_cars,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/25jh9y/im_done_letting_weed_fuck_up_the_things_i_care/,"Sorry for the length, I just need to get this off my chest and know there are a couple people here who can empathize. To start, I just finished my freshman year in college. I was a huge stoner in high school, smoked at least a gram a day. My girlfriend didn't care that I smoked but she did not like how often I was high and was very clear about that. I considered it her being controlling and I basically told her to deal with it. I sort of felt like I had ""the upper hand"" in the relationship and didn't think anything would ever come of it. Well eventually she got fed up with that among other things and she broke up with me. I know it was a high school relationship and is something I should move on from, but I'm still not completely over it. I cared about her a lot, and whether or not it was naive and young, I loved her. I should have realized then to slow down. 

Fast forward to my freshman year of college. I smoked less as it was hard to get away with living in the dorms. But I still just always was wanting to get high, prioritizing it over my school work and social life. On top of depression I was dealing with, my constant desire to smoke weed led to (not terrible) but lower grades than I should have got and could definitely affect my acceptance into my school's business program, something I need to pursue the career I'm interested in. With regards to the depression, I was definitely self medicating. Smoking pot made it worse because I began to realize how much control it had over my life, which made me feel more worthless. So I got high to forget about it. It became a positive feedback loop of self destruction. 

I got a really good internship this summer, something I was really excited about and something that would be very beneficial to my future. This would help with my acceptance into the business school that I mentioned before, and had potential to balance out some of the shitty grades I had gotten. Well, there was a drug test for the job. I stopped smoking for a couple weeks prior to the test and was confident I would pass. Well I didn't, I was let go today.

Usually when I'm in a situation like this I would go get high and try to forget about this. But I'm done. I'm fucking sick of letting weed ruin shit that I care about. It's fucked up too many things for me and has no place in my life whatsoever. 

My dad works for the company and has some connections so it is possible I could get retested. Even if I do, I'll feel shitty doing it because I know it's kind of bullshit and pretty much nepotism. It just feels shitty knowing that my only hope of keeping this job is the fact that I ran to daddy and he got me a second chance I didn't deserve. But if I do get that chance, I'll swallow my pride and do whatever I can to fix this shit. If I continue to smoke weed, and not get help with this depression, I will continue fucking up these chances I was fortunate enough to be in a position to get in the first place. I have too much potential and too many opportunities that were just *handed* to me to not take absolute advantage of those things. If I keep smoking, I'm throwing all that away. And that's selfish. There are people that would kill to have my life, people in the world that can't even imagine having the things I take for granted on a daily basis. 

I've tried to quit before and it's been hard, I've ended up just going back into the old routine. But I have a feeling this time will be different. I have no desire to continue my pot smoking habits because it is the worst thing I can do to myself right now. If you read this far, thanks. And if anybody else even *thinks* that weed might be a problem for them, step back and really look at what your life is. I made too many excuses for myself and I saw the consequences. I'm just glad they weren't worse.

25jimx,29,2014-05-14,"Me [21 F] with my BF [26 M], Just over two years, he says mean things sometimes.",insertthrowawayword,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/25jimx/me_21_f_with_my_bf_26_m_just_over_two_years_he/,"Holy cow I didn't realize I wrote so much. Thank you in advance for reading what I have to say. I don't really have anyone else to talk to.


So here is my situation.


Me (21F) and my BF (26M)have been together for just over two years. I know he loves me, and I know I love him. There are times when we are driving and I look at him and think, I wanna have this guys babies.


 I can't see myself being with anybody but him. He does nice things for me sometimes, but he can also be mean when he's frustrated. He has a temper. He was in the army and has PTSD, which is tough to live with for him and myself. 


When we were on vacation in florida he had a pimple on his back that he couldn't reach and he asked me to pop it. I said ""ew that thing is huge I'm not touching it"" or something along those lines because it was really big and gross. And he gets mad and says ""What good are you if you can't pop a pimple"" He said sorry, but he was still frustrated. Not to mention he said this while I was rubbing aloe on his sunburned back. 


Then a couple weeks ago he had gotten a pool (one of those inflatable wall mart ones for 50 bucks) and I was helping him straighten it out so it would lay flat and ants were biting my legs and he was getting frustrated because I wasn't doing it exactly how he wanted me to do it. I had just gotten home from work. I was tired. I say to him ""you're not making it fun to have a pool right now"" and he replies ""well you're not making it very fun to have a girlfriend right now"" he apologized for saying that to.


I just get so mad at him sometimes. But other times I love him to sky and back. 


Sometimes when I get home from work he will say to me ""I'm hungry"" with a pitiful look on his face or he will ask me to make him food. He never says please, which is a big thing for me. I never ask someone to do something for me without saying please. I asked him once if he could say please more often and he replies ""you know, I think when someone says something like 'can you do...' a please is implied"" Sometimes I feel more like a mother than a girlfriend.


I ask him if he can chew with his mouth closed (he's a loud eater) and he gets frustrated and says ""you know, I can't breath when I chew with my mouth closed"" I have allergies. I haven't been able to breath through my nose for more than half my life. I'm no stranger to this situation. He just eats so fucking fast, I'll take three bites and he'll be halfway done. 


When we first started dating we were joking around in the kitchen and he said ""so you cook and clean and I'll make the money"" and sometimes when I ask him to help clean the kitchen he says ""that wasn't part of our deal"" in a cute little kid voice. Well him being in and unpaid internship wasn't part of it either.


But he has good qualities too. For the first six months of our relationship he didn't let me touch door handles. I had to make him let me let myself out of the car. He still opens it when I get in though. His dad raised him to be a gentleman. 


Now here's a bit about the sex life. He gets angrily frustrated when I say I don't want him to put his penis in my buttonhole. Like, I'm already letting you put your finger in there which I don't really care for but I know you like it so I do it anyway, isn't that enough for you? Isn't me giving everything other part of my body that I haven't given to anyone else enough for you? Sometimes it just feels like it isn't enough for him. And I don't like that. 


I just need advice from people who have seen or gone through something like this before. But mostly I think I just needed to tell someone. I don't have many friends outside of him. 

---   

**tl;dr**: BF can say mean things sometimes. It upsets me. He can't take criticism whatsoever. The things he does seem very inconsiderate sometimes. Am I being to sensitive?

I'm afraid that in about 10 years Ill be left with nothing. And Im not blaming anyone, it was my own decisions that got me here. 

As far as my job goes, I work in the library field. Lets be honest, states are cutting back on funding and things like libraries and history are the first to go. Added to that, today you can pretty much download any book onto an electronic device. This is only going to increase in the coming years. Why would someone want to borrow a book that somebody's grubby hands have been allover when they can download it and have it with them on their smart phone. I feel like I am in a dying field. Funny thing is, it isnt even the field I wanted to go into. 

When I was in college I wanted to be a history professor, get my PhD and teach. I bought into the ""do what you love"" and ""your major doesnt matter, just that you graduated"" stuff. I was doing ok but then the summer before my senior year my gf (now wife) got pregnant. I had 8 months to get my entire life together. At the time I worked part time at a museum and didnt even have a checking account. Plus I was majoring in something that wouldnt turn into a job at the end of graduation (I had been applying to PhD programs). 

I had to give up on moving across country for grad school because I didnt know what would come next with the baby situation. I was working two crappy jobs and taking 20 credit hours a quarter just to get done with school as fast as possible. ALL my savings went to doctors visits and prenatal medicine. Adding to my stress, my gf would tell me that she planned to move to California (across the country) to be with her sister (a nurse who had shacked up with a doctor twice her age) because there was ""nothing left for her here."" I asked what I was supposed to do and she said ""it isnt a big deal, you can just fly out and visit us."" She turned very cold emotionally and when I would say things like ""I love you"" she responded with ""I dont care."" It was a dark place for me. 

I was trying to figure out what to do with a useless history degree and the department head said that I should go into archives. She said the pay was comparable to teachers and I could go into the school's archive grad program and I would definitely get a job. Mind you, her paycheck was dependent on me signing up for the program. 

I was freaking out about what to do with my life to secure a future for my unborn child and wife, so I went into the field. I got paid internship working at a federal facility nearby. My wife graduated with a nursing degree but decided she didnt want to go into nursing, nope, she only wanted to work part-time as a cashier at the grocery store. So I am supporting three people while making $32k a year. She still does this. I have tried to ask her to get a job that makes a better salary, or isnt for high schools, I mean she graduated magna cum laude. But nope, she just shuts down and tells me that she likes what she does and that its a good job and ""if thats the way I fell, I should take some time to think if I *really* want to be a part of this family."" WTF?!?

I didnt change career fields at the time because my boss at the internship place like my work and said that he was going to get a slot for me to be a full time researcher and in that program they would pay for my PhD. So I stuck with it thinking things were finally coming together. 

Well, then the recession hit and most of the nearby PhD programs shut down. Added to that, the slot I was supposed to get was earmarked for someone who already had their PhD or were close to finishing (ABD). So I was out of luck in that regards. Since there wasnt a future for me there, I was essentially told to move on after I finished the grad degree, which was very shortly thereafter. 

I got a two year grant position back at the university I graduated from. In that time my wife came down with depression and anxiety. She is very much a person who has to be in control of everything (I cant even do the dishes or laundry because I ""wont do them correctly."" I think a lot of her issues stem from her dad who was, I guess, emotionally abusive toward her and her sister (hence the sister dating a doctor the same age as her parents). Her dad is a major ass towards me. he had told her that I was going to leave her (which I had never planned to) and that I was cheating on her when I was spending nights working on grad school papers and working 40 hours a week (I wasnt cheating). Added to that, he convinced her to not let our son have my last name (because I would run out on the family, I guess). 

So Im working in the grant funded position and like everyday I get a call from my wife telling me that she wants to kill herself, this makes life really stressful. She is on medication now. I was luckily after the grant ended to get a job at the library, which I suck at because my grad program sucked. I dont know if the job is going to be here long because of budget cuts and since the library can get old retired ladies to do this stuff for free. 

Basically, my wife is emotionally and physically distant from me. She doesnt like giving hugs or kisses or saying love you, or anything like that. She says I bother her when we sleep together so I have slept on a couch every night for the past 9 years. I cant talk with her about these issues (job, her not being affectionate) because she shuts down and thinks Im verbally attacking her--this comes from her father I think. We have no money because I support everything on a crappy salary. Our kitchen table is held together with duct tape, I dont own a smart phone, the tv we have is the same fat back crt I bought before college in 2000. The only house I could afford was back in my very small hometown (all my friends have since left) and Im underwater on an $80k house. I dont have any friends (I think Ive always been the ""casual friend"" who was never truly part of the group). 

I am worried that as soon as my son goes off to college my wife will tell me she has to ""spread her wings and fly"" and move off to California with her sister where she will shack up with some doctor and live her dream life. Meanwhile I will be stuck in a small town and deadend job that is not marketable and no real prospects for the future. 

Basically, every decision Ive made in life has been wrong. The guys who majored in finance or engineering have amazing lives and can enjoy things, go on vacations, all that stuff. Im not financially secure, I dont know what is going to happen in ten years with my marriage, I am just worried."

I have been researching a lot and I read all the ""Developing for the rift;Where to start?"" thread on the subreddit, and I just want a reality check: I know and understand programming principle, I know Java from a class and Objective C from the Big Nerd Ranch book. I have never opened a game engine. My question for you guys is: is it realistic to believe that I can create a small demo, for the rift with my current knowledge and learning C++,Python and Unreal Engine 4?

I have heard that once you know a language, it is at least easier to learn another one (C++ and Python in my case )

25kdlg,4,2014-05-14,Millennials in the Insurance industry - Q&amp;A,monroe23,Insurance,https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/comments/25kdlg/millennials_in_the_insurance_industry_qa/,"My most recent blog post:

Let’s face it, for millennials – anyone born roughly between 1980 and 2000 – the insurance industry is not typically regarded as the most exciting career path to follow. But much of this is based on a lack of awareness and misinformation about the realities of working in the industry. I caught up with Derek Dow, Assistant Vice President at Integro Insurance Brokers, to get his firsthand perspective on what it’s like to be a millennial in the industry.

So, what they say really true? Do most people end up working in the insurance industry because they have a family connection to the business or because they simply ‘fell into it’?

DD: In my personal experience, that was true, to an extent. I studied finance and accounting in university, and interned one summer with a forensic accounting firm that worked a lot with insurance companies.  Although I had never specifically planned to work in the insurance sector, I was always focused on a career in financial services. But, as a business major, most of the careers I was exposed to were the more traditional banking and accounting opportunities.

Why did you choose insurance over those other career paths?

DD: I had the chance to intern for a large multinational insurance company in my final summer of university. What I found most surprising was how no two days were ever the same. I was able to use a wide variety of skills – interpersonal, analytical, networking, and so on – while still able to draw upon the business acumen I had learned in school. Since I was never pigeonholed into doing only a bunch of repetitive tasks, my job never got boring. That’s when I knew I was in the right career.

What’s surprised you the most about the industry?

DD: The sheer size of the industry was shocking to me. I feel like for most people, insurance is something you mainly think about for your car or your home. I didn’t really appreciate what a large portion of the financial services sector is represented by the insurance industry because of how little mainstream attention it receives.

On that note, how do you think the insurance industry can better attract millennials away from the more traditional financial services roles in banking and accounting?

DD: With little to no real world experience, most millennials form opinions of different careers using rough estimations of what people tell them – be it parents, classmates, recruiters, etc. For careers in insurance to join that conversation, companies need to do a better job of educating students on what their career path in the industry could look like. I’ve witnessed a push towards this in the last five years with increased on-campus recruitment and dedicated insurance career fairs, but there is still room for improvement. Volunteering to speak at campus engagements, formalizing internship programs, and mentoring are all opportunities for organizations, big or small, to connect with the next generation.

Recruiting is one thing, but retention is equally, if not more important to building a strong workforce. How does the industry manage to retain its young talent?

DD: In my experience, this industry is a real meritocracy. While tenure and experience can work to your advantage, particularly in client facing roles, I don’t think they are determining factors in one’s career success and, ultimately, you get what you put in. There is definitely the opportunity for a great work-life balance in this business, but those who put the extra effort and go the extra mile are usually rewarded for doing so. The fact is, given the ageing demographics of the workforce today, senior leaders are looking for young people to step up and take more responsibility. In my mind, that is a fantastic motivator to keep ambitious people engaged.

You bring up an interesting point.  Stats show that almost 25% of Canada’s insurance sector workforce is expected to retire between 2007 and 2017, and the numbers are similar in much of the US and Europe. How do you think this dynamic affects today’s workplace for millennials?

DD: I’d say the wealth of experience these seasoned professionals have to share is an amazing chance for millennials to learn the business. Many of these people are extremely busy but, in my experience, they are also overwhelmingly willing to mentor and develop newcomers. Sure, with such a big age gap there are generational differences. We grew up on the internet so it’s no surprise that most millennials prefer sending emails over picking up the phone. But, along with our iPhones, we bring fresh perspectives to an industry that could use some innovation. These dynamics create a rare opportunity for our generation to shape what the industry will look like over the next 20 to 30 years.

That’s a good observation. Is there any last piece of advice you’d like to share with millennials who are preparing to enter the workforce?

DD: Take the time to research and understand what different career paths look like, and see how that lines up with your skills and interests.  Above all else, a successful career is one you enjoy.

25klv8,0,2014-05-14,The Legendary Un-aired Episode of Countdown,[deleted],comedywriting,https://www.reddit.com/r/comedywriting/comments/25klv8/the_legendary_unaired_episode_of_countdown/,"
What follows is a fragment of a transcript of an episode of Countdown, which was considered so entertaining that it could never possibly be broadcast, in case people never got over the shock and expected this standard of television every week. The BBC have denied all rumours of its existence, but due to the bitterness of an underpaid and ignored intern, we have managed to acquire this small excerpt.

Nick Hewer: ‘‘So, now we hand you over to Susie in the Dictionary Corner to explain the origin of today’s phrase, one I’ve enjoyed using at countless football games whenever a player has had one too many late night take-aways : ‘’Get your tits out for the lads’ ‘’.

Susie Dent: ‘’ Definitely a phrase I’ve heard quite a few times in my life!’’
(Polite Laughter from all, one or two admiring glances at her chest.   Rachel Riley surreptitiously adjusts her dress around the bosom.)

‘’This phrase has quite a storied upbringing. During World War II, the development of safe methods of encrypting messages became vitally important to the war effort, and all sorts of devious ways were devised in order to safeguard important information. However, these mainly applied to information via radio, and when meeting another operative in person, the old methods of hiding secret messages up your backside quickly became redundant as any captured spy would simply have it removed. Also, the German spy network also had an uncanny ability to guess the passwords used by British Intelligence to ascertain whether the person they were meeting clandestinely were not German spies, they being predominantly based on the names of female characters in the Biggles series of adventure books.
Nick Hewer: ‘’ If only they had used the Flashman books, they would never have guessed. That man was a philanderer without parallel.’’

Susie Dent : ‘’Indeed. This tricky situation led to the startling and ingenious idea that fingers, which have very individual and unique patterns, have an even more useful counterpart in this area, the nipples, or more correctly, the areolas of nipples.

The areolas of nipples have little bumps on their surfaces, called Montgomery glands or areolar skin glands. Their function is partially unknown, but scientists suppose they secrete a liquid that lubricates the nipple/areola area. These little bumps create a ‘fingerprint’, unique to each individual. Each agent would then be assigned a number, based on the sum of the distances from the centre of the nipple to the five largest Montgomery Glands, excluding those on the rim of the areola. This then would be verified by the agent arranging the meeting, by measuring these distances with a callipers and cross checking with the number given to them by MI6 for that agent. The reason why nipples were chosen as opposed to fingerprints were the fact that very few situations call for the bare nipple to be exposed, making it difficult to measure the distances involved without being noticed whereas fingerprints can be obtained more easily. This practice of lifting one’s shirt at the beginning of a meeting became known as ‘Saluting the Fuhrer’, and then more colloquially, ’getting your bits out for the Queen’.
It was only after the War had ended, with the advent of free love and the widespread availability of the Pill that attitudes towards sexuality and sex began to change sufficiently enough that the phrase ‘Get your bits out for the Queen’ could evolve into ‘Get your tits out for the Queen’, the former being thought too stuffy and old hat for that generations swinging new hipsters.

Finally, the pit strikes in the Thatcher era put an end to the phrase in this form, the Queen being damned by association with the ruling Establishment elite. A bold move to reclaim the phrases for the working classes was initiated by no less than Arthur Scargill, who is credited with the first recorded use of the phrase in a speech he gave to a miner’s union in Pontypridd, Wales, in which he recalls all the brave men and women who ’got their tits out for the lads’ to save Britain from Hitler and his hordes of Nazis, and ‘who would stand up and get their tits out for the lads, in this, our most dire hour of need.’
Nick Hewer:’’ An interesting story indeed.  Would I be correct in saying the feminists in the Seventies used the saying as a symbol of male oppression against women, and staged a campaign based on this? I’m reasonably sure something like that happened.’’

Rachel Riley:’’ Oh yeah, I remember my Mum showing me pictures of her and her friends protesting outside a football match with a banner that said ‘Oi!! Fattie!! Get YOUR tits out for the lads’, and them jumping on random lone football fans and pulling their tops off in order to show them what it felt like to be treated like an object. There is even a photograph of my Mum being baton charged, and two protesters lying atop a policeman and suffocating him by squashing his face into their enormous bosoms, supposedly asking him ‘how did he like them now’. Bless.’’

(Again, polite laughter all round, and again one or two admiring glances at Susie Dent’s chest, which she catches and acknowledges with an embarrassed giggle. Rachel Riley stares daggers at her, and mouths the word ‘bitch’ quietly, but not quietly enough as her microphone picks it up.)

Nick Hewer:’’ That was an entertaining story indeed. And now, onto the final letters round of the day. Over to you, Rachel....’’

I have 10k currently saved after spending 4k on expenses like loan repayment,helping parents out, gas/food/toll, and insurance. By the end of co-op i will have 6k taken out of my combined paychecks. From what i hear from my friend who does professional tax returns is that i will receive majority of that money back since i am a college student and it was a college program.

I am currently holding the money as an emergency fund for my family as my family isn't in best income situation. 

Here is my expense/debt/income situation

1. Paying off credit card more than monthly. 721 credit score 1.5 years ago and hoping it went up after i kept up with credit cards and payed off private school loan. ( Current $140 credit card)

2. Graduate in may 2015 with projected 30-35k in federal loans(mix of both sub and unsub).

3. Possible 65k job offer in one year?

4. Drive a 16 year old car with 104k miles on it. Runs ok but has $700 needed for repairs. I paid 1700 for it in Dec 2013 with 98k miles. 

5. Car insurance is 1800 yearly(liability)

Just started learning about investment and want to start early in saving for retiring. 

Should i invest in roth ira now or wait till i get full job offer first?

My dilemma is what should i do with my potential 15-18k that i will have by end of graduation in one year? ( working during the school year that covers expenses like food/phone bill. Rent is covered through school since i will be now living offcampus which is cheaper than on-campus.

I looked at the links on the side and wanted to know what you guys would do if you were in my situation. I see myself as someone who is good in handeling money especially since i grew up in a household with a combined income of ~30k and do not know fully how to approach finance like colleagues at work. They have been giving me tips but, i still cautious.

I have the temptation to buy things like a new car but hesitating because i might make a bad decision?

Thanks in advance. I am thinking big picture like investing max contributions every year in IRA and company 401k.

I'm both worthless with and without Adderall. It's the reason I'm so irritable, emotional, discontent, and unhappy- to list a few.

I can't get out of bed without taking my pills. Then once I'm ""up"" and past the funny heart flutters, I dedicate my ""energy"" to meaningless ""self - improvement"" shit where I scour through 20 tabs of a mix of nose job reviews, local boot camps for exercise, hairstyles on Pinterest, recipes for starting my dogs on homecooked meals, volunteer opportunities, and before and afters of Invisalign patients. Have I followed up on any of these exhausting searches? No.

I'm a 25 year old married woman who just graduated with my bachelors. I've been on Adderall since I was 17. I complained to my psychiatrist that I had zero motivation in regards to studying, so he paired my Prozac with Adderall. Adderall was my life saver- it's how I finished my bachelor's with a 4.0. I've never been good about taking my Prozac, even after all these years. Adderall was enough for me, it was my happy pill. Adderall isn't so bad when I'm out and busy- like when I was doing my internships or taking classes. I've hated my love for the pills for a few years now, but it's definitely worse with the more down time I'm having since I graduated.

I know how stupid I am for not taking my Prozac. It's probably the reason I feel the way I do. I don't know why I'm so stupid about it. I get so frustrated with my husband when he forgets his daily anti-depressant. ""You can't just forget it, babe. You'll send your body out of whack- it knows it's missing something."" I also understand how important it is to practice cognitive therapy- ""whenever a negative thought creeps into your head you HAVE to make the conscious decision to push it out and think of something positive."" I'm this big dumb hypocrite.

I can barely stand up in the shower without my Adderall, my life revolves around it, yet I don't give a shit about my Prozac.

I can't be social without my adderall, but I don't feel like my true self with it, and if I don't take it I don't have the energy to be social. It's a bull shit cycle. I don't even know who I am without it because I don't let myself go without it because how else am I supposed to walk down the stairs and engage in conversation?

I guess I'm just wondering if anyone else has been here. I feel so weak and powerless and lazy and gross.

25ljs0,9,2014-05-14,I dread my birthday every year because all it does is remind me of how empty my life is.,Figbunz,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/25ljs0/i_dread_my_birthday_every_year_because_all_it/,"**tl;dr: Emotionally neglectful childhood bred a very lonely, empty adult who worries about her ability to make meaningful connections with others.**

Tomorrow, May 15, 2014, I turn 22 years old and I've never had a birthday party. It's been probably 10 years since I got a birthday gift from anyone in my family. Since I never had a party, few people outside of my family ever knew my birthday, so I never got many gifts or well-wishes from anyone. I remember in like 10th grade, coming to school expecting my years-long friends to know it was my birthday, and it wasn't until a teacher called me out that they realized it. It hurt my feelings, but not a lot. I mean, I made it 16 years without anyone caring about my birthday, so why should it change then? It's weird to think that I went to birthday parties all the time as a kid, gave other kids gifts and cards every year, but it never occurred to me that I could have, should have had the same things for myself. But I guess I never felt special enough to warrant that kind of attention.

I remember-- from childhood all the way through high school-- listening for my mom's car to arrive home so I could run downstairs and catch her as she came into the house, desperate for five or so minutes of her attention before she disappeared into her room and me back into mine. I felt silly having to corner my mom for her attention, but I inexplicably did it every day. I had four siblings but we never interacted. I cooked my own meals from grade school until high school when my mom's boyfriend moved in and she started cooking again. I guess you could say I lived the first 18 years of my life ""alone in a crowded room."" In the summer, I could have disappeared for days on end and nobody would have noticed. I know this is true because I spent whole days on end alone in my room, completely undisturbed, unacknowledged even if I passed a sibling on the way to the kitchen or bathroom. I had a few ""school friends"" but I might have seen them once or twice throughout the whole summer.

The worst part is, I didn't know how wrong all this was as I lived it. I thought that everybody lived like I did. You see stuff on TV and in school about physical/sexual/mental abuse, but not a lot on neglect, and virtually nothing on the type of neglect I experienced. I don't know how else to describe it except that I wasn't really... loved? Valued? Nurtured, I think is the word I'm looking for. How is a child supposed to know she's special if nobody tells her? Spends time with her? Teaches her how to share herself with others?

I spent half of today agonizing over whether or not I should text people and invite them to go to the bar with me tomorrow. How could I possibly demand that much attention from people? How could I ask people to go out of their way to see *me* just because it'll be May 15? I'd die before I made a facebook event. *""How conceited would I have to be to do that?""* I think as if I didn't go to 20 birthday parties this year that all had facebook events created by the birthday girl/guy and thought nothing of it. And then I think, *""It's not like anyone would come, anyway.""*

This is my problem. Or the result of all my problems, or something. I can't shake the feeling that I'm not worthless. I don't know how to describe it. Like I know I'm a decent person and a productive member or society, but I'm just not special, just not a part of society.

Sometimes, I feel so alien that I want to scream, but I don't know if anyone would understand me if I tried to explain it, not that I could bear to burden someone's time with my stupid problems. From the outside, I look normal. I'm clean, averagely-attractive, succeeding in school and work. I want so intensely for people to like me, to think I'm normal, to be my friend like I see other people being friends. What kills me is that people in my program (about 110 people in my class) see me as fairly popular-- I can walk up to anyone and talk to them, everyone knows who I am, I got elected to a committee, all that jazz-- but I feel like nobody really knows me. Probably 10 people have my phone number. It blows my mind to think that people just text each other for fun, because they're bored and want to talk to each other. I guess there's so many people out there that nobody really needs to talk to *me*. 

I'm slowly getting better at recognizing my own worth-- every month, I feel like I'm getting better-- but as I become more comfortable with the idea of being worthy of getting close to people, another deep-rooted insecurity crops up: Do I even have the emotional capacity to be close to people?

I would describe my baseline feeling as ""emptiness."" I'm almost totally incapable of processing intense feelings on either side of the spectrum. Anything you'd expect to incite an especially positive or negative reaction short-circuits me straight back to emptiness, with just a hint of the appropriate emotion. Death of my father? Emptiness, kinda sad. Accepted into my years-long-goal program? Emptiness, kinda happy. Got the internship? Got dumped? Friend tried to commit suicide? Lost my virginity? My birthday? Emptiness, kinda _____. Then I realize that I *should* have more feeling about those things and I get just upset enough that I can feel cripplingly ashamed and self-conscious. Shame and self-consciousness are two of the emotions I'm capable of feeling intensely, the others being anger and guilt.

I'm so desperate for affection/attention but also so afraid of it. What do you even do when somebody loves you?? I'm just normal enough to get KINDA close to somebody, but then I balk and either sabotage the relationship or distance myself. I get cold feet just trying to make friends with someone (how even do you do that, become legitimate friends with people?), let alone when I date a guy. I sincerely don't want a boyfriend just because I don't want to shit on some good man because I'm too emotionally unavailable to have an adult relationship.

Will I feel this way for my entire life, or can I learn to feel? Did I miss the boat when I was developing and those abilities are gone forever, or can I still become... totally human, I guess? Can I be just like everyone else and have normal friendships and relationships? Next year, could I make a facebook event inviting people to celebrate my birthday with me?

I can't really say that I love anyone or that I'm confident anyone loves me, at this point. I say I want friends but at the same time, I'm very ""out of sight, out of mind."" I can't bring myself to make the first move in trying to meet up with people because I feel guilty asking for their attention and self-conscious about putting myself out there. And like always before, nobody is gonna go out of their way to include me. Friendship is a two-way street and I can't figure out how to navigate either lane. I could probably go the rest of my life without talking to my family and not miss them. Not in a malicious way, I just don't care about them and they don't care about me. I think I'm mostly fine with that, except I do resent my mother especially for neglecting me so. Not so much because I suffered at the time, but because I'm suffering now and I may suffer forever because she didn't teach me how to love.

I feel like I'm going to miss out on all the best things in life. What do I have to live for if I can't love? I would never kill myself (for some reason-- nothing really is stopping me but I just *know* I wouldn't do it) but what's the point of life if I can't make friends or fall in love? If I can't even feel proud of my accomplishments? Am I just going to keep coasting by on nothingness, hit all the milestones of life and feel nothing, build a family I have no idea how to be a part of? I don't have any answers.

25lv4i,2,2014-05-15,Could use some advice,Gilad1,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/25lv4i/could_use_some_advice/,"So without giving more personal information that needed, here is the situation.

I live in St. Louis, MO.  I'm very interested in IT audit and am pursing a double degree and a minor.  My degrees are in Accounting and Accounting Systems and Forensics with a minor in Information Systems.  I will have 150 hours when the fall semester ends and I am currently involved with my local ISACA chapter and state CPA society.  The only work experience I have is with a law firm that I helped digitalize for a year as well as have the owner show me around the law field since I was considering going to law school at one point and work study jobs.  I am sitting for the CISA in June.  My GPA overall and with both of my majors is around the mid point of 3.1 and 3.2.  My GPA in my minor is a 4.0.

This spring I applied to many places for internships and entry level positions for IT audit, Internal Audit, and External Audit.  This resulted in a total of 5 businesses that gave me interviews with 3 of them going to the final phases of the interview processes.  I did not get a single offer.

Recently I applied to more places for entry level positions and a few part time jobs.  One included a part-time job as a bank teller that they didn't even want to interview me for.  I'm still waiting to hear back on the rest.

Now then, with all of this information given, I could really use some advice // insight on what it means.  I've been a bit bummed out lately because I just feel like no matter what I do, I'm just getting rejected.  Interviews I felt went very well with the places that resulted in final phase interviews, The interviews lasted about an hour each with me taking about 15-30 minutes asking them questions and the interviewers taking about 30-45 minutes to ask me questions.  The 2 that did not proceed to go into final phases I did not interview very well for because I didn't have much interview experience and had little to ask even though I researched the company beforehand because I wasn't sure what I should ask.

Questions that have been circling my mind:
Is my GPA too low?  Is it because I don't have a degree yet?  Is there something wrong with my personality(I know this one can't be answered here)?  What is it that is going so wrong for me that nobody wants me for anything.  I can't even get an interview for a teller position.

Everything I hear from people in this area and all I really hear are: There is a greater demand than supply for IT auditors, it's pretty easy to get into the field, you're doing everything right to start your career, you're doing more than most people are doing at your grade level, etc...

I'm just feel depressed at this point.  If any of that were true, why is it that I can't get an offer and get the constant rejections.

Can anybody help me out on this?

Apologies for how long this is and if it doesn't make a lot of sense.  It's late for me to be typing this and after a long day of work (My workstudy is continuing through the summer before I'm no longer able to work there), dealing with people in regards to my birthday (I woke up with the teller rejection this morning, was a great start), and studying for my summer courses + CISA exam... it's been a rather exhausting day.  I hope this makes sense, I could really use some help here.  I'm not giving up on the job search, just it's depressing to get told basically all positives and have job searches come back all negatives.  It really makes me feel like there is something wrong with me that is causing businesses to reject me.  Let alone the stress of graduating at the end of the year and job prospects are looking bleak based off of this.

At this point I'm just rambling and I'm going to end this massive text wall now.  I'm honestly appreciative of anyone who reads all of this and can offer me any advice.

Thank you for your time,
Long time subreddit lurker."
25lwrk,3,2014-05-15,I'm [21 F] finding myself constantly pissed off at my [21 M] boyfriend,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/25lwrk/im_21_f_finding_myself_constantly_pissed_off_at/,"And I hate it. We have been together officially for about three months (coincidentally the time period in which all of my past relationships have ended for one reason or another), but we've been seeing each other for eight months. I'll try to break this down for the sake of readability...sorry it's still going to be a short novel.

**Some context on him**:
He's five months younger than myself. He is the first guy I've been in a relationship with for almost three years. He's the youngest in his family after three sisters and the only boy, so he's used to being catered to quite a bit. His dad is a doctor and his mom is a nurse. I'm really hoping you guys will be able to connect the dots from here.  

**The good times**:
We were originally supposed to be friends with benefits, by his suggestion. At the time, I was looking for a serious relationship, but found myself in a dry spell, so I went along with it. As time passes, we spend more time together outside of his apartment; I'm hanging out with his friends, he's hanging out with mine and we find out that we actually have a lot in common. As we grew more comfortable around each other, things were fantastic. I was able to be myself, in all of my respective weirdness, around him and vice versa. About a month and a half into the official relationship, he tells me he loves me. I didn't return the sentiment at the time, not because I didn't have those feelings for him but because I wanted to be absolutely sure before I said it. I told him I loved him about a month later. 

**The problem (Brace yourself, it's long)**:
It started getting bad about three weeks ago. I planned to spend dead week with him at his apartment; this was pretty common, I spend a lot of time over there. I would usually clean his apartment for him while he was in class or studying at the library (because I wanted to and I enjoy cleaning). I had an attitude this week because we both deep cleaned it about four days before I came over that week. The place was spotless. I get to his place and I literally can't see his floor, he has three open Oreo boxes *in the bed*, a considerable stack of pizza boxes on his dresser and two full garbage bags next to his overflowing trash can. As irked as I am, I clean anyway. I chose not to say anything about it this time just because I would usually tease him for being messy and it was close to finals week, so I laid off. Throughout the rest of that week, I found myself finding his jokes thoroughly annoying and unfunny, mainly because I started to notice that he will either piggyback or totally copy my jokes...and repeat them. To save myself from sounding like a self-absorbed bitch who tells her boyfriend he's unfunny, I just chuckle and move on, but it's now almost impossible to smile when he makes a joke. I'm upset because the teasing that I used to love in the good times is now sending me over the edge in the complete opposite direction. Think obnoxious younger brother behavior and that's his sense of humor as I perceive it. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - -
When we were FWBs we would have sex twice a day, good sex. Even when we started dating officially, we would still go after each other. Lately, I hardly ever want to have sex; 99 percent of the time he initiates and about 60 percent of the time I actually respond. To twist the knife a little deeper, it doesn't feel that great anymore unless I drink. This week, he came over to my place to hang out. We were both on the couch just playing video games on our respective laptops. He would try to gently scratch my head or rub my shoulders, because I usually enjoy that, and I reacted like an old cat. 

**Why this is a problem**:
I love the kid. He's the first person in two years who I've been this comfortable around. He's smart, funny and sincere. He holds my hand in public, brags about me to his parents, and buys me gifts every once in a while just because. In hindsight, I should have probably spoken about this to someone before it got this bad, but I don't think it's right or just to talk poorly of your SO to other people. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yet, I feel like if I don't just rage on someone about him, I will snap and lose it at my SO over something stupid. It almost happened already! (WoW references ahead) We were playing together and because we were in a group we had to roll for this super rare piece of loot. He knew I needed it because the stats of the loot were specific for my class, not his. Instead of passing, he rolled and ended up winning the loot. It was soulbound, so he couldn't trade it with me. I immediately shut my laptop, packed my things, flipped him off and left. I don't even react that way when I'm playing with my friends!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm sickened with myself for how I've been toward him and I desperately want to overcome this. I know that he does so much right, but all I can see is what he does wrong. Even when he makes an effort to fix his behavior, he still manages to annoy me somehow. I feel guilty and depressed about the whole situation.



---   
**tl;dr**: I love my boyfriend, but he also makes me want to punch him in the face...all the time. How do I overcome this? Am I just being an over-analytical douche? How do I not be an over-analytical douche?

- - - - - -- - - -
EDIT: Just remembered a pivotal piece of information: we both live in Oklahoma, however, he's staying here for school. His permanent residence is in Texas. I'm moving to Florida in a couple of weeks for an internship. Depending on whether or not the company (a certain Fortune 500 company ran by a Mouse) I'm working for is offering me a permanent position, I may or may not permanently live in Florida. He has no desire to live anywhere outside of Texas. I mention this because when I brought all of this to my mother's attention, she told me that I was subconsciously trying to sabotage the relationship to make the decision to move easier. Just something else for your consideration. "
25mepk,5,2014-05-15,[Question]Need advice on following a true cut cycle,sumayah83,xxfitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/25mepk/questionneed_advice_on_following_a_true_cut_cycle/,"Hey Reddit.


After a long break from weight training I started lifting weights 3 months ago, using the starting strength program as a guide.  When I started I struggled with just the bar, but I have made some great gains in the short time I’ve been lifting.  (Squat 110#, Bench 80#, Deadlift 135#, overhead press 60#). I’ve incorporated a long weekend hike (8-10 miles) and some running during the week into my routine as well.  I believe I have put on about 7 pounds of muscle (my weight has gone up from 183 to 190, while my clothes haven’t gotten any tighter and my measurements have stayed the same).

I’ve been happy with the gains but starting next week I’m moving to a new city and starting a 12 week summer internship which will have me traveling Monday through Thursday. Most of the hotels I’ll be staying in will not have a great gyms, so I would like to focus on a cut cycle. I have quite a bit of fat to loose and I think i’ll have a better chance of loosing fat via diet and cardio then continuing trying to make strength gains. I’ll be backpacking through New Zealand January-March and every pound of fat I loose is more I can carry in my pack and farther on the trail I can go in a day.

I have used my fitness pal to closely track my food intake, though not since I started lifting weights. I’d love detailed advice on how to follow a true cut cycle (not just a crash diet). This internship is going to keep me very busy (70 hours a week), so I need to eat enough of the right foods while being on the road that I have the energy and the mental clarity to rock it.

Any advice would be appreciated!  This is my first post so if I have missed any important information, please let me know. 

Stats:
Height: 5’8
Weight: 189 (as of this morning)
Resting Metabolic Rate: 1757 
Diet: Gluten and dairy free (I get really sick, not just a fad diet)"
25mi1n,2,2014-05-15,A Couple of Beginner Questions.,GodWhenDrunk,laravel,https://www.reddit.com/r/laravel/comments/25mi1n/a_couple_of_beginner_questions/,"Hi guys, i'm making a application on my internship and wanted some guidance, super new in laravel/php and angularjs/javascript. Sorry for the english in advance.

The application:

* 3 ""modules""(mini-apps) -&gt; Clients, Providers, Personal.

* Basically 3 CRUDs.

* Each module with a 3/4 tables.

* The modules don't share a single table.

* AngularJs as front-end.

* Single Page application.

* I'm using laravel as a RESTfull api (i think lol), passing json to angular.

The modules would have also different access levels for each user.(read/write/none). 

Lets take for instance the Clients module, in there i have 2 tables, companies and users.  A company has many users, so, my SPA would be a filled form at the top of the page with the company info and a dropdown of all companies, a table with info on all the users from the selected company.

note: I already had most of this implemented but without javascript.

Questions:

* The way i first made this i had a lot of controllers(one for each model, with some exceptions), i'm guessing this is way too much controllers, how should i improve this? 

* Also i had one model for each table, am i doing this wrong? (I'm using namespace to keep things organized but still, a lot of models and controllers)

* With the lot of controllers configuration i had a json return for my tables. Again, using the users/clients example, it is possible for organizing my SPA passing the json for all my users and sort with angular or should i pass a json with all the users from the selected company?

* Should i make a SPA for each module or a huge SPA?

* How should i handle routing, on angular or on laravel? ATM i have a Route::resource for each controller. 

note:I'm making the laravel part of the app first.

I’m back with the possibility of 2014 schedule wallpapers.  If you don’t remember what I did last year or maybe you weren’t on this sub yet, [here is what I did](http://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/1m3m1j/im_2_games_late_but_the_wallpapers_are_finally/).  I didn’t want to copy my last design.  So far these are just ideas, but I’m posting them here to get feedback from the community.  [Here are some quick ones I threw together](http://imgur.com/a/PhtpS).  The first two have players, but then I started playing with the idea of having pictures of team stadiums/crowds instead.  I like the crowd design more so far.  I also used all mascot logos for the schedules last year and haven’t decided if I will do that again or just use normal team logos this year.

I plan on trying to make a wallpaper for every Division I FBS team.  I believe there are 129?  I made extra teams last year that were outside of the Div I list.  If your team isn’t a Div I FBS team then let me know if you would like a wallpaper.  I will have a list of teams to do once I get through the Div I’s.

Unfortunately, there is a chance that I won’t be creating these, which is why I said “possibility.”  I got a big summer internship this year and will be starting it next week.  For obvious reasons the internship will take priority over creating these.  But I feel confident that I can do both, so no worries!  

These should be done by the end of August right before the first games of the season.

TLDR: Maybe wallpaper?

Edit:  I will be going with the stadium style wallpaper.  If you have a stadium picture that you think would be good for your school then post it.  It helps me out a lot because I might not pick the best one.  Preferably good quality so I can resize it well."

25n782,5,2014-05-15,"Me [23 M] with my exgirlfriend [23 F] for 4.5 years, broke up 2 months ago. She's seeing my good friend now a week after the break up",HappeningTOme,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/25n782/me_23_m_with_my_exgirlfriend_23_f_for_45_years/,"Let me first start this by giving a little back story. I have known this girl since 3rd grade but did not start dating her until 5 years ago when we both started college. This was my first ""real"" relationship and I fell in love with her instantly, and it was reciprocated. 

The relationship took off full force and it was healthy. We lived together pretty much from day one and we both loved every minute of it. We had our ups and downs but we always got through them because we knew our relationship was worth it. I am an engineering student and as I got deeper in my coursework, we were spending more and more time away from each other. I got lazy because all I could think about was school even when I was with her. We always had a plan and I told her that things will be different when I graduate and I will have a more stable schedule. It's not like I wanted to think about school either when I was with her, she was the most important thing in my life and I just tried to make her realize that I was doing this for us but all she wanted was a less distant and depressed version of me. 

Last summer I noticed things changed between us when I left for 3 months for a summer internship. When I came back I noticed this person who got along just fine without me and that hurt. We got in a big fight over it but made up like the usual. She apologized a couple weeks later and told me that she is her best when I am around and she is happiest when she is with me. 

By this point in our relationship (4 years), we were more of companions. We shared bills, had 2 pets and a place, very similar to a married couple which was never a problem because that's what we wanted all along anyway.  

Now fast forward to March 14th. We are on our way home from spring break and I reach over to put my hand on her knee and she snaps and tells me not to touch her. I reach over and put my hand on her back and ask her what’s bothering her and she starts crying. I had no clue what was coming, I just thought I did something wrong and she was upset about that. She told me she hasn't felt romantic feelings in a long time (3 months) and she needed time and space. The worst part about this was we were stuck in a traffic jam for 2 hours. She said she couldn't empathize anymore with me about school and that it took a toll on her. 

We finally get back home and she goes to stay with her sister. We had fights before and terms like “space and time,” were thrown out there but we always made up and things were good after that, but this time I knew it was for real. I didn’t want to be alone so I called my friend to come pick me up and asked if I could stay with him for a while. This friend will come up later in the story but for now let’s call him Judas. Judas was one of my closest friends in school and he was there for me initially. The next day another one of my friends caught me after work and told me to come stay with him and his girlfriend. He said he went through something similar and he wanted to help me through this. We talked and he had some good advice. He told me to cut contact with her and give her what she wants and if it works out it does but if it doesn't then not talking to her with make it easier to move on. 

That was just it; I didn't want to move on. I am a fighter; I fought for her every other time so what makes this any different? So I texted her. I was an emotional wreck, I swear to her it seemed like I was bipolar. Back and forth between apologizing and asking her if we can work it out and then getting angry then apologizing some more. I was mess. I went out and tried to have fun to keep my mind off of her. I fooled around with some other girls and that was fun but I still felt like shit. I didn't text her for a month and I could start to see myself feeling better. I still wanted to be with her and was hoping that she would text me that she missed me and we could start over. 

Okay, so now it’s May 4th, the day after I graduated. I was feeling like the fucking man until I got a text from Judas telling me that he and my ex have had a thing going that he waited until after graduation to tell me so I didn't fail my classes and that nothing happened during our relationship and he realizes our friendship was over. I was heated so what did I do, I texted her. A bunch of really just awful texts about betrayal and name calling.  I really couldn't believe that this was happening to me. 

I really could have written a novel about this but I decided to leave out some details. Here is where I am now. Call me stupid but I still want her. I feel like I can forgive her for everything because I believe this person is the one I belong with. I can’t make her feel any way she doesn't want to but I feel I messed up by taking some jabs at her and hurting her. Non-emotional and betrayed me, never wanted to hurt her and I just want to tell her I am sorry for saying the things I did. I texted her last week to tell her that I wanted to sit and talk with her and clear up some things that were said and she replied that after everything I said to her, she really doesn't want to see me again. I told her I understand but if she changes her mind to let me know. I've only known Judas for 2 years so he is easily forgettable but I've known her since I was 9 and took my anger out on the wrong person. I really don’t what to do or how to feel.

TL;DR: Been with a girl for 4.5 years, broke up 2 months ago, found out she is seeing my friend now, said some stuff I regret, want to make it right. "
25n7zu,1,2014-05-15,On External Cravings vs. Internal Attacks,NOFAP_THROWAWEIGH,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/25n7zu/on_external_cravings_vs_internal_attacks/,"I recently redevoted myself the the /r/nofap cause. About 72 hours ago to be more precise - and I've already relapsed. I guess it would be almost inaccurate to call it a relapse - the term 'lapse' implies something very quick, short-term. But, in the past year, I've spent far more time 'off the wagon' than on it. So in reality, a relapse is merely me, returning to my previous, and far more 'normal' state. If any bit of this journey is the 'lapse' part - it is the part where I am *not* fapping. In other words - my 'lapse' of masturabatory sobriety ended; I 'delapsed'. 

This is far from the first time I've failed to permanently stop this habit - but that's not to say I'm not proud of the small stretch I accomplished. Considering I'm home alone most of the day - in limbo between the end of a school year and an internship - I'm proud that I was able to be alone with my thoughts for so long, yet control my urges. Which leads me to a post-mortem, about the differences between the ways my (and probably most of ours) addiction tries to get us to give in.

 
- - -
###External Cravings
- - -
These are the desires we are prepared to fight against. You see a suggestive image, and your mind wanders. You feel your body heating up - and you want to quench your desire. We expect this, and know how to stop it. In the first few days of our journey, these are the attacks that we fight against. There are numerous suggestions - some very good ones that I've read on this subreddit, such as:

1. Install Web Blockers so that you can limit your triggering input.
2. Before you do anything, just wait a moment, observe the urge. Understand it. You will find it can be like an animal inside you, that you can simply watch from a distance as it recedes.
3. Think for a minute about how important this is to you, and that a moment of satisfaction is not worth it.

When making a serious attempt at stopping this habit - I find these attacks are fairly easy to overcome. There is a rewarding satisfaction of taming the primal urges, and letting your desire recede. It's a battle we are well prepared for, and the one we expect to fight.

 To draw a corollary - when exercising - you expect to have to push against resistance. That is the whole point - so that you can grow stronger by overcoming it. You know it will take effort in your muscles, against the iron or machine, and the accomplishment of doing a set can be it's own reward.

 
 
* *

- - -
###Internal Attacks
- - -

These are the far more nefarious attacks that we (or at least I) do not expect to come against. Instead of being rooted in the outside imagery - or in a emotion that can be controlled by reason, they are rooted internally. A thought will come into your mind; and it can't be easily removed:

* ""I think you're fixed. You've done it - now you can go back to fapping"". 
* ""What's the point? You know you'll never make it to 90 days. Save the embarrassment, just give in now.""
* ""Do you really think this will change anything in your life?""
* ""Even if it did, is it worth it? You'll be losing a nice release that you sometimes need""
* ""It's natural - and probably healthy.""

    **OR**, my personal enemies:

* ""Everything in moderation, right? So maybe just give in now, and will only allow once a week from now on""
* ""Hey, at least you're watching vanilla porn. This is normal. This is what everyone does. Why would not doing this make you better?""

For me, these are extremely hard to fight against - because it's not some obvious emotion of desire that's trying to overtake my mind - it's my own self. It's subtle - and can build up very quickly if left unchecked. It doesn't fight you physically, but mentally - and I have no defense against it. When it enters, it feels like I have become a different person than the one who initially made this commitment, so by giving up, I'm not letting myself down - I'm letting down my previous self. My brain steps in and (intoxicated by it's subconscious desires) says:

*  *""I'm older now, than when I made that choice, and more experienced. When I tried this, I hadn't well experienced both sides of the coin - now I have. I've tried this, but now I'm ready to go back""*.

These are harder to fight back against for several reasons. Firstly, they don't appear right away, so I have less experience against them. Secondly, when starting, I can't imagine how my mind would betray me. It seems as if it would be easy to overcome, given my current mental state.

To go back to the corollary of exercise - you expect to lift weights when you work out. You expect to fight against the resistance of the iron. But it takes far more effort to fight against the resistance of yourself. If the thought *""You've done two sets, that's probably enough. You can go home. Plus, you've got work to do""*, comes into your head, it can be impossible to overcome.

**Does anyone have any suggestions on how to fight this?**

25ncxp,2,2014-05-15,Questions about cheap car rental (as an under 25 year old).,MisterSister,AskLosAngeles,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskLosAngeles/comments/25ncxp/questions_about_cheap_car_rental_as_an_under_25/,"Hi. 

I'm heading to LA to do a 4 week internship, starting this coming monday (19th). 

I have friends in East LA (Silverlake, Echo Park etc), but my internship is located in Beverly Hills - so ideally, I'd rent a car. Judging by all I've heard from friends (and pop-culture), living in LA really requires a car anyways. 

Does anyone have any tips regarding renting a car for a month... for cheap? Are there any alternatives to the standard car rental (which, including insurance, is at least $900 anywhere I look)?

Or, if a cheap rental is impossible, are there any things like car pool websites/forums etc I could look into?

Any help appreciated. 

EDIT: Thanks for all the suggestions! I have since arrived in LA and have decided to rent a car (I'm staying with some friends for free half the time, so it offsets some of the costs). First day to work the commute in was 40m, back out was 30m (I finish at 7pm, so after rush hour). 
Thanks again - I'm looking forward tot getting to know this city."

I am looking through craigslist and cars.com, and I can swear that the cars I find through dealers on cars.com are far closer to Kelley Blue Book's estimates than the private owner cars I find on Craigslist.

My budget is $4500 for a used vehicle, and I find very few clean-titled hondas/toyotas with less than 130,000 miles. 

My situation is a bit rough because I will be moving to Hillsboro, OR (outskirt of Portland) for an internship, and I won't have the means to go out and test drive many vehicles. Therefore I'm trying to find the best/most reliable deal so that the chances that I take the car on the spot is high.

Thanks for reading guys! Looking forward to your input.

25nvne,3,2014-05-15,"My manager [M/40s] hates his intern (aka: me [F/20s]). He has a very abrasive leadership style, and doesn't provide positive feedback of any kind. I need his recommendation to stay with the company. Help.",AmReallyTrying,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/25nvne/my_manager_m40s_hates_his_intern_aka_me_f20s_he/,"I [F/20s] work as a management intern for a fairly large, U.S. company in the northwest. Although I am an intern, I am still considered a member of management, and all of the people that work at our company view me as a manager. Many don't know I'm even an intern.

Each week, I meet with the head of our management team for a one-on-one meeting to talk about how I am doing over the course of my internship. We'll call this person Javert [M/40s].

Javert doesn't like me, which is a problem, because I need his recommendation to continue my work with the company after my internship ends. He has been with the company for over a decade, but he recently was put into this position, around the same time I started my internship.

Javert is a very abrasive person. He tends to call people out on their mistakes, and doesn't give any positive feedback... ever. If you do something great, it never gets noticed. If you do something wrong, he'll hate you forever. I fall into the latter category.

Let me give you some examples of the conversations we have in our weekly, one-on-one meetings:

&gt;**Javert**: ""Is there anything else you want to tell me about?""

&gt;**Me**: ""I think that about covers it!""

&gt;**Javert**: (sighs) ""Well, it's obvious that you're not going to bring this up, so I guess I'll have to...""

&gt;**Me**: ""Bring what up?""

&gt;**Javert**: ""When we had the power outage five weeks ago, and what you didn't follow correct procedure to fix it. You really shouldn't try to hide these things from me, I'm going to hear about them.""

&gt;**Me**: ""I'm not hiding anything from you. That was five weeks ago, I thought it was resolved.""

&gt;**Javert**: ""You may have resolved it with the rest of the management team, but not with me.""

&gt;**Me**: ""Okaaaaaay...?""

&gt;**Javert**: ""You should not have contacted corporate when that occurred. That needs to go through me first.""

&gt;**Me**: ""I understand. And I wholly admit that I should have handled the situation differently. It was my first time I had ever encountered an issue like this; in fact, I was never trained on how to handle something like that. But I know that's not an excuse, and I will learn from it.""

&gt;**Javert**: ""Well it shouldn't have happened and you made us look bad.""

...

&gt;**Javert**: ""I heard that you yelled at some of our employees, when they didn't deserve it.""

&gt;**Me**: ""I did yell at them. They were off the clock, and running through the shop, which we would not allow anyone to do -- regardless if they're an employee or not.""

&gt;**Javert**: ""Well these employees said that you 'banned' them from going into the shop ever again.""

&gt;**Me**: ""No, I didn't ban them.""

&gt;**Javert**: ""Well that's what they're saying.""

&gt;**Me**: ""Well, that's not true. I'm not sure who is telling you this, but that's not the case. I do believe, as employees, they should follow the rules, if not better than our customers already do. So I pulled them aside, and told them that.""

&gt;**Javert**: ""You could have approached the situation differently.""

...

&gt;**Javert**: ""We received a complaint about you. Apparently a customer says that you forced her to leave because she had her dog with her.""

&gt;**Me**: ""Ah yes, this is the customer that was so angry at me, she attempted to physically assault me and so I called security.""

&gt;**Javert**: ""Just because she had her dog with her doesn't mean we have to kick her out.""

&gt;**Me**: ""Yes, I know that. But as you, yourself, said last week -- customers with dogs are not permitted in that area.""

&gt;**Javert**: ""I know what I said. But we have other places they can go with their dogs.""

&gt;**Me**: ""Yes, and I did inform the customer of those other places. But even after doing so, she attempted to physically assault me.""

&gt;**Javert**: ""Uh huh. Okay, thanks for coming in."" [End of conversation.]

These are some examples of what I get to deal with when I talk to Javert. I am not exaggerating. Nothing is ever good enough for him. He has never -- not once -- complimented me for things I've done very well. (Despite getting compliments from other members of my team.) I receive many positive comments from my employees, and many positive comments from customers. But all Javert sees are the things I've done wrong.

When I do something wrong, I own up to it. I want to be wholly transparent and honest, and I want to do what is best for our company, my coworkers, our employees, and our customers. I am incredibly passionate about my work... but I have learned to hate this internship, all because of Javert.

In addition, there are a few bad apples on our management team, which doesn't help matters. They cause drama, and are back-stabbers who will complain about you, just to make themselves look better. When something goes wrong, they will go to Javert and complain about ""how I poorly handled the situation"" before I can even speak with him about it. And again... I look bad.

I know the whole company isn't like this (and if it was, I wouldn't have any desire to work there whatsoever). However, it is this particular team I've been assigned to that is so toxic. But I keep telling myself to breathe. If I can get though this, I'll have a great position at this company, doing my dream job. But I have to get though this. And I have to get Javert's approval to get there.

But I only have a few weeks left of this internship, and I am scared that Javert won't recommend for me to stay with the company. I actually asked him about it, to get an idea of where he was at with the decision. His answer? ""I'm honestly not sure. I think I am going to recommend you, but we'll just have to approach it when the time comes."" In previous internships I've had with this company, by this point, my managers were raving on me and writing me recommendations left and right. This is nothing like that.

I am trying my hardest to do well, but Javert continuously puts me down, even when I think I've done something worthy of praise. I do get compliments often from my employees and my customers, but of course, Javert would never listen to the ""lowly folk"" he sees them as.

Should I continue to try to be as nice as I can to Javert? This is my dream job, and if I make him angry he'll likely not recommend me to stay with this company, and I'll be devastated. At the same time, I wish I could call him out on his poor leadership style, and say to him: ""HEY LOOK, I'VE ACTUALLY DONE SOME REALLY GREAT STUFF, YOU SON OF A BITCH! CAN YOU GIVE ME *SOME* SORT OF POSITIVE REINFORCEMENT? I HATE THIS JOB BECAUSE OF YOU!""

(sigh) Sorry, I needed to vent there. I just don't know what to do, because Javert hates me. And I need him to recommend me. And I don't think he will. Because all he sees in me is failure.


---   
**tl;dr**: Working an internship for my dream job. I have the chance to stay on after my internship ends, but it requires my manager's recommendation. My manager HATES me and only sees my mistakes, despite the things I have done well, which he doesn't comment on.

I am so depressed because I really thought I was doing well, and other employees and even customers have given me great praise. But my manager doesn't see that, and doesn't care to give me any positive feedback whatsoever. Should I call him out on it? Or should I continue to suck it up, hold my tongue, and continue to do my best? I really need his recommendation. And I just don't know what to do.

Please help."

Let me regale you of the first tale of many regarding social justice warriors who have roamed into my life. And these are the kind of warriors whose egos are so inflated, they do their own colonoscopies with how far their head's up their ass. Let me introduce the cast.

KGBPro- Me. Narrator and witness to these events.

WarHammer- My awesome girlfriend of strong personality.

LSP- A hamplanet who is the living incarnate of Lumpy Space Princess from Adventure Time.

Selfie- A man whose ego matches that of Kanye West.

SpecialSnowflake- Girlfriend to Selfie. A spoiled brat who allows her opinion to be easily swayed to anyone in her favor.

Squilliam- Friend to LSP, Selfie and Snow. He hates everyone except the just mentioned and he spites everyone in his presence in the comfort of his mind.

TheOG- A true friend to all who approach him.

Now that the cast has been introduced, the curtains are rising and so it begins.

We were sitting around and discussing the qualities of the new Disney movie ""Frozen"".

Selfie:""I don't think Disney has any qualities that influence the public in a positive manner in their media department. I mean, all they've been doing is white-washing fairy tales and characters and lumping people of color together. Their best attempt was with 'Princess and the Frog' and we all know how much of a failure that was.""

SnowFlake &amp; LSP:""Yeah, they have very little consideration for other cultures.""

WarHammer:""Excuse me, but I don't think that's true. I think they have great consideration towards cultures. Maybe in the past, they screwed up yeah, but that was decades ago and cultural sensitivity wasn't much of a thing back then. But now, they've been making up for it by introducing foreign fairytales and keeping faithful to the origin of their culture and timeline. For example, 'Brave' is Scottish, 'Tangled' is German and 'Frozen' is Scandinavian. The character's appearances are portrayed accurately to their place and time of origin, to change any detail of that would be considered culturally insensitive in itself.""

Selfie:""I'm going to have to disagree there. I think it's culturally insensitive to waste an opportunity to interpret and project a story in such a manner that would open doors to consume media and cultures that differ from the predetermined norm. I think Disney, and I'm not excluding other companies from this, cater to the majority of white people rather than the minorities, in order to gain profit.""

WarHammer:""It's Disney! They gain enough profit as it is, do you really think they need anymore? And catering to the majority? Don't you think that's racist? You're lumping all white people together the same way you say they lump people of color together. A person can be white, but still be from a different culture!""

Snowflake:""No, I think he's right. The media is catered to the majority of white people in an effort to americanize foreign cultures, for everyone to see that 'America' is the greatest thing that there is in the world when it obviously isn't if it's doing something this low.""

At this point, Everybody else in the room, with the exception of WarHammer and I, were nodding in agreement to this. I stepped in.

Me:""Snowflake, you're white, right?""

Snowflake:""No, I'm not. I'm X-culture.""

Me:""But, you're paler than the moon on a cold winter night.""

Snowflake:""Yes, your point?""

Me:""My point is, your skin color is white enough that if no one knew you or anything about you, everybody would assume at first glance that you're american or european. You could literally pass off as being from a lot of countries, because of the way you look.""

Snowflake clearly getting angry at my argument:""But, I'm not! I identify myself as X-culture, not because I'm white!""

Me:""That's exactly my point.""

Snowflake:""That's not the same!""

WarHammer:""It's exactly the same! What you're saying is that you'd rather be recognized by where you're from, rather than your skin color and you guys are arguing for the opposite!""

Squilliam grimacing at the whole of our conversation looks at us and says distastefully:""Your argument is collapsing in on itself. None of your points accurately defend the act of white-washing in the media.""

WarHammer and I exchange perplexed looks.

WarHammer:""Do you buy the shit that's coming out of your own mouth? Do you subscribe to your own ignorance?""

At this point, everybody stands up and walks away from the table. We decided to drop it, because apparently nobody can accept opinions differing from their own.

A couple of days later, WarHammer and I were applying for internship in relation to the american government and in the application form, they asked to check off any ethnicity that applies. It was interesting when we found that ""Caucasian"" and ""White"" were two separate categories. ""Caucasian"" being american or canadian descent and ""White"" being of any cultural descent in relation to Western Europe all the way to the Middle East. 

WarHammer seized the opportunity and posted a Facebook status saying: ""Under the legislation of the american government, 'White' is considered any person of these European and so on heritages. Hmm, I wonder how culturally insensitive that is?""

About an hour later, TheOG messages her on Facebook.

TheOG:""WarHammer, what did you do?""

WarHammer:""I don't know? You tell me, what did I do?""

TheOG:""I don't want to throw any names around, but people are going around calling you a white supremacist.""

This threw her off and she double checked and surely enough, LSP and Squilliam unfriended her on Facebook. Not that hard to pin which ""people"" were those. How it makes sense to a bunch of ""intellectual"" dipshits that a ""white supremacist"" would go to a foreign country and date a person of that country(me) beats us. But, they harassed WarHammer by anonymously posting on her other social media profiles rants about her white supremacy and they tried to ruin her reputation with her friends by telling them how she [repressed](http://25.media.tumblr.com/49c35091e4d9d2716c7d32d7f0328f7a/tumblr_mj88inc4aw1rnzcl1o1_500.gif) them and how much of a racist she is. They tried to ruin her social life just because she had a different opinion.

TL;DR: ""People of Color"" try to ruin a girl's social life, just because she has a different opinion."
25o5d3,13,2014-05-15,[W4D3] Biggest achievement so far wasn't what I expected,fake_person,C25K,https://www.reddit.com/r/C25K/comments/25o5d3/w4d3_biggest_achievement_so_far_wasnt_what_i/,"I experienced several amazing feelings today.

Firstly, I actually managed to get out running. I started the programme while I was unemployed so I had plenty of time, but I've been doing an internship for a few weeks now and it's been hard to find the time to run. I get home quite late so I'm often too tired, plus I was ill last week and the days I felt ready to run it was raining.  But today, after a boring day at work sitting in front of the same word document for hours upon hours, knowing the weather was lovely outside, I got home and put my running shoes straight on.

I felt great because I'd started to lose all my momentum for these running days and I was so proud of myself for making the conscious effort to push forward. I'm generally quite lazy and it's totally unheard of for me to do something like this programme, let alone actually put in effort in to master it! It had been a long time since I felt so genuinely pleased for myself - but the best was yet to come. 

It was almost 2 weeks since I did w4d2 and I was nervous that I'd be out of practice or would not be as good as last time. Well, when the first 5 minute free form run started (I'm using the Zombie Run app) I decided to just go for it. I normally run for a song and walk the rest but today I just ran!  For possibly the first time in my life I ran for 5 minutes without stopping, and at a pretty decent speed.  And to top it off I was able to keep moving afterwards. Not too long ago a run like that would probably have put me in a week long coma. I was so happy with myself - but still the best was yet to come! 

The hour long session ended with a 15 minute free form run. By this time I was feeling worn out so I decided to just do the usual thing of running for one song and walking for the next. I ran ok for the first, then I walked but just had no energy left to start running again. I had an awful pain in my chest and my legs almost felt hollow. 

But after doing so well up to this point, I wasn't just going to stop. 

I walked slowly while mentally picturing all the reasons I've been doing the c25k: to lose weight, to feel better, to get active, to get healthier.  Then I started to lightly run. Then I remembered more: that random girl at that party who made fun of my weight and poked my stomach, the times I wouldn't go swimming with friend because I was embarrassed of my body, my ex-girlfriend who would always make me feel so inadequate. I got a little faster. I remembered the guy at work who said I wasn't determined enough at things, every girl I was too afraid to ask out,  every Saturday night in alone because I don't have the self assurance to make new friends, everyone who has ever made fun of me to my face or behind my back. I was sprinting.

Every step was a wonderful, torturous agony. I ran the duration of that song and spontaneously decided not to stop but to complete the extra few metres to get to the end of the path (by this point I was so exhausted that those few steps felt like miles) and I made it!!!

So what am I proudest of today?  Proving everyone wrong. Proving myself wrong. Every single step took every ounce of motivation and determination I could possibly muster. Not a single step was easy, and any could have been the one where I - quite legitimately - gave up. But I persisted.

I don't know what possessed me to start that final run, but by the end I knew exactly what I was running for and I now know exactly why I'm going to complete this programme: Because I'm better than people think and it's about damn time I showed them!

Sorry for the long post. I guess I had a lot to get off my chest and onto the Internet. 

Tl;dr - I ran. I ran well. I ran with purpose."
25oi59,41,2014-05-15,"Reddit throws itself a pity party, blames all their problems on the greatest evil of our time - ""baby boomers""",jamie_byron_dean,circlebroke,https://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/25oi59/reddit_throws_itself_a_pity_party_blames_all/,"[Young people 'feel they have nothing to live for' ""Almost a third of long-term unemployed young people have contemplated taking their own lives.""](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/25nl84/young_people_feel_they_have_nothing_to_live_for/)

I feel like any thoughtful person should realize fairly early in life how futile/stupid it is to blame their problems on ""the next generation,"" for example young people being unfairly maligned by older generations as ""the problem with the world these days."" Young people are rightly offended when older people categorize them all and blame them all for the world's ills, because that's a stupid thing to do.

So I'm completely flabbergasted how ready and willing reddit's ""younger generation"" is to turn the tables and blame the past generation - basically, their parents - for all of their problems. Why are we so quick to do this? Can't you see how inherently absurd it is to blame ""baby boomers"" for every single problem in society? It's literally - and I mean this literally - like going, ""FUCK YOU, MOM AND DAD! IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT!""

The anti-baby boomer jerk on this website just really gets me mad, because first off it's fundamentally stupid, but mostly because it's very offensive to a lot of really hard-working, capable people - i.e., our parents. What right do a bunch of kids who grew up playing WoW all day have to blame ""old people"" for everything? (but now I'm doing the opposite - blaming a generation of ""kids"" for being worthless sacks of shit - but spending as much time as I do on reddit, can you blame me?)

In /r/worldnews, a BBC article reports on a general malaise amongst the young and unemployed. Being young and unemployed myself, I feel the pain. But I also realize that blaming my parents for my unemployment is the absolute stupidest fucking bullshit in existence. If anything, we should - in general - be thankful and appreciative for the world they have given us. It's better than the world they inherited, that's for sure. Black people have rights now, that's something, huh? Gay people aren't routinely beaten. *The entire world isn't at war with itself.* Etc.

But the folks at /r/worldnews just throw nuance out the window and, in the flurry of feeling sorry for themselves, focus the blame on one thing, and it's certainly not themselves: Baby Boomers.

I'm going to skip all of the pity-party comments, because I don't want to possibly make people who are already feeling lousy feel even lousier for feeling lousy. However, the pity-party is definitely the prime contender for the circlejerk of the hour. 

The top comment is pity-party, that's okay. The second top comment changes course, and gets gilded along the way.

&gt;Can you blame us? The baby boomers spend half their time telling us we're worthless, and the other half taking our money and rolling in it. We can't get jobs, our opinions are dismissed, our rights are constantly being taken away by those who don't even understand how our generation functions. We're paradoxically both completely on our own and yet forced to rely on our parents because we can't do anything on our own, because the world won't let us.

&gt;It's time for us to stand up to our grandparents' generation and take our world for ourselves and for the future. I'm tired of being told that what we believe in isn't worth believing in. And I'm sure the rest of us are too.

Ahh, yes, that's it. ""Baby boomers."" They're like the ""SRS"" of the real world - anytime someone downvotes you, it's an SRS-brigade. Anytime you can't get a job, it's a baby boomer stealing it. 

""Our opinions are dismissed."" Are they? Kind of like how y'all dismiss every opinion that isn't atheist/STEM/google fiber/net neutrality? 

""Our rights are constantly being taken away by those who don't even understand how our generation functions."" Are they? Did they take away our right to vote? Did they take away our right to freeze peaches? What rights have we lost? The right to unlimited torrenting and porn? Well, maybe, they're starting to encroach on that right - which, curiously, isn't a right at all, is it?

""The world won't let us do anything on our own."" This is just bullshit. This isn't even an assertion, I don't want to even credit this statement as a statement. It's just ludicrous. What is stopping this redditor from doing *literally anything they could possibly want to do in the world?* I think it's a fairly uncontroversial statement to say that today's generations have more freedom to ""do what they want on their own"" than any other generation in the past. 

The second paragraph, though, gets into that absolutely absurd histrionic ""rally the people"" address that actually believes things like, ""It's time for us to stand up to our grandparents' generation and take our world for ourselves and for the future."" 

Basically saying, ""there ain't room on this planet for the both of us. Either you go, grandma, or I go. And I'm not leaving.""

It's stupid, it's thoughtless, it's hypocritical.

I'm going to move on to the next top comment chain.

&gt;While the baby boomers are delaying their retirement and passing laws that protect their own interest

There it is again, of course - fucking *baby boomers.* How dare they *have jobs.* How dare they *keep working where they've spent the last 40 years working.* Don't they know that when you reach, what, 50 years old? you're supposed to just surrender your entire livelihood to the young people? You're not allowed to have a life at 50 - only children are allowed lives. Old people just need to step aside already! Hogging all the precious jobs and oxygen!

&gt;&gt;Whenever I talk politics with my pop. He consistently says ""the baby boomers are fucking everyone over, and its people your age(im 23) who are gonna have to clean it up"". btw he is part of the generation hes blaming

&gt;&gt;&gt;I salute your dad.

Just including that little exchange for the ridiculous image of a redditor ""saluting"" a baby boomer for being part of the circlejerk.

Curiously, some kind of weird Finland jerk follows this, but I'm not going to go there.

&gt;We are a nation of over-qualified people working shit mundane jobs that offer no oppertunity, fulfillment or even enough pay to afford a basic living.

This is pity-party, and I said I wasn't going to focus on pity-party, but it's still kind of... pathetic, for lack of a better word. What do redditors think the world used to be like? Do they think it used to be *better?* 

&gt;&gt;""Go to University,"" they said. ""You'll get a good job,"" they said.
Fat lot of good that did me. I got a Criminology degree, which is just a specialized Arts degree. I studied what interested me, and even did internships and volunteering during school.
I graduated a year ago and have gotten 3 interviews with ""career"" type jobs during that time, and am extremely underemployed working as a security guard while I beat my head against the wall that is job searching. I try to spend an hour a day on applying to jobs, which generally equates to 7-10 applications per week.
I make $1800 a month after tax, and my rent is 600, internet and phone another 100, car payment and insurance 400 (need it for my job), $300 for student loans. This leaves $400 a month for everything else. This includes my food, cat food and litter, repairs to the car if it needs it (recently had a $500 repair), gas for the car. I recently started playing WoW again so that it will keep me entertained relatively cheaply, but I might even have to cut that expense. I can't even afford things like a first aid course or various other courses that I would maybe be able to get a better job with.
Most days I feel fucking worthless. My sisters, who didn't even graduate fucking high school make more than me because they started working at 16 and worked their way up in companies. I regret getting my stupid degree. I should have just gone and learned a trade rather than waste 4 years and thousands of dollars. Moving back in with parents isn't an option because I don't have a good relationship with them. I was out on my ass as soon as their legal obligation was done. I am certainly in the group that has considered taking their own life. I am sick of wondering how I am going to make ends meet. I am sick of banging my head against a wall trying to get a better job. I am sick of feeling worthless.

More of this same old song, ""they fed me lies about getting a degree! I studied what I wanted to study and they haven't even handed me a well-paying, fulfilling career! FUCKING PEOPLE!"" 

I feel their problems, I really do - but what's with the excessive finger-pointing? And on top of that, what happened to the idea of education for education's sake? But that's another issue.

&gt;&gt;Fifteen to twenty years ago Republicans loved telling people they need to adapt to changes in the market place by seeking out more training, education; and while people were doing just that, they worked with corporations to make it easier to bring in H1B visas, shift jobs overseas and making it easier for US companies to never bring profits home or pay taxes.

Ahhh, yes. It's not actually Baby Boomers that are the problem - it's REPUBLICANS. Republicans are bad, y'see? They have different opinions than me, which makes them absolutely evil. 

&gt;Being a NEET is suffering. It's fun at first because you have all the time in the world to play vidya, watch animu, read books, read articles, watch movies, etc., but then your situation eats away at you. You feel worthless because your life is going nowhere. Even if you are on some form of assistance, you still feel worthless because you aren't able to support yourself. Even being on assistance still has stigma attached to it. I didn't tell people that I was on unemployment insurance. I wasn't particularly ashamed of it because I was laid off through no fault of my own, but it's not anyone else's business. I don't know about the UK, but I'm pretty sure most, if not all, US states lack any legislation to prevent discrimination against the chronically unemployed. The chronically unemployed are just lazy bums who aren't trying hard enough anyway, right?

Maximum pity party. *Maximum.* I don't even really feel sorry for this guy, it's just so over-the-top and self-obsessed. And it ends with a call for the government to mandate - mandate what, exactly? That the ""chronically unemployed"" get first-pick when it comes to jobs? Affirmative action for ""NEETs""?

&gt;&gt;There's a lot of compassionate people here, but a large enough and vocal portion have too much of a ""screw you, I got mine"" and an ""American Dream = if I could do it, you can too; if you can't you must be lazy"" mindset.
I wish there were some way in today's society where you could live, be comfortable, and pursue interest, even if you can't ""prove worth"" to society by becoming a wage slave or turning something else like artistic talent into profits.

First off, no one is more ""fuck you, I got mine"" than the reddit hivemind. Second, what do they want? They want to live comfortable, happy lives without working a job (i.e. ""wage slavery,"" what an offensive phrase), but they don't want to have to ""produce art"" either. They just want to play WoW all day. I mean what else can that mean, if ""jobs"" and ""art"" are off the table?

&gt;I'm a young, full time employee and I still feel this way. I thought for the longest time that money and being busy would make me happier but my mind set hasn't changed.

I mean... Now we're just legitimately feeling sorry for ourselves. Is this person learning the lesson that ""money can't buy happiness?"" Good. That's a good lesson to learn. But what do these folks want out of life, if neither unemployment nor employment satisfy them?

&gt;It's even worse when you can't work due to health complications but don't qualify for disability.
And the social workers don't give a flying fuck. I had a worker once pass me a job opportunity that had expired two weeks prior and for students under 25 (I'm 30).
Having to justify your existance to a social worker is one of the most demeaning things on the planet. Most of them only care about one thing, getting you off social assistance.
They don't give a fuck about your problems and think everybody who looks healthy is healthy. Like they've all got fuckin' medical degrees.

This one shies away from blaming baby boomers and instead blames ""social workers."" I just don't appreciate how redditors villify (he said, villifying redditors) every group that somehow might partially not make their lives perfect. ""Social workers"" are not the fucking problem here. They're not your enemy. Neither are baby boomers - i.e., your parents.

Some other top-level comments talk about the future of automation and stuff, which I consider to be a worthwhlie conversation - at the very least, it isn't blaming generations of human beings for their problems. This discussion is immediately rounded off to one of reddit's favorite concepts: free money.

&gt;Another reason why we need a guaranteed minimum income
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guaranteed_minimum_income

Yeah, sure, okay. Whatever. Just keep pushing for free money, that's the solution.

This following exchange hits on a number of smaller circlejerks, largely histrionic and hypothetical in nature:

&gt;This is how you spark revolutions. Huge populations of people who feel like they have no hope and could potentially blame the source of their lack of hope on the government or society. It's like a dry forest, just needs a spark...

&gt;&gt;Why do you think all the police departments around the country have gotten new tanks and swat gear? Why do you think the DHS has billions of rounds of ammo laying in wait?
You think they don't know what you're saying? They are totally prepared. You aren't.

Come off it, already. Don't blame ""the police state"" now.

Finally - and I've pretty much given up on my ""no pity-party"" talk, sorry about that, but;

&gt;I've actually been having these thoughts for awhile, really ever since I turned 13. Six years later I still have the same general feeling of hopelessness. That, as a person, I'm going to be ignored by all the ""big things"" in the world. The government doesn't listen to the people, businesses sure as hell don't care about us either.
I guess I just don't have the feeling of an open world that my parents or grandparents did. I feel confined, knowing that I'm going to live out my life relatively unknown, and as a mindless worker bee. My finance teacher in my senior year taught us that our generation was slated to have an average of 11 different careers each, in our entire lifetime.
But mostly it's the entire, ""I feel insignificant and expendable"" thing.

This is funny. A 13-year-old really understands what it's like to be fresh out of college without any career prospects. Businesses don't care about you? Oh noes! Why doesn't Wal-Mart care about you? Why doesn't Ace Hardware come to your house and give you money and a house and a family and happiness forever? Fucking corporations, man!

""I guess I just don't have the feeling of an open world that my parents or grandparents did. I feel confined, knowing that I'm going to live out my life relatively unknown, and as a mindless worker bee.""

But *that's* the worst thing about this mega-jerk. Complete lack of historical awareness. Your grandparents weren't ""more free"" than you. If they were minorities, they were literally *less free.* If they weren't minorities, they probably *still* were less free. What do you want? WHAT DO YOU WANT? Do you want to be recognized as a genius redditor, rather than a ""mindless worker bee and relatively unknown?"" The ""relatively unknown"" bit really gets to me - if you want to be known, just fucking *get out there and make yourself known.* For fuck's sake, sorry for repeating myself, but *what the fuck do you want/expect out of the world?*

&gt;&gt;The new world is basically, you are your own business and your own government. It is up to you to develop your own mutual aid and social support network, you cannot rely on the government who are stealing your cash to use on garbage. It is up to you to take advantage of the same shit the corps are taking advantage of.
And don't worry, reddit has your back, you aren't insignificant or expendable :D

Riiiiight. Because 150 years ago the government had everything for you, big business totes had your back, working conditions were amazing and everyone was happy and life was perfect.

""Don't worry, reddit has your back, you aren't insignificant or expendable."" 

LOL.

Man... I mean, wow.

&gt;If it weren't for my nice parents who would be heartbroken if I started being crazy, I would be robbing banks and generally fucking shit up.

Well now we're just entering ""criminal"" territory, aren't we?

&gt;&gt;I feel similarly. It's like what is the point in following society's rules when those rules don't afford me the opportunity to enjoy a decent quality of life?
If society refuses to give me the opportunity to take care of myself legally, then perhaps I will resort to other means to take care of myself.

""It's like **what is the point in following society's rules when those rules don't afford me the opportunity to enjoy a decent quality of life?**""

Do they hear themselves? What planet do they live on? What America/UK are they redditing from? I just... I just don't get it, honestly. I just don't know where they're getting these perspectives.

&gt;At what point do you stop trying to live and honest life, and at least enjoy ""not"" trying to? is it just me? or would you much rather become an evil villain than an honest dead person? When some people get down about life they get a, ""fuck me"" attitude, I'm one of the other people that get a ""fuck everyone else"" attitude.

They basically just said, ""I am the problem,"" but no, it's definitely those greedy, job-stealing baby boomers that are the problem. 

&gt;&gt;I do this too. I get very Walter White when life gets sucky. There's a certain point where you stop believing that karma will serve you well as long as you be good and follow the rules to earn what you want in life. It's hard to believe when you see others cruise past you, taking what they want and suffering not one bit for their transgressions. The past 2 years have seen my morals blur and my empathy fade. I wish it weren't so but it is. At least I'm aware of it, I guess...

Oh man. Oh *man.* They just referenced fucking *Breaking Bad.*

I swear to god, not a single person on the internet has actually watched that show, or they'd think twice about casually comparing themselves to the grand heroics of WW.

And finally, because I'm sick of treading through this unending morass of shit, and because it rounds off nicely with the circlejerk I (theoretically) came here to write about:

&gt;that's because the baby boomers have taken all of our future away from us, through their inaction, we're being forced to clean up their messes, and we'll be wasting our entire generation on it. maybe our children's generation as well.

""Inaction."" Because if there's one word I want to use to characterize the last century of human progress, it's ""inaction."" Oh look, the next comment is the same:

&gt;Boomers call younger gen's materialistic and entitled when they themselves (boomers) were the generation that insisted on the norm being a house with a garage and a big yard and full family, expensive power tools and a couple cars (because cars symbolize American freedom). What was so terrible with good communal living and public transit that they insisted on having the opposite?

I don't know what they're even talking about anymore. This is just inane. This is just juvenile. 

This website is turning me into a neo-conservative simply out of retaliation for all this pathetic bullshit they seem to actually believe. I want to distance myself as far as possible from whatever perverted ideology it is that redditors, en masse, subscribe to.

Fortunately y'all exist to counterjerk with me, or else I would've (gasp) stopped redditing years ago."
25oz08,4,2014-05-16,[T][New York] Lunch with a French lady,silentwalker92,AssassinOrder,https://www.reddit.com/r/AssassinOrder/comments/25oz08/tnew_york_lunch_with_a_french_lady/,"Erik sits patiently in front of the conference table and reads through another intelligence files. The intelligences provided by local Abstergo ground operatives proved to be of limited worth, as the only thing he is sure about the local Assassin cell is that the den leader is someone named Jet. They are still unsure the exact location of the New York Assassin’s den, and the movements of the Assassins in New York are still untraceable most of the time. However, Erik does have an ace up his sleeves: he knows that Jet would sometimes frequent a local Italian restaurant, and Abstergo had assigned a ground operative posing as a waiter there. Erik is hoping Jet would drop by the restaurant later this week; he is ready to meet the Assassin den leader for the first time and establish contact with them.

An Abstergo clerk steps into the conference room and requests Erik’s presence at another room. Inside an executive office two floors above his usual operation room, Erik is being introduced to Mr. Harry Johnson, Abstergo’s Community Outreach Manager in New York.

“Good morning, Mr. Konrad. I am pleased to meet the new Templar in town finally. I am Harry Johnson, the local Community Outreach Manager here in New York.” Mr. Johnson and Erik shakes each other‘s hand and proceeds to take their seats.

“Mr. Konrad, my duty as the Community Outreach Manager in New York is to organize public community outreach events in New York for Abstergo. Yes, I do lead blood drives, fundraisers, visits to local orphanages, all those kind of Public Affairs activities. But, I also secretly liaise Abstergo connections with local New York politicians. I had heard about your other specialties in public affairs, and I hope that you would lend you expertise to us.”

“Well, I am delighted that my fellow colleagues in New York do appreciate my efforts in the political field. Yes, I would be honored to help you in any way I can, Mr. Johnson.” Erik wonders what side assignments this Mr. Johnson would need help with, so important that it may interrupt his operation on hunting down underground Assassin cells.

Mr. Johnson passes a file to Erik and goes on to explain the details inside the file. “Mr. Henry Goodman, forty two years old, African American, ex-New York General Attorney. Married with three kids and a dog, the perfect American family we have here. Mr. Goodman is expected to run for New York Governor later this year in the gubernatorial election, and we here at Abstergo are actually rooting for his opponent, which is a close ally and former employee of Abstergo. We are wondering if you could help us with this task on hand; we need to ensure Abstergo has a man inside the New York’s Governor Office.”

Erik grows suspicious when Mr. Johnson explained the nature of this task. Why would Abstergo New York branch assigned this duty to him? Surely, fixing an election and conducting smear campaigns against non-Abstergo allied candidates are not unfamiliar works for Abstergo. What are the New York Templars playing at? Erik knows that he couldn’t reject the assignment and he needs to perform well. Or at least that’s what Abstergo would want him to achieve. Or the American Templars sensed the secret nature behind Erik’s arrival here in New York? Do they know something about the seven-men-plot of the Templar’s Vienna Rite? Erik couldn’t risk being exposed, not after they finally managed to persuade three of the most powerful politicians in the world to join their secret plot.

Erik accepts the assignment and leaves the room. He now has two active operations in hand, not counting his true operation here in New York. Erik must ensure he doesn’t fail this particular assignment, or Abstergo’s New York branch would be suspicious of him. Erik picks up his phone and contacted one of the local Abstergo field agents. He needs to arrange a meeting with someone important later this afternoon, someone who could help Erik in long term.

___________________________________________________________

Erik walks into a French restaurant in downtown Manhattan. The waiter there points Erik to a reserved table, where a middle-aged French lady is already waiting there for him.

“Good afternoon, Madame. I hope I am not late for our little meeting here this afternoon. My name is Erik Konrad, and I work for Abstergo.” Erik pulls out his name card and gives it to the French lady across the table.

“Well, Mr. Konrad, we are not too late for anything, as long as Abstergo are paying for today’s lunch. I had ordered for both of us, and of course some fine champagne to moist our lips.” 

Erik smiles at the French lady. This is expected from a high-class escort, especially a Madame like the French lady in front of him. “That is for sure, Madame. How could we conduct business when there is no champagne on the table to help us clear our mind?”

The French lady seductively smiles back at Erik. She had personally known several high level Abstergo executives and slept with them as well, and she views Erik as another potential client that could bring in more revenues for her operations. “Mr. Konrad, I am sure that your contact had told you about me before setting up this meeting. I am Madame Lucie, and I run the most prestigious high-class escort service in the East Coast. I had previous experiences working with Abstergo, providing girls for some of the private events held by high level executives.”

Erik passes a small jewelry box to Madame Lucie, and the French lady opens it. Inside the jewelry box are diamonds worth at least one hundred thousand dollars, an amount even Madame Lucie doesn’t encounter regularly in her line of work.

“Madame Lucie, our business here requires complete confidentiality. Let’s remember that, shall we. I need you to provide an African American young lady, preferably still studying college or recently fresh out. She must be majoring in journalism or politics or any related field, as long as it fits her cover as an intern for election campaign. If you could hand her over to us by the end of this week, we shall reward you with another one hundred thousand dollars. I do expect one thing: no questions asked. The moment she is handed over to me, I expect you to keep this transaction a secret till death.” Erik firmly reminds Madame Lucie of the serious nature of this business transaction.

“Mr. Konrad, you should understand that some of my most loyal customers would pay sometimes up to ten thousand dollars to spend one night with my girls. In long term, selling you an asset so valuable as you had requested, for the price two hundred thousand dollars are not most economically profitable. Please explain to me, why I would want to sell off a girl so valuable just like that.” Madame Lucie tries to negotiate a better term with Erik, and Erik are exactly expecting this kind of reaction from a Madame. These kind of women are all the same around the world, whether you are American or European.

“Let me explain this very carefully, Madame Lucie: this business transaction will ensure Abstergo has one of the top politicians in the country within our control. The gentleman could even become the President one day, who knows. This transaction is not only about this one time, but an opening for more possible business between us, Madame. I promise you Madame, you will be benefited in long term by aligning yourself with our interest.” Erik convinces Madame Lucie that this business will be in the best interest of her future.

“Very well, Mr. Konrad. I hope that this would become a great start for the beneficial relationship between us. My contacts will use their best efforts to search such girl as requested throughout the country. Do expect delivery in a week.” Madame Lucie raises her glass and cheers with Erik.

“Yes, this will be a great start for our relationship. And when I mean relationship, would you be interested to join me for dinner tonight, Madame Lucie?” Erik slightly grins at Madame Lucie, hoping and expecting a positive reply from the French lady. Erik had been playing this game so long that he knew exactly when a woman is interested in a gentleman of stature like him.

“I don’t recall that’s part of the deal, Mr. Konrad.” Madame Lucie smiles back at Erik, trying to remain her composure.

“Do you really need money to enjoy a candlelight dinner with me, a gentleman like me, Lucie?” Erik makes his move, and Madame Lucie is both surprised and amused by the confidence showed by Erik. There is something special about this gentleman; maybe it’s his exotic lure as a British gentleman, or maybe it’s the power he hold within his hand. Either way, Madame Lucie wouldn’t mind to enjoy a dinner and maybe more with a gentleman so attractive like Erik.

“See you at my place at eight, Erik.” Madame Lucie makes a naughty seductive smile at Erik, and orders another bottle of champagne. "

My Wild are out too, and these past few days have been quite depressing). I've seen a few posts about firing Dan Bylsma. My question for you is, how long has this been a topic of discussion? Relatively recently? Maybe going back to last year? I look at the way he's coached the last few years and it seems like he is a coach who is very ""by the book."" He runs HIS system, HIS way, and won't adjust his style of play to best fit the players or the in-game situation.

I was privileged to get to intern with NBC during the Olympics and covered almost every hockey game, including all USA games. He seems to lack passion (although I am not sure how accurate this is, as the post-game interviews were about the only time I saw him speak to media so I could be wrong), and he comes off as, to be quite frank, the wrong guy for the job, both for the Penguins and for Team USA. He also seems like he doesn't have the ability to lead, inspire, and get the most out of his players. You guys have a talented team, that's for darn sure! But these collapses in the playoffs seem to point to a common denominator; no matter how well your stars play, no matter who is in net, it comes back to Bylsma. I don't want to rub anyone the wrong way here, but with the talent you've had on the roster (especially last year), I thought of the Penguins as perennial Cup favorites. Team USA this year looked excellent, but again, after the loss to Canada, Team USA looked unfocused, undisciplined, and unmotivated, and I believe that comes from the coach.

As a follow up question, if Bylsma is fired, who would you want to see replace him as coach? Thanks for the time, and good luck next season!!"

I always thought this would be smart, because then they could bring back characters who are DEAD, through Meredith reliving her intern years and her thinking that it is real... like we saw with Elis. This way they could bring back George and Lexi, as well as characters who aren't in her life anymore, such as Izzy and Cristina. (though I'm sure Cristina would come back to Seattle if she got Alzheimer's.)

It would be a heartbreaking way to end Grey's Anatomy... but hey, it's always been that way.

My friend wrote this about me for our new website. I just wanted to share with you all! I will be posting cool articles and excerpts every now and then. Feel free to check us out on [shibescoop.com.](http://shibescoop.com)

Silk Road forever tarnished the reputation as Bitcoin.  Using Silk Road, people took refuge in the anonymity provided by cryptocurrency to commit heinous crimes.  I don’t mention this to imply that Bitcoin hasn’t been an amazing innovation.  It has. 

 Bitcoin has forever altered the way we think about currency and money. In my view, the pace at which information and communication travel has had the effect of decentralizing and challenging traditional centers of power.  For example, in some scholars’ estimation, the globalization of today’s economy has so drastically freed the flow of capital that national governments can no longer effectively wield the levers of economic policy to control the economy.  Cryptocurrency does the same in a small way.

For something to be a store of value, it doesn’t need to be controlled and distributed by the government. We, the people, are also capable of creating stores of value — we don’t always need the government. Granted, the US dollar and many other official currencies are more stable than Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and other such currencies, but having an alternative currency raises the purchasing power of the people and increases their ability to hold their governments’ accountable for the monetary policy they draft by decentralizing power. The case with Bitcoin, however, seems that some portion of the power and freedom created by the currency ended up going to people
willing to abuse it.

Maybe we learned from Bitcoin’s early missteps or maybe people are just changing for the better, but thus far, Dogecoin seems different.

It’s an amazing community in terms of its initiative and its heart.

Bitcoin has Silk Road.  Dogecoin has Talladega.

I was on Reddit this morning where I found a post titled “You shibes have quite the effect on people.”  See, I haven’t spent all that much time in the Dogecoin community. For the past few months though, it’s been a fairly big presence in my life, because when my best friend found it a few months ago, I think it changed his life in a way. I was on Reddit, because I wanted to learn more about a community and a phenomenon that’s a big part of my friends’ lives so I clicked on the link, and that’s how this article came into being.""Before I came here, I was cheap and kind of a dick""

It was that bear meme with the shibe’s eyes and facial expression photoshopped on, but that’s not really the point. As with many memes, the point was the pithy quote, or in this case, the heartwarming one: “Before I came here I was cheap and kind of a dick.”

We all know Dogecoin has done positive things for people. They funded an Olympic team that wouldn’t have otherwise been able to attend. At Dogecon SF, Dogecoin creator and keynote speaker Jackson Palmer noted that during Dogecoin’s 138 day life (at the time of the conference), more than $100,000 in Dogecoin has been raised for different charitable purposes. That is $724.64 in Dogecoin contributed to charity per day.  It’s impressive — that’s for sure, but undoubtedly, there are wealthy individuals and corporations whose contributions dwarf those of Dogecoin, but that’s not the point I’m trying to make here. I’m not saying that Dogecoin is the most amazing thing to hit the planet, because it donates to charity. It’s not the first to do so and certainly won’t be the last.

The point is that the community positively impacts the lives of not only those it helps through charitable endeavors, but also the members of the community. I think that’s special. These days, we do too many things and participate in too many things because we “have to” rather than because we want to or because we enjoy it or because it makes us a better person.

For example, this fall, I took a class on dance appreciation not because I wanted to or because it would make me happy but because my university has a fine arts requirement.

The Dogecoin community doesn’t seem like that to me. It’s like a group of friends that cracks inside jokes and helps each other and others out.  It’s kind of awesome.

In my view, and maybe I’m wrong (I’m sure he’ll correct me), my friend found the Dogecoin community at a time when he was losing motivation because of the pressures and hurdles life sometimes throws at you. He wants to become an investment banker or venture capitalist, and the pressure of that along with all the things you “have to” do to graduate and be successful had made him lose sight of why he wanted those things in the first place.

Dogecoin though, and cryptocurrency, reignited the spark. He was passionate again about investing, innovations, and entrepreneurship. His passion for cryptocurrency helped him land multiple internships, and since then, he has taken on a million different entrepreneurial projects.  There’s this website.  He created and built his own mining rig. He is in the process of creating an online college bookstore that accepts Dogecoin, Bitcoin, and Litecoin as payment.  These are all good things if you ask me.

Right now, Dogecoin feels like one of those good things in the world that improves the planet we live on in small but measurable ways.

So I guess, keep doing what you’re doing :)

25p9by,0,2014-05-16,I'd like your opinion on this situation,Jenny_Lite,MensRights,https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/25p9by/id_like_your_opinion_on_this_situation/,"My company offers internships to a large number of University students and recent graduates in a number of different areas.

To be honest I'm not a massive fan of the program, for a lot of different reasons, and I tend not to have anything to do with it.

The recent batch's have tended to have quite a large proportion of women in, because of an effort the company makes to fill as many of the placements as possible with women.

So in a typical group, some will have more success than other. A lot of it comes down to how adept they are at making themselves useful, and putting themselves in a position where they can learn some useful skills.

The girls in the group tend to be a lot better at it, even though on average their level of academic knowledge is significantly lower.

So there's a lot of reasons for that, some of them are quite pretty (but not all of them) so in a majority male environment it can be a novelty to have a girl around (apart from me, for a lot of my colleagues my novelty has worn off). Also they're better at asking I think, as in they'll just walk up to groups and offer to make tea, and afterwards just kind of insert themselves into projects.

So anyway recently I came across a guy who was just finishing his placement and who had blatantly learned nothing. It was just a complete waste of time for everyone involved.

So it was his last week, I had some time on my hands and I thought why not I'll walk him through what I was working on, and give him some simple tasks to do. It wasn't any benefit to me, I was doing it simply to try and help him develop technically.

So we spent a morning working together. He had a bit of an episode, called me a few names and he didn't come back after lunch.

Now without going into details, I am someone that's very conscious of her position. We weren't equals, I was trying to get across a lot of information in a very short time, and he got caught up in the way I was saying it.

I get the impression that it was the fact that I had a vagina that really upset him, and he wasn't used to having a woman in a position of authority over him. I think some other people might have told him a few things about me, which made him less inclined to give me the respect my position deserved.

Anyway I thought this might be the environment to offer it up for discussion. I'd welcome any thoughts or questions people might have.

25pjl1,10,2014-05-16,[Seeking] Creative Professional At the end of His Rope,[deleted],MNJobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/MNJobs/comments/25pjl1/seeking_creative_professional_at_the_end_of_his/,"Let me tell you a little bit about my qualifications and work experience.

Firstly, I have two bachelors degrees– one in Spanish and another in Studio Art. During college I was the campus photographer’s indispensable assistant who took his memory cards and selected, edited, and prepared his best shots for print and web. As well, I took on photography assignments once a week ranging from in-studio portraits to published photographs to supplement pieces in newsletters and the college website. I made $7.25 per hour and to this date, it was the most fulfilling job I’ve ever held.

When I left college in 2008, I pursued entry-level creative jobs with my strong background in industry-standard computer programs and a touted eye for detail and strong sense of marketing wherewithal. I applied for dozens of jobs weekly for five months from my parents’ house and received two interviews. From those, one granted me a second interview– yet in the end, I remained unemployed. My parents complaining that I was unrealistic and a worthless lump, I gave my name to a series of temp agencies that kept me working for about a year and a half. Some of these were able to utilize my fluency in Spanish and French, but never lasted longer than six months. In this time, I worked freelance either for free or for pennies so that I could develop a portfolio and references.

In this time, I have done campaigns for Crave Restaurants, ING Employee Benefits, Target Corp., Solera, and even managed to combine both my degrees for a Spanish newsmagazine. I proved myself innovative, efficient, reliable, and able to work under strict deadlines. I put all this in my résumé, backed it up with a concise portfolio, and applied again.

Nothing. Not even an internship, because I was “overqualified” for an internship. I applied for hospitality positions and fast food kitchens. I was overqualified to make McNuggets and didn’t have enough hospitality experience to deliver food. I continued answering phones on a two-week basis for temp agencies until I was determined overqualified for more.

About a year ago, I was given a job taking catalog orders over the phone in English and Spanish until one “High Volume” customer informed my supervisor that I “didn’t seem happy to take [his] order.” To the chagrin of the entire office, I was let go. I continue to take on freelance jobs, but many clients either expect me to work for free or have eleventh-hour qualms about my fee and either haggle me or decide they could do a better job in-house.

I continue to apply for jobs with silence on the other end or excuses that my freelance experience doesn’t count as “professional” experience. Others say that I need experience working in an office environment. When I point out that several of my freelance jobs are contract positions that found me in their offices, that doesn’t assuage their fears that I’m an unreliable, flighty risk of a hire because all I know are fortnight-long assignments.

So here I am, posting this from a cellphone-tethered internet connection because Comcast has disconnected my internet. In a roach-infested apartment that I’m now two weeks behind on paying rent for. I have $20 in my account from my last job.

I know this isn’t the standard way to ask for a job, and that’s because I’m no longer asking, I’m begging. Consider this as me on my knees praying. It’s coming up on six years since I graduated college and all I’ve gotten is a cyclical stream of excuses, denials, and silences.

So if you need a great, dedicated employee who’s willing to start small and grow big, I’m your man. Shoot me a message if you know of anything and I’ll be happy to give you a concise job history, list of qualifications, and a link to my portfolio. Don’t worry that I’ll be unreliable, because I’ve spent six years of firsthand experience knowing what it’s like to not have a stable job. I am and will continue to be a hardworking team player and fierce self-starter.

Thank you for your time. I hope to be your newest gladiator in a suit.

Yes, I have a suit."
25q7g8,151,2014-05-16,UPDATE #2: I [28F] need help movitating my husband [31M] of 4 years... now he's started lying.,throwitaway12356,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/25q7g8/update_2_i_28f_need_help_movitating_my_husband/,"Original: http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1p8w39/i_28f_need_help_movitating_my_husband_31m_of_4/

Update 1: http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1xlmo1/update_i_28f_need_help_movitating_my_husband_31m/

Firstly, I thank absolutely everyone who responded from the bottom of my heart. I apologize for not responding to everyone, I was very stressed out about the situation and needed time to think. I got some great advice. This is a happy update! 

I read everyone's responses carefully. When my husband came home the day after I posted, I had a prepared statement (a lot of which I borrowed from Reddit). I told him that that I would be moving back to our home country after I graduated, and we could either continue as a LDR or divorce based on his progress/situation (giving him almost a year to get his shit together). I told me it was killing me to see him drown without doing anything to help himself, that it didn't fit our life plan that we'd made together, that it wasn't healthy, and it wasn't a good role model for our future kids. 

I then told him I would do two last things for him: Pay for him to see a therapist (for as long as he needed), and book a doctor's appointment to be evaluated for depression. I told him he could not play any more video games and that he had to make some changes that I could see (study habits, getting up on time, etc). 

Luckily, he took these things very seriously. The doctor diagnosed him as borderline depressed (and also revealed some things that even I didn't know, like that he'd had suicidal thoughts), but chose not to take medication as he wanted to try therapy first. He hit it off with his therapist and they saw each other for 3 months, leading up to now. They worked through a lot of his mental blocks that he had with going to school and putting all of his energy into computer gaming, such as why he has escaping and how to prevent it from happening. He also made several appointments with his school counselor on his own and went to those. He talked to a school friend of his (ahead of him in the program) and started to get interesting in the jobs he could actually do with his degree. 

Since then, he followed through with his own plan of going to re-exams and passed all of them. He made up most of the classes that he was missing, and has been going regularly and on time. He also set some goals for himself, such as that he would get up and shower every morning and make breakfast, which he has also followed through on. He applied to several engineering firms to work as an intern. He didn't end up getting a place anywhere, but just him TRYING is a major change. 

He has also gotten more dedicated to going to the gym, and has made a few friends - again, almost shockingly different from before. 

While it's still a long road - he has approximately 1.5 years of school left - things are looking way, way up. I am really excited about the future, and I definitely want a future with him. 

Thank you guys so, so much. I cannot thank you all enough. 

**TL;DR** Followed Reddit's advice and gave the hubs an ultimatum. He responded well and is now on a better and hopefully permanent path. "

Part of it is because I traveled to China for an internship over the summer and was alone in a foreign country without knowing the language. For two months. 

Another part of it was a case of Eczema that looked so bad I could barely go out in public. 

When I got back after the internship, I was a wreck, and I had forgotten how to live my life. It's been three quarters of college since then, and I've improved each quarter. My Eczema has been treated, but the scars are still visible. I was almost back to my old self, but I just seem to be getting more depressed every day. 

I use to be carefree and secure my freshman and sophomore years, and now, I'm so insecure that people who thought of me as a role model can tell... 

I've had one session with a counselor and plan to continue, but it just kills me everyday. It also doesn't help that no matter how many woman I talk to, I seem to just bounce from one to the next. I make real connections, but fail to communicate my emotions or what I want. I don't want to be a creepy dude, so I try too hard to be a gentleman. It just ends up with me falling asleep feeling more lonely than the night before. 

I actually have a great life, but as a product of the society I've grown up in, I'm been taught to hate myself. The people who are different. People who aren't white. I'm different, and although I use to accept it, I've just lost the ability to. "

SO and I have been together just over 5 years, lived together for 2. Right now we are living out of state while he finishes school. This summer he has a _fantastic_ internship at one of The Big tech companies, and graduates this December.

My dilemma is this: our whole engagement is dependent upon him getting a return offer at that internship, which we are 85% sure will happen. We've started (roughly) planning a wedding for April/May/early June of 2015. The problem is, we want to do a destination wedding in Hawaii. He won't propose until he gets that job offer, which might not be until August or September. Does that give our guests enough time? I would start telling my family to give them a heads up, but that seems dicey with no actual ring! And if he doesn't get the return offer... ugh.

Our backup plan is to try and find a mountain B&amp;B in the NorCal area that will hold ~50 people for a ceremony and dinner reception. I am totally fine only asking immediate family (and 2 super close aunts) but I know everyone else's feelings will be hurt, and SO wants his whole (meaning extended) family there too. 

So, I'm feeling like I'm stuck. I want to plan this thing but I feel like I can't, with no actual engagement or certainty that it will happen in the time frame that we're thinking. We chose Spring 2015 because we've wanted to get married for a long time and as soon as we're engaged I want to marry this guy! If we could just skip the wedding altogether I would.

I'm flying out to San Francisco tomorrow for a summer internship, so I needed to ship my bicycle and pick up the dry cleaning.

I load it up, hop in the car, and back out of the driveway. I'm not in a huge hurry, so I decide to take it slow, since I'm in a neighborhood with lots of little children and they're totally unpredictable. Next thing I know, some mom in an SUV is riding on my tail, trying to get out the entrance of the neighborhood just like I am. And hell if I'm driving any faster in this neighborhood. I take my sweet time, going about 20mph in a 30mph zone.

Now, the neighborhood entrance is at a stoplight off of a main road. I lived here during my high school years, so I know this stoplight all too well. As we approach the stoplight, I notice it's red, and I check which cars are going which direction at the moment. I make my way into the right-turn lane, and as luck should have it, tailgate-witch is trying to turn right too.

At the stoplight, I stop for a second or two, and I wait for just the right moment. Just as the cross traffic from our left enters the intersection, I hit the gas and turn right, successfully getting in front of the oncoming sea of traffic on the main road.

But SUV-cunt is still stuck in the right-turn lane, watching as cars whizz by in front of her.

I need to do well in rotations, I want to specialize in internal medicine, but I feel that in terms of practical skills I'm WAY behind my classmates. I wasn't able to get any referral clinic experience and very little general practice experience before vet school. I mostly worked with exotics, wildlife, and horses.

every time I hear my classmates talk about their summer break stuff, I get a little sick to my stomach. They have all been working in referral clinics or directly with vets. I work in a small animal general practice clinic that doesn't let me do much (since I don't know how).
I feel like I'm way behind. I feel like an idiot, and I know my classmates don't really view me as being very competent.

I tried to get experience for this summer, but I was expecting the general practice place to be willing to let me do more.

I just found out they placed a bunch of my classmates in positions in the emergency clinic also this summer, without sending e-mails or interviewing. I wasn't one of the ones selected.
Have I fallen too far behind now? I haven't even started rotations but I feel like it's too late and I'm left in the dust. I'm not on their level and I won't stand a chance at an academic internship.


I'm rambling but I'm worrying myself sick over this. I screwed up somehow and made it through two years of vet school without really doing anything impressive to put on a resume, or learn practical skills.
I have decent grades I guess (3.7), but of course my GPA dropped last semester (second semester second year) and I probably fell in the class rank too.


So I guess I'm asking if 

A. anybody else felt like this, how did it turn out? 

B. how did the not-so-experienced students fare in rotations?

The past 24 hours have been a much more stressful time than I even imagined. This is coming from a guy who decided to take an accelerated college curriculum that was year round.

So background. I'm a 22 male, who's about to graduate with his bachelor's in computer science in June after I finish my last internship, so I'm also currently applying for jobs as well.

I was seeing this girl 3 months ago, and we were mutual where we stood. I was the one that first proposed we end it mutually since of our schedules picking up, and me needing to possibly needing to relocate. She was hesitant, but she did agree with my points. We remained friends and I tried moving on, but couldn't and eventually regretted making this decision. 

Yesterday I caved in after having a job offer rescinded (Mix-up with resumes and they thought I could start sooner) and talked to her again after three months. She helped me out of my predicament in calming down and well I caved and let her know how I still felt about her. Unfortunately she's now in a relationship, so I knew I had to stop there. What was worse was she made it evident that she wanted to move on with our relationship before, but circumstances prevented that (Busier schedules, etc). I felt crushed cause I knew at this point it was my fault for letting her get away.

She kept insisting we be friends, but I knew better and told her it wouldn't work. However I caved in and agreed, after she kept trying a few times and said we could try. I tried to stay away but my bad state and situations just kept pushing me beyond reasonable thinking. What I thought was just me venting, ended up sounding like me being desperate and I just regret talking to her again.

I couldn't sleep at all last night due to the combined stressed of the rescinded offer and learning I was the one that screwed myself over.

I've just cut communications with her now and have been doing fine for the most part today. Those painful memories still pop up of what once was, but I have to constantly remind myself; she isn't here now and she cares for someone else. 

I've let my closest friends know and they've been helping encouraging me through both ordeals, saying the usual things friends would; ""You're a catch and you'll eventually find the right person."" or ""There are other better job offers I'll get."" Being positive and trying to get myself to believe them, it's just at the moment my self-esteem isn't helping.

I just feel like my world got 180'd or some carpet I was standing on get pulled from me

This isn't the first time I've had to get over someone, but this one is hitting me much harder that I figured. I'm trying to see some positive out of this, but it's just getting too much for me to handle and I'm seriously have not been acting myself in the past day.

Any words of encouragement or advice would help now. Again sorry for the wall of text, but my head hasn't really been on straight for the past 24 Hours.

**tl;dr**: I had an unlucky break and bad day. Made it worse by talking to my last ex I was still interested in and thought was still single since we ended it mutually due to circumstances. She wasn't, made me realize I had an opportunity before, and probably made myself worse to her.

Cut all communications already. Friend's helping me through ordeal with encouragement, but it's not helping much. Losing sleep and acting strange according to my friends. Any words of encouragement would help"
25s1xu,2,2014-05-17,How long does it take to transfer a title to a family member (in RI)? Is there any way to speed it up? Can AAA do it?,SellingMyToaster,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/25s1xu/how_long_does_it_take_to_transfer_a_title_to_a/,"Hi!

So I'm in a bit of a pickle. I've decided to sell my 2010 Honda Element. The car was originally my mother's, but she signed it over to me. However, due to insurance/registration/blah, I never actually registered the car in my name and got a new title. So it's still in her name, I just have her signature on the title.

Now, I'm doing an engineering internship across the country in two weeks and I decided that

A) I really dislike the toaster (dat shit mpg) and it has a relatively high sell price
B) Not having a car will be a huge hassle in that part of the country
C) I don't want to drive 3,000 miles

so it makes sense to sell the car and get a new one while there (as a young male, insurance is very high for me but my sister lives closeby so I'll just put the car in her name). 

This means that in the next two weeks I have to do the following:

A) Submit my application for a family transfer
B) Get the new title
C) Sell the car

I'm going to submit ASAP. I'm not sure if AAA can do it---do you guys know? If so, I'll submit the application tomorrow morning. Otherwise I have to wait until Monday for the DMV. 

Then, do any of you guys have any idea how long it takes to get the title? If the title doesn't arrive in time and I find a buyer, I have a neighbor who's willing to deal with the title and actually hand the car over (he would just mail the new title to me and I'd sign it and mail it back). Do you think a buyer would be open to this?

As for some way to speed it up: if there is one, it can't require my mother to be present. She lives across the Atlantic.

I have an internship in Bristol this summer, but I'm having a hard time finding a place to stay.. I'm looking for something cheap (ideally around 60 pounds a week with bills) - I don't really care about anything else. Does anyone know where I could look aside from gumtree and easyroommate?"

I felt I should post some back story. I am a high school senior planning to attend a college in the fall and major in computer science. About 3 weeks ago I attempted suicide. My life sucked. No motivation, nothing. I was baker-acted into a facility where I stayed for about a week. Upon discharged I knew my life had to change. I made a point to set my life straight. Well. Last night I talked out a plan with a friend. In the coming month, I am selling some bitcoins to earn $30,000. I will spend about $15,000 on a decent Honda Civic 2012, prepay insurance for a year, and then relax and enjoy summer. I have a job paying $15/hr which I will work my butt off during the summer and earn money to pay for tuition. My parents are allowing enough to pay for my phone, rent, and possibly help me out with insurance on the car. I have set a prospect to get a scholarship with the college's programming team which could yield up to $15,000/yr scholarship. During my 3rd and 4th year I will try to get an internship at Microsoft/Facebook/Some company in the seattle area. Move up there for 2-3 months during the summer, work my butt off. I predict I could come out of college with about $10,000-$20,000 and be ready to start my life. My dream job would be a job at Google. I feel if I keep up what I do with programming (I've been a competitive programmer for about 4 years now, and have been scouted by the college I am planning on attending) I can seriously do this, and be successful in life. Just thought I'd like to share my plan. To all programmers out there, dream big. You'll get there! Hold your head high and remember, no dream is too big. :)


Edit : One slight change to this plan. I'd be moving to western Florida for 6 month rooming with my friend and we'd work on WebApps and Programming. He'd do design and I'd do development. (I'm planning on attending college in the spring rather than fall)."
25sn4d,4,2014-05-17,Motivating my daughter,reggindiputs,Parenting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/25sn4d/motivating_my_daughter/,"My daughter is approaching her senior year of college this fall. She has never had a paying job or an internship in her life. When she comes home for breaks, she goes out most nights with a mysterious long-term boyfriend whom she has never introduced the rest of her family to. She leaves very late at night, gets driven over an hour away, and sometimes stays out for days at a time without telling us anything. Coming back late most mornings ~~with a hangover~~ ""tired"" (my son tells me she occasionally tells him this--I'm not just making assumptions), she'll sleep most of the day away, and either shut herself in her room, or go back out with this mysterious guy. I'm worried that she won't be prepared after she graduates to handle ""real"" life: her mother and I have been able to provide a lot for her, and I'm afraid that she has grown too used to that.


She attends a very well-regarded art school, but thinks that her degree will be a sort of ""golden ticket"" for getting jobs. While it may be important to get her interviews, she has basically nothing on her resume but her education, and doesn't seem to be actively trying to change that. She's a talented artist, but lacks agency.


Her discipline for other things is also very low. Since she's been home for the past couple of summers without a job, even getting her to help around the house has proven difficult. ""I'll do it later"" is her default response, meaning that a few hours later someone will have to pound on her door for five minutes just for her to hear through her headphones. In the case that she can actually be persuaded to help around the house, even doing something as simple as doing dishes after a meal, she will always leave difficult work hidden and unfinished for someone else to stumble upon and deal with begrudgingly. Half the time there's no getting her to do this unfinished work because she's out with mysterious boyfriend™, anyway! It's probably worth mentioning that she hasn't even been trying hard at all to get her driver's license, or any kind of thing to help her be more independent.


My wife and I have seen other parents being too over-pressuring on their sons and daughters to dive into the professional world, and in a lot of cases it's been discouraging to them, creating in many a low sense of self-worth or panic. We don't want to be too stressing, but we don't want to wind up doing nothing to motivate our daughter. We have two other children, one older and one younger than the daughter in question, and they work hard to accomplish things, but at this point we don't know what to do with our daughter. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. We want to help her, but we just don't know how."

I wish I had good news. I'm going to get a lot of I told you so's. I've been getting a lot of pressure to go home and I let my dad know I'd be coming home past Sunday. He of course wanted to know what'd be keeping me behind. I had work to get done that I was being paid for and errands to run locally before I leave for the summer. Thursday I was only supposed to pick up a pay check. I was asked to work another hour or so since the project we're doing is going to be presented soon. I wasn't leaving yet, I said okay.

 So apparently there were joint emails in my family going around that interfered a little with my internship plans and I was unaware because I didn't check them yet that day. My uncle called and we discussed it and I went back to work. Then my dad called. I assumed it was about the same thing, so I picked up. Que screaming and cursing. He screams that my family has been trying to fucking reach out to me for days and I need to get my ass involved. I told him I was busy doing work and I'd call back as soon as I was done. He says fuck my work this has to get done in the next ten minutes [no it didn't] and HE'S the one who has to get work done. My work isn't real work and I'd better do this now if I want his financial help or I'm doing this on my own. I told him I can't get things done when he talks to me that way, that it was rude and hurtful, he needs to respect my boundaries, etc. He heard none of it. So I warned him if he continues to curse at me I'll be hanging up. He continued so I told him I'd figure it out myself and hung up.

After that conversation I realized all the time I had tried to set my boundaries have done nothing and my dad's probably beyond repair. The only sliver of hope I had was therapy. Since I realized the cursing wasn't going to stop, I downloaded an app to record our phone calls and checked the state laws of both where he works and where he lives. It's legal for me to record the calls since I am part of the conversation. I thought I could have it as back up in therapy since he was already in denial of how bad he talks to me.

I also checked with my local bank about student loans, how 529 plans work, and called my mom to know more about her divorce agreement with my dad. I've been establishing credit for a year now at least; I'm not sure what my score is but I'm hoping interest won't be as high as 12% which seems to be the max. My mom gave me a copy of it a year or so ago when he was giving me issues so I am more aware of my education payments. I have it locked away so I'll check what it says soon. Supposedly, they agreed that he was to pay for my education until I am 23, not 21, and it's a signed contract. I think regardless of whether or not he is legally obligated, I'll probably take out loans anyway for my last year but I'd like to have this documentation present so he can stop saying he sacrifices a lot and pays for schooling purely out of the kindness of his heart.

So the inevitable phone call happened and I had the recording prepared. My dad asked about when I was coming home and reminds me that everyone effected by this is going. I ask him what he means by ""everyone."" He says everyone in this household. I reminded him we agreed it was to be the two of us and that my stepmom isn't involved. She speaks up from the background [couldn't hear what she said] and he tells me his wife is involved. I told him he cannot force me into therapy against my will, we had an agreement, it's between the two of us, and if she goes I will not be attending. He said there will be serious consequences for my actions, I cannot control him and tell him what to do [he's the father, I'm the child], and he's allowed to change his mind. He says his wife is involved and everyone is hurt by my actions [he was careful not to curse because she was there in the background], and I have no idea the type of crap I put them through the past two months. My stepmom pipes up that she feels uncomfortable to have me in their home from all that I put them through. My dad says he was sick for weeks because of what I did and that I don't even care. I talked about establishing boundaries, the way he treats me hurts, and me ignoring them was a response to how they treat me. I said I wasn't doing it to control anyone, it was to protect myself from how badly they treat me. My dad made a list of all the things he's paid for and says if I want him out of my life then do it after graduation and until then I'm under his rule and I'm going to therapy with the two of them. I told him I was prepared to take out loans. 

The conversation went back and forth like this for ten minutes with his wife whispering in the background and cheering him on. He talked over me the majority of the time and dismissed all parts of my argument including the loans and his behavior. The only good thing I got out of it was the recording so I know I'm not crazy. Once I reveal the recordings, they will watch what they say on the phone and save it all for in person meetings. So I think I'll be holding off until I get the cursing recorded if anything. I don't know if I'll be going there now. I feel betrayed and disrespected. By time the call was over, I was shaking and crying because it was extremely mentally draining.

I guess the next step is to call more banks and see which one offers the best plan for student loans. The bank seemed a little worried that I'll be part time, so I may or may not have to pick up an extra class in order to get that loan. I need a cosigner, so I'll have to ask another family member that isn't involved. 

I feel like I'm taking crazy pills but I'm very thankful my boyfriend and best friend see that I did the right thing and I'm not as heartless as my parents think I am. I'm saving all the emails that back me up and I'd appreciate it if any of you happen to know of any articles that discuss establishing boundaries and what not that you think might be useful. I'm not sure if this is my final update, but I'd like to thank you all for your advice, support, and for encouraging me to break away.

TL;DR: Dad started cursing at me again. I started recording our phone calls and educating myself about student loan options. He took back his promise to go to therapy alone with me and his wife feels uncomfortable with my presence.

Edit: Parents called and it was another heated discussion. His wife came on the phone to involve herself so I hung up. I discussed it more in [this comment](http://ud.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/25soq4/updateme_21_f_with_my_father_50s_where_is_the/chkde0v).

cGPA: 3.93, phi beta kappa (inducted as a junior)
sGPA: 3.95 (give or take)
MCAT: 34 (12/10/12)

**LIST OF EC's (tl;dr - I think they're decent/good)**

* Research experience since 1st year in 2 labs (moved to second one at beginning of 3rd year), will complete a senior thesis in current lab - no publications

* Participated in competitive summer research fellowship following 2nd year at same institution)

* Various non-clinical volunteering (~50 hours over the course of three years)

* Wrote for a organizational newsletter for a semester

* Internship at a big cancer hospital, which was pretty much intensive shadowing (&gt;200 hours)

* Shadowing at nearby children's hospital  (~10 hours)

* Study group leader (/tutor) for a neurobio class for a semester

* Worked on a special programs council (voted in) and served as volunteering co-chair for a year (will likely run again)

* Volunteer at local community hospital since 2nd year (helped primarily surgery/trauma patients)(~120 hours) 
    - also I am a part of a small student leadership group here where we help evaluate applications from prospective volunteers and conduct interviews
    - will also be training new volunteers this summer

* Volunteer at foster/temporary-care home for kids from troubled homes- engage kids through science-exploration activities (just started this past semester ~10 hours)


* (Paid) Mentor and tutor in chemistry for 1st year students, now in a leadership role in this organization, will continue mentoring and tutoring next year along with duties of new role

* Ran a 5k earlier this year. Trained for and ran a 10k recently. Will start training for a half marathon soon.

* Will have 4 LORs, not sure what counts defines a good or great LOR, but I think they will all be at least decent.


School List:

All TX/TMDSAS schools (UT Southwestern, UTMB Galveston, UT Houston, UT SA, A&amp;M, Tech/Lubbock, UNT DO, Paul Foster-El Paso)

AMCAS schools:

Baylor
Mayo
Columbia
Stanford
Harvard 
Duke

The reason my AMCAS schools are all reach schools is because TX schools are all of great quality already and the tuition costs are unbeatable and I figure if I apply out-of-state I may as well aim high.

What do you all think? Is 14 schools enough (I realize apps can be a numbers game)? Are the AMCAS schools worth applying to? Any schools to add/drop?

Also, I don't mean to step on anyone's toes if I seem boastful. I really do appreciate the community here and the vast amount of information shared. I am a long-time lurker (check here almost every night) and this is where I've learned most of the stuff I know about apps. 

Best of luck to everyone applying this cycle!

25tmaf,4,2014-05-17,Input please: Stick with the military vs. going it alone?,the_serenacy,financialindependence,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/25tmaf/input_please_stick_with_the_military_vs_going_it/,"Thank in advance for adding your 2 cents.  I'll try not to ramble on for too long.

I'm currently an Air Force ROTC cadet with 4 years of prior enlisted experience.  In 2015 I will commission as a Lieutenant.  At that point I owe the Air Force four more years then I can choose to get out or stay in.

Before listing the options I will add that my goal is to ""retire"" by 40ish so that I can write and use my time for non-economic pursuits that are important to me, on my own terms.  I'm pretty individualistic so I know there is some irony that both of the following options are quite institutional (read: controlling).  But hey, they're the options most apparent to me at this point so maybe that will change later.

Option A:

If I get out after four years (2019, age 27) my next step according to my (tentative) planning would be to pursue an MBA and then transition to investment banking as an associate (age 29).  MBA would cost quite a bit (I'm thinking around 200k+ as well as two years' sacrified salary) but I can expect income of around 150-180k after graduation assuming I land the Ibanking position.  I will have prior banking internship experience and my GPA/(expected) GMAT place me in the competitive range for MBA programs where investment banks recruit, which makes this a realistic goal in my opinion.  Other options after graduation include consulting and corporate finance, which are still great but offer lower income potential over my time frame.

As some of you may know, investment banking salaries can become quite absurd for those who progress beyond the analyst/associate ranks.  Without going too far into numbers, which would be quite speculative since we are talking about a time frame over 10 years from now in a volatile industry, I assume that such a salary combined with aggressive and thoughtful saving habits could produce a sizable portfolio by age 40 (perhaps $3-5 million or even more if I live substantially below my means) as well as total repayment of MBA student loans.

However, the caveat here is that I do not particularly want to spend my 30's slaving away in a bank for 70-100 hours a week even if the salaries become massive.  There's also the risk of them firing my ass or another recession that results in this little plan going awry.

Overall, I would be limited to returns on my investments as well as whatever income I produce after retirement but would have a much larger portfolio.  This option also allows for the possibility of earlier retirement given that the Air Force career requires I continue until at least age 43.


Option B:

I stay in the Air Force after the 4 year mark, earning progressively better (but not great) pay as an officer.  After 20 years I am eligible for retirement with a defined pension (a percentage of your averaged final three years salary based on my understanding). I would have access to the Thrift Savings Plan throughout this career, which is great because it has tax efficiency and extremely low expenses, but lacks matching contributions for service members.  Also, I can possibly earn advanced degrees paid for by the Air Force.

This is definitely the simpler option but not without caveats of its own:  First of all, the 20 year retirement system may not exist by the time I would retire (This is a whole discussion of its own which I will avoid further).  Secondly, there is the possibility of not making it to the 20 year mark, for whatever reason.  Finally, four years of service has already taught me that the military often makes my blood boil with its... peculiarities.  I am optimistic that choosing a new career field upon graduation will alleviate some of this but I know this career would involve much gritting of teeth.  (Not that the alternative is much better).

Overall, at retirement I would have that retirement check coming in every two weeks as well as the income from my portfolio.  The catch is that my portfolio would be considerably smaller given the much smaller salary (and thus smaller annual contributions).

Closing:

As promised I tried not to dive too far into the weeds, so these options aren't too detailed and many topics that could have been covered have not been.

Please let me know what you all think.  I wouldn't be posting this if I thought I already had all the answers so feel free to inform, critique, preach, etc...  Thanks!"

When it hits 100,000 votes, some intern will respond to with a carefully noncommittal set of prepared talking points.

CALL the White House.[1] The number for comments is 202-456-1111. The phone menu for this can be a bit of a pain, so skip and come back here if you're limited on time.

Write a letter. Yes, that means snail mail:
The White House

Fill out an email form.[2] Instead of aggregating 100,000+ people into a single, easily ignored petition, make them spend a little bit of effort ignoring you.

Done one (or all) of those? Good. Now hit the FCC:

push 1, 4, 0

a person will answer.

they will ask for your name and address. you can just give them a zip code if you want.

""I'm calling to ask the FCC to reclassify Internet Service Providers as Title Two Common Carriers."" Feel free to add more, if you have more to say!

They'll ask if there is anything else you would like to add.
""No, Thank you for your time.""

hang up.

They'll probably have an automated message telling you to send an email when you call the FCC's number. Nope. Crash their phone system and keep their operators busy.

Now go submit Comments to the FCC's Proceeding.[3] You'll probably want to express that in terms of Proceeding 14-28 and why the FCC needs to reclassify ISPs as Common Carriers under Title II. Net Neutrality is only the beginning- as a data service provider, they're strikingly vulnerable to being grouped as an associate to any crime committed over their connections, just as Kim Dotcom was.

DO NOT use a form letter for the 14-28 comments! This will get your comments aggregated and considered a mass email along with everyone else who used that form letter. This makes your comment more or less ineffective! Take two minutes to type out a paragraph. (You're on Reddit right now, so don't tell me you don't have two minutes.) Potential talking points include:
ISPs can charge extra fees to carry traffic from any online business they want. If a company depends heavily on Internet traffic, the ISP could refuse to allow web pages to load in under 30 seconds unless that business pays up. How much? Whatever the ISP thinks it can get you to pay.

Consumers are already paying for Internet access. Online businesses pay their ISPs, just like consumers. Why should the regular people not get the Internet services like email, Facebook, or videos that they've already paid their ISP for? Why should an online business have to pay the customer's ISP, when the customer already paid that bill?
The end result will be either destroying businesses that can't afford to pay up, or higher fees for customers. Some ISPs also own their own online businesses. Those ISPs can charge competitors high enough fees to drive them out of business, so customers only have one option.

Fixing the problem is easy: The FCC reclassifies ISPs as Title II, just like a phone company. If you talk about Verizon on an AT&amp;T phone, they're not allowed to cut off your call, or fill it with static. ISPs shouldn't be allowed to interfere with your Internet either.
Mix it up, add your own views.

Call your Congressperson.[4] Yes, phone call again. Speak slowly and clearly, and keep your talking points simple. You're talking to an intern again. What do you want? Title II for ISPs. Why do you want it? Because as a sysadmin and subject matter expert, you are concerned about what this will mean for the industry, for customers, and for your job and those of others like you in their district.

EDIT: Okay, this blew the heck up a lot more than I expected. Since there's a /r/bestof[5] link now, let's do this right. Get your voice personally heard by doing some of the following!

On the vote to create 'fast lanes' (Where if you're not paying extra to Comcast AND Time Warner AND Charter AND Verizon, you're in the slow lane):

Tom Wheeler (D): YES

Mignon Clyburn (D): YES

Jessica Rosenworcel (D): YES

Ajit Pai (R): NO

Michael O'Rielly (R): NO

Thank Ajit Pai and Michael O'Rielly for trying to stop the ""slow lanes unless you pay cable ISPs"" concept. Ask Jessica Rosenworcel why, if she had misgivings about the vote moving too fast, she voted for it. Express your displeasure with Tom Wheeler and Mignon Clyburn.

Interestingly enough, the Chairman and Commissioners' direct email addresses have vanished off the FCC website and been replaced by a web form. It's like they don't want people like you to be able to contact the FCC's leadership directly. Pity, that:

Ready to hit the ground rolling.,[deleted],BikingATX,https://www.reddit.com/r/BikingATX/comments/25u0yt/new_to_austin_ready_to_hit_the_ground_rolling/,"Hey /r/bikingatx, I just moved in for a summer internship! I just finished my collegiate road season (I race for the University of Michigan), and I'm looking for people to bike with. I live in the Jollyville area, but I can meet pretty much anywhere.  

What is the best resource for brisk group rides? I'm no pro, but I *love* tough hill climbs.  

Do you think there are any local teams/shops that would adopt me for a season? I really enjoyed having teammates to race with this year, and I'm not sure of the best way to find fellow female cyclists.  

What's the easiest way to find local-ish bike races (within a few hours)? I plan to go to pretty much any, so if you'd like to carpool, let me know!  

Thanks for your help, and I hope to see you biking around!"

I haven't gotten any internships lately, and some of my classmates are about to get one or are doing one right now. I feel like I'm way behind. I thought of getting one for the summer, but I feel that the companies I sent my resume to care are GPA, not my skills. Also, my interviewing skills are lacking in confidence, and I feel like I won't be able to get an internship soon.

There are some people I do not get along with in my major. One used me by asking me for my help but does not give it back in return. One time, he saw me suffering with an assignment, and he did not even attempt to help. I guess I encounter a lot of assholes (there are some nice people in the major though), and they even influence my mutual friends. I don't think I want to network with those kind of two-faced people.

Also, I'm thinking of doing a part-time job over the summer, but I don't really want to work in a food-based environment. I want something related to my major, yet I feel like the jobs out there are looking for those who have experience.

I'm also thinking of taking a gap year, but I fear that I might not get financial aid if I come back.

I'm also thinking of taking a summer class in a closer university (my current university is about an hour or 2 if traffic), but I feel like those classes might be filled up when I apply.

I also want to network with other engineering professionals, but whenever I try to talk to them, I feel like they don't really want to network with me.

I have no idea if I even belong to this engineering discipline. I love what I'm learning, but I don't know if I'm not doing well because of the environment (my university is a quarter-based system) or I get distracted with a lot of issues and insecurities in life.

I'm sorry for these long lists. I am not sure what I should do to make myself better."

And to be honest, I don't really care if this gets buried, as long as I get it off my chest, I'm think I'll be alright.

I'm haven't *really* hurt myself in at least six months. But I still feel it every day. Every fucking goddamn day its the same thing over and over in my mind when I get stressed, which seems to be happening more and more lately. But thats unrelated. 

I keep a razor at my desk at work. It's hidden under my wooden Buddha figurine so I can remind myself of what I stand for before I lift it up. In the end, my life will go on, my life will go on, my life will go on. I don't know if that what Buddha stands for, but I really don't care.

I shouldn't be drunk by myself. Bad things happen when I'm drunk by myself. I knew this was a bad idea before I even starting drinking. But like many other situations I find myself in, *I just don't care*. My SO knows my username, and I know that somehow they'll see it, and a part of me wants them to see it.

Yeah, apparently I'm totally cool with everything. Oh me? Nah, I'm fine. Really. It doesn't irrationally bother me that you're off having a great time on your birthday at camp with your friends and I'm here by myself at home getting drunk and waiting for you to answer my texts, knowing that you won't, because you're having fun on your birthday. I want to be fine with it. I want to be completely fine with you wanting to have time without me, and with your friends instead. It's what a good SO would do. Even when I went to Minneapolis with some people from work, I regretted it and didn't want to be there anymore after the first night. I wanted to be at home. also known as wherever you are.

And I shouldn't cut myself right now. I don't want you to feel like you can't leave me alone for two fucking nights without me hurting myself. I don't want you to feel like you can't leave me alone to live your life. I don't want you to worry about my own mental health at the cost of your own. One of your journals for your internship was open and I saw that you wanted to change your shifts to more correspond with mine because you were worried ""for my own mental health."" 

I'm so ashamed that you think I can't be left alone.

But dear fucking god, I want to rip myself apart.

I'm so fucking clingy. It really bothers me how clingy I am. And it bothers me how emotional I get when I'm away from you for more than 24 hours.

Maybe it's because I don't have any friends. I've only moved here a year ago. I was born here, but I only moved back 9 years later. All your friends are my friends. I don't have anyone for myself. You go out with them all the time, and I just tag along, cause I'm so fucking lonely. I WANT FRIENDS, not just people I talk to at work. I want someone I can invite to come over. I want someone that I'm not terrified to talk to. I want to go over to someone's house and not instantly want to go home. To be honest, *you, my wonderful love of my life, are my best friend. Maybe even my only friend.* 

I feel like a pathetic, awkward loser who doesn't know how to interact with society, or even with myself.

I'm so insecure. I want so desperately to be comfortable around your friends, and have then be comfortable around me, but it's really hard when I don't know them very well. I want to be friends with your friends, Because they're wonderful people. They really are.

I know these things take time, and that becoming comfortable with myself and other people is a long process. I'm working on it, I promise. I know you dealt with the same thing for most of your life, and still do sometimes. But you're so much further along than I am.  

Long story short. I'm so jealous of you.

**TL;DR**: I'm ashamed that I feel like my SO thinks they can't leave me alone without me hurting myself. Also I would like to feel comfortable around myself and people I consider the closest thing I have to friends. "

We met in college and we were just messing around for about a year before we started dating. I graduated and went on to find a job. I would go up on weekends and stay the night a with her. She lives about an hour away. Occasionally I would make it up on a weekday. Throughout the relationship we have maintained good communication via facetime, texts and calls. Her phone is glued to her hip and she doesn't leave her house without it. 

This summer she will be working an internship for her final year of college. She took on a serving job at night and on weekends to at least have an income. This limits the amount of times that I can see her because of our schedules.  We have had conversations about our relationship and that we are growing apart because our schedules do not match up. We agreed to try and make it work because we have been through a summer like this already. 

Lately she has been distant. Sporadically answering my texts, and not answering facetime calls. It seems like I am always initiating the conversation.  She goes out with her best friend alot (who I am not really fond of because she hangs out with alot of guys, all of whom are not her boyfriend).  I don't think my girlfriend would cheat on me, but it doesn't help that there is a possibility her friend could influence her.

My girlfriend has since changed her twitter and Facebook pic away from us to just herself. I really like this girl and she was the best thing that has happened to me. What should I do? I try not to be clingy/desperate by calling and texting her, but I can't help it. From my eyes, in order to keep our relationship going we need to continue the communication, but she seems to be avoiding it.

Thank you for your help, I apologize of some of it does not make sense. My head is spinning right now thinking about this. Please feel free to ask any questions.

TL;DR; My girlfriend is not answering me texts/calls, what should I do?

EDIT: in a text this morning, she had mentioned that she wanted to quit her job. I have never asked her to do this"

Help.",Throwdelta0012ba,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/25u9zv/i_hate_myself_i_hate_who_i_am_but_im_a_teen_i/,"So much to say I don’t know where to start, I guess I should start somewhere.

I hate who I am, I hate myself, there I said it, finally. I have so many issue, so many things I think that are wrong with me. But no one to share them with, no one to talk to, no one I can trust, really trust. That won’t hurt me, or affect my life. I don’t want a lot of my life to change, I just want the bad parts to change. I want to fix myself without changing anything else. But I can’t do that, I haven’t been able to do that. How am I supposed to do that now? So many things I want to fix, but no way to fix them. 

So where do I start with all my issues I think I have? Here I guess,
Friends, I only have one good friend, I thought I had two, but well I guess not because I havnt had a good conversation with them in several months, its like they don’t want to be a bad friend, but at the same time they don’t want to be my friend, so we end up with this terrible friendship, that sucks but I don’t want to lose a friend, because heck I only have a couple friends. I cant afford to lose a friend, someone I share almost everything with, someone who has been in my life for over 2 years. Maybe im losing them because I never hung out with them, only texted? But that seemed like what they wanted, we’re teenagers, we cant drive ourselves anywhere. How are we supposed to hang out? Plus even if we did something I would be to awkward to be who I really, the person I am on text messages, the person I want to be. But the person I cannot be in person. So is this why I feel like I am losing a friend? Why I have no friends? Because I am not like other people? I don’t even know at this point, I am hiding so much I have been hiding so much I cant feel anything anymore. Its all a blur. 
All the other “friends” I have, they’re just people I know. People who only kinda talk to me. I don’t know if they’re my friends, its like they’re only my friends in certain situations. Only when they need to be my friend. Only when they need me, my support or something. That’s when they’re my friend. But I don’t know, I cant feel anything. 
I want to be like other people, I want to have friends, and things to do. But im to afraid to try, im to afraid of who I am to do anything. So I stay where I am out, hating myself, hating who I am because I cannot bring myself to fix it. Living out of the city, and being homeschooled doesn’t help. Everyone else is normal and im the weird farmer kid who doesn’t go to school and has no friends and isn’t social. That’s what you get for living out west I guess. 

This only scratches the surface of the issues I have and the issues that are coming. Im supposed to be this smart kid, who works on a farm and is going to start his own business when he gets older. But really, the only reason I am so smart about business stuff is because I don’t do my school. I just plain old don’t do it. I can’t bring myself to do it, I hate school, and everything else I do is so much more fun. Why would I want to do school. It sucks. So here I am, 3 weeks away from school ending and If I don’t  do my school, that I really haven’t done all year then well I get to repeat whatever  grade im in. You know what that will do to my self-image, which already sucks. Yes, it will pound it into the ground. It will be nothing, I will be nothing, more than I am. I can have that. I need help, but I have no motivation to fix anything so why do it. 

I have so many opportunities that are going to be ruined by me redoing a grade. So many job openings and internships that I could have, but can’t if I fail this grade. I won’t be who I want to be, im supposed to be someone special, someone smart, after all im homeschooled, im a smart ass kid who knows everything and knows exactly what he wants to do. But really I don’t have any idea what I want to do, im not all that smart in most stuff, only in a couple areas and really im not better than your average person. But of course everyone thinks im better than that. That I am the smart homeschooled kid on a farm. But im not, I am really not and I can’t escape that assumption about me. I am just like them, just without any friends. 

I have no feelings most of the time. I don’t feel stuff, so people are happy, so people are sad big whoop. Doesn’t affect me, if it does it’s a show so I don’t look weird because I am not reacting. I don’t feel anything during the day. Its only at night  that I start to feel everything, when I start to lose the grip on covering everything up, when the depression sets in and I feel crippled, so I crawl off to bed or absorb myself in TV to wash away that feeling, or maybe go jack off because that always makes me feel better. But really it doesn’t, it just hides everything and I hate that I do it.

I hate that I masturbate all the time. It bothers me, it goes against what I was brought up with, against what I want to believe, what I want to hold myself to. What I want for myself. But I can’t stop, ive tried it doesn’t work, and It just keeps happening. I enjoy that 2 seconds of bliss but I hate myself for it. I hear everyone say its ok it won’t hurt you, but heck its hurting me, I have no emotions, I have terrible thoughts because of it, ive done some terrible things because of it. I hate everything about it, but but I cannot keep myself from doing it. Of course porn comes along with this, and this also goes against my moral, MY beliefs, standards I have set my MYSELF standards people think I adhere to, standards that people think I am living but really its just a lie. Just a fake. But I cant come out about it, that would ruin everything, everything I tell you. My parents would take away everything I have, I would have no privileges nothing. I would be a nobody more so than I am now. Life would never be the same, for the worse. I don’t those things, they cant change. I need to stop the PMO addiction, but I cant. 

Ive said so much, but there is so much more to say. But I feel like ive said enough maybe. I don’t know what to do. I think I need help but I have no were to get it. No were away from my parents. No were to run to. But of course im supposed to run to God, but I can’t. I don’t know how.

Throughout undergrad and medical school, I never paid attention to healthy habits or taking care of myself as a priority.  I just wanted to do well in school and have fun with friends.

During my medical intern year, **** hit the fan.  My lack of ""wellness"" habits - even though I always exercised and played sports growing up - came back to haunt me.  We worked 80hr weeks, and weren't given time to sleep, eat well or exercise.

When I started business school, I knew I wanted to succeed but I wasn't willing to sacrifice my health to get there.

I came up with a way to still work hard and have fun with friends, but also include the other key ingredients of living a long and healthy life as per the American College of Preventive Medicine: sleep, exercise, nutrition, stress management (i.e. meditation, yoga, relaxation) and love/social.

Because I'm a very visual person, and sometimes find it hard to focus on a single task (i.e. with ADHD-like attention at times), I wanted the experience to be fun, colorful and visual.  Health can be a ""cool"" thing, so I didn't want something dry and boring, I wanted something fun, engaging and aesthetically pleasing.

The result is here:

NAC has worked the best so far. You can get it online or at natural health food stores.  [Here is a paper that discusses NAC](http://www.trich.org/dnld/NACarticle_InTouch55_rev.pdf) . I know you tell yourself this is a first world problem, but its one that's worth time and effort to fix. This such a frustrating ailment. Don't give up :)**


Hi everyone-- these are my abbreviated notes on my journey so far, methods I've tried, my failures and triumphs. The numbers represent my overall feelings about my trich: 


**Childhood: 0**

&gt;Always picking at split ends, zits, funny hairs, didn't think much of it. One thing sticks out in my mind though in hindsight after much rumination: When I was about 11 a friend of mine told me if you have these thick black hairs that poke out of the top of your head it has something to do with your hormone changes. I hated the thought of hormone changes. I pulled them out whenever I found them. Stopped doing this in high school, but since that time I still loved my tweezers and finding strange hairs that didn't belong all over my body. I thought this was strange but again, didn't think much of it. 



**December 2009 - The first episode (wow didn't realize it had been this long...): -2**

&gt;I remember that first pull so perfectly well. I have fine, long blonde hair. I was in my bedroom studying for finals, running my fingers through my hair and I feel this course, thick hair. Hm sorry little buddy you don't belong. Pull. Wow I wonder if there are other ones like this. Oh my goodness so many. Two days later the space around my desk is has strands of hair all over the ground. I didn't tell anyone, but it didn't alarm me at the time. 



**Spring 2010 - Hm, something's wrong: -4**

&gt;My arms and fingers ache, I have hair everywhere, I spend 15-60 min in a trance picking most days. I ask my hairdresser why I have so many course hairs, and if there was something I could do to to make them soft (I still thought this was an issue with my hair at this point, not with my brain, though I was starting to get suspicious of that brain of mine...)



**Summer 2010 - Coming out: -2**

&gt;I find a name for it. Trich. I tell those close to me, my boyfriend and sister. I lived with my sister, and being a psychology student, she decided she would employ her own negative reinforcement experiment on me, which essentially involved smacking/hitting/throwing a cat at me every time I picked. I'm sure everyone here could guess that this only lead to frustration for both of us, and ultimately resulted in what I call ""negative-negative"" reinforcement where I would smack her after she smacked me. Ultimately the experiment was rendered futile. We have an amazing relationship and she has always been supportive of my more... conventional methods of healing. My boyfriend was so lovely about the whole thing. When I told him I was nervous he would think it was very weird, but he responded with only love and a willingness to help. His plan of attack through the whole situation has only been gentle reminders when I was pulling. Though this was never ultimately effective, anyone who has trich knows how absolutely annoying anything else but a gentle reminder is. He was and is totally patient and supportive. I told my parents later in the summer; they had already noticed of course. 



**Summer 2010-Summer 2011 - Just. go. away...: -6**

&gt;Methods of attack included: will power, hats, gloves, rubber bands, string, hand lotion, etc.... All lead to basically the same thing: Immense frustration. I also felt depressed-- if I'm honest with myself I've always known something wasn't quite right in my brain. I always nearly got the courage to try counseling but never did. In the spring of 2011 I was having a particularly bad time of it (couldn't find a summer job, no money, poor relationship with parents). My mom suggested I see a councilor for my pulling, and though annoyed that she would suggest this I reluctantly went. Basically I walked into the office, she asked me what was going on, I broke down crying for the full hour. As you would imagine, my sobbing didn't really result in a cost-effective counseling session. She suggested I try fish oil to make my hair stronger (an obvious band-aid-- but what more could she do in the moments between weeping?). I ended up getting a job the next week and was away out of province for the rest of the summer. 



**Fall 2011-Summer 2012 - Counseling and CBT: 7**

&gt;In the fall I finally got the courage to see a counselor weekly (I did this for 4 months). Luckily this was included in my university fees. She was only an intern, but it doesn't seem to matter when you click with someone I guess. She was wonderful. We focused on two main things: general counsel and CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy). I participated in CBT diligently and went through a book called ""Mind Over Mood"". This was moderately helpful, but I never really found my ""trigger"". From reading the posts on this subreddit for some time I don't really know that anyone can define a trigger other than general stress or boredom. What really helped me during these sessions though was just general counsel. We talked through some of my first world problems that I had been bottling inside for a long time. This, in my opinion, is what helped the most. My picking went down substantially and my parents noticed (I didn't tell them I was in counseling). It was truly amazing to me because even though I was under a lot of stress I was still calm and peaceful. The ""effects"" of the counseling went until about Summer 2012 and then slowly I started picking more and more. 



**Summer 2012-Spring 2013 - Results decay: -1**

&gt;My old counselor moves on to become a registered counselor, I see another women starting in the fall who seemed great but I was just too busy to make the time. Plus my trich wasn't terrible during this time, I would say around a -2, so I wasn't overly motivated to get help, though it was still terribly frustrating. I graduate in winter 2013, work for four months, then take four months off to relax and travel before starting my first full time, salaried job.



**Summer 2013 - Old fashioned rejuvenation: 3**

&gt;During my four months off it was incredibly easy for me to reduce my pulling. I employed this technique where if I started pulling I put my hands in the air and repeated, out loud ""I don't need to touch my hair"". This simple tactic worked wonders in my newly stress-free life. I wasn't perfect but by the end of the summer I had practically considered myself ""cured"". 



**Fall 2013 - Yeah, I'm not cured.: -7**

&gt;My boyfriend left to study overseas. My new job started and was very stressful. I had moved and was alone in a big city. My first world problems resulted in pulling like no other time in my life. This was the first time my hair dresser asked if I pulled. I was mortified that she noticed. After that I sought counsel again. I get 8 free sessions with a councilor on my work plan. We didn't really ""click"", I eventually stop seeing her after about 5 sessions. In the mean-time, I have the good fortune of getting in touch with a woman online who's son had trich and overcame it by using Zoloft for a short time and was successful in banishing his trich. This seemed too good to be true but it planted the seed of trying medication in my mind. I tell my dad this and the next day he brings me home samples of Cipralex (he's a GP). I'm skeptical and wait about a week before trying it.



**Fall 2013 - Cipralex: 10 .....-3**

&gt;It was like a freaking miracle. My hands just didn't care to go to my head. My hair seemed utterly uninteresting. I felt like a million bucks. I felt so free. The first day I called my mom and told her ""I hope this works. But if it doesn't, I'm just so thankful to have today"". It still makes me tear up thinking about how good I felt that day. Sadly over the next few weeks, the results became less and less as my dose went up and up. I didn't want to admit defeat, but my mom told me she noticed I was picking as much as ever. I was heart broken. 



**Winter 2014 - Zoloft: -2**

&gt;My dad helps me switch to Zoloft. It made me feel nauseous at first, but I got over it. It helped a little bit, but not nearly the effect of my first few weeks on Cipralex. Again, my dose slowly went up, while my results remained largely stagnant. I tried a few things during this time because I had read that anti depressants work best in conjunction with other, more holistic methods. I tried CBT again (on my own) and a few other methods, including one that I adapted from the book ""The Brain that Changes Itself"" which involved meditation and chocolate. Though tasty, it ultimately didn't work.



**Spring 2014 - NAC: 3**

&gt;My dad started researching other methods for treating trich. He found [this paper on NAC (N-Acytle-Cystine)](http://www.trich.org/dnld/NACarticle_InTouch55_rev.pdf). I found it at a natural health food store; interestingly it is not sold at pharmacies. I slowly reduced my dosage of Zoloft, and increased my dosage of NAC (up to 2000mg). This is my first week completely off of an anti-depressant since the fall. The NAC has been helping a lot in my opinion. Its so hard to tell with these things. You never know what is a placebo. I measure my success in not pulling by the number of ""episodes"" I have-- I define an episode as that trance-like state of picking that I can't seem to snap out of. Since using NAC, I have had very few of these episodes. I would certainly not say I'm perfect, but I feel much more in control than I did on the anti-depressants. Apparently NAC helps more and more overtime so I am excited and hopeful for the future. 




I'm sure from my story you can see I am very lucky to have such a supportive network of people around me.

Good luck everyone-- trich is a weird one.

25vi7d,2,2014-05-18,On a major downswing and in need of some encouragement or kind words. TL;DR included postscript.,TAdepres,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/25vi7d/on_a_major_downswing_and_in_need_of_some/,"Hi all. I'm notorious for writing tangentially so I apologize. I'll include a tl;dr at the end of this.

I'm female, 24, and was diagnosed with childhood depression at age 8. Throughout the years I struggled to find a good med mix (with weekly or biweekly therapy sessions included) and in 2008, I found it in Pristiq 100 daily *(I'll note that this is what I'm still taking atm)*. In 2009 I developed anorexia nervosa and in late 2010, I took myself off the Pristiq cold turkey (*""I don't need this! I'm fine!""*). By spring 2011 I was a complete wreck; full-blown eating disorder, alcohol abuse, severe anxiety and depression, unmedicated, and suicidal. After realizing that I was in the throes of rock bottom, I committed myself to the hospital and that experience changed my life for the better. At the time I was in college and after my hospitalization, I joined two very helpful therapy groups on campus for depression and eating disorders which undoubtedly helped me discover mindfulness, meditation, patience, acceptance, and for the first time in my life, true hope and faith that I had inner strength. Putting the skills I learned into practice made me a better person, in my opinion, and although I sometimes did slip and fall, I was able to wrangle myself back up, pinpoint what happened to start the downfall, and my ""depressed times"" were much shorter in duration. I felt that I was very much in control of helping myself wrestle through the muck and come out on the shinier other side. 

I graduated college last May but before I could receive my diploma, I had to complete a 12-week unpaid internship. My university was 4 ½ hours away from my family and I was in no way financially capable of working 40+ hours for free all summer and still live in the town where my school was, which was where I wanted so badly to stay. Long story short, I landed an internship in my hometown, which is a mostly rural place with &lt;4,000 residents. We don't have apartment complexes here. My only choice was to move back in with my toxic family. 

I very much enjoyed my internship and formed tight bonds with all of my colleagues but it was with a state agency, and I'm sure most of us who've tried to get state-level jobs right out of school know that it's nearly impossible being that we don't have any experience. (I've since learned that a 12-week internship does not count as experience.) 
As such, I finally found a job an hour away that is somewhat related to my degree, but is soul sucking. It is a psychiatric hospital for children and teens--and by psychiatric I mean patients with major aggressive tendencies who may or may not have a touch of mental illness sprinkled in. I began in September working full-time but by mid-April, I could not handle it anymore. The two-hour round trip, the constant understaffing and being berated by patients, and the way that I myself was trained during orientation to be a strict authoritarian with our patients. Basically, my own usage of mindfulness, patience, listening, understanding, and loving-kindness was simply not allowed at my work. Naturally, after six months of using this harsher technique, I found that it became much harder for me to turn the work switch off once at home, and my old feelings of depression and despair began resurfacing. I quit my full-time schedule a month ago and now only go in PRN, but it's still extremely difficult for me to even work there a few times a month (which is, truly, all that I can mentally stomach).
I was involved in a sticky fwb relationship with one of my coworkers at the hospital from December-May. To be quick, he was not the person I thought he was and he ended up sexually assaulting me a couple of weeks ago at his home. I am still trying to wrap my head around this because I truly trusted him and thought he was my friend, not to mention I had never been sexually assaulted before. 

Next, my family. My dad is an alcoholic, my mom has severe major depressive disorder and anxiety, my 16-year-old sister is an academic prodigy but is an extreme hoarder who bottles up her feelings and has crippling anxiety at times, and my 13-year-old sister has been diagnosed as bipolar, but her therapist (who she's seen since age 7) has begun using DBT with her because she believes that she's a budding borderline. She and my mom have a disgustingly codependent relationship and seeing it in action daily is absolutely infuriating. I do not have friends here, as all the friends I had in high school have since moved away, and all of the friends I have from my work live near the facility. I do keep in touch with each of them regularly via texting/emailing, but it's just not the same as being able to escape and have that social, personal bonding. 

When I quit my f-t schedule, I had over $2000 saved up and had been fervently applying for jobs of all kinds--retail, food service, state, local, you name it--since January. I was confident that *some*thing would arise (I have plenty of retail experience, some of it supervisory, and I've never had a problem with any bosses so I didn't/don't foresee receiving a bad reference) and that I'd have enough money to be able to move out and cover those costs. However, my plan has not worked out as such. I have monthly payments to make, and this is the second month I'm having to make them without any substantial incoming cash flow--I pay my parents a small portion of rent, I pay for my phone, car insurance, then I have a credit card payment monthly, and two student loan payments to make. This past week I had an interview with a coffee shop about an hour away and it went wonderfully, but protocol demands all potential new hires have a second interview with the district manager before being officially hired. I am still waiting for a callback from the DM so I can get all of this in motion. 


Y'all, I feel like I'm drowning. My family is absolutely toxic. I have no social life, and I'm by nature a person who thrives being in the company of others. There aren't even coffee shops or bars where I live! I want--need--to move out of here to regain my independence and freedom from negativity. I feel like all of the progress I made after my hospitalization has been consistently dwindling since I moved back home a year ago. I think the last time I showered was on Wednesday before my interview and hygiene has always been a top priority for me (when I'm well). I can't stay here much longer. Yesterday I was truly suicidal for the first time since committing myself. I feel like I'm a waste of space, a do-nothing, and even though I've accomplished a lot, I feel like it's all been for nothing. I feel like these are the years when I should be thriving and independent, not unhappily living at home again without any sense of security. I'm so incredibly sad.


**TL;DR** Been diagnosed with depression since age 8. Found a great medication years ago and after a hospitalization, I learned new techniques to help me become more mindful, patient, calm, and peaceful. After graduating college a year ago, having to move back in with my toxic family, working at a job that makes me cringe at the mere thought of going to (and one of my coworkers, whom I thought was a friend, sexually assaulted me less than a month ago), not having a social life, and not having much luck in finding other employment that will help me escape living here any longer, I feel utterly hopeless. 

Thank you for taking the time out of your day to read this, /r/depression, and I'm sending my best to all of you out there who are also struggling to keep yourselves afloat."

My mother is terrible. She passive aggressively insults me constantly and trivializes my feelings. Today, for example, I said that I put air in her tires for her for free at the mechanic, and she said ""I guess having big boobs pays off!"" in a sarcastic way. Then told me I was an idiot when I said that was really inappropriate.
I have a square jaw, and so does she. She'll often point it out and call me ""jaw face"" in a mocking way, then tell me I need to take a joke when I say it hurts my feelings.

She constantly makes me feel guilty for any money she gives me, even if it is for medical things like dentist appointments, etc. She is paying for my university, which is cheaper because it's in Canada and we are originally Canadian so I get the Canadian rate. She consistently tells me I am draining her financially and any time I ask for something, she tells me to quit taking her money (my mother is a successful business woman who makes 230,000 plus bonuses a year. She's not loaded, but money shouldn't be a huge issue for her). 

I am home from school for the summer, working 45 hours a week on a commission at a high-end store. I have always made all of my own doctors' appointments, paid for my own clothing and make up since age 16, pay my internet/water/electricity at school (voluntarily), and go to one of the top schools in the world. Yet she has never once told me she's proud of me, or that I am accomplished. Instead, she focuses on the things I do ask for, such as tuition, the odd thing like boots or a coat, and basic necessities at school.

I suffer from low self-esteem and anxiety. Today, I told my mother I was upset because I have been having trouble sleeping since I got home. She asked me what my problem was. I read her a list of things that were worrying me (looking for support and reassurance, I was at the point of tears). She interrupted me and began yelling that I wasn't going to make it in life if I got so worried about stupid things, (she was literally yelling), and told me I was a pain in the ass and not to bother her. When I became more upset and began to cry, she told me to get out of the room. That's when I suddenly had a panic attack and had to rush out of the house and onto the porch, where I curled up in a ball until I recovered.

She did not come out to check on me. When I came back in, she told me the eye doctor was charging too much for my appointment back in January, and she needed me to drive there and get a printed receipt. ""Add it to your list of things to do,"" she said, despite the fact that the WHOLE reason I had previously been upset was that I was overwhelmed (I am moving to NYC to do an internship in mid June, and because I am working so much, it is difficult to get anything done. I am paying my own rent/living expenses in NYC, so I am concerned about saving enough money, adding to my stressors).

I am beginning to hate her. I feel awful saying it, but I really despise her. She is not a mother, she is a woman who does nothing but mock me, yell at me, and make me feel worthless. Is she narcissistic? What should I do, since I have one more year of college and still partly depend on her? Help! I have been feeling almost suicidal since coming home. I am so miserable. I have no privacy here and I am only spoken to when it is to ask a favour or criticize. "
25vvr7,1,2014-05-18,"Want a more measured workout (less trial and error), willing to put in 2 hours a day 5 days a week. Where can I find it?",fyaishar,Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/25vvr7/want_a_more_measured_workout_less_trial_and_error/,"Hi there,

I stumbled upon fitness while searching aimlessly for a fitness plan that fits me. I'm starting summer break and made the decision not to leave town for this internship so that I can focus on my health and fitness.

I proved to myself that I want to do this this past week by going to the gym 5 days last week for two hours. I've been following my brother's lead, doing all the muscle groups over the week, ending with cardio on Saturday. But I want something a little more measured.

My workout schedule to give everyone an idea:

Monday- Chest and Back
Tuesday- Legs and Abs
Wednesday- Biceps and Triceps (and forearms)
Thursday- break
Friday- Traps, Delts
Saturday- Cardio

Basically I'm looking for a place where I can find a workout routine that complements what I currently do (the muscle groups I do each day, the amount of time I do each day) but with a better measure of results.

Would maybe doing a preliminary fitness test be a good idea? To figure out my bases and my limits? (I'd love to know my starting strength, starting weight, recommended daily calorie intake, and the base weights I should use for each workout. Something a little less trial and error.)

I'm lost but I hope you all can help!!"

We live about 40 mins away from each other at home and go to unis about 2 hours apart. However, she's doing a degree that means she has to go abroad for the next year.

She's been away for the past month, living and working with a group of about 15 other interns. It's about 7 hours travel to where she is and pretty expensive, but I have managed to get out at visit her once so far.

The problem is that i'm still stuck at uni studying for exams and can't stop thinking about her and wanting to talk to her (when shes at home we talk everyday) 

I understand that she's busy, but she just doesn't seem to be thinking about me or missing me the same way i am with her. When I call, she pushes me off the phone after about 5 minutes of conversation and it just feels like she's pushing me away. We're going to be on different continents for 4 months this summer and although she said she's completely committed and wants to make this work, I feel like we've lost some of our connection.

I want to still feel close to her without being needy or obsessive, I know she loves me, but I'm just feeling a bit neglected atm.

I still like her very much.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/25w11d/i_23_m_went_to_a_concert_and_a_few_dates_with_l/,"Hi Reddit! Long time reader, but first time posting to /r/Relationships.

I volunteer at a group that helps feed the homeless, and about a year ago, a great girl friend of mine - let’s call her A - brought along a good friend of hers - let’s call her L. L started volunteering too, and she and I started talking quite frequently, and became “friends.” A short time after meeting her, she told me that she liked a particular (extremely well known) singer. I found out that he was coming to a town about three hours away, and told her if she wanted to go with me; she said YES! I was ecstatic.

We had about three months until the show, so we got together a few times to buy the tickets online, book the van that would take us to the venue, etc. I finally mustered the courage to ask her out for a few drinks and dinner - under the pretense of organizing our day trip to the venue - and she agreed. Well, I would say that these “dates” didn’t really go great. It was a bit awkward, no kiss or close contact of any kind. **But if there is one thing I can tell you, Reddit, is that I was crazy about her.**

One particular weekend, the whole group where I volunteer went to a party, and L and A were there. I left a bit early, and the following day, my best friend (M) told me that L’s best friend (A) had told her girlfriends (who are part of the group) that I fancied L. She mentioned that I had asked her out several times, and that she wasn’t interested. As you can imagine, this was a huge blow. I was hurt because I really liked L, and because I felt A had betrayed me - what right did she have to tell the whole group what was between L and I. I felt humiliated. Up to this day, I am still good friends with A. She doesn’t know that I know what she said, and we regularly go to dinner with a small group, etc. Should I have told her what I heard? I don’t know. But honestly, I think that if I never mention it to her, it will always be on the back of my mind.

I decided to try and not let what people had said influence me, and to play it like I knew nothing at all about what A had said.

So, show weekend came around. Since she really liked this artist, I decided to surprise her. I drove for eight hours and got us tickets in the first row! (YAY) I put them in an envelope with her name on it, and only showed it to her once we were on the way to the venue. Overall, the I had an amazing time on the trip. She was friendly, sweet, and we got along great.

Once we came back, however, things started going south again. I invited her out a few times, and she would always have something else to do, couldn’t make it, etc. And a couple of days later, I went on a trip with my family for a few weeks. Just before I came back to my home town, she went on a trip with her family too, and things cooled off. She stopped volunteering at our group, and - except for a short Whatsapp conversation on my birthday, the messaging stopped.

I was devastated. I should point out that, despite being 23, one would say that I have little experience with girls. It may be that I am shy, or that I don’t drink, or a combination of both - but that’s neither here nor there. Anyhow, it took a few months, but I was finally OK with myself again. It still hurt when somebody would mention her, or the guys (who don’t know I fancied her) talked about her, but I managed to go about my life alright.

Fast forward about three months with barely any contact, I got an internship at a tech company that would require me to live in another town (the same town of the concert) during the weekdays. Out of the blue, I got a Whatsapp message from L on Saturday’s evening saying she was just talking to a friend about the show, and that she felt reminiscent. She mentioned nothing about the internship, but I suspect A (our mutual friend) told her about it. Anyway, we messaged back and forth for a little while, and then I had to leave to go to a birthday party.

Being honest, this stirred up a lot of old feelings. Should I text her now? Am I being weak? Should I ask her out again? I don’t know, Reddit. I believe that, thinking critically, I should not, but I can’t help but think “what if.” I am still crazy about her.

What should I do? Pursue her again, or try to move forward?

**TL;DR**: I met a girl, asked her out, and went to a concert together. Went on a few awkward dates, but her best friend told our group that I had asked her out several times and that she was not interested. Now she contacted me again, and it stirred up a lot of old feelings. I am definitely not over her, and I still like her. What should I do?

25w8g9,267,2014-05-18,I (21 F) broke up with my abusive ex-boyfriend (22 M) over a year ago. Today he contacts me and is threatening to put our sex video from when I just turned 18 on the internet. HELP!,hellakitty92,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/25w8g9/i_21_f_broke_up_with_my_abusive_exboyfriend_22_m/,"To clarify, I am in my third year at our university while my ex is in his final year here. A little over a year ago, I broke up with my then boyfriend of four years because he was abusive and I needed out. Also, him taking another girl to his fraternity formal over me but still expecting us to be in a girlfriend and boyfriend relationship after also put me over the edge This was actually his second time doing it. The first time, I was going absolutely crazy on the patch for of birth control, and I decided to stop taking it because I was feeling depressed and seriously crazy. Because I stopped it abruptly, he yelled at me for risking being pregnant since we had sex three days before I pulled it off, and took another girl to his fraternity formal (this happened four days before his formal too). These two instances are two completely different stories and I'm over it, but I'm going to give as much detail as I can about this relationship. So before I get to my current problem, let me explain why breaking up with him was probably the best decision I have made. 

Our relationship was both emotionally and physically abusive on both ends. He would lash out at me for not telling him about my past relationships when we were not together and would call me really mean things. He would also yell at me whenever he was drunk and would accuse me of cheating even when I did not go out and have always been faithful. He actually cheated on me during my freshman year of college, but again that's a different story and I am over it. Even after that incident, he always checked out other girls in front of me, and just make me feel inadequate (he would tell me to lose weight all the time, or ask why I couldn't look more like someone else). In response to most of his abuses, usually I would just put my head in a pillow and cry or sleep and ignore him; but when it got really bad, I would hit him and scratch him when he would not stop (he would call me names and yell at me when all I wanted was to be left alone). He would hit me back and bruise me as well, but I used to think everything was completely my fault. 

Because of my guilt of hooking up with people during one of our breaks, I let him do anything to me. The worst was when he let one of his fraternity brothers have sex with me while I was drunk even when I did not say yes (in fact, I actually said no) because he wanted to see me get touched in the way someone else touched me when we were on a break. Yes, I understand that was rape. I reported it to our Sexual Assault group in our university after I broke up with him. I did not press any charges because that was so traumatic and I didn't want to deal with it because it was just so hurtful. But I do have the option of getting a school restraining order in which he would not be able to contact me in fear of getting kicked out. So I guess I have that going for me.

Fast forward to the present, and I am the happiest I have ever been in my entire life. I had counseling sessions, got an emotional support animal, my grades are better, I am more social, I go out without any fear of being yelled at, I've scored more internships, and I have been dating the absolute best boyfriend I have ever had for the past six months (honestly, if he isn't the one, I don't know who is - I've never felt this way about anyone in my life!). Basically, I turned my life around. However, my ex is not in the same boat. He is graduating and for the past year has been texting me that he is depressed. I used to text back and tell him everything will be okay and he can get over me, but he always became abusive and would start calling me names. He is very jealous of my life and happiness, he even tries to make fun of my boyfriend. In fact, he once saw us together, flipped out, and texted me mean things about him that were just so childish. So I have been ignoring him for the most part for the past 6 months, and I blocked his texts and phone calls for the past 4 months. 

Last night, I saw his name pop up on my screen for my phone. Both my boyfriend and I saw it, but the call blocker (This blocker is called ""Dead 2 Me"") ignored it as expected. However, I get two unknown calls within the hour after he called me. This was late at night and it is always typical for him to abusively call me when he is drunk. He also left two messages. The first message told me I should feel guilty for giving him a few scars on his arm that were permanent. I am not proud of that AT ALL (my ex knows this), and it really hurts me that he brings it up as a weapon. I do not think being physically abusive is justifiable in any way, but the biggest scar I gave him was when he told me it was my fault his fraternity bro had sex with me. I bring this up only to describe how much abuse I took before I fought back. However, the second message is much worse. He brought up a sex video we made when I was 18 and he was 19. His friend recorded it, and in our years together he told me he destroyed the video. Still, he told me he had it and would put it online if I did not talk to him in 24 hours. I freaked out this morning when I heard the messages, and in panic I deleted it permanently (I tried to go back and recover it to no avail). I hate dealing with my ex because of the memories of abuse, and I just did not want to deal with this again. I told my best friend over the phone and then I woke up my boyfriend and cried hysterically while telling him everything. Thank God he was so understanding. 

Later in the day, I make my best friend who I told text him to tell him i would tell the university that he was harassing me and that I could get a restraining order that could get him kicked out of school if he tried this again. My ex responds to her ""Sorry. It won't happen again.""

I am contemplating telling the school still, but the quarter is almost done and I am more worried about midterms and what not. Telling the school takes so much time and effort so I don't know if I should go through with it; I hate re-opening that part of my life because it brings back so many depressing memories. I also do not know if he will threaten me again with that sex video. If he has it, I do not know how to go about making him destroy it or if I have any rights to it. It is so embarrassing, and i do not want my reputation to be hurt in any way from a stupid mistake I made when I JUST turned 18. I guess this also goes toward anything else that can be incriminatory, since I know he tried to spread rumors about me in the sorority I just joined (and sadly, some of the girls who are his friends took his side even though they do not know of what he did to me). So reddit, I don't know of the best way to go about this. Tell our university and go through a process of bringing back memories and have many meetings that will take time out of school and work, or just ignore him as I have been doing and hope for the best unless he tries to talk to me again. I don't want to be bothered by this anymore.

**tl;dr**: My abusive ex boyfriend left a voice mail saying he would put our sex video we made when I was 18 and he was 19 online. I want to make sure I won't get hurt.

25wejh,0,2014-05-18,Fitness for an investment banking intern,[deleted],Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/25wejh/fitness_for_an_investment_banking_intern/,"Hey everyone,

I'm looking for some guidance choosing a lifting program for the summer.

My goals are to add 5-10lbs of muscle, while cutting down to about 8% bf. To keep my bf low, I plan on adhering to some version of the leangains program; however, I am not sure what weightlifting routine to use.

Also, this summer I have an investment banking internship lined up and I anticipate working roughly 80 hours a week based on estimates of what current employees said past interns usually work, so I'm going to have limited free time for the next 2.5 months.


Some things about me:

I'm a 21yr old male college student 
5' 10"" 
150lbs 
Roughly 10-12% body fat 
Bench (3x5): 145lbs 
Deadlift (1x5): 255lbs 
Squat (3x5): 185lbs 
Press (3x5): 100lbs

Tried SS about 3 months ago, but tweaked my back deadlifting 2 months into it, so I've been chilling for about a month now to let it heal. Going forward, I want something where I'm doing more than just 5 reps per set.

I used to be a D1 athlete before my school cut my team after my sophomore year--never really had a solid lifting routine then either bc of constant coaching changes. Looking to start changing that now.

I'm thinking about the AllPro Beginner Routine, but I'm not sure. I would really appreciate some suggestions!! Thanks

TL;DR - Working 80hrs a week this summer, need suggestion for workout routine that is short-ish and intense to help build muscle"

I've been posting a bit the last week, and just wanted to formally re-introduce myself... I used to be very active on the Plounge, but have been mostly away for a fairly long time, more than half a year... I still see a few familiar names, but I also see a ton of new people! ^(Hey new people! &lt;3)

[](/sp)

[](/dwspace) Pretty much, I've been super busy interning at NASA, while concurrently taking a few online classes ^(because who needs sleep!)

At first, it was only going to be for Fall... then they offered to keep me for Spring... then tomorrow, I'm actually starting a third internship for Summer. I guess I must be doing a pretty good job q: ^(Also they're going to have to hit me with a stick to make me leave!)

But anyyyways, my classes are over, so although I'm still going to be interning this summer, I'm going to try to be more active here again.

[](/sp)

[](/vsspace) For those who don't know me.... as my name might suggest, I looove space. ^(That's an understatement) 

I love collecting stuff, like [space shuttle hardware](http://imgur.com/a/fFh7h), [space suit components](http://i.imgur.com/QqJaNSJ.jpg), and [pilot gear](http://www.reddit.com/r/MLPLounge/comments/1hcawi/). I love ~~preaching to~~ teaching [kids about NASA and spaceflight](http://i.imgur.com/OJ0E4Gg.jpg). I love playing dress up, whether as an [astronaut pilot](http://i.imgur.com/i65pYzw.jpg?1), a [moonwalker](http://i.imgur.com/fWGUlNF.jpg), or as [some crazy adventurer](http://i.imgur.com/ntDZpeQ.jpg) ^(please forgive me for the fedora q:)  

And I also used to do a ton of [embroidery](http://www.reddit.com/r/MLPLounge/comments/17wunb/i_think_i_just_won_the_game/) ^(sorry if I've been too busy to make anything for anyone who's asked &lt;/3)

[](/dashieglee) Well, the past 8 months have been incredible. I've seen plenty of [cool stuff](http://i.imgur.com/PixizZf.jpg), met a number of [cool people](http://i.imgur.com/78vjVvm.jpg), and got to do some [pretty cool things](http://i.imgur.com/jGeneG5.jpg)...

Whether it be [sitting in a space shuttle cockpit](http://i.imgur.com/UDOHURp.jpg), checking out a [freakishly large](http://i.imgur.com/SWQdFTS.jpg) airplane (and some of it's [smaller brothers](http://i.imgur.com/GgN9aB4.jpg)), playing with a [space station hatch](http://i.imgur.com/iAXuapt.jpg) and [robotic arm controls](http://i.imgur.com/pwM5EAc.jpg) inside a training mockup of [the international space station](http://i.imgur.com/uYWx8Cz.jpg), learning about [space suits](http://i.imgur.com/NXUNdRW.jpg), watching [astronauts train](http://i.imgur.com/aWv3jS7.jpg) inside a giant swimming pool, getting a [3D scan](http://i.imgur.com/vqOH7Bl.jpg) of myself ^(they didn't let me keep it &lt;/3), or [partying with a bunch of astronauts](http://i.imgur.com/cYTED2h.jpg) at a celebration.

[](/derpycam) NASA also let me have a pretty cool [professional portrait](http://i.imgur.com/Q5VZAdf.jpg), which was nice &lt;3 Though, for some reason their official photographers also decided to photograph me [eating lunch](http://i.imgur.com/gAYqe2v.jpg), staring [at wildlife](http://i.imgur.com/bLSLs9t.jpg) (which made its way [on Instagram](http://instagram.com/p/k2Qx5ZqpCC/) o.O), and [watching a lecture](http://i.imgur.com/CZ5Mcp1.jpg) (That elbow that's just out of frame is the deputy director of the Johnson Space Center...

25wq1h,4,2014-05-18,Possible Thyroid Cancer,umainebeast,cancer,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/25wq1h/possible_thyroid_cancer/,"Hi guys, I felt like getting this off my chest to someone other than my immediate family and friends. It's a different kind of camaraderie, and less personal. I haven't even been diagnosed yet and I'm being smothered! I'll start with a little bit of background.

In October of last year, I was walking to my car at the University and I noticed that the ground was swelling up to me in waves. Like, I was on a boat in the middle of a Nor’easter; I had to sit on the sidewalk until it passed. I had been having trouble focusing with my right eye for a few days but I wrote it off as my contacts being an old prescription. I went to my eye doctor and he dilated my eye, took a peek around in there and found nothing. He decided on a whim to check my blood pressure and it was 148/98, definitely high for a 21 year old male in excellent shape. I ran 5k's, lifted, ate well, just a normal active person. I saw my family doctor, a nurse practioner. (This is important for later, maybe) She prescribed me beta blockers, propranolol and subjected me to battery of adrenal tests, looking for a root cause. They screened me for renal disease, blockages in my aorta, pheochromocytoma, and a complete panel blood test/ urine test and everything was negative. It was a huge relief. I just needed to manage symptoms and get back to my active lifestyle. 

After a few weeks I was lethargic, and I had no appetite. Some days would be great, others not so much. In February of this year I had my first event. I felt a pinching in my right leg and I had facial palsy and a galloping heartbeat. It subsided within thirty minutes. It was accompanied with syncope and shortness of breath. I wrote it off as heat stress, as I was working in a mill environment on internship and the conditions on the floor are not great. Then I had another, worse. I should have gone to the ER but I’m stubborn. I had been prescribed an automated cuff to track my BP and checked it. 165/125, it was a hypertensive emergency. It also displayed arrhythmia. My doctor sent me to the cardiologist following that event, and I had an echocardiogram of my heart, as well as an EKG. I also had an ultrasound of my leg looking for clots and an angiogram of my brain due to the facial palsy.

The cardiologist put me on a 3 day Holter monitor, and it showed pretty intense heartblock. This was around the time that Lyme disease was thrown around. A symptom of Lyme disease is heart block, so the propranolol was discontinued. I immediately felt more energetic, but my symptoms weren’t completely abated. I continued on, not really finding out much for the next month or so, and losing about 20 pounds.

In early May I was driving home and noticed a swelling between my Adam’s apple and collarbone on the right side of my throat. I called my doctor and there was an immediate ultrasound scheduled, without even seeing her. It took over a week to schedule and in that time, I began feeling it push on the structures of my throat. I have pain in my right ear, a cough, hoarseness, and shortness of breath. For about a month I've had pain with every breath in the right side of my chest, almost like I have bronchitis, but I don't know if it's related. It’s getting worse by the day. They found a mass in my thyroid that was 25 x 26 x 38 mm. A FNAB was performed and I got a call that the mass was benign. A lobectomy was recommended. After a day had passed, and I had celebrated, the hospital called again and told me a second pathologist was called in due to the first pathologist being unsure, and they found “atypical cells” throughout the sample. They said that cancer was 40% likely and recommended an immediate iodine uptake, which will be performed this week. A surgical consult was also hired, which seems to me that I’ll have surgery before the month is out, at least a lobectomy, perhaps a complete thyroidectomy.

So in summary, I was first diagnosed with chronic high blood pressure. Then they thought that there was adrenal dysfunction. Then blood clots. Then it was neurological/ lyme disease. Now I think that the thyroid could have been the problem all along. I don’t know if it’s a combination of inexperience and misdiagnosis or incompetence as a nurse practitioner. I see the good in people and want to think it’s the former.

If this does turn out to be cancer, I hope I can learn from some of you that have gone through this ordeal. Should I be eager to get a second opinion? Should I actually get a doctor with experience instead of a CNP? Should I be more aggressive in asking the doctor’s for procedures? If it was up to me this growth would be gone already. How do I even set up a team of specialists and oncologists? Is there support groups? I want to become better prepared in case it’s something bad. It feels like I'm in a dream. I've never had health issues like this and it's almost too much. Thank you for your opinions and enduring this wall of text. I encourage you to ask questions and I apologize if I missed anything.

There’s even a theory that Kevin could be Cecil’s forgotten brother. It does make sense.

But I’ve been thinking, and I feel it goes much deeper than that.

In “Cassette,” young Cecil says that his mother warns him not to look in mirrors, because “Someday someone will kill you, and it will involve a mirror.” She goes so far as to cover every reflective surface in the house, and hide from Cecil for three days. He also mentions that his brother doesn’t like the idea of him going into radio, saying he “doesn’t have the right voice for it.” Later on, after Cecil reports getting the internship for Leonard Burton at the station, his brother glares at him with hollow eyes across the breakfast table and howls.

WHAT IF Kevin wanted to become a radio show host and eventual replacement for Leonard, but knew from the tablets down at city hall that his brother would be taking the spot, making him angry and jealous and perhaps a tad malicious?

WHAT IF Kevin was the noise and shadow haunting Cecil during his practice recordings, because he wanted to get back at the younger teenager for taking the job he wanted?

WHAT IF Kevin had the ability to move through mirrors and kill? It’s not so far out there. If he can be totally comfortable with murder and blood, it’s possible he could have ways of fulfilling his sick pleasures.

WHAT IF that’s why their mother warned him about mirrors and hid when she felt danger lurking? She probably knew what evil and demented things her other son was capable of, and wanted to keep the other boy safe.

WHAT IF Kevin attacked and nearly killed Cecil at the end of the recordings, and for some reason, didn’t succeed? What if instead of being locked up, the Sheriff’s Secret Police just sent the boy to Desert Bluffs, where he became the eventual host of Welcome to Desert Bluffs? And the City Council just erased Cecil’s memories to make it easier for him to fulfill the prophecy as the future Voice of Night Vale without any complications. It would explain why Cecil had this seemingly irrational hatred of the town, despite never visiting it. It also explains Kevin’s insistence to make listeners forget about the former host when he and Lauren take over the show in episode 47. "

25xgpo,0,2014-05-19,Sorry if this comes off as whiny.,PandahGoRawr,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/25xgpo/sorry_if_this_comes_off_as_whiny/,"You guys decide if this comes off as too whiny or complaining as I probably don't have it as bad as others. I'd just like an opportunity to let off some steam.

I'm an eighteen year old male from the Netherlands, currently studying IT in an Univesity of Applied Sciences since February. English isn't my first language so mind me if I make any mistakes.

Firstly, since Decembre I've felt more and more anxious. I've always been a bit of a person that worries about a lot and possibly too much but the last half year I've noticed and thereby increasing. At the end of Septembre I finished a study IT Management at a Vocational Education which I started at age fifteen. Since internship ended too late I couldn't start at university on time which in return kept me at home from Septembre to January. Since I was seventeen at the time it wasn't as easy to find a job so I spent that time sitting at home behind the computer. 

Part of the problem is possibly that I've done everything well at my education including the Vocational Education. I've barely studied until this point and even though I have no problems taking time to study, I've never had to work that much to make any accomplishments and that doesn't help right now. Since I started this study I've been more and more worried that I'll fail and disappoint not only my parents but the majority of my family as well.  The classes I have are mostly practical lessons and I get fine by some, but I'm struggling with others.  

Adding to that, I'm part of a triplet with two sisters and they're struggling with dyslexia and the youngest one has autism (not informed too much about it, would go in more detail if I could) and I've been told that my parents don't worry as much how I'll end up compared to them, unknowingly giving me more things to worry and think about.

The second part of my worries is adultery. Now that I've become eighteen this year and from then on I've had some questions and worries added along. While my parents take care with financial support I keep worrying about when I'll be ""grown up"" and if my burden upon my. I feel like I'm not mature at all while I'm no way anything close to mature. I won't have to move out until I have a steady income high enough to afford a good appartment and the other costs, so fortunately that's not a worry.

tl;dr; I'm constantly stressed, worked up about my current studies,  when I'll ""growing up"" and disappointing the ones I care about."

25xwoz,285,2014-05-19,"Mom unhappy about my graduation ceremony and (originally planned) graduation party is canceled because ""she never had anything like that when she was my age""",JenLakerFan,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/25xwoz/mom_unhappy_about_my_graduation_ceremony_and/,"Err.. here I go with a lovely rant. Sorry.

I had my graduation ceremony this past Saturday. I got my BA in Communications (WOOHOO!). Quite an amazing day despite the heat outside. I was looking forward to this day, mostly due to how I'd get to sit with one of my best friends and just enjoy the festivities altogether.

My parents were ehh about the ceremony. My mom, who is definitely an Nmom, especially didn't want to go. They went anyway because they felt they were ""obligated"" to since they're my parents. My mom believed me having a graduation ceremony was ""unnecessary"" because she never had anything like that when she was my age.

She was barely an immigrant to the U.S. around then and had other things to straighten out in life that didn't involve education (aside from taking ESL courses). I understand this... and there's many people out there who have been (or are) in this position. But she always blames me for that happening. It's my fault that she never got a proper education in America. It's my fault she didn't know English too well and had to take ESL classes. And... I didn't even come into the picture until several years later.

The entire ceremony, she (and dad) had this dull look on their faces. They looked pretty frustrated. When my name was called and I shook the Dean's hand, it was just my friend and my brother cheering and yelling in the stands. My parents just sat there stone-faced. Not surprised, really. They had always been crummy about my accomplishments, so I learned to hide stuff from them -- but who the heck could hide achieving a college degree?

Our family friends had been planning a graduation party for me and another fellow grad in the circle for weeks, but my mom kept pushing for it to get canceled because she felt I didn't need one. She didn't even think about the other girl whom the party was for as well. After weeks of learning the party would be on..then off...then on again, it's now been permanently canceled. I really do hope that other girl gets a party or something though, because it'd be messed up if she doesn't AT ALL just because of my situation.

My mom tried to ""cheer me up"" last night about the cancelation, saying we'll go somewhere nice as a family instead, like Santa Monica Pier or something *rolls eyes*

It's not going to happen. Sounds like great plans, but she does this so much every time she takes away something from me, and when the day comes, we don't go anywhere. And when I ask about it, I'd be told ""What do you want? Why do you want to go there? There's nothing there.""

YOU JUST PLANNED FOR US ALL TO GO THERE JUST DAYS AGO!

I'm so tired of this way of thinking my mom has. I'm glad I'm taking this cancelation better than I would have months ago... for one, I'm not surprised (unfortunately)... and two -- it should be more fun to go somewhere without the parents and celebrate my graduation that way.

But this way of thinking is always going to be around with my mom. Everything is ""I didn't have that when I was your age, so why should you? That's unfair.""

I thought parents are supposed to want the best for their kids? For their kids to have a better life than them (all while still wisely taking care of themselves too, of course)? It's crazy how long this has gone on for, and it's only gotten worse since I finished college.

It leaves me thinking I have to baby her all the time, but I usually don't know what to do. 90% of the time, I feel as though I'm not taking care of myself as much or focusing on my life plans/goals much; the thought of trying to make sure my mom doesn't spazz out is usually in the back of my mind. I guess... no matter what I do or say, she'll spazz out anyway.

She likes to compete against me. Spreads rumors about me at her work to make herself look better. She was upset that she didn't get to go to work on Saturday because of the ceremony, even though she had the option to not go anyway. But going back to the ""obligation to go,"" she thinks nothing is fair when you're a parent. She claims her life had been complete shit ever since I came into the picture, and believes I owe her (a lot of money) for having been around.

Well, I'm sorry to break it to you, but... I didn't ask to be born.

I remember as a kid, she used to threaten to put me up for adoption. Or drop me off at the police station so they could deal with me (for being a ""bad child""). I wish she had done either of those things.

I'm about to head off to work now. It's always a long drive for me (2 hours to and from), but I enjoy it because it gives me a peaceful mind knowing I'm away from the house for a bit.

It's an internship, to be exact, so the pay isn't enough to move out with, but it could turn into a full-time job so I hope I get it after the internship period is over so I can get out of this house.

I'm kind of freaking out that I put this off for so long and I feel like I'm stuck in the mud and have no idea what to do. Ideally, I would like to go to grad school but I haven't taken the GMAT exam and haven't applied to any schools. I have a 2.9 gpa and a around a 3.0 gpa for accounting and I wish to pursue going for the CPA whenever that may be

Do any of you have any advice of what my next steps should be? Thank you so much for taking the time to read this

I am a recent college graduate that has obtained two B.B.A.'s.  One in Management, and the other in Marketing.  

I am finding it incredibly difficult to land that entry level job in the marketing industry.  I have tried to reach out and talk to some alumni in my area, but they either never respond or offer poor advice such as contacting other alumni or emailing people.  I have been trying to email businesses and other contacts but it leads to dead ends or no responses.

I am constantly on Indeed.com searching in my city, as well as other cities for marketing positions but I cannot find any relevant jobs that are not either shady or pure sales.  I am not opposed to sales but some of these jobs are 100% commission with zero work life balance.  Also any of the jobs I have applied for I never get, or very rarely get a phone interview which I do well on but for some reason never make it onto the next step (these are usually for social media positions).I have a professional website and twitter as well.

I have applied to a broad range of marketing jobs, but usually not sales jobs unless I view the company as stable and ethical.  I also try to apply for social media jobs as well.  I have 2 1/2 years experience being an accounting intern and 1 1/2 year of being a public relations intern.  I also have 7 years of leadership experience, and I have had friends and others view my resume and it appears to be pretty good.

Sorry for the wall of text I am just really frustrated as I have been applying and looking for jobs since January.  Does anyone have some advice to perhaps further help what I am already doing, or something I should do better?"
25y4vr,3,2014-05-19,How much is too much?,nalgenethis,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/25y4vr/how_much_is_too_much/,"Hello all,


I'm 29/m, and my awesome gf is 26/f.  We met a year ago in a very romantic way.  In short, we barely knew each other but hit it off and whimsically booked plane tickets to Indonesia together, after which we got to know each other much more, then we fell in love while overseas.  Upon returning back home, our living situation was a bit atypical: she was transitioning careers (had given up her research position at an Ivy League lab), and I was doing a summer research internship elsewhere.  Since she was now (deliberately) unemployed and was just going to teach herself necessary knowledge as she applied for jobs in her new field and thus had freedom to live wherever, we immediately decided to move-in together during my out-of-state summer job, and afterwards when I returned back to school.  This lasted for 6 months and went great between us, but she was often bored, lonely at home while I worked, and at times battled severe depression.


She landed a good job out-of-state in January.  I've made enormous attempts to be there for her, as she struggles with stresses of the job, family, and other stresses.  She became suicidal.  I interrupted school for (7) 1-week trips during the semester to see her and to try to help put her back together.  Around March, as she was suicidal, she surprisingly decided to take a break from our relationship and broke up with me (for no tangible reasons that she could pinpoint about me).  That didn't last long, and we've been back together ever since.


 She saw a psychologist and psychiatrist for a while, but stopped and is handling depression is much better now; when I visit her, it's like she's her original self and there is no sadness.  It's only when I'm in my normal, out-of-state home away from her that she's struggling.  The reality is her job does suck in that it's way too demanding and she just handles stress very poorly. She truly deserves a less-demanding job, and it's over-working her big-time.  Plus, the town she's in is tiny and depressing for her (it would be for me, too).  So, she wants to quit the job and accept a new job in my city, which is great for our relationship; however, we both know that long-term, she shouldn't live up north with me because the cold winters negatively affect her mood.  So, ideally, she should move to FL or CA, and when I'm done with school, I move to be with her (which I'd be happy to do).


So, here's the deal: although she isn't suicidal, her general mood is often very sad.  It's not bipolar, but it nearly is.  She's happy each day, but she misses me like crazy but almost every single day she gets really down for at least one of these:

* job

* family stress

* physical issues (her stomach and vagina have both been occasionally giving her problems for months, dr appts are scheduled but 1 month away).

* roommates (pretty unhealthy, dramatic situation that her roommates are in with each other; she's not involved)

* missing me


I've been essentially a caregiver for the vast majority of our relationship.  I'm always taking care of her (e.g., calling appointments, handling logistics for her, driving her everywhere when I'm in town, cooking every meal for her (which I like to do)), and she really appreciates my help.  I've had 2 medical issues during our 1 year relationship, and she's been incredibly supportive and there for me, too.  She loves me with all her heart, and she's very caring and wants to know about me and be there for me.  So, the love isn't 1-sided.  However, the tone of our relationship is often one where I'm just lending support and trying to be there for her -- where she's either doing okay and is fairly happy for half the day, then the other I'm helping her cope with her sadness.  She's applying for new jobs in my city now, and she desperately wants to move in with me again.  I love her so much, but I just keep feeling like I give, give, give, and that it's comparable to how a parent must feel with a struggling, sad teenager.  That's a strong, weird thing for me to say, I realize.


I should say, we are able to have fun though.  When we're together, she tends to be able to make me laugh, too, and I truly enjoy spending every minute with her.  It's just that nearly everyday I assume this giving role, to the point that it makes me feel helpless and sad that I can't ""fix"" all of her issues she's battling.  Related, my dad and mom are very poor and are struggling.  Dad has been suicidal for last 7 years, and as the only child, I'm essentially a parent for my parents, although long-distance.  I take care of a lot for them, both financially and emotionally, I'm their crutch big time.


So, my vague question: how much is too much to give.  I love her so incredibly much, and I consider her the love of my life, but I realize it's important for each person to feel happy and confidence in life without the other person, and for their happiness not be entirely contingent and derived from being in the relationship with the other person.  She's not happy without me.  I am what makes her happy.  I want to be with her, but I also want her to be happy independent of me, which looks very unlikely.  I can't build her up and make her whole.  I don't know what to do.  I want her to feel complete without me, and I wish she could handle stress better -- especially when I think of how she would serve as a mother (she'd be awesomely caring, but I could imagine her pouting and secluding herself to a room anytime things get hectic).


Does this constitute that maybe I should say we take a break from the relationship?  How can I help her more?  Maybe things will be much better once she switches jobs again?


p.s. the sex is amazing.  2-6 orgasms a day for her when I visit her, and 1-3 for me.


If you've read all of this, you deserve a cookie and a hug!  So, thanks!"
25y6qh,15,2014-05-19,Need advice about roommate,BucolicLove,actuallesbians,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuallesbians/comments/25y6qh/need_advice_about_roommate/,"Hey there,
Haven’t known about this subreddit for long. I don’t have a lot of fellow LGBT friends, and I need some advice from humans who understand what it’s like being a lesbian.

My partner and I moved into my friend Andy's basement within the last year to overcome some economic and health related hardship. He’s a straight guy I worked with for a couple years, and always considered upstanding, until recently. Things have been going great - he’s a veteran, and although we don’t always see eye-to-eye, it’s been a fairly harmonic, win-win situation for all three of us. We’ve helped him out in certain ways, by offering gardening assistance, by being sisterly and listening to his troubles, and he’s given us a fairly cheap place to rent during a really rough patch.

My partner is sick with adrenal fatigue and genetic inability to process Vitamin B/Folate issue, and we just found that out. She’s been losing hair and has migraines and physical pain all the time, so she’s not been able to give a lot because she’s very weak. We don’t have insurance, and can’t afford the cheapest ones we’ve found. 

This last year, I’ve returned to college to complete a degree to get our family to a better place. My partner, “Anne,” has been working +50 hrs/week in a caustic work environment on top of her illness, providing income while I’ve been driving 12-16 hours a week for full time upper level undergrad courses. I’ve been living out of my car at times to finish this degree: it’s cheaper than renting near where my college is, and Andy helped us by giving low rent costs so we can afford health care and I can get this degree.

Summer has struck, and I have more time at home, which I’m not accustomed to - most of the time I’ve been studying in our one-bedroom, or driving. Because Anne has been severely ill, we haven’t cleaned our portion of the house, but neither had Andy cleaned his portion, who is also in college full-time. 

Since I’ve been home from college, I’ve noticed Andy has a cruel streak, one I didn’t know about while we were working together, or while I’ve been in hyper-focus-4.0GPA-mode. 

Andy seems to be one of those humans who teases ruthlessly and pushes the shock-button continually “in jest.” He doesn’t tease Anne, she thinks it’s because she hasn’t reacted to it, so he stopped. He’s said some fairly offensive things while I’ve lived here, but I figured, meh, some people are like that, they may not mean it, it’s just how they blow off steam - and this is what he’s affirmed. Offensive = racist and misogynist comments.

Anne and I both feel Andy has some PTSD from Iraq - he’s seeing a therapist about that right now; suicide is very common in his unit, more than the average for the military branch he is a part of. We have been attempting kindness and compassion - we are both older than Andy, and have seen crap ourselves, so we have felt we could be sort of the safe confessors.  I think he’s seeing therapy because of some of the honest questions he’s asked of me and Anne, and our honest replies. 

This guy doesn’t like to express emotion. He’s also had a rough semester. He’s been working 2 part time jobs, one a night shift, while going to university full time, and he was dating a girl who, younger than he, also had depressive issues. They had a pregnancy scare, and this freaked his girlfriend out and she kind of backed out of the relationship after that, until they were broken up (apparently amiably, but all happening in the same week as finals). My partner and I have both been trying to be kind to him, because to us this is a ton of stress! However, he insists he’s not stressed, and that he’s fine, although he’s been drinking more, and he’s been increasingly cruel in his teasing.

Last week we had our first ‘roommate fight.’ He kept making passive-aggressive comments about cleanliness, also saying things like, “you’re still tired? Huh” - this is less than a week after I’ve completed a 4.0 at the 2nd best college in the country for my degree. He also passive-aggressively alluded to how I was lazy because I don’t have a job and my partner does, which really irked me because I’ve been working to carry the household load of my sick spouse, while trying to get a summer internship, and clean, on top of offering him landscape/gardening help and being wiped from a rough semester! 

I flew off at him because he had been giving me these passive-aggressive hits all day, saying that if he had a problem with me, he needed to tell me directly, because I wouldn’t know unless he did. He got all red in the face, which looked honestly like shock and guilt that I had caught him abusing me, and then tried to have a conversation about it with me. I was so upset I had to leave: I resist being violent in my family-generated fighting style, a thing I want to leave in my past, and I don’t like angry confrontations. He was trying to apologize, but I couldn’t deal with that until I calmed down. When alone, I figured, I’m a frayed wire, I was probably over-reacting because I was exhausted, so I apologized for flying off the handle, and he apologized for what he said - that he wasn’t trying to allude to anything. 

Things have been awkward since. 
This weekend was the planned weekend to help him landscape. He has one day off a week, that one day was yesterday. He left early for Home Depot, giving me no direction on helping him, so I cleaned my fridge waiting for him to get back. This greatly delayed landscaping.

The dude moves until he drops, and I can’t keep up, but feel the social pressure that I’m expected to. I also feel he is jealous of me because of my grades, and this jealousy comes out sideways through other competitions and one-upmanship’s. He tried for all A’s this semester, but with the crap he had going on, he couldn’t. And I did, and he hasn’t congratulated me about it, but rather has acted weird about it since I got my grades, and he’s gotten his 2.5GPA. I couldn't care less, everyone has their own path to walk, but I think he cares, and competes - he’s told me he’s jealous of my school capacities before. I don’t know what to say/do about that. 

For the work, he prepped some amazing lamb in compensation of my landscaping help. My spouse also helps, and has a discount with landscaping supplies which she has given him for this project = lots of discounted money, wholesale savings.  We’ve both been extremely helpful, and kind, and compassionate to this guy. 

He had his 10+ year best guy friends over to share the lamb last night. Turns out all three of them when together exacerbate the cruelty. At least one of them was drunk, and this guy is Andy’s best friend, who he weekly works with at a brewery. Andy was at least tipsy, and the other guy is LDS and not exactly gay-friendly. It was insanely awkward. These guys didn’t help with the labor, so it was Andy and me doing most of the work, and really, me doing most of it because Andy doesn’t know shit about plants. 

The comments made last night were aggressively misogynistic, aggressively homophobic, and aggressively cruel. All in “jest.” There were also some insanely white-supremacist comments made, in a multi-racial neighborhood, and I don’t agree with these comments at all! I was so shocked, sitting there in the mud, putting in this guys plants, as he and his friends go on about gays and blacks, and white power and how women are cunts. I was so shocked it didn’t hit me until last night, when I couldn’t sleep because of it. Now, it was mostly Andy’s friends saying these things, but it was so wrong, I don’t remember it all - I’ve blotted it out of my memory it made me so angry (coping mechanism). 

It was odd, but each time my partner left, the cruelty was directed at me. Like they’re trying to make me ‘one of the guys’ and jest with me like that, but I don’t know how to do that. I’m a motherfucking female! Tomboy, sure, but I’m still a woman! After the planting was done, I took a shower and then came up for lamb. I was going to eat then go back to our basement apartment. Anne and I came up, ate, at this point Both Andy and his best friend (the non-LDS) were drunk. Anne finished before me and went to remove the plates, and as I was getting ready to leave my roommates best friend said the following:

“So, what the fuck is wrong with you lesbians, anyway? You don’t like dick? What the fuck?! You must be fucked up - like, what the fuck did your parents do to fuck you up THAT much?” 

I was so shocked I just stood there. I said:
“Well, that’s a discussion for another time.” 

The mormon guy went:
“Oh, dude that went too far! I think she wants to get on her liberal soap box now! C’mon, girlie, let’s do it!”

And I said, 
“I hardly think this is the time. I’m not as offended as much as you think (I lied, I was traumatized, but what can I do?)”

My roommate just sat there, a stupid dear-in-headlights grin on his face, saying nothing at all.

So, I was in shock. Honestly. After all my partner and I have done to help this guy, be kind, share discounts, give physical aid, and then to have that happen, I couldn’t fathom it. He did nothing. 

He came down later after his friends had left and apologized if he or his friends had offended us. That they had gotten a ""little out of line"" at the end, and that they don’t mean it, and were only “kidding.” It’s all in jest, he said. I looked at him and said, “don’t worry, you’re just being guys.” and I tried to mean it, tried to be the bigger person, convinced myself in that moment I did mean it.  But, really, I feel so totally trapped, furious, and sick.

I couldn’t sleep last night. I was so angry. I was so hurt, and I feel so stuck. I don’t want to live here anymore, but I’m not in the economic situation to do anything about it right now that I can see. I’m waiting to hear back on a paid internship. If we can, Anne and I both want to move closer to my college, because it’s a much more liberal area than the conservative military town we’re now in, and because Anne also wants to finish her degree - she just was able to get a better job than I could with retail experience, so she was fronting the living costs while I was in school this year.  With these comments from Andy, I  have NO IDEA what to do. I have until August before I go back to college, and I can’t deal with this every day. I can’t deal with this kind of two-faced bullshit. The company one keeps says a lot about a person - if these are Andy’s best friends, does Andy feel the same? When he is with Anne and me, we have fun together, but when I’m alone with him, he says really weird shit, passive aggressive biting comments that he doesn’t say to Anne, and I can’t handle it. I’m at breaking point.

I may sleep in my car tonight. Or go to my mothers, and my mother and partner don’t get along so this is really hard. We have no where else to go right now, and Anne said she can’t sleep in the car still keep her job.  So, I feel stuck, and I don’t know what to do. I don’t know what to say to Andy - I have to be honest, I have to tell him it actually did break my trust in him, right? Or, should I try to keep quiet? What do you guys suggest I do?

We have a little savings, but not enough to get us through until August, esp. moving to the college town - doing the move means Anne loses her job. 

Any ideas would be helpful. Sorry this is so long. I just don’t know what to do.






=========


EDIT/UPDATE: Thanks for reading my verbose saga.

My actions with Roommate were a fusion of your collective advice coupled with gut intuition. I wrote him a letter when I wasn't angry, explaining why I was hurt, the boundaries I required to maintain personal wellness, and asking if he held the same caustic anti-gay crap opinions his best friend did. He read it and we talked the next day. The Wifely-One wasn't about (so important she has a title), and as an individual she's got her own journey with him.

It was... weird. He said, ""He was sorry I chose to take it personally, and chose to be hurt about it, but that he wasn't going to apologize for himself, and he wasn't going to apologize for he and his friends jesting."" So, he didn't apologize. I asked him if he felt that way about lesbians and women, and gayness in general, and he said, ""Honestly? No. I don't care. If you find someone to love, whatever. If I find someone to love who isn't a girl, whatever."" 

And then, he asked me to help him garden.

I guess I have no backbone, but I helped, mainly because I love plants and wanted to do something pretty outside, and also I'm emotionally exhausted and don't give a fuck and can't fight with a dude trained in fighting. He's been avoiding me and my Wifely-One since, which has been nice: I like privacy/boundaries. During the conversation, he used phrases like ""I'm a loser,"" and ""I'm an idiot"" more times than I've heard him say before. He also said he'd 'reign in his teasing.' So, I guess he feels bad, but he won't apologize. It isn't his responsibility to apologize for his homophobic bestie. I asked that he let my Wifely-One and I know when his friends would come over, to remove ourselves from them, and he complied.

Right now, our plan is to get the hell out of here as fast as possible, but as cautiously as possible. I've been commuting &gt;400miles/week to complete a degree in a different city, while the wifely-one has been working as a manager in the conservative city we live in (this insanity was cheaper than living in the college town). She wants to finish her degree also, and the management place isn't working well with her health issues, so we're planning on moving up to the college town before summer's done to both finish. We're in our 30s and finishing college has been difficult, lacking familial support. I hope to keep the peace here for a couple months longer. Fingers crossed, and thanks for listening. I don't really have any lesbian friends, so you guys are my community :-) Blessings.  "
25ya18,9,2014-05-19,Proper Protocol for an Internship,mizdictator,architecture,https://www.reddit.com/r/architecture/comments/25ya18/proper_protocol_for_an_internship/,"I have recently graduated with a B.S. in Architecture and through my part-time job as a waitress met an older architect (we'll call him Richard) who was ecstatic to have potential help with computer work and I was ecstatic to have a foot in the door.

He is working on the expansion of a company and designing some new buildings for their complex. I went to the interview process with HR of the company but have not filled out any proper paperwork, taken a drug test, or been officially hired. Even before I went to the interview this Richard started giving me assignments. HR member said that was a no-no because I was not on payroll. 

Last Friday at about 7pm Richard sent me another email asking for some CAD work due for Monday. I was out celebrating my friend's birthday so I did not promptly return the email. The next morning at 9am he called my cell phone to insist that this work must be done for Monday. My long-term boyfriend's family was coming down to visit so I said that I would not have time. This was when Dick became irate.

""If you cannot spare 30 minutes to do this for Monday"" he said ""I should just find someone else to fill the position.""

I have been compliant with Dick so far. However, I have also BCC a member of HR (the one who was interviewing me) with my messages to Dick. At first Richard was insistent that I ""had the job"" but Dick is now telling me that I need to go through his interview process to see if I fulfill his requirements which includes various AutoCAD assignments. 

It seems like Dick is trying to get me to do free work for him with little to no intent to hire me. I have never had a job or internship in the architecture field so I really would like the experience so I can at least move up in the world. The first job is the hardest.

Is this common practice in the architecture field to give assignments before being officially employed?

Should I stick it out and help Dick out or should I call it a lost cause and pursue careers elsewhere?

**Edit:** I am cutting my losses for a lot of the reasons discussed below. Most of what was discussed I had inclinations about before this post but I just wanted a second opinion. Thank you for the clarifications and advise!"

I'm a long time Toronto native that will moving to Ottawa soon to complete a 3 month internship, and I was looking for a couple tips before I came.  

I see you have Bixi, but I was wondering if its worth it to get my own bike (cheaply), and then sell it after.  

I checked out your craigslist for housing, but I'm a little dismayed with the choices.  I realize its a bad month to move (mid June/July to Sept), but I was hoping to find a cool place soon.  I was hoping there might be some other sources Ottawa specific that I am not aware of.  I'll be looking mostly for places around the Hill and the government office area, Sandy Hill, and Ottawa U areas.  

Since I'm single, I'll be looking to meet women and cool guys to hang out with.  Where is the best area/places to do this?  Also, best places to watch the World Cup games? I'll be cheering mostly for the latin countries (Spain, Brasil, Ecuador, Argentina, but also Germany).

25yzzh,1,2014-05-19,"Why I'm a ""Failure""",1stWorldFailure,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/25yzzh/why_im_a_failure/,"I put ""failure"" in quotes because i'm really not a failure, I don't have an awful addiction, i've never been arrested, i'm a high school graduate and a current student at a solid university, love the career path I have a very good internship in (in the medical field). Before i start this, I'm not depressed, dont have any medical/mental conditions, and actually like life right now.  I hate calling myself a failure because i know people have real problems that i have never and know i couldn't even begin to comprehend, while i have little to no real issues.  So I'm only a failure in the terms that i've defined for myself.

While I have all these good things going for me, here's why i feel like a failure.  I seriously don't think I can remember the last time I gave something my full effort, or earned something.  I'm from a well off family (not Rich, but my family is doing good for themselves), with just about the most supportive parents and extended family of all time. I've always done ""good enough"" in school, was a solid B student in HS, and was able to do so without much (and by much i mean none) effort. That was constant throughout my entire HS career, in all aspects.  Never went to a party, never had a GF, never drank, never smoked, didn't really hang out with anyone.  But i seriously can't take anything i do seriously, I've been on the cusp of getting kicked out of school, and still haven't been able to concentrate on my schoolwork, or even give an effort towards passing classes. While my parents are able to pay for my classes, I can't even try hard enough to not completely waste their money for me to go to college.  I've failed many important classes, and barely passed others.

But this isn't just about school. I'm a big guy, who's extremely self conscience.  Ever since I was a little kid, my parents were on me about my weight (since they struggled with weight issues, as well as some health concerns tied to it). And I try to blame them for that, but i know it isn't them.  And this, mixed with my inability to try at ANYTHING, has lead me to become someone who has never even tried to have a girlfriend, and never had sex, as a 23 year old college student.  Its literally become anything outside my comfort zone is off limits.  In HS and up until a year ago in college, I was someone who never had any close friends, my childhood friends all ended up in a different ""group"" as me, and I desperately tried to fit in with a group of people i didn't belong with, which lead to me not really doing anything in HS, ever. I played football in HS, and wasn't very good, but since middle school i've been made of for being a big guy, and honestly didn't care, and i know a lot of people say that they dont care, but i honestly didn't care, after a little bit of time, it became a sense of pride, especially as an offensive lineman in high school, where it was just a group of us big dudes.  But i've never been good talking with new people, or meeting new people, that aren't in my really close friends, which makes it even harder to meet girls, especially when my best friends are complete extroverts and get lots of girls, pretty easily.  I over-analyze the absolute shit out of anything that i say to almost anybody, other than my friends, so unless what i'm saying is completely scripted or i have a very good idea of what i'm talking about, it comes out wrong or with a stutter (i dont normally have a stutter problem, especially when i'm with my friends).

But that leads to an extension of the not trying at anything, seriously not caring about anything. There's very few things that I care about, at all, and would get offended if happened.  And usually if something goes far enough to seriously piss me off, i'm far too big of a ""miled mannored person"", or as most call it, a pussy to do anything about it.

I've thought of awesome plans, of what i'm going to do in the future, and not once have I followed through on any of them.  Most of them related to losing weight or studying, since thats 90% of my life right now.  But the fact that I can't try at anything has made me feel like such a piece of shit, especially when i spend most of my time doing absolutely nothing, and ignoring whatever I could be doing.

Thats the end of what i had to get off my chest, probablly gonna get downvoted to hell, dont really care, just looking for something to vent to, thanks reddit...lol"

25zdi2,1,2014-05-19,Should I[19/M] Just give up on [20/F]?,throwaway3454321,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/25zdi2/should_i19m_just_give_up_on_20f/,"So 3 years ago I met the girl who I wanted to spend my life with, she was funny and laughed at all my stupid jokes, loved to play guitar and sing with me, told me she thought I was her soul mate, everything felt like I was in a romantic comedy, including the fact that she had a boyfriend. He was the kind of guy who was controlling and a dick to her at times, he never hit her but he would punch walls and break her phone from time to time; and of course like every romantic comedy, there was just something about him that made him worth staying with, figures. 

And that's when she got pregnant....

Fast forward a year, we haven't talked in months because I didnt want to break up a relationship that involved a child. But one day I get a call from her telling me that her and her BF (I'll call him C) broke up because he had been cheating since before the baby, and even more so afterwards. At this point I was living 1300 away on an internship for a year, but we decide to start talking again.

Things are going better than ever, we make plans to meet up when I come back for Christmas to visit family, and we do, and one thing leads to another and we have sex a couple times over the course of the week. Here's where I made a mistake, she wanted to make things official, but a combination of me living so far away, and her having a child made me very hesitant, and I told her I couldn't do that at least not untill I was living in the same state as her.

Fast forward again to another year or so later when I move back home. We are very excited to see each other and I decide that I want to spend a day with her and her daughter, with my intentions being to ask her out once I feel comfortable with the idea of dating a girl with a child. Things go great at first, her daughter loves me, and I start to really get attached to the idea of being part of their lives. But like every romantic comedy, there's a catch.

She has been seeing some guy who started out as her stalker, but for some reason her loneliness combined with possibly my not wanting to date her while I was out of state, drove her to sleep with him, and to start having feelings for him. She tells me things are weird at the moment and that we should just be friends for a while and that apparently this stalker of hers is dangerous at times and she's afraid what would happen if the two of us were to be together. She tells me she still thinks I'm her soul mate and that she really wants to remain friends until she gets her head straight.

But it was too much for me, I told her that I couldn't just be friends with her, not after everything we had done to get to this point. It's been a week since I told her I cant talk to her anymore and that I wished her the best. I thought that by breaking off contact I would realize it wasn't worth it and I would start to move on, but I've just been feeling worse and worse about the situation.

Should I swallow my pride and try and make things work out (which I'm not sure was possible, even before cutting off contact) or should I just keep trying to forget about her?

If you read all of that, thank you so much, I couldn't think of a way to make it any shorter, if you have any advice, questions, or personal wisdom to give me, it would be greatly appreciated. "

I was originally coding it all by myself, but need some help to meet a deadline and to leave me more time to focus on business development.

My application is written in Python/Django and incorporates the Twitter Bootstrap and JQuery/UI. Prior experience with these technologies is preferred but not required. Some minimal web-development knowledge or experience is required, but a willingness and proof of ability to learn new frameworks is more important. 

As this is a very early-stage startup with minimal funding, we can only offer an unpaid internship at this time. For this reason, we are hoping to attract students or those looking to expand their experience and resume. We hope to be able to offer paid internships soon after launch!

Position is open now and will be filled as soon the right candidate is found. 

Thank you for your applications. PM me with a letters of interest/resumes/questions/etc.

26044f,1,2014-05-19,I need a raise,[deleted],self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/26044f/i_need_a_raise/,"I'm 18 years old and a fresh high school graduate. Last summer, I began an internship at a small web development company. The company is very small, there are less than ten of us, and its a great company. I like everyone I work with and get along really well with my boss. It's a relaxed environment, and I really couldn't ask for a better workplace. I'm getting ready to work a full 40-hour schedule again this summer from my 14 hours I worked through the school year.

The only thing I'm not satisfied with is my pay. When I interviewed last year, I came unprepared. I didn't come in with a number in mind, and when we got to talking about wage, I threw out $10/hr, which my now boss accepted without hesitation.

In retrospect, I think that wage was more acceptable when I first started. I thought going in that I knew everything I would need to know, and man was I wrong. I had a ton to learn, and I have. I'm to the point now that I would consider myself a competent developer.

My boss and I talk a lot throughout the day. At one point we got around to talking about what larger companies like Target and Walmart pay their workers. He then asked how much he pays me, noticed how close they were, and remarked ""I should pay you more."" I took this to mean I would be getting a raise, but didn't pursue any further. These conversations are always pretty casual, and if I wanted to see results from them I should have more seriously pressed for a raise.

All this to say, I think I deserve a raise. I'm going to be spending the majority of my summer at work trying to save up for college. It'd be great to be building an even bigger savings.

How do I start this conversation? It seems like larger companies have all of this mapped out, with things like performance reviews and other regular things.

But what do I do when its just me, my boss, and a few other people in the office?"

Some background: I'm an asian high school senior. For the past four years, I've been working my ass off to get into a good school. I have a 4.35 gpa for grades 10-12, a 2320 SAT score, 800 in Biology, 760 in Math II for my SAT IIs, and I have a bunch of AP tests under my belt. I've been doing taekwondo for over half my life, and done a variety of extracurriculars; working a part time job as a TA at a summer school, tutoring kids another summer, working at an internship for a biology research clinic, etc etc. I asked the teachers that I got on well with to write me letters of recommendation. Come April, I discover I've gotten into literally zero colleges. None. FUCKING NONE. UCI, UCSD, Wash U St Louis. All waitlisted me. All my other schools (among them UCLA, UC Berkeley, and USC) rejected me. Then comes May 15th, when I find out NONE of my waitlisted schools have chosen to admit me. What have I been fucking working my ass off these past four years for? Everything feels so fucking USELESS. I guess being an Asian STEM major just means the cards are stacked against me. And these past few months I've slowly been descending into a downward spiral of laziness and lack of motivation. And maybe this is me being a bit arrogant, but I don't think I'm meant for community college at all. The lack of motivation and drive there would just stifle me. Yes, you get the same degree, but everyone says that I'll get bogged down, and I haven't worked my ass off to go to community college. So fuck me for wanting to get a higher education, I guess. Fuck my hard work. Fuck the college admissions process.

Also, among other things, my prom date ditched me for another guy who asked her 15 minutes after she said yes to me, I got into a minor car accident, and my parents want to increasingly get involved into everything I do because they feel I can't do anything by myself anymore because ""I failed the first time."" I'm just angry, but I think above all I'm the most angry at myself.
Maybe I would have gotten into a better school if I worked harder. Maybe I wouldn't have been left by my date if I had a fucking spine and asked her sooner. Maybe I wouldn't have hit my car if I had been more careful. Maybe I wouldn't have rapidly dropping grades if I wasn't such a self hating and unmotivated sack of shit.

I fucking hate everything."

261sqt,1,2014-05-20,I (20M) am in a long distance relationship of almost 3 years with 21F and I don't know whether or not to stick with it,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/261sqt/i_20m_am_in_a_long_distance_relationship_of/,"We started dating right after high school and really hit it off. Things were great for the first two years. We skyped and we talked all the time and always tried to see each other as much as possible. Unfortunately she goes to school 6 hours away from me. However, we maintained a very close relationship and were genuinely excited to be together for the long haul. 

The only time we get to be together and see each other is vacations and long weekends where she comes home. For the last two years she has decided to stay up at school for the Summer in order to take some classes and do research for her resume. The first time she did this was for an internship where she would be two hours away from me for the fall semester, something that was really awesome. This summer she will be up there for the summer, fall, and spring. 

This last semester (Spring 14) was tough for both of us. She wasn't used to school, having been out of it for a year, and I was struggling with my mental health. I had had issues with depression and anxiety before and this semester was particularly tough on me and my mental health. She freaked out midway through the semester and did what she usually does, shut herself off from everyone, including me. I freaked out at the end of the semester and did what I usually do, talk it out. This is where I think the problem started. 

She thinks that I am relying on her too much for my happiness, and it puts a lot of pressure on her. I will admit, I did dump a lot of my issues on her and I don't really have anyone else to talk to intimately like I do with her. I get why this can be seen as a lot of pressure. I can't get over how distant she's been this last semester. She is a terrible texter and sometimes goes a day or two without talking to me in any form. She wasn't like this until her internship last fall. I understood it during the fall because I got to see her every week or so, but it continued when she got back to school as well. We both have a good group of friends at our schools as well and we do have people other than each other to keep us busy, but we have always maintained a close relationship. 

Last week, she visited me while I live near school for the Summer. We had a good time. I was still mental and was struggling with it. I am getting help now and I think it will work, though. So on the last day she was here, I had an anxiety attack and was freaking out over nothing (like usual). I told her about it the next day and she did the typical girlfriend stuff of ""It will all be ok, i love you, etc."" A couple days after she left, we had a talk about our relationship unlike any we had ever had. I thought there was a problem with us, but I also thought it was a result of my mentality. In the conversation we agreed that we wanted to be together, but we also acknowledged the distance between us was starting to be a problem. I let her know I thought it was because we hadn't been talking as much. And she let me know that my mental health was scaring her and making it tough. We agreed we would try to maintain our relationship and get better at what we had to get better at. 

The thing is, I am not convinced she is willing to change. She still doesn't talk to me as much as we used to and I still feel as if she doesn't want to be with me. Even though she just told me she wanted to be with me. I love this girl and I really don't want to lose her, but it's becoming difficult to convince myself I deserve this. The biggest issue I am facing is that I think I am putting in way more effort to make this work than she is. We were perfect for two and a half years. I mean perfect. I never doubted us and I was never worried about us. Recently its all I can think about. I don't know what to do. We just had a conversation about the relationship and yet I feel like we need to have another. So is it even worth it? I am beginning to think I deserve better than a girl who doesn't even talk to me and that is ""dangerous"" thinking. I don't know what to do anymore. Is it over?


TL;DR-- Long distance relationship, like 6 hours long, is becoming increasingly difficult because of my mental health and her lack of communication. We've been together for 3 years and just had a conversation where we decided to try and make it work. The distance is becoming difficult and it doesn't feel like she wants to change for it to work and I am beginning to think I deserve better. I don't want to leave her, but its feeling like I have no choice. "

261xi2,8,2014-05-20,Having Trouble With Motivation Without My Running Partner,ProletarianParka,xxfitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/261xi2/having_trouble_with_motivation_without_my_running/,"So a few weeks back, I was talking to my SO about how I wanted to get better at running. He is in great shape, and was pretty ecstatic, so he set up a plan for us to follow and would go out with me every time I ran. During, he would make jokes, ask me how I was doing, encourage me, and generally make running, an activity which I usually avoid-at-all costs, bearable, if not occasionally fun. He was super supportive, and would always tell me he was proud, etc. after a run, and I generally ended them on a good note.

Unfortunately, last week he was called away unexpectedly for the next month and a half for some job-related stuff. Now I am left trying to run on my own, and it is not going well at all. I am going shorter distances, feeling unmotivated to complete the run, and putting a lot more walking breaks in between miles. During I feel frustrated and unhappy. Afterwards I feel unaccomplished and depressed. I am seriously considering giving up.

I have looked into getting someone else to go with me, but most of my friends have summer commitments to internships, studying abroad, etc. and aren't around to go, or just plain old not interested.

I want to continue running so I can impress my SO when he gets back, as well as improve myself, but am struggling with doing it by myself. I'm just wondering if any of ya'll have some advice for my particular situation."
2620bf,10,2014-05-20,I'm fucking tired of feeling like I'm always so far behind my peers and friends in everything I do. I feel like everyone else's life goes so smoothly.,down_the_toilet,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2620bf/im_fucking_tired_of_feeling_like_im_always_so_far/,"Graduted 5 months ago with a degree in mechanical engineering with a solid GPA but no work experience. I have had zero luck with job hunting. I'm stuck living in my mom's house in a new town where I know no one. Meanwhile, all my friends are raking in $55-65k jobs, buying houses, and getting married. I'm so fucking tired of all of this. Did I really fuck up my entire career by not getting a fucking internship? All I hear about these internships is how people just sit around and push paper all day. How is that good experience? Why is it so important? I feel like I've completely barred myself from the career in aerospace I've always dreamed of because I didn't get some damn paper pushing internship in school. Almost all of my friends had jobs before they graduated or within a month or two. Here I am staring down the 6 month mark with student loans breathing down my neck. 

The job search is the biggest load of bullshit I've ever seen. These companies leave postings open for fucking months at a time during which they accumulate literally hundreds of applications. How the fuck is a single person suppose to get noticed in a stack of shit like that? I've been perfectly qualified for all of the jobs I've applied for. Hell, I don't even have a problem finding jobs that require zero work experience but I just never hear anything back. Don't even get me started on big a waste of time cover letters are too. Can I make them sound nice and fancy? Yeah I've gotten pretty damn good at it by now but its all just grade A bullshit too. ""Multifunctional team"" ""dynamic team environment"" what the fuck do these even mean? I'm so sick of all this pointless HR jargon that I have to sprinkle in my cover letter to get it past the screening programs. God, just bring me in for an interview and let me show you that I'm smart and enthusiastic and ready to learn. 

I applied to my dream job at a company a few days ago. They were looking for an entry level engineer to work on the next generation manned spacecraft. This has been my dream for literally over a decade. I would fucking do this job for minimum wage. I wrote a passionate, yet professional cover letter, explaining my experience and how I was qualified for the job. Will I ever hear anything? Probably not. And if I do, it'll be like 6 months from now. I tried my hand at ""networking"" for this too. I saw on Linkedin that I had some 2nd degree connections at the branch where the job was located so I got in contact with the people I knew and asked if they could help me get in touch with someone there. My professor replies saying that he doesn't really know the guy he is connected to and that its a huge company so probably doesn't have any say in hiring regardless. Strike 1. My friend Facebook messages the girl he knows there but she hasn't responded yet. Probably strike 2. I feel like the universe is actively trying to stop me from getting a good job with this bullshit. Would it really be that hard for that girl to email my friend a hiring manager's email address? Does she not know how big of a difference she could make in someone's life with like 1 minute of her time? So I probably won't be getting a job I'll actually enjoy. I'm afraid at this point, if I do get an offer, I'll be for some shit job I don't want to do but I'll be forced to take it. 

The worst part of all of this? I feel like I can see how all these problems will compound in the future to make my future suck too. If I get a shit job not in my field of choice with a low starting salary, then employers will see that and it'll still be hard to get a good job in an interest field. All I wanted was to get a job I could see myself doing for the next 2-3 years without having to keep applying. Chances are I'm going to be stuck in the same damn part of the country I grew up in too. I can't fucking escape the south and midwest. God, I want out of this hell hole. 

I can see how being poor creates a cycle that perpetuates being poor. It sickens me how much of my happiness will be indirectly tied to money. I'm not asking to be rich but without money, I can't move to a place where I'd be more happy and job hunt there. I can't replace my 5 year old laptop that is literally falling apart. I can't pay to get my screwed up phone fixed. 

My biggest worry in life is turning 45 and thinking ""What went wrong?"" Both of my parents detested their jobs and I think that instilled a real fear of being unhappy in me. Regret is the worst feeling in the world, in my opinion. The feeling that you screwed up and that you can't do anything about it fucking sucks. I hate the helplessness of it. 

Sorry for the huge wall-o-text. /rant"

     &gt; Currently working an internship. Expecting to make ~6 grand+ this summer
     &gt;Expecting not to have any student loan debt coming out of school.  My father is paying for college, which I'm grateful for, however I pay him $4,500 a year to help pay for school.
     &gt;My aunt gave me ~$400 in an investment account that has been sitting doing nothing for about a year.  It's not invested into anything, which I'd like to change. 

Okay, so hopefully thats enough background information to get some good advice. 

As I mentioned before, I have $400 waiting to be invested, which I plan on adding to over the summer (so lets just say I have $1000 to invest). Pretty much, I'm planning on investing most of the money into Index funds because I know I'm not ready to confidentially invest in more risky stocks yet.  Also, I'd be happy to start putting money into some sort of a retirement account.  

So, I'm mostly looking for advice on how to wisely invest my money between index funds and retirement funds.  Thanks!

262ln2,6,2014-05-20,I want out. I do not like taking part anymore.,yaidt,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/262ln2/i_want_out_i_do_not_like_taking_part_anymore/,"Slight suddden panic attacks have become more frequent.
Not even because my life is so difficult, there are no problems I can not escape. But my stress level is through the roof because I worry about every single aspect.

**Education-wise**

I am in my third year of my bachelor degree. About to start an internship. (One more year to go after the internship. Which consists of specialization and thesis).

I am good at what I do, but I do not feel like I master it. I am like extremely average at everything. But the things I focus on I do reasonably well. I won't be the best, I won't outspecialize someone else. This sucks, since I rather focus on few things really well and help others. Facilitate instead of produce or do myself.

But knowing that in my field I will not be the best, not be a specialist. Means I won't know everything. This scares me because I hate being held responsible when I was already doubting myself. Hence why I prefer to facilitate, and not manage or lead.


**Part-time job**

It is very closely related to my degree. I learn new things everyday, but again. I am not the best, and I seemingly just dont have it in me to become the best. I constantly second guess and I do not feel comfortable delivering work which a specialist should be doing.

I need to take the time to look over a request when it comes in. In face to face situations, it is difficult to tell someone you need some time to figure it out. Eventually I get away with it, but if my boss, co-workers, or clients knew what was running through my mind. They would fire me.

**Socially**

I love going out with friends and doing new things. It is all about experiencing, since I never went out much, this is a lot of fun. But I worry constantly... Meeting girls, meeting new friends, talking to people. It all brings a dynamic which I try to dissect and understand. As we all know, emotions fuck up everything (or make something beautiful), so this intrigues me. What if I do this, will she respond in a positive or a negative way?

It is amazing as long as nobody gets hurt or too manipulative. But I feel sick to my stomach having to handle all these issues. Being there for friends who got hurt, who have problems, who just want to 'get something off their chest'. It tears me apart on the inside, where do I put my issues? I dont want to bother them, they can't help, won't do anything. I am losing myself in doing 'whats right' to help others and not what benefits me anymore.

This girl likes me, we flirt a lot. Anyone else would have stepped up the game by now... Not me. I am scared. Afraid that she might actually like me. I don't know why this scares me. I feel very uncomfortable.

**Being a weirdo**

I overthink everything. Philosophy, cultural, economical, political, social... ALL issues. My brain is constantly grinding the information and trying to find absolute perfect solutions to every problem.
Disrupt me and I'll go silent, recalibrate what you were disrupting me for... Sheepishly laugh and answer to the best of my abilities.
Unmotivated by the lack of results in previous ambitions, I am in this infinite cycle of barely getting by doing things I don't enjoy while never really getting any enjoyment out of any other aspect of my life.
I only ever feel happy or comfortable when watching movies or series.

Please help me, I am lost.
I want out, I want to quit. But I know I can't. I am part of this system now. I have obligations and am entangled in other people's well being. I am part of their life, but not of my own.

If necessary, I feel like ending it altogether because over last couple years I just noticed that I feel more and more like I will never find my place because I am so internally conflicted. But then I think of how weak it would be and I sort of postpone the thoughts to some other time.

I plan on walking in tomorrow and asking, I've already put my app in. I was told that since I didn't put down for full time they passed me up. It was a call center job, and my stats were great. They're hiring like crazy, and I have higher ups who can vouch for me. I don't mind working full time, but then that would make going to school too difficult. 

The issue is, my college is giving me the runaround. My program was supposed to be a year. I've been there for a year and 3 months now, and when I went in to class they told me they pushed my grad back to september. I failed one class, which I'm currently retaking, but they keep pushing my internship back, and adding classes that I was not told were necessary. They're really dropping the ball with my financial aid too, and because of that they keep asking me for cash payments. 

If I go back to work, school will need to be put on the back burner for a while. I want to push through and finish, but I'm tired of being broke.

Forgive me, this might be all over the place.

First he has an anger problem. He knows this and I know this. When I was younger, I had a lot of insecurity issues. I was abused heavily by mom verbally and emotionally which evolved into physical abuse (pushing and she choked me once while drunk). He also knows this.

When I say anger problem, I mean the switch gets flipped and the sweet, caring, intelligent guy I fell in love with punched holes in walls, stole my car (which I gave him the spare keys to get to work) to chase me down when I left the house, threw me through a screen door, tore down my bedroom door piece by piece when I locked him out, hit me (I hit him back eventually). Just bad bad bad. 

We separated for a year and that's when I changed. I grew up, called myself on my shit and tried to work it out. I moved to Hawaii to intern and ran short of money. We'd never really stopped talking and right before I was set to leave the island and lamented I'd have to go back to my tiny town, he offered to have me move to him in a city across the country. The move made sense and we took months to talk things through and became the couple all his friends envied. 

His family loves me. His friends love me. I wanted him to love me. And he said he did and I believe him. But the problems never really stopped. Instead of taking the stance of fighting back, I tried to convince him to try counseling. I could see the patterns of his behavior not just with me, but in life. He would feel threatened, slip into rage mode, destroy everything around him either with words or his fists, then fall into a depression.

After the depression, there was never a ""I'm sorry"". Only a ""I'm sorry, but you..."" My responses changed from ""How DARE you?!"" to ""I can't make you feel or do anything. I'm not your puppeteer""

He's in the entertainment industry. He doesn't always get paid because a lot was networking. I, too, want to be involved in the arts. But we needed a paycheck. So I landed a great job. But I became frustrated when he couldn't pay rent twice in a row and finally tried to talk to him about it.

He exploded and I paid the price from then on. He accused me of resenting him, of lying about supporting us, being too ""negative"" about his work. Maybe it was all true. I was so frustrated.

It came to a head last month (18 months after I moved here) when he said in a rage, ""YOU NEED TO MOVE OUT"" and I started looking for rooms. I gave him one last chance and he agreed to couple's counseling. The night before he exploded on me again (I don't remember why, honestly. Maybe he was scared of counseling) and I declared the relationship over.

The next day he sent me a barrage of texts on the way to counseling stating he hated me and never wanted to see again. We got through the session and things were better. We made it to another and I saw progress. The counselor called him on what I had been saying but we left with him feeling bad and saying he didn't get counseling since it was just him talking and I wasn't being called on what I did.

I wanted to make it another. But we got into argument at lunch. I tried to talk to him last night about it but he just started yelling at me so loud our neighbors called the security guard to check in. He demanded I move out (again) and, well, I was actually looking for rooms while he was yelling at me. 

Then the nastiness started. He called me a lying, little bitch. That the problem was my dad gave me too much freedom and my mother abused me so I don't know how to communicate. I was a two-faced pig. And he hated me. I had emasculated him in the relationship and acted like an authority figure. He got right in my face screaming at me until he had me laying down on my side on the bed.

We still share the apartment until I can get into my next one (seeing three this week!) and he is now in depression mode. Weeping in bed with the curtains drawn. I know he got out once today as I called a mutual friend that would keep this private (I'm not trying to ruin his career and reputation, he needs help not to be ostracized) to drop in on him while I was at work.

So why am I writing this? Because while I'm holding it together and know I don't deserve to be treated this way, I'm completely shattered inside. I feel so stupid and left to drift. When someone who knows you so well can seem to forget everything about you and then do the absolute worst thing to you while saying it's your fault, that he's only ever been like this with you, it's confusing. 

I'm worried that I am this monster he described. I caught myself thinking I could never be in a relationship again because maybe I'm just bad at it. Maybe I'll get with someone else and they'll say I'm self-absorbed and a ""horror"".

 
---   
**tl;dr**: Ended my relationship with my massively abusive boyfriend and I'm lost in a sea of thoughts that range from excited for the future to maybe I am the monster he described. "

I am a computer science student at a university and I just finished my second year of school. As soon as I got out, I began searching for a summer job and ended up getting hired as a web developer intern at an international company. 

I have had jobs before, but never anything more than minimum wage retail positions. So this is my first experience working in an office environment. 

I showed up for my first day of work and felt immediately overwhelmed. I didn't recognize any of the software they were using, the programming was almost all unfamiliar to me, and I have no idea what I'm doing. None of this was explained to me when I interviewed. 

So today was my second day. I still feel useless. I want to contribute, but I feel like I'm drowning. I'm trying to absorb as much as possible, but because I'm only here for three months, I feel like there's an expectation that I should be hitting the ground running.

I try to be self sufficient and take care of my own problems, but I've got so much to learn that I keep having to ask my boss for help. I feel like I'm burdening him and the stress of the new work environment is breaking me down. 

I have this constant pit in my stomach. I get home from work at 5pm and am so worn out that I just sleep. I am absolutely miserable and I am absolutely horrified that my boss is going to tell me to leave because I'm in over my head. 

I feel pressured that I can't live up to the expectations of my employer and I feel disappointed in myself for not being able to do my job. 

I want to succeed more than anything in the world but it's only my second day and I'm ready to implode. :("

264jcy,1,2014-05-21,Me [26-M] falling out of love with my [25-F] girlfriend of 3.5 years,readitanonymous,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/264jcy/me_26m_falling_out_of_love_with_my_25f_girlfriend/,"This is my first post to reddit, and it's going to be a small book, so bear with me. 

I've been in a monogamous relationship with my girlfriend since Dec. 25th, 2010. We've had a lot of ups, and a few really bad downs. I've broken up with her a couple of times only for her to win me back over and this is the cycle I've been with since I started college.

I've got trust issues, admittedly, and she knows this and has known this since day one mostly because every woman who has been in life has wronged me and I don't trust people easily, my father wasn't worth his salt so I tend to be actually fairly reserved with everyone tbh. 

About 6 months into our relationship, a friend who ""saved her life"" wanted to go to a concert with her, she didn't tell me about it, and said she was going to a friends wedding thing. I confronted her on the matter, nothing was going to come of it she said, and she didn't go to her friends wedding party or whatever because she was worried I wouldn't trust her at that point anyways.

Fast forward a couple of months, we got into a huge fight about my brother moving in because he had no place to go, my 3 year old nephew had no roof over his head, so I said cmon but you gotta get on your feet and handle your share of bills. We got in a huge fight and I was in a lease with her and as opposed to fighting more, and dealing with a long running issues of her unhappiness I asked my brother to find somewhere else to stay. This put some distance between us because I just had to tell my brother who has sole custody of my nephew, and my nephew, on the streets to make her happy. Not long down the road we got into a big argument over my brother again (if you want more details I'll elaborate) and i told her I was tired of having to choose between her and my family and told her we need to take a break for awhile because my family is important to me, I have no friends and she would barely allow time for family.

Within 24 hours of this, the irony is she was on the phone with her ex (who lives 2k miles away) and I caught her where she tried to deny it. I told her, in all realness it doesn't matter because I'd just broken up with her, but I thought it was rather convenient &amp;/or odd that she was on the phone and talking to her ex THAT fast.

She came around and apologized, told me she was sorry, said my brother could move in if he needed to and we started to work on things, we stayed together and renewed our lease a couple months later.

Later I found her talking to her ex again about 5 months down the road, and I lost my shit calling her out on her poor moral/ethical values in a relationship. We even ended up getting over this after some deep conversation regarding our relationship where we were both at fault for not appreciating each other for enough, showing that, and following through in it. Having thought we acknowledged these problems and started adjusting for the issues, I can accept fault where I am at fault and progress to do better. 

A couple of years have passed at this point and we are in our 3rd lease. Our sex life has came to a screeching halt for weeks at a time in several cases and I tried to discuss these issues with her and she seemed to just not be in the mood, I informed her she's not happy and I can see it, what can I do to make her happy? The real answer here was ...nothing, apparently.

We had a lot of good times, and we had some rough spots too but things ad been working out alright when suddenly our intimacy and friendship
started dwindling yet again and we signed a lease in July/August and its been about 4 months since. I work 30-35 hours a week and go to college at 15 credit hours a semester (5 classes) and my time is strung. I have literally not been to a single college party, college event, or anything else because WHEN I get free time, I choose to spend it with her doing anything, asking to do anything. Bike ride, walk, puzzle, game, movie, anything. I ask if we have problems, she says no everything is fine. one night she's acting rather ...different, quiet all night etc, and I asked a few times if everything was ok, is there anything to talk about? Yes, everything is fine, no nothing to talk about.

The next morning I woke from a bad dream, bad feeling in my gut, and I checked her phone. There were pages...and pages...and pages of FB conversation with the same ex. This is the 3rd time I've caught her talking to this guy and I absolutely lose my shit starting by snapping her phone in half, breaking my hand on a wall because of how mad I got and I didn't want to hit her, I could never hit a girl, it's simply not in my character. 

I break up with her, we're through. It's done. She begged me to hurt her for it, she felt guilty and said she deserved it. I refuse, she keeps begging me to hurt her. I told her I'm moving out, my mind is racing...wtf am I gonna go I'm in a lease and I cant afford to move, to buy out my lease, or anything. I go to leave and shes still begging me to hurt her, so I go take my gun with me because shes begging to hurt herself etc, and she goes stupid. So I took her gun, took both guns to the police station, informed them what was going on, and they followed me back to the property to ensure she was ok, after all my hands are bloody/swollen and they asked if I struck her I said of course not, they can look at the wall for proof, my skin was still on it.

We spent 2 days of her begging me, attempting to touch me even on the arm and I couldn't stand the thought of her for days. She shows me a message she sent to her ex saying he has to stop contacting her, its ruining her relationship, they are ex's for a reason, etc. I dunno how or why but at the time all I could feel is how much I loved her, and how hurt I was by this. Nothing literally happened because I KNEW he lived 2k miles away. 

tidbit of info, she goes out to Seattle, WA in May, 2013 where her friend lives and there was a literal 2 day blackout where we didn't speak or text at all and she said she was in the mountains, had some pics to prove it. A) I think she cheated on me because at the time, I didn't realize her ex was only 2 hours from where she flew to, he lived in Oregon...now having learned this shit WHILE SHE WAS THERE, and right around that blackout, my mind went a bit crazy and all I could think about was her fucking her ex.

So getting back to Feb. 2014 to this huge breakup with the cops involved, all I can think about is the one thing I loved so dearly has betrayed me unforgivingly. After she sent him that message with the only working device, my phone, I felt a little reassurance. Since both her phone, her laptop, and ipod got destroyed 2 by her, phone by me) during that argument (i was going to read whatever they discussed as i hadn't initially, just scrolled through the BOOK sized conv. they had over FB) she wasn't on electronics again for a couple weeks until I bought her another phone after things had started to go back to normal, whatever that was at this point. I tried to make myself forget about this, put this behind me

Now here we are, its May a few months later. Shes already fallen back into online social hole of spending hours on FB and Pinterest and dusting me off when she gets bored there. I love her, I'm no longer in love with her. I told her we would work on this and see where things go, the problem is I know what damage has been done to me is permanent I feel. I have nightmares Biut her sleeping with people, I am thinking about what she does while I'm gone to my internship for 8 hours a day, 5 days a week. I know my trust will never be the same again with her, yet for the past couple of months she has tried so very hard, and I can tell, to make me feel like I'm her king. Just yesterday she wrote a very sweet letter, but in the back of my mind whilst Im reading it all I'm saying is ""If I'm the best thing that happened to you, why did you do this to me and lie about it in the same night, not talk to me about where we stood...or she stood emotionally with us"". My love for her is real, me being in love with her is over.

She thinks everything is ok, but I want to leave her at the end of my internship. I want this before we both get 10 years into marriage with kids and her get bored of me, again, and do something like this again to drive me to shoot myself or something crazy. 

So I ask reddit, when do I tell her....how should I tell her Ive fallen out of love with her because of what shes done, the many times there were weeks of no affection, and her untrustworthiness i just cannot get over?

Sorry such along post...maybe I should have made it a few different posts. Ask me anything pertaining to any of it, I'm an open book.

264pcy,1,2014-05-21,Running vs Walking?,[deleted],loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/264pcy/running_vs_walking/,"Hey loseit,

I'm a 19 year old male college student. I put on some weight during the school year and have been trying to drop it (CW: 176, GW: 165ish) since summer started. Losing weight over the summer has never been an issue for me, but this summer I have an internship and am taking the MCAT, so it's harder to be active. I've been running or lifting almost daily (usually 5-6 days per week) and have been using MFP with a daily calorie limit of around 1800. I've been losing a bit under a pound per week, but I'd like to speed the process up a little. 

This is where the running vs walking question comes in. I love running, but when I run for 30-45 minutes, it feels like I wasted time that I should use to study. In an attempt to fix this, I've started running 1.5 miles in the morning and then walking for another 30-60 minutes at night while going over notes or flashcards. It seems that I end up burning about the same amount of calories (according to the treadmill), but is walking as effective as running for weight loss? I've come across a bunch of articles that claim that people lose more weight when running (even if they walk for a longer period of time), but shouldn't this be a matter of calories in vs calories out at the end of the day?"
264ps5,2,2014-05-21,"21yr White Male - Possible Stroke 1 year ago, please advise",[deleted],AskDocs,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/264ps5/21yr_white_male_possible_stroke_1_year_ago_please/,"Background info: 1 Year ago I moved to NYC for the summer. I was an intern for an investment bank so the workload was heavy. I don’t smoke, use any narcotics, and do not take any prescription medications. I am a 21 year old male, 6 foot 2, 275 pounds (lineman build – not skinny but no one would say I look fat). I have very SLIGHTLY high blood pressure, my grandfather died of a heart attack at age 63, and my father has high blood pressure. There’s no history of stroke on my dad’s side but my mother’s ide has a history of multiple strokes.

**The Facts:
**

* On a Friday night 1 year ago I went out to one of my favorite bars in the meatpacking district.  Metup with some friends from back home that I’ve known for years and I had 2 drinks (yes just 2). After about an hour I hopped on the subway, ate a little bit when I got home and then went to bed around midnight. 

* At approximately 4AM I woke up with horrible nausea, a splitting headache and I was EXTREMELY dizzy. I could hardly sit up. I tried to getup to get to the trash can and practically collapsed as soon as my feet hit the floor. 

* I could barely move my arms or legs and just had enough strength to support myself over the trashcan. All the while I had an absolutely splitting headache, it was very hard to see/focus even with the lights on in the room. I then attempted to get to the bathroom but ended up having to crawl. I got into the shower, turned on cold water and just there. I couldn’t move, I couldn’t feel, I couldn’t think. I didn’t have enough energy to stand or even talk and I noticed numbness all over my body. 

* I also had severe “pins and needles” on my right side. After about 6 hours into this ordeal I feel as if I finally was able to think clearly – and truthfully that was the first moment I even considered calling the paramedics. Some may say these are hangover symptoms but they truly made me feel as if I were to die. I can leg press 1000+ pounds, bench 175+ and still have the stamina to run a 5K. That’s why I was so scared – I’ve never felt so weak and powerless in my entire life. I’ve felt 10x stronger after a major surgery.

So – why am I asking about this 1 year later? This past year I’ve not been myself at all. I was a 4.0 student going into my senior year of undergrad, extremely social, and was extremely motivated. I noticed after the “incident” that I immediately felt much more challenged by my workload. I was late to work and left tasks unfinished. I pushed through as best I could but was nowhere near my performance when I started working. I got started back at school for my last year and just couldn’t concentrate on anything. I skipped most all of my classes and skipped exams – throughout everything I was just completely apathetic. I also became somewhat reclusive; I got a 2.0 GPA first semester senior year and a 3.0 last semester. My girlfriend noticed that my right eyelid seemed to be drooping (noticeably), I stumbled over my words and just wasn’t as sharp as I once was. I hear the words, I recognize the words, but my brain just doesn’t process those words into sentences that I can immediately understand.

What could this have been? If it wasn’t a stroke what else could’ve caused both the physical and mental symptoms? What kind of doctor do I see to test for a stroke a year ago (if that’s even possible)? What else should I explore?

**TL;DR – Hardly ever sick in my life, had incident a year ago that caused severe weakness and almost complete inability to move for about 5ish hours, since incident I’ve had severe depression, complete loss of motivation, anxiety, lost my 4.0 GPA, I have a slightly drooping right eyelid, trouble understanding sentences, difficulty concentrating and I am reclusive. A complete 180 from my personality and academic record for the past 21 years. None of these symptoms existed before the incident.

2650xm,3,2014-05-21,So my girlfriend and I broke up/went on a break for a while because of my own issues. I want to improve myself as much as possible before possibly trying to get her back.,jewfro667,askseddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/askseddit/comments/2650xm/so_my_girlfriend_and_i_broke_upwent_on_a_break/,"I know the usual thig you say, which is a break is a break up and that I should move on. I really don't feel like moving on because this girl is probably one of the greatest girls I know. Without going into it too much, we basically started fighting a lot because I was stressed about not being where I want to be in life at this point and feeling inadequate. I have a shitty internship that isn't satisfying and the job hunt stresses me out so I got irritable very quickly and started fights with her. She always supported me. 

Anyway, we both decided that this can't keep happening and decided on a break. I want to know how I can become the man she fell for a year and a half ago because she looked at me and said that I'm not the man she fell for, which really hurt, especially seeing her cry. Anyway, I want to become even better than that guy and am looking for advice on what you recommend I do. 

Also, I do plan to date around still. I just don't think I want a relationship for a while until I get my stuff together. I'm giving myself a few months to decide if I want her back and then will go from there regarding that. 

Tl;dr: girlfriend of 1.5 years and I had mutual breakup because I don't have my shit together and kept getting irritated despite her support, want to become better than the guy she fell for a year ago and possibly get her back in the future. 

Edit: so I decided against my better judgement to see her today and talk in person. A lot of crying happened. Then I told her it would be better to take a break from each other because we don't have a lot of relationship experience. I told her that I won't talk to her for a little while and then we can see what happens. She still wants to hook up though, which I don't really want to do at this time. So yeah, I surprisingly feel a lot better after that. It was really therapeutic. Now I don't know what's going to happen. "
2653a5,10,2014-05-21,I got hair follicle surgery (continued from 5 months ago),lo1ly,tressless,https://www.reddit.com/r/tressless/comments/2653a5/i_got_hair_follicle_surgery_continued_from_5/,"Hey guys. Sooo I'm back. Here's my original thread i posted 2 or 3 days after my surgery [boom] (http://www.reddit.com/r/tressless/comments/1tf9ky/i_just_got_hair_implant_surgery/). So It's been a long 5 months since my surgery, and I am going to try to make this thread as detailed as I possibly can. 

Note: I may add to this thread, but I will try to put it into sections so people don't have to read a long wall of texts, and can just read sections instead.

Preface (Chapter 1): So I'm a 22 year old dude ( Turn 23 tomorrow) who started going bald probably at the age of late 20, but didn't start really noticing it until I turned 22. Once I started noticing, shit got bad quick. My boss at my internship made a couple remarks, but said ""don't get surgery."" I stuck it out through the summer and then at the end I saw a billboard saying something like ""We grow hair!"" So I gave them a call and met with a consultant for free.


Pre Surgery (Chapter 2): Going into this meeting I had no idea what to expect, but in walks in a dude with beautiful full white head of hair. We talked about hair follicles, and told me his story and showed me his before and after pictures, and I was stunned. I couldn't believe this was the same dude. Anyways, we started talking about hair follicles and what procedures would need to be done. I started taking Minoxidil (basically rogain) and some special shampoo (not really sure if it does much). We met 2 other times, talked about pricing, and I finally decided to take a risk, say fuck it, and do the surgery. As of this point I'm still in my senior year of college, and decided to do the surgery during my christmas break, December 20th. There wasn't much prep before my surgery other than taking minoxidal and another thing the night before my surgery.


The surgery (Chapter 3): The surgery took 4 hours, and they pulled follicles from the back of my head, because those follicles get more blood flow therefore wont die, and placed them in the crown of my head. They took around 3500 hair follicles. I was out for the entire surgery, but I guess that's really uncommon for that to happen. You're supposed to be awake for like 2 hours of it, so I'm not sure if that part hurts. I heard it doesn't. Anyways after the surgery I felt fine, but had to get someone to pick me up. I had to leave the bandages on my head and sleep upright for the next couple of days, since I had sort of a big surgery.


Post Surgery (Chapter 4): I read other people's stories from blogs saying there was little to no pain. For me, I had some discomfort. Yes hydrocodon was extremely helpful, but I personally felt pain for about 3-5 days. I had scabs on my head, and I was given instructions how to treat them fro the next 10-15 days. They started falling off in the shower around day 10 from light massages. After around 10-12 days, I was back to ""normal."" Things looked worse than before, but it was because they had to cut the original hair follicles to see where exactly to place the new ones.


Months 1-5 (chapter 5):  The First month was extremely noticeable and wore hats to hide it, but honestly, nobody would have guessed I got surgery. People just would have said ""wow, he's really balding quickly. But things started to grow quickly. Month 2 wasn't much better, but there was definitely improvement. Still felt a little self conscious, but things were looking better. Month 3 showed a lot of improvement, but I was starting to get skeptical. I wondered if my $6,000 investment was a bad one. Things were still growing, and I felt a little more at ease when I saw a new wave of hair follicles sprout. Month 4, this is when shit got real. My hair started to look awesome, and damn near complete out of nowhere. Month 5, things seem to have been done, but I met with the original consultant. He was amazed with the progress, and told me the hair follicles were going to continue thickening up for the next 3 months to come... so that was good news

Reflection: I've been very happy with my investment. I didn't lack confidence prior to the surgery, but just wanted to look my peek during the prime years of my life. I've gained more confidence, and am sure it will help me in my career, as it has already helped me in my romantic life. I wouldn't get the surgery thinking it will make you happy, but if it's something you've been thinking about, just talk to someone.




With all that said, I hope you have learned something from my experience. During my last post, I got a lot a shit for getting a surgery from a billboard, getting the surgery at the age of 22, and only spending $6000 on it. All I can say is I'm living evidence that hair follicle treatment does work, and I'm glad to have hair for 15+ years.

One last thing.. I will still take minoxidil, and I am going to start taking propecia when I start my Job come July. If you wanna message me. Feel free."

265k4k,2,2014-05-21,I [22M] ran into an ex-bestfriend/flame [22F] that ruined our friendship and I haven't spoken to in years since I moved away.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/265k4k/i_22m_ran_into_an_exbestfriendflame_22f_that/,"I apologize for advance for the massive wall of text.  I feel it's important to know the entire story of our friendship/relationship thing.

I'll start it off from how we met I suppose.  It was towards the end of our senior year of high school.  This girl was smart, athletic, funny and beautiful.  We knew of each other but hadn't spoken or hung out at all until a few weeks before prom.  She had just ended a year long relationship and was out of a prom date so a mutual friend ended up pairing us together.  From the beginning she let me know that she wasn't looking to start a relationship with me and that I shouldn't expect a kiss or anything after prom, if I still wanted to go she would love to but didn't want to give me the wrong idea.  This immediately let me know what type of person she really was and we became close friends.  We'd text and call each other every day and 
come to each other for advice on things.  Every one wanted us 
to be dating but we thought of each other as friends, she'd confide in her relationships with me as I would with her.

Lets skip ahead to the end of summer after graduation and she's preparing to leave for college that was about an hour away from our home town.  We had a day where we just hung out and talked about our futures with school and how often we'd visit each other at our different schools.  Well at the end of this day she kissed me and said she ""wished I had asked her out then maybe she'd have gone to my school instead or I would have gone to hers"".  I should note that this was the first time either of us were physically intimate with each other because I just considered her way out of my league and too good of a friend.

So we're freshman in college now and continue talking to each other throughout the year and visiting each other but around valentine's day she gets into a relationship with a guy and stops talking to me completely.  I took this as a sign and went on with my life and ended up moving back home from school to do an internship for the summer.  When I was done with this internship I decided to go to a community college in town rather than move back to the University a few hours away again.  She started an internship herself for the fall and took the semester off, we were inseparable.  When we finally started sleeping together she'd drop hints about a future together and what she wanted to do after graduating college.  We expressed we loved each other a couple times.

Now we'll skip ahead again to what would be her sophomore year of college in the spring and I'm still at home going to community college.  She began a relationship towards the end of the semester and I hadn't heard from her other than me occasionally texting to catch up.  She was very short with her answers like ""I'm good, you?"", ""oh ok"", ""good to hear from you"". Now and then she'd come back to town and always want to spend time with me and go do things with our mutual friends and act like we were best friends again but when she went back to school it was the cold shoulder.

Towards the end of 2011 I was offered a great job opportunity a long way from home and I only had a couple weeks from the offering until I needed to move.  I tried every single day of those 2 weeks trying to get a hold of her and to meet up and say goodbye, good luck, kiss my ass, whatever.  I had a bunch of friends that went to the same school as her so I went up to the town to hang out with them and decided I'd try her one last time.  I sent a text that said ""*Hey, I'm in town and really wanted to tell you something important.  Any chance I can take 5 minutes of your time?*""  I considered her my best friend and didn't want to tell her via text.  So a few hours go by and I finally get a response that said ""*FarAndGone you need to leave me ALONE!  This will NEVER happen and I will NOT meet up with you.  Don't speak to me!  Oh and don't bother responding to this because I won't read it.*""

Well the thing was that apparently my texts every day asking to see her had upset her boyfriend and he broke up with her because of it.  How did I know this?  Because that very same night I saw her older sister while my friends and I were out drinking.  I told her I was moving but didn't tell her about the text her little sister sent me.  I left a couple days later and had to get a new work phone from the company, I deleted all of my social networks for awhile but kept my old cell phone around for a week just to see if she'd apologize or something.  Didn't happen.  

I haven't so much as heard her name since I moved but I came back to town this week to visit family for the summer.  I ran into her while I was having lunch with my friends.  She seemed shocked when she saw me and there was without a doubt an awkward tension.  It was a basic interaction with the how are you's and good to see you's.  She went to go for a hug but I pulled away.  I guess she asked one of my friends for my new number because she text me saying she really wants to meet up and talk, then she added me on my new social network pages that I created a short while after I left.

I guess what I'm asking is.  Do I give this woman a chance?  She may apologize or she may just act like that situation never happened and wants to be friends.  I've lost a little bit of weight since I left and gotten a little better looking, in my opinion, and maybe she's had a change of heart since seeing me.  I mean she didn't bother trying to get in touch with me UNTIL she saw me in person.  I'm just confused about it and really I want to see her and tell her to go fuck herself but then I remember how close we used to be and she might have been going through a tough time.

**TL;DR: an old bestfriend refused to see me when I was moving away, destroyed our friendship and now after 3 years wants to meet up and act like all is ok.**"

Hello new recruit, I know this new surrounding may be a bit shocking to you, but you will learn to love it.  This facility is kept secret from the world, for good reason, but every once in a while, someone with great potential is recruited, so lucky you!  Unfortunately, the life you had before this has been wiped from your mind, and every trace of your existence erased.  What you did before will be nothing compared to the incredible things you will be a part of within these walls.

You will be given a brief orientation, and then you will be assigned a temporary office.  In this office, you will find a welcome basket, containing your rookie manual, a variety of gift cards to the facility stores, a name tag, and a Class 1 access card.  The access card will allow you to obtain up to 500 interns, and a hydra chosen at random.

After your special skills have been identified, you will be given a permanent office in the department you are most likely to excel in.  If your special skills do not fit into a current department, a new one will be created, which you will become head of.  Once placed in a department, you will be given 5 tasks to complete, if you fail to complete these tasks, you will be terminated, mind wiped, and ejected from the facility.  After 5 tasks have been completed, you will receive full clearance to most of the facility, and your intern limit will not be capped.

If you have any further questions, contact your department head.  If for some reason, they are unable to answer your question, then contact the Maximum Order Department Supervisors, or the MODS.  Please enjoy your stay at [REDACTED] Facility.

266i9r,0,2014-05-21,law school admissions advice,throwawaylsatbs,law,https://www.reddit.com/r/law/comments/266i9r/law_school_admissions_advice/,"Hi, 

I was wondering what are my chances of getting into a top 25 school? Below you will find explanations of my academic and personal background. I am particularly interested in Berkeley, UCLA, and Columbia (2 of these 3 are long shots, I know…), but would be very grateful to hear about everyones opinion regardless of school (especially ones that have suggestions for schools they believe I might have a chance at).

Academic Background: Graduate next spring with a Comp sci degree. Current gpa 2.4, trying for a 2.6 by graduation. 162 lsat cold. currently studying for it, and Ill take the real thing in september. First semester I dropped everything. The next 2 contain D’s and F’s. After that I spent a year at a community college studying to be a paramedic, eventually decided that wasn’t for me. Returned and changed my major about three times. The past three years I have held good steady jobs, did one year interning at a hedge fund and the past 2.5 years at a research lab at my university. Have had mostly solid grades since working.

Personal Background: Did policy debate during university for a year, then I joined a student financial club where I held leadership positions. Was part of a group that proactively entered ourselves on behalf of our school in the CFA Research Challenge ( a competition that usually only grad students enter, and where I meet the guy who gave me my hedge fund internship). Afterwords I joined the competitive programming team and won some competitions. I also would like to mention on my ps that I did 4 years of varsity swimming and water polo in high school. And I throw a decent yo momma joke every now and then (that doesn’t go in the ps). Oh and I am a male latino who is also an american citizen (so no immigration issues).

Also, because my gpa sucks, would anyone advise waiting for my lsat score before I start sending in applications this fall? I ask because I would like to send them in as early as possible but perhaps I might get put off when they look at my low gpa and then see that I have yet to send in my lsat scores. I am pretty much riding on my lsat scores to get me in. The wait between when I can first send in my applications and when I can send in my lsat is about 3 weeks.

I met this girl in high school several years ago and have only since been little more than acquaintances if I am being honest. We hang out in the same group of friends, but do not really communicate outside of that. After graduating high school, she went off to a college in-state and I went to another. For several years we seldom saw one another, but this has changed recently. Over the last year she has visited my house (I live with several high school friends) occasionally. Truthfully,I have always been attracted to this girl (great personality and gorgeous) and this was made more difficult over the past week.

Background for the background now, this girl is going to college for a degree in acting/theatre. Because of this interest, she managed to get an internship at a prominent theme park/entertainment conglomerate (I don't want to be specific in order to avoid upsetting the ""magic""). With this connection, she was able to get my friends and I several passes to the park for two days and came with us.We managed to catch up in the lengthy line wait times and had a blast on all of the rides.  It was during this time that I felt myself becoming more attracted to her, and I'm sure the firework shows didn't help. Now my vacation has ended and we have once again gone our separate ways.

 My question to you Reddit is layered: how can I initiate contact with her (without coming across as creepy/desperate), should I pursue the a relationship when she comes back to our home state, and what are any helpful tips for this situation?

P.S Some additional background facts:

1. I am a fairly shy person and have never been able to come close to a relationship before.

2. I am a college senior doing an extra semester and want to act before we both graduate and potentially start very different careers.

3. Honestly, this girl had dated one of my very good friends back in high school (worried about any toes being stepped on here).

4. The girl and I get along well when we hang out in that larger group setting.

5. If it is at all important, she has said that I am on the top of her list for finding someone for me to date and that I'm a nice guy. I'm sure this wasn't an open invitation for a date, but I hope it also wasn't ""friendzoning"" or whatever.

6. I guess I can answer any additional questions below.

Thanks for taking the time to read my lengthy post!"
266tsm,4,2014-05-22,Getting rid of green in hair with fuchsia dye?,[deleted],FancyFollicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/FancyFollicles/comments/266tsm/getting_rid_of_green_in_hair_with_fuchsia_dye/,"Some basics:

- Hair is naturally dark blonde, dyed it purple for 2 months (no bleach)

- When purple faded, dyed it a mix of turquoise/midnight blue

- Aggressively washed out the blue so I could go back to natural for an upcoming internship

- Had a very very faded greenish purplish stain left all over, had it professionally dyed over with a light/medium gold-brown (level 6)

So this whole process worked very well, my hair right now is pretty close to my natural color so I don't have to worry about weird fading. The only problem is that I have a very slight greenish tone in some areas. It's not super noticeable but I notice it and it bothers me. 

My question is- would it help to dilute some fuchsia semi-permanent dye in conditioner and wash with that? My hair is dark enough that I don't think any pink would visibly show up as pink but it could help with the tone. My reasoning is that it's opposite on the color wheel. "
266wez,1,2014-05-22,I am unhireable.,wrcftw,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/266wez/i_am_unhireable/,"I think I fucked up the rest of my life this year.  Depression and anxiety have ruined my career.  I graduated college with an accounting degree, but never worked as an accountant as I couldn't do it well in my internships and hated it dearly.  I worked for 3.5 years doing something for a railway and learned hardly anything at all.  The job was boring and I spent most days on the Internet.  I didn't learn anything marketable.  I had a mental breakdown last August and went on leave from the railway.  I tried to go back but they would only give me my old job back, not a different one.  I couldn't do that job anymore, every day made me have panic attacks.  So i quit and now it's been months and I can't find another job.   I have a degree in something I don't want to do, nor have I done it out of university.  I have no transferable skills from the railway job.  I can't explain the last 9 months of work history without telling an interviewer that I was on sick leave for months (red flag).

I've been on a few interviews but I never get passed round 2.  I think this is because more details come out and the red flags add up.  I present very well and have the luxury of being attractive in appearance but my work history is a giant red flag.   My last employer will give me a good reference because she feels bad for me, but that's about the only positive.

So i feel like I'm pretty much fucked.  My wife resents me for not being successful.  I need to take financial help from my parents.  And I have no idea how I'm going to find any professional success.  Sometimes I think my only hope is to start my own business.   But I don't really have any skills that I could sell, and opening a store seems daunting and stressful.

I'm feeling quite desperate and like my life is basically over.  I had all of these aspirations of being financially successful and career oriented but all of my attempts have failed and I'm now unhireable.  So much money wasted on a degree...so much potential smarts wasted away.  I was always the guy people thought would go places, I'm heading towards chronic unemployment and a divorce.

Fuck my life, seriously.  

Edit: reading this over and observing how poorly I'm communicating my thoughts is troubling....communication used to be my strength...now I sound like an idiot."

I just finished up my second year of college, and I've made the decision to leave the school: At the beginning of my freshman year, I went to a frat party and was sexually assaulted by one of the guys there. Since then, I became so depressed and my self-esteem was so damaged. I lacked self-respect and did many more things that I really regret up till today. Anyway, I remember his face.. And I saw him around campus a lot. I found out his name, since he's a really popular guy. Not only is he really involved in his frat, but he's also a student athlete.. Some of my friends/acquaintances are friends with him and I always see them in pictures together on Facebook. It seems like alot of people that I know know him, and they all like him.
Anyway, I stalked his FB profile and instagram, and found out that he got a very prestigious internship position this summer. All this info that I found out about him angers me... He is such as asshole and douchebag and he made me so suicidal.. I failed so many classes because of my depression and anger.. While he is out there having the time of his life, and getting places in life. Life's not fair... I hate him. I really really hate him...

EDIT: Thanks for all the answers! 

And for all the people telling me that I need to move on and it's been 2 years, *clearly* I know this. However, it's easier said than done. I'm obsessive by nature and find it extremely hard to let go of stuff.. Especially when I feel like I've been wronged. I hate it but it's so hard to put it behind. Some days I feel like I'm ready to let go but other days I feel so angry I can't even control myself.

For everyone asking why I didn't confess earlier: After it happened, I didn't tell *anyone*. I was so embarrassed. I held it in, and kept it to myself. I only confessed it to one friend about a week ago. I thought it would help me feel better to finally get it out, but instead it made me angrier. I've been seeing a counsellor on and off for the past two years but I haven't confessed this to her yet. When we initially met, I never told her *truthfully* what was really bothering me and we just always discuss my mood. (Btw, it wasn't that I wanted to lie to her. It was that I was lying to myself). Also, I don't feel comfortable enough to tell her, in all honesty.

Always thought I would end up with the big 4 or MBB consulting provided things go well.

My chances of securing an internship are next to zero (blanked out on one of my exams and will have to resit so any chance of getting a 2:1 is gone). Will try hard though and at this stage I wont mind unpaid work if it means getting some exposure. I keep myself constantly updated through Twitter, read articles on various websites. Second question, how do writers build up sources? Also, not having a degree in journalism/communications/mdia go against me? At this stage, I obviously don't have any funds or means to do hands on reviews of products. Knowing my family, they won't be supportive of my decision. So essentially, any hardships I face I will have to deal with them alone. Any help appreciated! Cheers!"
26855h,1,2014-05-22,Sibling Bullying/Abuse,[deleted],survivorsofabuse,https://www.reddit.com/r/survivorsofabuse/comments/26855h/sibling_bullyingabuse/,"I'm using a throwaway because I do not want my reddit name attached to this. I feel shame and guilt talking about it, but it seems to be becoming redundant to those close to me.

My sister abused me physically and emotionally for 30 years. I now think she even tried to kill me. When I was three-seven, she pushed me down a flight of stairs, put a bean bag over a barbie house and pushed me into it, locked me in an ottoman for what seemed like an eternity.

Throughout my life prior to puberty she has broken my bones (my arm, three fingers, and twice my nose), had her friends beat me up for telling my mom she was smoking, stolen my bike, and would beat me up for getting student of the month awards in elementary school. My grades started to drop because I did not want to be beaten. I told my parents a few times, but that just made things worse. Eventually I just stopped talking about it all together. 

One time her and her boyfriend were going to camp for the weekend. Mom made her take me and my cousin, it was a small cabin up in the mountains. All weekend, Cousin and I heard Sister pornfucking Boyfirend, with interludes of getting stoned out on the porch. Cousin told Aunt and Mom what happened, and I got beat by boyfriend and Sister for it. 

After I hit Junior High, she spread rumors that I was gay, cross dressed, and was a narc. She would then make fun of me for not having a girl friend, stinking, and I was a loser for not standing up for myself and having no friends. One time her new boyfriend held me down and put deodorant on me. I broke out in blisters under my armpits and was mocked because i was ""so dirty even deodorant cant help you"".

Over time, she apologized for how she treated me and started to help me become an adult. She helped me find my first place when I got a full time job, and would just be an all around friend. Of course, I would help her financially, I had no real bills and all my extra money just went towards comic books for myself. Of course I would help buy groceries for her and her kids, god knows her husband doesn't make enough. Of course I would pay her bills. I got evicted from my house anyway. I don't know where my money went, I guess I am a loser for not being able to pay my bills and rent. I should have been more careful with my money. I am a loser for having to move back in with mom and dad, you're right, sister. 

I did not even realize I was feeding some sort of psychopathic narcissist's ego until I lost my job. I was going to move into Sister's old house and take up the mortgage payments, but that got axed when my income dried up. 

Sister lost her shit. She called me every name in the book, lied to my grandmother to such an extent that Grandma disowned me a year before she died. I still don't know what she said, but Grandma told me I wasn't welcome in her home anymore. She disowned my mom and dad for giving me and my family a place to live while I finished school and looked for work. She told my mother that I am using her (mom) and am ""worse than a nigger at work and a schister with money"". 

My wife has been so helpful in me recognizing what had happened, she is a survivor of abuse as well. Wife is able to predict what sister will say or do with such uncanny certainty that it boggles my mind. Wife predicted that Sister is on drugs (Meth and that generic weed shit), is spreading lies to feel better about herself, and even showed me that I gave Sister power by reacting to her negativity. I ignore the bitch now. It was my wife that helped me recognize everything I have done in my life, to focus on the positive aspects, how influential I am to our children, and that if anyone is a freeloader, it's Sister. Wife pointed out how much she relied on me to live, yet I got nothing in return but scorn when I did not bend to Sister's will. She said anyone who truly loved their sibling would not scorn them for financial woes and actions outside their control. She also pointed out that 

Mom tries to keep a rapport with her, but Sister isn't having it. Mom needs permission to drive an hour away to see her grandchildren, and sister won't give it to her unless I am out of mom and dads life. In the mean time, she is now all over facebook spreading lies about my parents and my family unit. 

It should be noted that my parents tried to intervene a few times, but it was met with disaster. First time, Sister claimed abuse to the school counselor. Second time, she ran away and came home a week later strung out on meth. Third time, we moved out of state and Sister resorted to pills. 

Now, I am a loser for not doing drugs (never have and don't want to), being unemployed (I intern now), having no place to live (I personally hand built extensions to my parents home and keep it from decay), and take handouts (I was a janitor prior to interning). 

I hate that cunt.

TL;DR: A rant that probably belongs elsewhere. "

I was friends with benefits with ""AJ"" almost a year ago, although I never had any intentions of dating him and made that very clear.  He would still ask me to be his girlfriend and I repeatedly told him I did not want a a boyfriend, and remind him we were not in a monogamous relationship whenever he brought it up. He moved away to an internship last summer and that's when we ended our relationship.  He asked me one final time to be his girlfriend and I again declined.  He got very angry and thought all our time spent together was a waste. 

Fast forward to January, I had to hear from someone else that my future roommate (we signed a lease in October) has started dating AJ.  Meanwhile, AJ has been spreading rumors and making his distaste for me well known.  Future roommate has actually told me I haven't been invited to certain events because AJ would be there.  Three months ago both AJ and future roommate started using cocaine. (*Just a note, I already talked to a lawyer about the situation and she said it'd be no problem to kick her out of the lease if she was misbehaving and hard drugs are involved)

I was originally going to arrange a meet up with the both of them and try to talk and clear the air, but the more I think about it the angrier I am.  I would never expect them to ""ask permission"" from me, but a friendly heads-up would have been nice.  She also entered a relationship knowing her boyfriend hated her future roommate. I feel like the ball is in their court. 

I guess my question is should I try to arrange a meet up to clear the air, should I just ignore it, or does anyone have another idea? 


TL;DR; Future roommate put me in a difficult situation, I'm looking for ideas to defuse the situation and hopefully have a great year. "

Quite rushed for time and just typed this out with whatever spare time in class I have.  I'm not really happy with it and I'm not a very strong writer, but because of time constraints I just need something at least C level.


&gt;My internship at Intel was an incredible experience that I learned a lot at.  In my time there I was able to see what the job site is like in fields of work that I’m interested in, as well being able to experience working as a team.  I already had a pretty good idea of what working at Intel would look like, but there were still a lot of things that surprised me.  The whole experience never once felt like it was just something that I had to do or a job I had to be at, I genuinely enjoyed my time.
 

&gt;On my first day I met my supervisor Anthony, who made it clear from the start that this internship should be a fun experience to take a lot away from.  I was given my first task soon after, I was responsible for setting up a display of newer products that were going to be used in a sales pitch.  It felt a little weird being in a large conference room setting these products up while catered food was being brought in for the meeting.  I’m not sure how to explain it other than knowing that this was an important meeting and I on my first day was able to take part in getting it ready.  I half expected my first day to be somewhat slow, maybe being shown around a bit.  
For the rest of my internship I was working in a lab with about 50 other people, I quickly fell into place with everyone after a few days.  The subject of what we did is really difficult to actually define, I had a rather large range of tasks and a lot of the time we were allowed to work on what we felt should be worked on.  If I had an idea for something to work on that would be beneficial I had the freedom to work on it.  A lot of the time I was building computers to be used in our lab, which was something I was always interested in but had never done.  A lot of the time I had to bring something I was working on to another part of the building which doesn’t sound like too big of a task, but the Intel building is absolutely massive.  After the whole summer I still had pretty much no idea where I was going in this building, but I did learn how to get to the few important places.
 

&gt;While I already knew quite a bit about what Intel did as a company and a little bit about the knowledge required for their positions, I learned a lot while I was there.  I worked in a team with other interns on most days, which was a little different than the typical team for a project in school.  I also learned a lot about computer hardware, how it all works together and how to use them.  With these two skills combined I felt like I was an effective member of our team and I will definitely be able to apply them to future work situations. 
 

&gt;In the future I would like to work at a place like Intel, or somewhere that I can apply skills similar to what I used at Intel.  Working at Intel requires to either be in college or to have a diploma from a college and for you to have been an intern there before.  I think working at Intel in the future as either an intern again or a full time employ is a realistic option for me and it is definitely something that I would like to do.  Not only do employees at Intel have a really interesting job, but they have a lot benefits for their full time workers.  Just as an example they allow you to work from home or whatever hours you want as long as you’re getting your work done.
 

&gt;Interning at Intel as my first job experience was a great experience for me and it has definitely made what I want to do in life clear.  I would like to intern at other electronics companies to get a broader view of the industry, but Intel was a unique experience that I learned a lot from.

It's that time of year again: internship time. I myself will be working at a production studio in Midtown, and thought that I could provide y'all with some info about myself in case anyone is interested in renting out to me:

I am a man and I have no problems with living with all guys, all girls, or a mix of the two.

I am 20 years old. I could tell you that I'm ""responsible,"" ""wise beyond my years,"" ""born in the wrong generation,"" etc. all day, but that won't make a difference. If you have a problem with young people, I'm not your man.

I am clean and organized. I won't make a mess of your space.

I will be working pretty consistent hours.

I do not drink or smoke, but I have no problem if you do.

I will cook and clean for you outside of my working/sleeping hours.

I do not need much. I shit you not, I will live in a broom closet, on a couch, or under a bed if you need me to.

Are you interested? If so, great! Here are my/your two options:

I will pay $700 in rent if you are within 45 minutes' walking distance of my workplace (West 37th Street/8th Avenue).

I will pay $600 in rent if you are beyond that, because I will have to commute.

Both of these options are somewhat flexible if you're just outside of that range.

If you are interested, please send me a PM. I am trying to find space by June 1. From there, I can provide pics, links, and anything else you might like to know about me.

EDIT: though I said that there was no use in saying that I'm responsible, I may have phrased that badly: I AM RESPONSIBLE. Fact is, if you don't want to rent out to a 20 year old, I can't change your mind. That was all I was trying to convey.

EDIT #2: the offer's still open if someone wants a personal cook to make them some friggin' delicious dinners this summer! 
Also, if you just have a room open and don't need a cook, feel free to contact me anyway... please?"

I'm going to keep looking, but I'll probably be graduating next year without any experience. How can I get a job with a low (3.0-3.1) GPA and no experience? 

My school is very highly ranked, so maybe the degree itself will help me, but it obviously didn't help me get an internship, so I can't see it doing anything to help me find a job. I'm really stressed out about this as it seems everyone else in my school got an internship. Some people who I never would have thought would have an internship before me, got something. I can't imagine going through this same experience again a year from now, spending all day every day on a computer applying for jobs worrying what I'm going to do.

What should I do between now and a year from now when I graduate to get a job in finance without having any internship experience?


EDIT: I exaggerated a little bit about the emails. For the past 2-3 weeks I've been sending out 20+ a day, but before that I was sending about 20 per week. Also, I went to some recruiting events in the fall, but they didn't get me anywhere, as I had a 2.6 GPA then. I brought my GPA up from a 2.6 to a 3.0 this year, and I'm looking to continue to bring it up during my senior year. Thanks for the advice everyone, and I welcome any more that you might have.

268xhv,5,2014-05-22,Busting my [22F] ass at college while my mom [56F] still makes me feel guilty about money.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/268xhv/busting_my_22f_ass_at_college_while_my_mom_56f/,"Some background: My parents are divorced, and my mom used to work for my dad/stay at home with me (I am an only child), so when they got divorced about eight years ago, she decided to stay at home instead of getting a job. She makes a (very small) amount of money through an at-home online business, but it really only operates for a couple months out of the year. Most of her money comes from my dad paying child support/alimony/etc (which is a whole other issue, since they are still fighting about the divorce settlement in court eight or nine years later) and some other ways like money from the selling of a house in her family, things like that.

Both of my parents have helped me financially through college, both with tuition and rent in an expensive city. I've worked part-time jobs and done internships (mostly unpaid) throughout college, and right now I'm finishing up my last semester. I'm taking a couple of classes at night, working 25+ hours a week at a part-time job, and doing an unpaid internship that can be 40+ hours a week (the hours fluctuate, sometimes more sometimes less). I'm trying to manage a relationship, but our dates have been consisting of him driving me to cover things for work or making food at my place and falling asleep. I'm trying my best, but I don't make enough money to afford my rent and tuition so until I graduate and find a job in my field that will actually pay me, I have to rely on them.

So my mom doesn't really do much during the day. She tends to yardwork, runs errands, plants flowers and redoes rooms in the house. She admits she hasn't even paid attention to her own business in months. She goes on lots of dates and nice long bike rides all the time. She makes no money, really. But...she kind of gets on me and makes fun of me when I tell her I'm tired or I'm rushing around to try and do everything I need to get done every day, and likes to insinuate that my job is easy and I don't do anything and mocks me a little bit when I tell her I'm really busy.

Meanwhile, any time I buy anything new (and we're talking a new shirt or a phone case or whatever, just little things like that) she tells me how we're in really bad shape financially and that I've sucked all of her money into tuition and she's poor and struggling and makes me feel like shit. It drives me insane because the simple solution, in my mind, is for her to get a job and make some money. I'm doing what I can until I can find a full-time job. She tells me how hard her life is and how busy her days are but I don't think she understands that the things she does on a daily basis are things other people do while having actual jobs!!!

Am I being really selfish for being frustrated here? I know it probably doesn't sound like I appreciate her help. I know she's not obligated to help me but either help me or don't, but making me feel guilty and lazy about it all the time is helping no one. How do I not let this get to me?


**TL;DR: My mom (who doesn't work) makes me feel lazy and guilty despite the fact that I'm working hard, because she's helped me pay for rent and tuition.**

This is probably a standard complaint here, but I'm incapable of forming any type of meaningful relationship with a girl.  I find a girl, and they're always either using me, not as into me as I am to them, or the situation causes it to fail before it even gets off the ground.  

I rarely dated in high school.  I dated a girl for a month freshman year, we broke up, my dad vanished for a year or so, then came back into my life and died shortly after.  All of this left me with a pretty severe bout of social anxiety that followed me throughout most of high school.  

Eventually, senior year, I got a much needed hair cut, and the loss of those long locks gave me a slight boost in confidence, and a boost in attractiveness, as well.  Ended up going to prom with and dating a girl that had rejected me a year or so before.  We break up over the summer, partially because we're both too afraid to propose taking each other's virginity (we both wanted it, but thought the other wasn't ready), and partially because she's just a very fickle person.  

I didn't do anything else with a girl for a little over three years after that.  A mixture of being too busy balancing school, work, and music, and being afraid of my own inexperience leads to me still being a virgin at 21.  

Summer of 2012, the first ex is back in town for an internship, and we're hanging out here and there.  She's got a long distance boyfriend, so I'm just enjoying our renewed friendship, no expectations.  We go to dinner and a party, and she starts talking about how she's going to dump her boyfriend the next day when he's in town.  She takes me to another room and she pounces on me.  I have her pants off when her boyfriend texts her and we move back a few steps.  She ends up staying with him, and they live happily ever after in another state.  

A couple of months later, I meet the roomie/best friend of a work friend.  We text for a few days, she invites me to hang out, and she takes my virginity.  We hang out and hook up for a few months, but she tells me she's not ready for a relationship when I ask, so we stop.  It doesn't take long before she ends up actually in a relationship.  

A few months after that ends, I end up sleeping with a friend of a different friend.  It lasts a couple of weeks before she ends up in a committed relationship.  

I get back in touch with high school ex #2.  She's back in town taking some time off from school, and we hang out a bunch.  A mutual friend (who hooked me up with the previous girl) says that she's been talking about wanting to hook up with me.  The ex had hit me up earlier that night and took a limo with some friends 30 miles from Dallas to Denton to hang out at my house after one of their bar crawls.  They all leave together, except her and she crashes on my couch.  We make out, and she stops me because ""she's just got too much to figure out in her life.""  I told you she was fickle.

At this point, partially because I'm so busy, and partially because I'm so disillusioned with my interactions with girls in the past, I decide I just want to hook up and whatever happens happens.  

This goes fine for a while.  I slept with a girl once, we kind of drifted apart when she left the state for winter break, and I wasn't torn up about it.  

The next semester, though, I started having an existential crisis.  Things got worse when I briefly became involved with my best friend's ex.  They had been broken up for about three years now, but we kept in touch because we always got along and lived in the same college town.  I hit her up to hang out one night because I was having an existential panic attack and didn't want to be alone.  We're talking at a bar, and she asks if I had ever had an existential crisis.  I hadn't really brought it up with anyone at this point, but she asks me about it out of the blue and we spend hours talking about how we're going through the same thing.  We ended up sleeping with each other that night, and a couple of nights later.  It was wrong, because she was my best friend's ex, but I hadn't felt this type of connection for a long time, if not ever before.   

I told my friend, as I thought it was the right thing to do.  It ended up hurting him way more than I expected, so I broke it off.  This hurt immensely for two reasons.  Number one, I had jeopardized my relationship with my best friend, and number two, I thought I had found the perfect distraction from my existential depression, only to have to throw it away immediately.  

At this point I realized how much I wanted a relationship.  Those two nights with her did so much for my anxiety that I had to find something to replace it.  I wasn't content with just hooking up any more.  

So now we make it to my latest failure.  A friend from work.  I've had a thing for this girl the entire time I've worked there.  She was one of the first people at the job to make the effort to get to know me, and we'd always been flirty with one another.  When we'd hung out early on, she mentioned that she was against getting involved with coworkers.  I liked her, but I put the idea of being with her in the back of my head.  Around the time things fell apart with the last girl, she'd made an offhand remark about not always following that rule.  We'd always texted back and forth, but now the conversations were getting deeper and more frequent.  I ended up kissing her as she was heading home from my place one night.  She said ""that was unexpected,"" and asked if I wanted to have a cigarette with her before she left.  We texted a bunch the following week, but she blew me off when I tried to hang out with her again.  

The next few weeks or so, I don't really talk to her at work.  Nothing passive aggressive or mean-spirited, I just don't really make an effort, since I assume she's not into it.  This week, though, she's been extra flirty.  I asked her about it, and she said she catches herself flirting with me all the time, but she's not looking to mix work and dating.  

So that's where I am now.  Desperately looking for a connection, but having no idea where to look.  Any time I go to a party, I almost never meet anyone that I'm interested in.  My band can play to a packed house, and it will be 90% males.  The other 10% are girls that are with someone in the 90%.  I'm so frustrated right now and have no idea what to do.  

TLDR: I can't find girlfriend material.  They're all either using me or move on.

2695gn,4,2014-05-22,"Missed EU LCS Week 1? Wrap Up, Expectations &amp; Results! [LONG]",Squallify,leagueoflegends,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/2695gn/missed_eu_lcs_week_1_wrap_up_expectations_results/,"With the games of today the first week of EU LCS has come to an end. From today on I'll be doing a weekly wrap-up of how the week went and make an analysis of the teams and their performance.

Hope you like it!


* **FNATIC** 

Fnatic's last split performance was pretty shaky. They started great with a 7-0 win streak, but after that they went on tilt with a 0-8 losing streak. 

After the split they managed to climb up in the playoffs and crown themselves as the Spring 2014 LCS champions AGAIN.

Thus they participated in All Star tournament where their performance was also shaky and gave a lot to talk.

**Expectations:** Come back from the summer vacations and shake the shakyness off (heh). They have to proof that they are a solid team.

**Results:** They are still a shaky team. They managed to end 2/2 but the games weren't really convincing, not even the ones they won. Let's see if they manage to step it up next week

**Best Player this Week:** Rekkles. He's a life asurance and even when his team doesn't do well, he won't go on tilt.

* **SK GAMING**

No one expected much of SK Gaming at the start of the Spring split, they completely changed their roster being CandyPanda the only remaining player from the old roster.

Even though they didn't look as strong as the start of the split they managed to end in 1st position at the end showing a lot of strength and specially good tactics and sinergy.

In the PlayOffs they ended 2nd just after losing to Fnatic. 

**Expectations:** Keep the high level of play, specially in terms of macro (rotations, strategies, team sinergy..)

**Results:** SK Gaming has showed that they are a top contender for going to worlds this year. Their laning phases may not be the strongest of all teams, but they make it up with great rotations and calls.

**Best Player this Week:** Jesiz, or should I say JESUS? He totally stepped his game up from last split where he was considered not to be a top mid laner. Looking forward to see him dominate even more!

* **ALLIANCE**

Alliance was a team that came into the Spring Split very hyped, the so called ""super-team"". 

This quickly transitioned into the fail super team because they were in last position for quite some time. 

Luckily for them EU LCS likes ties and all the teams being close to each other in the standings and they improved their gameplay in the latter part of the split and were able to sneak into playoffs where they put up a good fight.

**Expectations:** People probably expected this split Alliance to show that they really are a super-team, and after Froggen's performance in All Stars and being known that the team was looking for analysts, a good performance is what people want to see.

**Results:** Wanted good performance? There you have it. Tied at first place together with SK Gaming and Millenium. All the players played out of their minds, both individually and as a team.

You could also see some korean tactics being used in their game against Fnatic totally denying Soaz's farm and experience. Great start for them.

**Best Player this Week:** It's pretty hard to decide. Even though I will go with Tabbz because he's the one who stepped up his game the most from last split. 

No one really expected him to carry, everyone expected Froggen to take that role. But Tabzz did a great job, nice to see ADs in Europe evolve!

* **ROCCAT**

The polish powerhouse. They replaced MYM As the full-polish team in LCS and surprised everyone. After kicking NiP out of the LCS they entered it and totally dominated at the very beggining.

Overall the team was great, but if we had to chose one Overpow is that man. He really shone in the spring split. Sadly by the end of the split they started to lose some games, but still they are not a team you should look over.

**Expectations:** People expect Roccat to be a top tier contender. They want to see the dominating version of the polish players, and be up there in the fight to get into Worlds.

**Results:** They ended 1-3. Even though their play was not bad, they lack the consistency they maybe had in the start of spring split.

They seem to make bad calls and throw pretty easily. Potential is there, but there are lot of things to **polish** (DEM PUNS).

**Best Player this Week:** Again and again, Overpow. He's the player to look at and the player that will shine when Roccat wins. His Kayle is still terrifying.

* **GAMBIT GAMING**

Our favourite russian overlords. Edward came back from NA and everyone was all aboard the siberian hype express. This was the year we destroyed the koreans.

Sadly, it didn't end all like that. They started pretty strong with a 3-1 superweek in spring split, but after then they lacked consistency. You could see good plays here and there, but sometimes it wasn't enough.

Probably there were problems like having to trouble, the Ucraine conflict when they had a gaming house, and the intern tension (as Alex said when he left).

They entered playoffs but escaped the relegations by the skin of their teeth. After that Alex Ich left the team and stated that the intern situation in Gambit was a huge part of the poor results.

**Expectations:** Now without Alex people really don't expectated much from Gambit. Most of the people wanted to see how NiQ will do, will he be able to fullfil Alex role? If yes, that would be a surprise, and a great one. If no, sadly it wouldn't surprise anyone.

**Results:** Even though Diamond says they are stronger then ever their poor 1-3 start and their performance didn't show so. They got ran over in 2 games, and even though they managed to take a win from SK Gaming... Let's just say they have a lot to work on.

The mechanical skill didn't seem to be the problem, but rather the calls and team sinergy. There have been several moments where it seemed that they didn't really understand each other.

**Best Player this Week:** NiQ. He's the new one and even though he's the best player in the team right now.

Darien and Diamond were probably at their weakest version this week, and the bot lane didn't seem in their best moments either. NiQ had also some difficult moments but even so he's the one that seemed the most solid.

* **COPENHAGEN WOLVES**

The Talent Factory. They entered Spring Split after a very strong performance in the Challenger League when Rekkles was still play with them. 

People didn't believe that they would do well without him, but FORG1VEN, a greek ADC replaced him and did a really good job.

They didn't look bad, they were a well-made team. But even so that wasn't enough and even if they could give a good fight, the dominating teams of the split were too much for them to take.

Luckily they were able to stay in the LCS.

After that, AGAIN one of their members moves to TSM. This time Amazing. Also Forg1ven left the team. Airwalks (jungle) and Woolite (adc) switched in for them.

**Expectations:** It's their second split in the LCS but they suffered pretty heavy changes in their core members. Will they be able to still give a good fight with this changes? That's the question.

**Results:** They ended 1/3, but even the sensation it gave off was pretty satisfying. People thought that they wouldn't give up a good fight anymore and that didn't become true, they put up a good fight and showed that they are a team you better should not forget of.

**Best Player this Week:** Woolite. He came new in, and came out big. They may have gone 1/3 but everyone that watched the games will agree this guy will be a main component of this team.

* **SUPA HOT CREW XD**

They were the underdogs in the spring split. Were able to enter in after kicking MYM out.

They probably had a couple of rough weeks at the start but slowly they were finding their place, specially the AD carry Mr Rallez. 

Sadly it wasn't enough and they ended at the 7th place and forced to play the relegation matches, but they played brilliantly against C9E and 3-0'd them to come back into the LCS this split.

**Expectations:** Migxa left the team so now Rallez has a new support.  Also LS will be working for the team as an analyst. People will be expecting to see results of that.

**Results:** Even though the results could have been better (2-2) you can see clearly how they improved from the last split. Mr Rallez is as strong as ever, and specially the team rotations are way smoother than before. Props to them.

**Best Player this Week:** Who would it be? Yeah it's Rallez. He's a machine and everyone who has him in his Fantasy LCS will be glad they picked him up. Keep up with the good work!

* **MILLENIUM**

And last, but definitely not least, Millenium. They came into the spring split with high expectations after picking up Kev1n, moving Kerp to mid and having the ADC Creaton back from breaking his arm.

Sadly they couldn't live up to it and ended in 8th place, facing the strongest amateur team of all, NIP. After a good fight they managed to win against NIP 3-2 and here they are now, in the LCS again.

**Expectations:** People didn't really think they would be impactful in the LCS. They were called the Velocity of EU.

**Results:** Oh dear lord. There's not a single person in the whole LoLiverse that isn't impressed by how they stepped their game up with this 3-1.

Not only the calls and rotations, but also individually. The lanes looked stronger than ever, and they are even looking for an analyt as Kev1n said!!!!!

**Best Player this Week:** TRACKBALL TRACKBALL TRACKBALLLLLLL

Yes ITS KERP! What a monster what a beast! Last split we could see him doing some good moves but dear lord this week, he really played out of his mind and destroyed. I'm sure he's the week MVP.

If he keeps it like this he'll be definitely there in the top mids in the scene.

A few months ago, I bought a threadmill and started to run in my basement. Did 3 weeks and all was going well... until I started an internship at an hospital and got sick (flu, then a cold). Afterwards, I tried to continue on week 4, but fell off my threadmill and had to take a few days off to heal. It was really stupid: I tried to get all my hair in my headband during my warmup. The headband was on my eyes and next thing I know I flew off on the right and fell hard on the floor on my hip. I had troubles walking afterwards. Then I tried to run again a few days later (a W1D1 run) but I had trouble running one minute and I had to stop halfways.

Now I'm back -again- at W1D2 and everything went really well! I did it faster than I ever run before! One thing is for sure: perseverance will pay off!"

26a20s,6,2014-05-23,Me [20 M/] confused and crestfallen,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/26a20s/me_20_m_confused_and_crestfallen/,"Before you read, I need your advice because I have never dated someone, never really a social person beyond a few friends, and I am basically a 20 year old introverted nerd who enjoys reading and computer games. So you can say i barely have any experience with girls.

So I met this really vivacious and cheerful girl while I am currently doing an internship with a foreign company whom I really fancy getting to know. Problem is that she works in another department while I work in finance, so I don't get the chance to speak to her often. I noticed she had been looking at me while I am in a conversation with someone else ( although she doesnt do that these days) and took that as a possible sign of her being somewhat interested. 

So i tried making small talk through our company's version of skype/IM in recent days, and I have been camping in the building lobby to wait so i can speak to her personally but always never got the chance. and today, I bit the rag by finally asking her personally to her face if she wanted to have lunch with me ( This took a lot of courage for me). She agreed almost readily, which surprised me, but then she followed up by saying that she could gather a whole bunch of her department friends to come as a group to have lunch.

To be honest this was not at all what i envisioned, I felt that my question was straightforward 'i was wondering if you would like to go out for lunch together with me?' so I am feeling rather crestfallen at the fact that she may have just friendzoned me and that she does not want to go on a one to one meeting so we can get to know each other better ( I want to get to know her better).

so during lunchtime she asked if I wanted to join her group and I said it was not convenient and postponed my attendance to next week because I am feeling uncertain of what to do and how to approach the situation. I am not really comfortable in large groups ( I barely know her friends) and I feel that this is going nowhere, so im feeling on the downside right now.

And yes im serious about this, I am looking for a serious dating relationship and not just for bedding her or something. What should I do next? Should I give this up totally and focus on my career and keep both of us as friends ( im about to enter university soon) or should I be more bold and tell her that I am interested in her only?

TL:DR Girl I am interested in may have friendzoned me when I asked her out for lunch, by gathering a group of her friends ( she usually goes out with them for lunch) instead, so I am rather crestfallen and wondering if i should pursue this or just remain friends

We got engaged heading into college because we felt it was right for us. she ended up transferring after one semester to my school (Purdue) because she hated where she was at and found she enjoyed the atmosphere at Purdue better then where she was, and not just because of me. 

We are a very close couple, very loving and spend a lot of our time together.  This summer though she got an internship and will be away from me for 3 months, In a different state while I'll be taking summer classes. 

next week is the last week before she leaves and I guess I'm starting to have a hard time handling it. I'm just worried that were going to both have an awful time without each other and not be able to bail each other out  I don't have any questions or anything I guess I just wanted to vent that I'm feeling scared.:("

Some background:

Myself and two other friends from university decided to do a internship abroad in spain in our third year of studies. All three of us have decently paid jobs in big spanish companies where we are given a lot of responsibility. Although it can be stressful sometimes living in a country where the main language spoken is different from your mother tongue, we manage to get on fairly well, and we have a cute appartment altogether.

My friend, let's call her A, only speaks english whereas myself and my other roomate are at a professional level of spanish. Our friend A really struggles and can only speak one or two phrases. Recently she changed jobs to work for a much better company and here is where her problem began.

--------

A started off with a great working relationship with her boss, she was given more responsibility than at her previous job and was being consistently told how good of a job she was doing. A months in her boss told her how he only hired young foreign females for this position and she wasn't the first who didn't speak spanish as he ""enjoyed having the intern to himself and speaking one on one in english"". 

He has started taking her out on wine tours and forcing her to go out for drinks at lunchtimes rather than letting her interact with other interns there. More recently when she declined his request to have lunch together so she could  revise for her exam he insisted that she was ""no fun, not like how you are on facebook, you love to drink"" and informed her that prior to this job he was a worked in IT and knew how to track and read private profiles.

When she declined his request for a lunch time break so she could revise she joked that she would go back to university without a degree if she didn't study, he replied ""and if you turn me down again you'll come back from your exam with no job"" which she said he said with no humour in his voice.

Last week, he spoke with her about how he has taken previous interns on holidays, to his private residence in the south for weeks at a time ""just for fun"". I told A she should report him but the problem it'll be difficult for her to convey what's happening with him due to the language barrier. I offered to write to her HR manager but I wouldn't know how to start it. Plus A suffers with an anxiety disorder so she's scared of confrontations and keeps telling me she only has to ""make it til the end of july"". How can I help her? Should she report him?

sorry for the wall of text and errors I'm writing this from work

26agzd,1,2014-05-23,(Spoilers All) Arya and her attitude in the show vs the book in ASOS,jdthemannis,asoiaf,https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/26agzd/spoilers_all_arya_and_her_attitude_in_the_show_vs/,"I remember that after the Red Wedding, Arya was in a point of depression that I thought was beyond return. She couldn't care less where the Hound would take her and you could see she doesn't give a crap if she dies or not. When she kills Tickler and then leaves the Hound I think se remembers how good is to have revenge and kill (which for me is a little bit concerning) and then tries to sail to Braavos. 

Now you have show Arya who, in past episodes, is able to be funny (in that man's house where she and the Hound devour the stew) and to care about The Hound's injurys. I remember that she didn't hate Clegane that bad but was having and intern fight over his feelings toward his kidnapper. 

I'm a little worried that people is still cheering and happy for Arya when in that part of the book you were really concerned about her, she was almost suicidal to me. That state of mind is the reason she is becoming a character with so many shades of grey. Could she be a villain in the future? Is she a psycopath? Does she really listen whe the kindly man talks her about the mission and vision of the Faceless Assasins or is she just about vengeance, vengeance, vengeance (ironically like her mother? To me those questions is what makes BookArya an interesting character in ASOIAF. While, until now, ShowArya is just a hero, you can see only white and doesn't see to be grieving a lot about her diceased family. 

Do you think it's valid to do that for D&amp;D just because the screen time of the Hound and Arya makes so many people happy? I get it, they are awesome together, but I think it's a short term reward that it's going to have some consequences in the long run. Many people won't understand (unless they change it too) some of his actiones in Braavos.

I don't know, give me your opinions and sorry for my awful English"

26avl6,9,2014-05-23,Coming to a conclusion with my church drama. The meeting with my former lead pastor.,[deleted],brokehugs,https://www.reddit.com/r/brokehugs/comments/26avl6/coming_to_a_conclusion_with_my_church_drama_the/,"I thought I'd update y'all on the ""personal"" meeting my wife and I had with my former lead pastor to try and at least reach an understanding. It was important for my wife to be there because she's known him for over a decade, and so his actions have personally hurt her and destroyed their friendship.

It actually went a bit better than I thought it might. My wife was really upset and (since she shows emotions more than I do) I think it really became clear for my former lead pastor just how much he has hurt us. At the end he did apologize for not speaking with me sooner or more clearly. He said that he realizes we need time to forgive and that we will need even more time to trust (in my case, if I ever do trust him again.)

My wife was very clear about what she thought he did wrong as a lead pastor. With some things he agreed with my wife, although with other things he disagreed and argued back. He still stands by his assessment that I'm too introverted and lack the communication necessary to be a pastor. But a couple of interesting things came out in what he said. One, he didn't like that I didn't really communicate how I *felt* with him during my intern time. That was apparently problematic. It was at a more heated point in the conversation so I told him that my feelings were none of his damn business. I mean, call me a product of typical American ""boys don't cry"" upbringing, but I choose who I share my emotions with. And I express them in a rather restrained way. 

He also said that he can't believe that it was only in January that I realized how completely differently I would go about making house visits (i.e. not inviting myself to someone's house because from my perspective that would be rude.) He just couldn't believe that I could not know that it was different in this culture than in America. Which we both found a bit ridiculous because I've never HAD to do house visits before. Then he said, ""Well hasn't your wife told you?"" And we said no. Then he had the gall to ask ""So what do you actually talk about?"" Such a stupid question. 

It's also pretty clear that he still can't comprehend that I am so completely different from him. That I communicate differently, think differently and work differently. It's like he just can't get that. Which is disturbing in a pastor. I even told him that I think my mentor was right when my mentor said that he has never really understood me.

Although he did say something VERY revealing right around the end. My wife told him that she had the feeling that he just dumped me on the charge to see if I could make it. She said she couldn't understand that and did it have something to do with him having a lot of extra work to do?, etc. So he started to talk about his work and then he let slip this nugget: ""When the District Superintendent asked me if I wanted an intern, I thought 'I don't want that.'"" At that point I interrupted him and pointed out just how important that one little phrase was, ""I didn't want an intern."" He got confused because he didn't even realize that he let it slip. But my wife caught it too. I said that I think he brought that attitude into his work whether he realizes it or not. Whether he meant to or not. And I think that attitude really was present the whole time I was there.

Like I said, it was a bit better than I thought it would be. He has seen now just how much he has hurt us. I think that has, for the first time, really been driven home. He still stands by his perspective, but he's been made aware of how many mistakes he's made and he apologized for many of them. What this means for the future, I don't know. Luckily it's not like I have to see him so constantly anymore."

I just feel so fucking violated and for some reason embarrassed and ashamed at the same time.

I have a summer internship that I work at two or three days a week, and today I finished my work early and was able to leave early, which was awesome. I love my internship but really need a paying job so I've been applying all over my city, and since I was off work early I thought I'd follow up at a place at an outdoor market that told me they might have an opening.

The market is really cool and actually fairly famous, but the neighborhood it's in has its ups and downs. It's a bit ghetto and sketchy in places, but also contains a ton of historic buildings, some trendy independently owned shops and restaurants, and a gorgeous park that is probably my favorite place in the whole city. It still has a reputation (especially amongst the middle-class white people in my area) for being hood as fuck and completely unsafe, but from my experience 99% of the people there are friendly, cool, and helpful.

Anyway, I stopped at the market, still in my work clothes (a simple business-casual dress and flats) only to find that the hiring manager had left early and I'd have to stop back tomorrow. But it was a gorgeous day, and not too late in the afternoon, so I decided to walk down to the park I mentioned earlier and enjoy the sunshine for a while, then maybe stop at some of the shops in the trendier part of the neighborhood to see if any of them were hiring. 

On my way down to the park, I realized that the street from the market to the park was actually pretty long, and pretty sketchy. Nothing I couldn't handle, but a couple of jackasses started catcalling me as I walked by (one guy said ""hey baby, lemme get a slice of that pie!"" y'know, shit like that). Ugh. I felt a bit uncomfortable and embarrassed, but I decided to ignore them and go enjoy the park, which I did (had a long conversation with a sweet old black lady about Frieda Kahlo, which was unexpected but cool--like I said, 99% of the people in this neighborhood are friendly and awesome) and then wandered down to the shops for a bit. 

As I started the walk back to my car (which was still parked at the market) I realized that I had absolutely no fucking idea where I was. I turned down what I thought was the right street, looked around, realized I still didn't know where I was, lather, rinse, repeat, until I was totally and thoroughly lost, on one of the sketchier side streets of the area. At this point I was a little worried, but I've gotten lost in worse places, so I just pulled out my phone with GPS for directions back to the market. As I walked in the direction it told me to go, I passed another guy, with several friends, who shouted ""mm baby, how much for that?"" 

I'd never felt more uncomfortable, but I just tried to ignore him and kept walking, even though he was still shouting shit at me, and his friends had joined in. At this point I'm near tears, my feet have blisters on them from my flats, I just want to get the fuck back to my car and go home. I get to an intersection where I need to cross the street. As I'm waiting for the light to turn, I glance behind me and this guy and one of his friends had fucking FOLLOWED me to the intersection and were right behind me, still saying sexually explicit things to me. I turned around to just tell them to stop, thinking maybe that would do something, and saw one of the guys reaching out to try and physically grab my ass.

 At that point I literally ran across the street, because fuck the don't walk sign, and walked as fast as possible back towards where my car was. I made it back to my car, happily, but not before getting catcalled by TWO MORE DIFFERENT GUYS.

I got into my car and literally just sat there and cried for probably ten minutes before I felt stable enough to drive home. I'm probably overreacting, I didn't get groped or raped or assaulted, but I feel so fucking violated and somehow also really embarrassed and ashamed, like it was my fault for wearing a dress and makeup in a sketchy area, or just being in that area in the first place. I feel like if I tell anyone then they'll tell me it's my own fault, I just feel so stupid and ashamed and gross and I don't know what to do or if I should even do anything. All I wanted to do was enjoy a cool neighborhood on a Friday afternoon. Why can't I fucking do that without becoming like some fucking sex object that only exists to be objectified? Fuck.

I'm sorry for the long story and the rant. I just needed to tell somebody. Ugh.

EDIT: Wow, coming back to see all this support really, really helped. Thank you all so much for the virtual hugs and reassurances that it's ok to be upset and that I didn't do anything wrong. I think the most annoying part is that I know with absolute certainty in the logical part of my brain that their actions weren't my fault, and yet for some reason I STILL feel angry at myself. I don't know why that is, and it's as confusing to me as it would be to anyone else. 

For people asking why I didn't put them in their place or defend myself, I should explain that I've never been catcalled by so many people in such a short period of time, and I'm not used to being catcalled at all in the first place (I'm from a pretty suburban area). When that sort of thing happens and you're not prepared for it, your head starts racing and so many thoughts and feelings hit at once, and before you can form a coherent sentence in your defense, even if it's just ""fuck you,"" the moment's over and the people are behind you. I wish I'd said something in retrospect, but I'm trying not to beat myself up about the fact that I didn't."

3. Dave, another admin, you're old have a wife and kid and blaze higher than my GPA.... Sadly the summer job I will have to turn down because I will be doing 35 hours a week at the boys and Girls club, but maybe during my college life you will need an intern.

4. Cowobys, you threw a shit ton of passes, and I always hated putting Jerrod Johnson as POTW, he usually could have won every week

5. Broncos aka Jay aka my PA relative aka my college rival, we'll see a lot of each other during college, so you'll hear my true feelings when we both get drunk and recreate the scene from neighbors.

26c7c0,43,2014-05-23,Mrs. Frechette! All I wanted was to love you...,sadie1700,confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/26c7c0/mrs_frechette_all_i_wanted_was_to_love_you/,"Adored, wild, strange, irresistible. I have no idea what was in her face that was vaguely lovable.

She molested my visions, provoked pathos. When I closed my eyes, I saw her grey hair tangle to the side, as she glanced at me from her crow's feet-embedded blue eyes. Whenever I was near her, her scent lingered, and I'd pause, let it wash over me.

I was 17-years-old. My mom asked me to come over to her travel agency to drop some food off, because she was still busy at work, and she didn't have time to step away. So my boyfriend left the car engine on, and I darted inside.

That's when I first saw Mrs. Frechette behind the cubicle. Her hair was in a tight bun, and her body was tightly wrapped inside a matching blue blouse and skirt. In the immediate moment, I felt nothing except a curiosity.

But when I came home later that night and drifted off to sleep, I couldn't escape her. There she was, so perfect and prim, grey hair, and laughter lines around her mouth. I felt a strong energy: lust, lust, lust, as she floated in and out of my dreams.

When I awoke, I felt stupid and mediocre. Who am I? What have I done with my life? How do I impress her?

Could I ever be lavished by her love, just for a moment, just for acknowledgment, just for ""the look"" that might as well be a kiss, a kiss that's all-too-brief (still not real), but a moment, yes, a moment that brings she and I closer to the cosmos?

For two years, I tried to escape her. I tried to pretend she didn't exist. But I kept finding excuses to come over to my mom's travel agency. 

""Hey mom, I brought you salad.""

""Hey mom, the accountant wanted me to personally deliver this message to you.""

""Hey mom, can my friend intern here?""

It was always to be around Mrs. Frechette. It was always to see if she knew I existed. It was always so I could smell her scent as I walked past her cubicle.

In the event she was gone, I'd try to remember everything on her desk: her motivational posters, pictures of her family, the Acer monitor tilted just so.

I couldn't mention anything to anyone, but quietly I broke up with my boyfriend, telling him I wanted to ""grow"" and ""explore life"". The reality is, I felt sick. I didn't know how anyone—never mind a girl like me—could ever feel satisfied. Yes, I was in college, now living in a dorm, seemingly with the world at my feet. 

But I didn't have Mrs. Frechette.

Then one day, my mom wasn't in the office, but Mrs. Frechette was alone. It was pouring rain outside—damp—a grey day. 

I walked by her desk, and I don't know what came over me. I just stared.

""What do you want?"" Mrs. Frechette asked me in her cordial, professional manner.

I smiled.

Our passions, dyed with blood from our beating hearts, did not match the present grey day. In that moment, it seemed time stopped—a thin curtain between now and a world of shadows. When our eyes met, it was like suddenly looking at the world as it actually was, instead of a dim looking glass.

And our eyes! They say eyes are the windows to the soul, yet when our gazes locked, I felt that I had to build stratagems and tactics—in the great hope that Mrs. Frechette would not turn contemptuous.

Mrs Frechette, so grey, so curvy, so stately, so *uhhhh!* She will always be beautiful, alluring, heart-stopping, laughing, winking, cajoling, her presence stomping on my dreams and allusions and songs, whispering with her red lips.

Then we kissed.

And all the while, I wondered, ""Mrs. Frechette, do you feel the impulse? Do you feel abandon? Is your stomach making flips, as though it's flung upwards by the wind?""

I felt a flame, and a kaleidoscope of wild colour, and heartbeats racing.

It was there—all in the kiss.

And I knew: I loved her.

That was 10 years ago. Two weeks ago, I married Mrs. Frechette. People think that because I'm her wife, I should call her by her first name—but she'll always be my Mrs. Frechette.

Here's my confession. It's a small one, but important. Last night, I wondered, ""What if our love grows cold?""

But just as quickly, I stared at Mrs. Frechette eye-to-eye, touched her flesh, and whispered to her, ""I love you.""

""I love you too,"" Mrs. Frechette replied.

""Good night, sweetheart.""

26ce3h,1,2014-05-23,Questionable Thoughts [M21/F19] [Somewhat Long],tossawayLDR,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/26ce3h/questionable_thoughts_m21f19_somewhat_long/,"First off: I decided against posting this to /r/relationships, because I don’t feel as if they would understand long distance as well as you guys do.  I do follow this subreddit on my main account.    
  
Here's the situation:  a little more than two years ago I met a girl online.  We hit it off and I ended up meeting her very shortly thereafter. I went way out of my comfort zone with that but it ended up very well. This is my very first relationship, and it is hers as well. I love this girl immensely.  I am not sure when we will be able to close the gap because she wants to get her masters, or doctorate even. She just finished up her first semester of college. I am about a year away from finishing my Bachelors and there’s an extremely low chance I will continue and get a masters. She occasionally begs me to move to her, 5 states away, after I graduate. I currently live with my parents and work part time while I finish up school, and I enjoy it. They also like my girlfriend for the most part.  Though, my girlfriend says I need to ""choose what is more important” that being, her or my family; and “live my own life” and be the one to close the distance as soon as possible. She has tried to make me promise I will move there to be with her and “it’s not like I’d be alone” as I’d have her there to help provide a little bit of financial support. I personally have no problem with the distance.  At times, however, she does.  She can’t handle it as well as I can.  I may just be a terrible person, but I value my time away from her (we use video calling daily) I have my own life to attend to, but that doesn’t mean I don’t make time for her.  I just want us to live our lives long distance for now and experience life before we finally live together, I’m (sort of) ok with that being a few years from now.  She wants the distance to end ASAP so we can get our life together started.  This is a girl I would have no problem marrying and starting a family with.  

Here’s the catch: I recently began a year-round internship with an extremely good company. I’m talking google-tier.  The experience and knowledge I will gain (and have already gained) during this internship will be very valuable to me, and having this company on my resume helps line me up for major success in the future. This is a position I would keep throughout my remaining 2 or 3 semesters of school and I would most likely be turned into a full time employee after I graduate (according to my uncle, who works there as well). She is extremely supportive and seems super happy for me and excited.  I wonder if she even yet realizes this hurts my chance at closing the distance almost entirely… or if she’s just not voicing it to me because she doesn’t want to seem unsupportive.  
She will inevitably ask it… Should I ever be expected to give up a good position in the future to move to her…? (This company has no presence in her state, so I wouldn’t be able to “just transfer”)  I could not imagine ever giving up an amazing opportunity like this… I don’t exactly want to be the one to make the move.  My family is pretty important to me.  A good majority of us are FINALLY all together in the same state. Everything is going well.  My girlfriend says she would also be giving things up, which I understand, but I don’t feel as if it is nearly as much as I would be giving up (I understand this is a selfish thought… I can’t help it.  She lived with her dad during high school and although they have a good relationship, he was happy to have “gotten rid of her” when she left for college.)       
  


And now… the bad thoughts I’ve been having for the past month: I've been told I'm a very attractive guy, however I never was able to talk to women without being awkward all throughout my teenage years and up until now. As much as I love my girlfriend, I feel as if I’m also missing out on a lot of experiences by being in this LDR.  My relationship has taught me a lot about myself, and overall transformed me into a more confident/likable person. My parents tell me to keep my options open, but it kind of hurts me when they say that because it’s like they think I should find a girl closer to home that is “less trouble.” Most of the time, I can’t imagine being with anyone else.  The really sad thing is, I sometimes sort of agree with my parents but I don’t want to risk giving up an amazing relationship for something so uncertain.  I also feel guilty for even THINKING about it.  I'm afraid of ruining the relationship, but I’m also afraid that I may be limiting myself and preventing myself from having an amazing relationship/experiences with someone else.   I don't want to end this relationship because it would absolutely devastate her and it would hurt me very badly as well.      
  

Am I being selfish?  Are my feelings warranted?  Do I really have a reason to end this relationship and try to find someone else closer to home? I don’t feel like we have any problems in our relationship (sometimes we fight, but that’s assumed with every relationship).  I really don’t think we should break up… I just want her to be happy but I need to set up my career before I do ANY moving.  I do realize we are both young… I just want some insight from some people with more experiences than myself.  Note, she has said she would move to me (after her schooling) if I never ended up going there.

It would be nice to have some people to hang out with, or to just show me around the town. 

A little about me. I live in PA, attend school in VT, and just finished a semester abroad in Montreal. Starting this fall I will be starting my senior year as a game programmer with a completed minor in mathematics. Clearly I love to play video games (when time allows), but on top of that I also read, cook, hike, watch anime, and consider myself an amateur astronomer. 

I do my best to constantly strive for self-improvement, in both myself and those close to me. Yet I never waste an opportunity to relax with friends or devour a bag of candy. 

[Also I am trying to revolutionize bathroom selfies.](http://i.imgur.com/tiNyfDs.jpg)

As I said in the title, I am mixed race, black and hispanic. I have naturally curly hair, but in about the fifth grade, I begged my mom to allow me to straighten my hair. Ever since then, I have been getting relaxers, with an about 18 month break, ending this past January.

I regret now ever relaxing my hair. It was gorgeous when I was younger, and I don't know if I will ever be able to get that back. I've also been coloring my hair, in various ways, since 8th grade.

First semester of college, I really started to grow tired of my hair. I attemted to wear it natural, but it just wasn't working. Over half of my previous relaxer had grown out, but the damage was done. I finally caved in January. My hair has been dyed red twice in this time frame, once in the fall, and again about a month ago.

Now I have new growth and its frustrating to straighten it every day. I could always get the relaxer touched up, but I don't want my hair to be any more damaged then it already is. I can't not flat iron it, but even then it gets frizzy and looks terrible. I have a job and an internship, I have to look presentable, but that is getting increasingly challenging. I honestly don't know what to do.

Thanks in advance for any help however it may come. I don't know how to put my hair though rehab while looking presentable day to day."

Let me explain my scenario. I am a (f18) and I am about to graduate from high school. These past four years have been nothing but my drive to succeed in school, study, and get straight A's. Along the way, I sacrificed my social life and relationships. I have been asked out on dates, i've had a few boyfriends- but it never worked out. This was due in large part to my crazy schedule with sports, my internship, peer tutoring, debate, etc. School has been my main focus for these past four years and I have never really felt obligated to get side tracked by a relationship. 

Well, my hard work paid off and I was accepted into a professional program that guarantees my JD Law degree in six years.
However, I resent the fact that I have focused on school so much because I forced myself to hold boys at a distance. Come my senior year, I was in a short relationship with a fellow debate partner of mine, and we split because I had no time for the relationship. This was in december, and after we split I decided no more relationships. I needed to focus on school, college apps, water polo, debate, mock trial, my internship, etc. (I have no idea how I managed to do all of this, to be honest).

At the time of my split, I got a paid reporting job that I could do on the side. My internship was not paid, so I had to make money some how. So I took the reporting job and was in charge of writing weekly articles on boys water polo. Through my job, I met many different athletes and got to know them on a more personal level. I was driven by this job because I found strength in my job because I channelled all of my anger and resent from my breakup into writing.

As I started to adjust to my job, I met one player. We can call him A. Now A was different from any other player that I had met; he was intelligent, considerate, and we clicked instantly. The first interview we had was over skype because I couldn't plan one in person, due to my insane schedule. Our interview went for around two hours, and we didn't really get much work done outside of talk about god knows what.
I got to know A throughout the season through a professional relationship, and I forced myself to keep it professional even though I thought he was extremely attractive.

Well, thanks to religiously reading Askmen threads, after the season was over, I admitted that I thought he was incredibly attractive out of the blue. It took him a day to respond, which made me nervous as heck, but we decided to establish a FWB arrangement.
This was in december. Fast forward to May.

The intent of this physical relationship was to just have sex. We both didn't want relationships, and we didn't want to be tied down. I felt like I was too busy for anyone, but I needed a way to release stress. Sex is something that I turn to as a way to relieve all of my tension.
Our FWB relationship has worked out tremendously because we have become close friends. I know these types of relationships aren't supposed to work this way, but somehow it just happens. As I reflect on these past few months, I realize what made this work is the mutual respect we established earlier in the arrangement. I did not talk to anyone about this because he told me he didn't want his teammates to find out about us being fwb. While this is a huge dick move, I just decided to say ""okay"" and proceed to keep quiet for the next six months.

A and I have become good friends. Although I initiate conversations 97% of the time, he's always willing to listen. (Although i'm sure that I annoy the shit out of him sometimes :) He knows about my friend's suicide, that my old editor's daughter is diagnosed with stage 3 lukemia (I visit her on a weekly basis, and she is very dear to me), and i've gotten him a paid internship at a law firm through my uncle. I know about some of his past, he's given me advice, and been (according to him ) ""the rock"". We both trust each other and it's taken a while to establish that mutual trust. In fact, he said to me, ""You're actually the first girl who hasn't run around and told everyone about us. I applaud you.""

However, the other day (tuesday) I was with my friends and we were discussing why I couldn't tell them about A. I have kept A a secret from my friends and family because those were his wishes. I thought this was fine, until one of my close friends said, ""Why do you defend him when he is just embarrassed of you?""

What she said made me think. I mean, if I was giving A a paid job, inviting him to my birthday party (it's going to be a gigantic bash!); why should I be friends with someone who's embarrassed of me? This angered the fuck out of me.

On a side note, I have been super stressed due to finals, and my friend's memorial is coming up. This is the friend that committed suicide. Lately my mood hasn't been the best and I have been trying to keep everything together. The impact of my editor's daughter's sickness is overwhelming, and it's hard to handle everything when you really want to cry. However, crying will not help, and I have to carry on.
Back to my story, I was feeling particularly stressed on tuesday due to the memorial, my senior project, and finals. But the thought that he was embarrassed made me so angry, so I sat him down the next day, and told him he couldn't be my friend anymore because I knew he was embarrassed. At one point I started to cry, and he just sat there in silence for a few minutes.

After I was done, I told him that he could leave. I didn't want to subject him to that situation and make him feel trapped. But instead, he said to me, ""can I please explain?""

He said: ""Look, I can understand why it looks that way. But you need to know that i'm not embarrassed of you. In fact i'm very impressed by you. You're smart, attractive, driven, the connections you have, and it's amazing how much you care about others. You have a lot on your plate, obviously, and I don't blame you for feeling stressed. I'm not embarrassed, and I never meant to come off that way. The thing is, I really don't like the guys that I have to play with that go to your school. I try to stay away from them because I never really got along with them. But now that we're leaving you can tell them. I just didn't want to deal with them asking me at practice about you and I, but high school is over and if they have something to say, then that's a risk i'm going to have to take.""

We sat there for the next three hours talking about life, relationships, and just chilling. Eventually we had sex in the back of my car hahaha.

Now here I am, talking to a boy I barely knew six months ago. We didn't want a relationship, we've grown close, and I thought he was just using me for sex. I have no feelings for this dude, but I have grown to care for him.

However, he admits to me that he's never had a best friend and he wants to get married so he can find someone to share that bond with (this is his reasoning, although it doesn't make sense). During his freshman and sophomore year, he wanted a girl friend so badly, and he's had a really bad experience with a girl. This was the night when I saw a more vulnerable side of him, and we was incredibly sweet and it was actually adorable listening to him explain his thoughts on relationships.

Well, as the classic tale goes, I can't stop thinking about him since that night. I realize that, even if I didn't want a relationship with him in the beginning, I'm starting to see that I have developed feelings for him. He and I click so well together, we bring out the best in each other, and there's so much trust in our friendship.

I'm not entirely sure where this leaves him and I, but I am so scared to tell him how I feel. He makes me feel happy, like I get this tingly feeling inside my chest when I think of him. No boy has ever done that before. I just want to be around him all the time now, and we could talk to each other for hours. I want him to be happy and successful.

But I am so nervous to ruin our friendship because it took a while to build something like this. I am also scared shitless of rejection. Give or take, I don't want to have a feeling of heartbreak- because when you meet someone who you think is so right for you, it just clicks. However, I have a high chance of rejection because he will be leaving right after graduation to go train overseas in Europe for water polo, and then he comes back in August to start training for college. I'm not really sure what to do at this point.

I asked my brothers and they didn't know either, and so I ask the people of reddit for their help.

Starting around June 15th I'll be living with a friend who has the same internship (full time). He likes Healer/Tank and I am leaning towards Stalker Tank/SS Healer/Engineer DPS.

Unfortunately he has a heavy course load so he can't play until June 10th or so, but I have a 4 day weekend lined up for launch and I'd love to be able to play with some hoopy froods.

We want to do maybe one or two weeknights plus weekends for raiding, but that may increase. After 6pm PST is when we will probably be free (don't have final work schedule).

We are both vets, I did hardcore raiding in Vanilla WoW (It's a bit fuzzy as I was young). He also played Vanilla WoW, and I know he was pretty into it but idk how much.

Haven't done any really interesting stuff for a while. Leveled a few TERA characters recently but kind of lost interest as I approached endgame.

26d89e,2,2014-05-24,I think I'm going to drop out of university... again.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/26d89e/i_think_im_going_to_drop_out_of_university_again/,"TL;DR: made the mistake of choosing a course I didn't care about again. Inevitably going to drop out/get kicked out. Don't plan on going to university again anytime soon. What should I do now?

Good morning everyone, I'm a 20 year old from the UK.

So here's my story. In September 2012, I started a Chinese and Japanese course at University of Manchester after finishing A levels. I wanted to take a gap year but having Asian parents meant I had to go to uni. My mom forced me to pick a course from clearing. It wasn't entirely her fault though. Going to a grammar school made it seem like university was the only option. They didn't talk about what other paths to take. Anyway, I went to UoM for four months and decided to drop out without telling my parents first. I couldn't take studying something I didn't enjoy or care about.

For the rest of the year, I lived with my cousin in London and did a couple of internships at creative agencies. I really had a lot of fun and experience working around in the office with like minded people and going to video shoots to help out. I even briefly appeared in an online Microsoft ad.

September 2013, I started going to Aston University to do Multimedia Computing. Honestly, I didn't want to go to university again. But I also didn't want to dispppint my mom. I know, I haven't learned my lesson from the year before. I always say to myself to be more selfish, and to make decisions for myself and not for my mom, but I made the stupid mistake again. I managed to somehow get through a year of lectures but I hadn't learned anything. I thought the course would be a good mix of something I'd enjoy and something that would help me in the future as the course was supposed to be about creative media and programming. Turns out programming made up 90% of the course and the multimedia part of the course was useless, as they taught Flash which no one uses anymore.

Which brings me to now, May 2014. I have exams next week and now I know I won't pass them. Simply because I haven't taken anything in. I literally know nothing. I'm not enjoying this course at all. I've had such a bad experience that every time I open up my coding program that I feel a bit sick. 

The reason I don't want to go to university is because there's no courses I like that aren't Mickey Mouse courses. I'm a creative person and I like to learn practically so I can't learn by sitting in a lecture hall and reading presentations. All the ones I do like, like Filmography or Photography are apparently useless, and I'm scared because of that. I don't want to waste money on a course that won't help me in the future.

So now my question is, what should I do? In a better world, I'd get a job and rent a flat and move out so I wouldn't have to disappoint and rely on my parents anymore. Is that feasible? I just know that my mom is gonna get so mad and so upset that I failed university again. I feel so pathetic."
26dc7i,6,2014-05-24,(23/m - 8 years deep) Day 1. First serious quit. Beginning with a camping trip.,doingbusinessDOBIS,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/26dc7i/23m_8_years_deep_day_1_first_serious_quit/,"Well first let me give you some background. I'm 23, and I've been smoking for about 8 years, with 5-6 daily use, and 1 year of almost exclusive concentrate use. 

I've tried (to no avail) to curb my consumption for years, but I've only ever smoked more and stronger products as time went on. The last year, I've been smoking dabs almost exclusively, which has made it even harder. The feelings that I felt the last two times I tried to take a week off have shown me how deeply psychologically and even physically dependent I am on this substance.

I was always a kick-ass student, but I had a sad freshman year of college, leading me (or as a result of?) spending most of my time in my dorm numbing myself with sweet Indica. This time period was probably the first that I treated marijuana in a negative, dependent, crutch-type way.

And ever since then, I've been ""getting by"". I went to a state school for a degree in English, where it wasn't very competitive, and I could get decent grades doing very little, skipping lots of class, and handing in 90% complete research papers.

But I rode my privilege even further, and with very few credentials (no internships, and very little relevant work experience from those years, because ""who cares? let's just get high.""), I got a decent paying job as a web editor for a big corporation that makes web sites for small businesses. I was really excited to kick ass at something for the first time in a really long time. For once, to not know I could do better with effort, but to actually put that effort forth and reap the glory of a job well done.

I didn't smoke before work for the first month. Then, as soon as I was comfortable enough in my duties to feel like I could get away with it, I took a dab before work. Immediately, I started taking dabs before work every single day. Then one day on lunch break, I realized that I had an oil rig down in the car for the night that I would spend at my GF's. From that point forward, I took a dab AT WORK on every lunch break.

After doing this for a few weeks, it occurred to me that all the problems I had in college were creeping into my work life -- I became incredibly anxious around people, I tried so hard to be DL that I more or less stopped socializing with my peers, it made it impossible to think linearly resulting in terrible efficiency, I was sleepy all day every day, and overall, I was satisfied with the bare-ass minimum.

After several attempts at avoiding pre- and at-work dabs, always ending in failure (sometimes a couple weeks, other times only days -- because you and I know that there is always an excuse for why this one time is ok), it became abundantly clear that due to my lack of self control and dependence on this substance, I was at the bottom of the pack in my team.

In a major turn of events, soon after, my entire department was laid off and outsourced. We had 7 weeks to continue working through the transition period and find new jobs. Once again, I rode my wave of privilege and found a job as the social media manager for a small marketing firm. 

I would have to move, I would have to start a new job... And I had to accept, finally, that I could not succeed at this new opportunity if I am high all the god-damn time. I could not become comfortable in the work place with my co-workers, if I'm spending all my mental energy hiding this ""secret"" from everyone. I just didn't want to makes ALL THE SAME MISTAKES THAT I HAVE BEEN MAKING FOR 5+ YEARS.

So that brings me to now. Yesterday was my last day at my old job, and it was also my last day smoking/dabbing.

I'm going on a 3-day camping trip with some of closest, oldest friends, and I'm hoping that being in the woods away from everything will help to keep me in the moment and act as a natural anti-depressant, pending the inevitable anger and mood swings that I'm about to experience. And next week is all about getting my things packed up and moving to my new apartment, where I plan to bring NO weed things. Nothing. Nada. 

This will be the first time that I've gone more than 7 or 8 hours, without specifically planning for a way to get high at the first reasonable moment. And it's fucking scary. I'm scared. I'm anxious. But for the first time since I began this love affair (and oh it was a love affair), I'm ready to be done. Done with the social anxiety, done with the couchlock, done with the bad eating habits, done with my mediocrity.

So here I stand before you. Day 1. Strap yourselves in because it's about to be a roller coaster."

I just can't do it anymore. The lying, the identities I have to keep going. I've fallen for APs before and they for me but I can't ever leave my family life, I have young kids and they mean too much to me.
Every time I have to break off with an AP it kills me just a little bit more, I know I shouldn't get emotionally involved but I guess that's just me - APs for me are about more than just sex, I need that emotional attachment too and that's when it becomes dangerous.
When you have something that means so much to you and time and time again you have to break it off and start again with someone else.
It's like the most fucked up version of Groundhog Day you could find.
I've just ended things with AP.. I don't even know the number ? 50 something? She had to go back west and wanted me to go with her, as much as my heart screamed at me to just be with her my head wouldn't let me.
So here I am again, keeping my happy home face on and no one knows that I'm just dying inside, again.
But you know what, couple of months I'll be over this and that cute intern in the office who smiles a lot at me.. Yep I'll be there again.. Rinse and repeat.. Fuck this life "

To the intern reading this:

Tell Dan to get his shit together. I just sat in traffic for 45 minutes because some idiot decided to shut down Tryon so a bunch of obese people could waddle their way through a 5k gasping for life. Your town is too fat for this shit. I sat 100 feet from my building watching fat people sweat for 30 minutes while a fat cop wouldnt even let me idle across the road between the packs and I was only at the halfway point. These people were so pathetic that they had at least a 30 minute spread a mile or two into the race. You look like a man who was in shape at one point of your life. We both know this is doable in under 30 minutes without training.

Im not saying we cant let them run. These people should be encouraged to run (even walk, as most were doing). Just intelligently set up a course somewhere. I can find plenty of rural roads on a map of NC if you need my help for that. If youre going to fucking shut down the pipeline to the heart of the city, do it for people who arent losers. I would only expect that kind of preferential treatment for athletes.

26ell3,2,2014-05-24,"Help Me Study Abroad in Tel Aviv, Israel",syrinj,Assistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/26ell3/help_me_study_abroad_in_tel_aviv_israel/,"[I just started a GoFundMe campaign](http://www.gofundme.com/Study-in-Israel) to help raise money so I can pay for an $8k internship program in Tel Aviv, Israel

I am a full-time student at the University of Maryland who wishes to take on internships and studies abroad in Tel Aviv, Israel. I've answered any questions below.

&gt;**ABOUT ME**

I am a full-time undergraduate student at the University of Maryland majoring in Legal Studies (with a minor in Business Administration). I work as a paralegal intern in Washington, DC, but I live in Montgomery County, MD. I'm in the last stretch of my undergraduate program (and therefore trying to boost a 3.5 GPA to 3.8 before it's too late).

Upon graduation (likely Spring 2015), I will be aiming high for law school to focus on Business and International Law.



&gt;**ABOUT THE PROGRAM**

The program, provided by WUJS Israel ( www.wujsisrael.org), is roughly five months long, and would place me in internships in fields of my choosing (I'm shooting for entrepreneurship).

While in the program, I would be living independently among Israelis while working at an internship about 30 hours per week and fostering a command of the Hebrew language on the side. I would also be networking extensively and participating in group activities like field trips and hikes.

While I'm there, I will still be enrolled at Maryland via online classes, so any free time I have down there will remain somewhat limited as it is currently (I wouldn't have it any other way).

The price tag for the program is about $8,000 (pretty hefty to raise in only a few months).



&gt;**WHY TEL AVIV, ISRAEL?**

Israel is known as the ""Start-Up Nation"" and for a good reason: its roughly 60-year-old economy is flourishing beyond comprehension. This internship would provide me a wonderful opportunity to get involved in the start-ups that contribute to this boom from their earliest stages.

The majority of Israel's start-ups are in Tel Aviv, a thriving metropolis that absorbs the bulk of Israel's population (second only to Jerusalem). Most of these companies are hi-tech and have made significant advances in a short period of time.

A long-term goal of mine is to ""make Aliyah,"" meaning I intend to acquire Israeli citizenship and live there.



&gt;**WHY I CHOSE GOFUNDME (AND WHAT ELSE I'M DOING)**

Being a full-time student while raising money and maintaining a healthy and successful work-school-life balance has proven hectic—particularly in this case where the time-span is rather short—but I do what I can. I'm going out of my way to exhaust all available sources of funding outside of this platform.

•  **I've applied for numerous scholarships and grants and am always researching to find more.** I spend a huge chunk of my time drafting e-mails, essays, and letters to individuals and organizations that align with programs like WUJS asking about resources for funding.

•  **I'm posting flyers** to bulletin boards at my local Jewish Community Center, some synogagues, and other relevant establishments.

•  **I'm saving money** from my current internship. I anticipate that this will make up the bulk of the funding.



&gt;**WHAT YOU GET FOR CONTRIBUTING**

I don't enjoy the idea of being a beggar, but my monetary options are quite limited. So where my ability is lacking, willingness will have to do. With that in mind, I've decided among some options below:

•  **A Blog.** Blogs allow me to live vicariously through others. So, to update those who are curious about where their money is going (and anyone else for that matter), I'll be maintaining one. This content will include massive amounts of pictures, commentary, and video—all taken, written, and filmed by me. As long as I find Wi-Fi, there will be updates.

•  **""Thank You"" Letters.** I enjoy saying ""thank you,"" so expect some extensive letters saying so (and you'll probably get more than one).

•  **Souvenirs.** I love getting gifts for people. Just ask me for a souvenir and it'll be in your hands soon enough!

Admittedly, these perks certainly aren't extravagant, but they are among what I can offer for the time being. I am also open to more ideas as I enjoy giving back what I can.



&gt;**...AND SOME FINAL THOUGHTS...**

**$8,000 is a hefty price tag.** With that said, I feel that fulfillment of that amount through GoFundMe is an irrational expectation. I've seen causes much greater than this get extraordinary funding in mere days. This is more for my own benefit, so as stated above, I anticipate my own funding will make up the bulk of the payment.

**Nevertheless,** all contributions, from $1 (yes, really) to the highest anyone can give, are very much appreciated. Thank you!"
26etdz,10,2014-05-24,Scared with noone to turn to... Anyone please help?,teethadvice,Dentistry,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dentistry/comments/26etdz/scared_with_noone_to_turn_to_anyone_please_help/,"Hi all,  
  
I've been irresponsible with my teeth and I take full responsibility that I haven't been taking care of it as I should. But now I need advice and I feel like crying because I'll be all alone in this. And this is super long because there's a lot of history. 
  
Two years ago, I decided to go to the dentist by myself. I was 19. Mom isn't particularly fond of dentists and do not respect their practice. She has drilled in me since I was a kid that dentists just are out to get money by recommending treatments for patients that they don't need. Anyway, I had to make the appointment and arrange everything myself. I took public transportation and went in alone. The dentist told me I needed to have one filling and asked if I wanted to get it done. I said that I had to ask my mom first.  
  
Well, I asked my mom and she goes on this rants on how you can fix cavities and that I shouldn't get the fillings done and that she's not paying for anything. And, again, that made my self esteem feel low but I thought that maybe it wasn't meant to be as I have to return to college the next week anyway. I decided to listen to her wishes and be very diligent with my teeth as I came back to college. But, I was still planning to return during winter break to get it done and informed my mom of my plans. And she said it was unnecessary nor urgent and you can just wait till you get back the next summer. 
  
So, I was like okay. I didn't return home the next summer as I was doing internships and what not, but I think next christmas break  I finally decided to go to the dentist again. And then the dentist was like now I have 4 teeth that needs to get work done. And that the one tooth would need a root canal now because I waited too long. Of course, that made me feel terrible. Again, I told my mom what he said, and she started saying the same things and making me feel bad about any decision I was to make about my teeth. And that the dentist is fooling me and just wants money. In the end, I decided to go against my mother's wishes, and get the three new cavities filled, but I couldn't afford the root canal and there wouldn't be any time since I had to go to college soon. I broke down and started crying in the dentist seat because 1. I was alone 2. Just feeling overly terrible on how I caused this on myself and 3. Because I wasn't certain if I was making the right decision. Mother pretty much told me that whatever I was doing with my teeth would be my own decision, and she's against everything, and doesn't want to hear about it. When I look back at that day at the dentist, I feel super embarrassed because I was just crying on his chair and he even gave me a discount, but it was still not an experience I want to repeat. 
  
Now, I finally graduated. And it is two years after the fact and I haven't gotten the main tooth problems I needed fixed. And I have two really bad pains in my two back teeth on either side. Plus, one of my filling my previous dentist did is too high and I just dealt with it for a year (I was able to do this because of my bad alignment of my teeth from a braces stint has caused my top and bottom teeth to not really close together. Again I am planning to fix this once I have money and not rely on my mother's advice because when I lost my retainer, she told me that it wasn't necessary to get one. In fact, she was really upset when the ortondist put permanent retainers on me and didn't want me to wear the normal retainer and balked that people wore it for the rest of their lives)... Plus, I never really liked how my braces (since I had overbite) made my jaw protrude. It really affected how I viewed my attraction, and the orthodontist when I was younger recommended that I get some teeth extracted because my mouth was too small or teeth too big (I forget), but my mom went against it. Even my friends noticed it happening (my jaw getting big) and it's another thing, I deeply regret and wish I could somehow change.  
  
Again, I made alot of mistakes with my teeth and I just don't know what to do. I just graduated from college, and do not have alot of money. I'm just ashamed because if I just decided to come home for winter break that one time and get that main cavity filled I wouldn't be having this severe pain right now. When I tell my mom about my teeth pain, she again just tells me that I can fix it with special toothpaste and stuff. Today, I just asked her and swallowed my pride if she can come with me to a new dentist in my next appointment the Monday after memorial weekend, she declined and said no. That she's going to work and she doesn't want to hear about anything. 
  
Now, I'm trying to take initiative and not rely on others to make important decisions with my body and health. I am thinking that I would need two of my teeth extracted now because I let the infection go on for too long. Which really scares me.  I just don't know what to do. I have $5,000  saved up from school so I can pay for possible dentist work, but how would I know if I'm making the right decision. Dentists for some reason I can't fully trust and since I already broke down in front of one of them, that just makes it even more negative. And plus, what about my orthodontist work that I have to get done in the future, should I be somehow thinking about what I should do to make sure the treatments coincide with one another. I do want my jaw to return to normal size and my teeth to close and align again. There's just so many issues that I don't know where to start."

Not only just going out and being in social situations is draining enough,I got two sucky grades and got few things to do to get better ones,otherwise I might have to do a extra test to determine if I'll fail or not.

There's the activity hours I need to get from stuff like intern jobs,etc. And there's this thing in my country that you have a huge final project at college to show to a couple of teachers in front of tons of people. I'm graduating in 2 years and I'm not ready for that.

Most days I wish I didn't had to wake up,the only time I feel good is when I'm sleeping. I'm loosing touch with myself,I rather spend my time daydreaming about many different lives where I'm a girl.

Got other body issues as well. My hair is falling pretty bad,by skin is extremely dry and not only I will start braces after years with them(had to take them out because my former dentist was doing something wrong),my gum is in a awful state. And I'm pretty sure I got retinal detachment on my eye but after some tests my doctor said it's nothing.

Now my father says he found a therapist for my brother and I,and I'm pretty sure it's going to suck. And the worst thing is that I know I should just stop whining and find a job to do everything on my own,but I'm too weak. 

I feel like I'm going to burst at any time."

To the computationalists out there: Have you found an effective method of maintaining a lab notebook?

The method I currently have is using a binder and a lab notebook. The physical lab notebook contains information on the two projects I am currently working. It is presented in a problem-solution format with the pages dated and numbered. My problem-solution format usually looks like this:
&gt;
&gt;**Problem:** The Job failed
&gt;
&gt;**Solution:** Check log file.
&gt;      Job hit wall time.

My Binder has the following sections:

* Terminal/Unix - This contains some unix/terminal commands that I have yet to commit to memory and information about the clusters I can run jobs on.

* LaTeX/R A couple of quick reference guides and paper copies of any finalized code.

* Matlab- Matlab is split off because it is a central part of my second project so I have a lot more example code here.

* Working code/Project - This is mainly a pet project I have that contains some working examples of QM like a particle in a box and stuff that I made for practice. 

* Meeting notes/Workshop notes - Any group meeting or workshop notes go here. Personal meetings with my mentors on the project go in my lab notebook.

* Book problems- I have this subdivided between 5 books I work problems from: General chem, Thermo, Quantum, Biophysics and GRE. Remember I've been working on this for a while so I don't do problems from every book every week so I'm not ""overloading myself"" and I'm not going to ""burn out."" I say this because I've had to justify this to others before...

* Projects- General background info on projects such as publications (also stored on the computer in mendeley) and other readings go here.

I'm a biophysics major and CS/Chem minor so the lab notebooks have mainly been experimental in physics. I'm wondering if anyone ~~has the patience to read this~~ has a lab notebook method that they're willing to share. I know there's not just one way to do things so please share yours if you can that way we can all pick and assimilate the parts of others that we like."

It was one of the cheaper brands from Sally's...the kind that washes out in a couple of weeks. I posted a picture on Facebook and my dad IMs me, frantically asking if the dye is permanent.

I tell him it's not, and asks why he was so concerned. He says, ""Mullet says you can't be in her special day if your hair is an unnatural color. She wants to leave a good impression on our family."" (Too late.) 

I could have done my hair in an updo and no one would have any idea. Still...I should have kept it blue.

**Blurb 2, in which I discover she's a racist (of course):**

When I got the formal invitation in the mail, I told the unlucky couple that I was planning to bring one of my friends (a penpal I had recently met in person) who has always wanted to visit that part of the country. (They got an internship and had to bail. Yay and boo at the same time...) 

Dad &amp; M misunderstood me and assumed I was talking about a different internet friend who's from a bi-racial family. My dad asked me, ""So, M wants to know if you're bringing one of those colored girls home? I don't care, but Mullet's family might."" 

(WHO THE F STILL USES THE WORD ""COLORED"" IN A FAR NORTHERN STATE? UGH.)

**Blurb 3, a question:**

My usual couch at the House of Pooh will be occupied by my future stepbrother's baby mama, so I was told I'd have to pay for a hotel room for the weekend. I can afford it, since I'll be staying with the K family for the month of June &amp; not paying rent between apartments. I tell myself to look at it as a comedy vacation.

Once my dad reserves the room for me, Mullet posts a Facebook status, saying how awesome it is that she has possibly found a free venue for her wedding shower/bachelorette party. (MY ROOM.)

...Would I be a shit person if I tell the front desk attendant that she's not allowed in to visit me? I don't want her meth-ed out bridesmaids getting wasted anywhere near my stuff. I can't really pay for wedding gifts, so I feel like I owe her and my dad. But I probably don't.

While I am excited to finally see what real world Accounting is like, I am also very nervous. I've done a search about internship advice on this subreddit and most of it pertains to a Big 4 internship, I'm not sure how similar that is to an internship at a National firm. 

I know that the Internship period is supposed to be the best part of being an Accountant because of the hourly pay and the easier work, but I keep hearing that interns will be given the same type of work as First year Associates. If that's the case, wouldn't the work be pretty challenging? I'm just not really sure what type of work to expect (I will be in Tax). 

I guess my main question is: How did most of you feel at the start of your internship? Were you nervous and full of questions like me? This is going to be my first job in a Corporate environment and I'm also nervous about how I will fit in at the Office. "
26foez,5,2014-05-25,"I want to start losing again, but this time my situation is totally different so I could use some tips on how to make it a success!",[deleted],loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/26foez/i_want_to_start_losing_again_but_this_time_my/,"Dear loseit members!

Last year I lost 30 lbs in summer and autumn (165 lbs to 135, 5'6"" tall). I was able to do this because I went abroad for an internship and was living all alone and food was expensive over there. I counted calories and picked up running too and did the C25K running programme, which I finally finished in October I think. 

For who is interested in the progress I made back then: [Progress pic](http://i.imgur.com/Zt871ce.jpg). First picture is beginning of June, second picture is halfway September. 

Anyway. After I came back I continued running for quite a while and was still paying attention to what I ate. However, a lot of things have changed since then; I graduated from university and this year I started as a PhD candidate. I live together with my boyfriend again now and we moved to another place. The weight loss actually stopped in December, because we were visiting a lot of family which made it hard to count calories and go running. 

Now my weight has remained very constant over the months so at least I am happy about that, but I have the feeling that I am not finished yet. Especially around the stomach area I feel like I could still lose a lot of weight, and I would still be nowhere near comfortable wearing a bikini. On the other hand, I feel that I really lack muscle mass; Other people of a similar weight/height seem to look much slimmer and I can only imagine that it has to be a muscle difference. My younger sisters' BMI's are really near the lower border of healthy but they do not look like it, so I think this is caused by a skewed fat/muscle proportion (although I have no further references than them because the rest of my family are all overweight). I don't know if there is anything I can do about that or whether whatever I do I will always look fat. 

Therefore I am doubting what the best strategies are to improve my figure; I might be able to lose more weight by restricting calories again but I wonder whether it will make me look any better. Probably I could benefit more from exercise? But what type of exercise will help most? Due to doing a PhD I am really, really busy and am even working many weekends at the moment. Many times I come home I really don't feel like doing anything. My experiments involve several hours of walking outside every day but I don't think it matters much. I kind of quit running several months ago; lately I've tried it a couple of times and it sucked, not only because my condition got worse but mostly because I couldn't motivate myself that this was a GOOD way to spend time, I was mostly thinking ""I am wasting my time with this, I have to do (insert list of work and household tasks)"". I think that perhaps lifting would be more helpful than running, but I think it will take me even more time (running is only 30/40 minutes total) and I don't enjoy it at all. 

Foodwise, my situation doesn't really help that much. Fieldwork makes me hungry and I work in two large departments meaning that there is birthday cake about twice a week on average and that excludes the times someone brings treats for whatever party reason. At home, I already eat quite healthy. My boyfriend automatically splits our dinner in half though, giving us each the same portion sizes, and doesn't like it when I explain that I don't need the same amount of food as he eats. He also buys snacks often, but he is much better at controlling urges than me and can eat more over all. But I think he is the least of my concerns, he has been very supportive last time and if I tell him I am serious at losing again he will help me. 

So, my question to you is how I would be able to successfully do this this summer! How to I change my mindset of finding any type of exercise a waste of my time? What are the best ways to focus more on physique than on actual loss in numbers? I also don't really know what to make my goal, earlier it was simple; lose X lbs of weight but now that I lost it I am still not satisfied and I wonder whether setting another 'lose X lbs of weight' loss will help me. I sometimes look at my body in the mirror and think it is hopeless. 

Thank you for reading and I hope you can give me some motivation to make this a success!

26g1g4,0,2014-05-25,"Scored 590 on SAT math, but received As on Calc I &amp; II (COLLEGE). Can I become an Actuary?",[deleted],actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/26g1g4/scored_590_on_sat_math_but_received_as_on_calc_i/,"Hello,

Here's the thing that is bothering me:

I read somewhere that the average SAT score of someone who is taking the actuarial exam is 800. While that is obviously not necessarily true, it seems that people tend to say only people with really high SAT math scores are truly qualified to become actuaries or attempt to take that path.

But here's the thing: I don't really believe that (and correct me if I'm wrong), please read the following:

I am currently a Math major at a university who is in the top 40 in the nation according to the U.S. News College Rankings (Don't want to say which one it is)

I finished 4 semesters and I have a 3.93 cumulative GPA and I am a math major (I LOVE math and I am very passionate about it)

I received an A on both Calc I and II (student averages are around 70 in my school)
Here are my scores on the exams:
Calc 1: Exam 1: 100. Exam 2: 91. Final: 92.
Calc 2: Exam 1: 98. Exam 2: 96. Final: 96

I finished my second out of 5 years (You can think of me as an upcoming sophomore in the actuarial science path, even though I will be a junior overall.)

Managed to get an actuarial internship in P&amp;C which I will be starting in about a week (even though I have not taken any exams yet, still have to take Calc III and probability theory to take  exam P)

My roommate who is also a close friend of mine got 700 on his SAT math (with no studying) and yet struggled in calc I and II and only got C's on both. He needed my help many times.

I am a very hard worker and very diligent. Also I am very passionate about education in general especially anything math related (math, statistics, economics).
Also I am minoring in Statistics and Economics.

Does my 590 on the math SAT say bad things about my capabilities? Am I considered not ""smart enough"" to become an actuary even though I work really hard? 

I honestly consider myself good at math. Calc I and II were really fun and I did not struggle much to understand them and be able to master the topics.
So my big question is (and THANK YOU so much for reading this far, I really appreciate it):

Are SAT math scores an accurate indicator of your mathematical capabilities, even though I strongly believe I do better in math classes than a lot of students who scored way higher than me on the SAT math.

I do not know if I just became good at math out of nowhere due to a lot of studying and practicing (also, I always liked math but MUCH MUCH more once I started taking college math classes)

Thank you for your time! Any input would be greatly appreciated!

P.S.
If I made it sound like I am doubtful of my intelligence; that is not true. I believe I am a smart student, not just a hard working one. But I do not want to deceive myself. How smart do I have to be to become an actuary? Are average or slightly above average intelligence and A LOT of diligence good enough qualities to go on the actuarial path?"

I may have mentioned in my last post that I landed a job out of my internship! It was an exciting moment that was marred by the situation my brother and his girlfriend had put me through. I dredged on and put a smile on my face. I have been working so hard to create a stable life for my son and I that I can't let anyone get in the way of that. 

I thank everyone for their insights and comments because each and every one of them helped me out. I created a legal contract for my brother to officially sign that included stipulations of his girlfriend not trespassing on the property, sharing chores and etc. And he signed it. 

 I enrolled my son in daycare and he loves it. When I come home from work I am noticing that he's generally much more happy, laughing and smiling. He's always been a happy child but there's something more vibrant about him. 

I am still dealing with my own emotions on the matter. A lot of good is happening for me but it seems that I've snapped into a depressive episode and I'm struggling a little. 

As far as my brother is concerned, ever since I gave him the ultimatum to sign my contract or GTFO, he's been peaches to me. He wished me a Happy Mother's Day, he's been in a very very good mood and very pleasant to me. 

So, once again, thank you /r/Mommit, I needed a supportive group of ladies like yourselves and it's improved my situation 100-fold. I love you ladies :)"

Much information!",shibedesign,dogecoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/26h2as/a_little_anecdote_about_doge4doge_twitchtipping/,"Hi fellow shibes,

I'm currently making my bachelor of science in engineering and am a long time doge lurker. I love the doge4doge initiative and will offer my services in another post in some time to come. I see a lot of potential for doge4doge. 
I am a design shibe. I could offer services in video editing, audio processing, compositing, 3d design, a little bit of coding (but only a little bit, like I said I'm fresh out of school and programming wasn't one of my strongest suits)
I've seen a few posts recently from +\u\ShibeShen regarding his doge-shop which sells exclusive doge merchandise for doge and I think the idea is great. Other design shibes like me could work on t-shirt designs and distribute them through the site. There could be limited edition shirts in which would give people incentive to spend their doge on shirts like we saw with the nascar shirts. Maybe there could be a weekly limited shirt which will only be available during this week (or month) and is designed by a fellow shibe and voted in by the community. These Shirts could be a little more expensive than the rest on the site but the designer could be paid a little bit of doge, and another bit could go to a charity after +\u\ShibeShen substracted his expenses. This could become a huge thing if we could rally enough talented design shibes behind it and the support of the community.
If you have some time and live in Europe plz have a look at his post and give him some feedback:

http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/26eduj/doge4business/

I am also extremely excited about dogetipbot twitch integration. If we can make doge the dominant gaming cryptocurrency that would be a huuuuuuge deal! Gamers are easy to adopt new technologies and if we get big name streamers like maybe Kripparrian to accept dogecoin (all it would take for him to accept is for someone to sell orange juice for dogecoin in Canada or deliver there, plz make this happen reddit!) 
we would have an enormous amount of new shibes interested in doge and maybe investing a few bucks each month to support their favorite steamer or buy a few things like doge merchandise or steam keys which are sold plenty on dogemarket.


But for now enough on that. Just a little more till the giveaway, I promise ;)

but before that a little backstory:

I recently wrote my thesis about indie game publishing and stumbled about the dota workshop publishing feature, which allows you to design and publish items for games like dota (to be honest I never played a lot of dota, I know of it and know it's popular, but I never got into it). During my internship I had some downtime and thought to myself I could try to design an item. I had some 3d design experience during my bachelor and so I gave it a shot.
This is the result:

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=263172037

If you play dota and like the item I'd appreciate a rate up ;) 

to the giveaway part:

Like I said my dota knowledge isn't immense so I thought I'd ask the doge community for some feedback. Put some feedback here on reddit regarding the item or dota, which character do you play and why, if you bought items through the valve workshop, why you bought the item or which character you'd like to see items designed for. Plz include ""dota 2"" in your post so I can maybe have tipbot tip every comment with the word in it? If so I'd appreciate some instructions or a link. When I have some spare time I'll go through all the posts and will tip special contributions again if I have enough doge. If you don't play dota write that and you will be tipped too ;) and if you voted for my item plz don't tell me so I can tip you without buying votes! much thx!!!

plz give me some time with the tipping of the feedback because I first have to authenticate this account and transfer the doge but all posts containing the word dota will be tipped, maybe I'll also use the new make it rain bot if I figure out how it works, although I haven't got a huge amount of doge at my dispose.

thx dogecommunity &amp; I love you!

26hdug,3,2014-05-25,"I [22/F] absolutely hate my in-laws, and I'm afraid that it will hurt my marriage",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/26hdug/i_22f_absolutely_hate_my_inlaws_and_im_afraid/,"This will be long, and I apologize in advance for that. I just don't know who to talk to and need to get this off my chest.

I [22/F] recently got married to my husband [22/M]. We dated all through college, for four years prior to getting married. I have an incredibly strained relationship with his family, however, and I have come to strongly resent them and any involvement that they have in our lives. I don't want to force my husband to choose between me and his family, and don't want to stick him in the middle of an unfair tug-of-war between allegiances. I am afraid that my growing inability to get over or hide my feelings will do just that, though, and may jeopardize our marriage. 

The problem started almost immediately after we became engaged (they were very friendly and welcoming while we were dating). They started trying to control aspects of our life together that weren't any of their business; aspects such as trying to plan the wedding out from under us, asking invasive questions about our sex life and trying to ""slut shame"" me after we refused to talk about our intimate details with them. They also randomly starting fights with both my then-fiance and myself over seemingly inconsequential ""slights"", such as my use of the phrase, ""If it helps your feelings,"" in conversation. They went so far as to call us ""immoral adulterers"" at Christmas, then demanded that we not invite the extended family and family friends from my husband's side because they were too ashamed to be associated with us. 

The problems escalated throughout our year and a half long engagement, culminating in them starting a rather large fight with me a month before the wedding (it was over a small, trivial detail related to the honeymoon) that resulted in them threatening not to come to the wedding at all. My husband made peace with them, but they never attempted to contact or speak to me again. Then at the wedding, they said nasty things about me within earshot so as to ensure that I heard it. They acted blatantly angry throughout the ceremony, to the point where my wedding party was too uncomfortable to look out into the crowd due to the ""evil stares"" that the father was giving everyone.  They spent the whole day complaining about having to be there, and deeply hurt my husband's feelings on what should have been a happy day for him. They also made a point of refusing to speak to me throughout the day, just to drive home the fact that they do not approve of me.

I understand where the disapproval stems from, but I can't apologize for it. At Christmas of this past year, I went on his family's annual trip rather than going home to see my own family in an attempt to start bridging the gap between the two separate families. This was incredibly difficult for me to do, because my grandmother (whom I am especially close to) has a terminal illness and is declining in health; it may have been her last Christmas alive, but only time will tell on that front. 

They spent the entire trip making passive-aggressive statements towards my then-fiance and myself, before finally laying all of the cards on the table and staging a full-family attack on my husband; he hurt his leg and needed to return to the condo, and they took the opportunity when he couldn't easily get away to quite literally get in his face and yell at, insult, and thoroughly demean him. They told him that he wasn't a good enough son, attacked his religious expression (or lack thereof) and made incredibly crude, inappropriate, and judgmental conjectures on our sexual relationship. I have never seen family behave so cruelly to one another. My raw feelings at being away form my own family and my outrage at seeing anyone treat my husband that way lead to me defending him. I was respectful (somehow) and held my feelings back on the matter, but that didn't help at all. The family then turned their full rage on me, telling me that I wasn't family and had no business interjecting, before slut-shaming me for whatever they imagined to be going on in my bedroom. This went on for two days. 

The day before we finally had enough and decided to leave, they changed tactics; the mom pulled me away from the group to ""have a talk"" with me. She tried to manipulate me into feeling sorry for her, to get me on her side in controlling my husband. Meanwhile, the father, brother, and sister-in-law took another opportunity to attack him while I was away and couldn't support him. My husband got so upset that he stormed out and nobody could find him. When I tried to go after him, they physically restrained me long enough for the brother to leave to go after him so that I couldn't get to him first. 

I have my degree in psychology; my internship experience is in child and family therapy, so I took the alone time with his parents as an opportunity to try to help mediate the fight, get to the bottom of it, and try to soothe their doubts about our relationship. For the time, it worked. However, it only took them a day or two to decide that I had ""manipulated"" them, which sent them into an even blinder rage than before. Things progressively got worse for the four months between then and the wedding, as mentioned above. The father took to blatantly starting fights with me to get under my husband's skin.

According to my husband and his childhood friends that I have met, his parents are just ""like this.""  Saying horrible things about family members, being manipulative, and having seemingly emotionally-unstable screamfests are just par for the course with them, and I should just get used to it since I married the family. I witnessed first-hand that his parents treated his older brother's wife the exact same way leading up to her marriage, so it is partially my fault that I didn't brace myself for the storm that I should have seen coming. However, I don't think that I can just accept it or get used to it. They are adults and have no right to treat others this way; it's childish and frightening. However, no matter how I approach it with my husband or how upset it makes me, he will not sever ties with his family and I do not want to force him to do it.

It's reached a point, though, where the mention of his parents immediately makes me angry. I put of writing my thank-you cards after the wedding for three days because each time I started to write the card to them, I got uncontrollably angry and unfairly lashed out at my husband. I can't sleep for three to four days at a time and have panic attacks any time that I know we will have to see or interact with them. I've fantasized about them dying in a freak accident so that I won't have to spend my life dealing with them. I can't hide or control my feelings anymore, and I know that it's only a matter of time before it really starts to take a toll on my marriage. 

My husband and I are otherwise incredibly happy and very much in love; I'm just not sure how long we can be in this position, because I know how unfair it is for both of us. I've tried to talk to my husband, but he just gets mad at me and treats me like I'm at fault for thinking too much about the familial problems. I've tried talking this out with my mom, who tells me to just deal with it because they're his family. I've tried talking to friends, but they are too selfish to spend longer than 5 minutes talking about anyone but themselves. I desperately need advice on how to handle this situation, before I snap and say or do something that I shouldn't. 

tl;dr- I think that my in-laws are truly bad people, and I no longer know how to contain my hatred for them for my husband's benefit after a number of horrible encounters with them, including their behavior at my wedding. "

Also, sorry if this is not the correct place to post this. But since you guys have had personal experience with the whole Jehovah’s Witness thing, I bet you of all people can help me try to understand what is up with my former classmate. Get ready, because this is a long one. But for you impatient bastards, there is a TL;DR at the end.

I started my PhD about two years ago. I don’t like to brag or anything (who am I kidding, of course I do), but my school is very, very well respected in our field, which would fall under the STEM category. So the students I see on a day-to-day basis are pretty damn sharp. Sometime last year, I met this one girl, a PhD student who started the same time I did. Man, I’m telling you, she was way out of my league and I am no slacker. I was looking at her résumé and my jaw was on the floor. She had achieved so much in her life. Internships, extracurricular activities, scholarships, and awards left and right. And to top it all off, she was funded by one of the most prestigious fellowships that a STEM grad student could ever ask for. So yeah, she was kind of a big deal.

Despite all that, I never felt intimidated by her because she was also one of the sweetest people I have ever met. She was very kind, polite, chatty, smiley, and above all, humble about her accomplishments. So getting to the point here, she mentioned that was a devout JW. I knew pretty much nothing about them (beyond the whole door-to-door quirk) and I didn’t really care all that much to learn. I figured, hey, if that’s what motivates her to be the awesome person that she is, then who am I to get in the way?

I honestly thought that if she kept going along the path that she was already on, she could end up becoming a world leader in our field. But then about a month ago, she announced that she would be leaving grad school after her MS because she found a job. It was more of an industry job than a research job. And from the way it sounded, I felt that it wasn't challenging enough for her. Still, it was directly in our field, which is a tough one to find employment in, and it paid well so I was happy for her. 

But I started to get curious. Why was she even looking for a job in the first place when she was on a fellowship for a PhD? She seemed to enjoy her work and it wasn’t like she was facing financial problems or anything. So I asked. She told me that her research was too time-consuming and that she wanted to spend more time with her congregation. I found that to be a rather silly reason. Yeah, I know from personal experience that we grad students work long and odd hours. But for the most part, our advisors are cool with what times we work as long as we make sufficient progress overall. She definitely could have fit her religious obligations into her schedule if she really wanted to (at least that’s what I thought at the time). I wondered, what the hell could possibly be so damn appealing about this religion that you’d be willing to walk away from such a golden educational opportunity? So then I started to do a little research about JWs...

Holy. Fucking. Shit.

I thought Mormons were kind of weird, but at least they allow their followers to have a little bit of leeway. JWs on the other hand seem to have every single aspect of their lives controlled by their congregations. I don’t need to go through that whole list of things that they’re not allowed to do. You guys know that all too well. But if they decide to bend the rules even just a little bit, then they risk becoming complete outcasts. Families have been ripped apart over this. To me, there is nothing to like about this religion. Whatever good there is can easily be found in other religions. Going back to my classmate, I am now completely bewildered by her existence and I am trying to rationalize it. Here are a few questions that I have for you.

---

How do JWs feel about STEM education? If they are against it, I’d be surprised that she got into STEM in the first place.

How do JWs feel about women empowerment? Again, if they discourage it, I’d be surprised that she had high career ambitions to begin with. Also, for what it’s worth, she is super fit. I can’t imagine someone like her ever participating in a religion that forces women to be weak.

How do JWs feel about traveling and seeing the world? This girl loves going on adventures in different countries and meeting different kinds of people. If she was forced to stop, she would be devastated.

How strict are JWs about no blood transfusions? Her major in undergrad was medicine related. What kind of self-respecting student of medicine would ever frown upon a blood transfusion?

How common is the practice of disfellowshipping and how severe are the consequences really? From what I read in this subreddit, it sounds absolutely awful. But again, this girl was such a sweet person. I just cannot imagine her ever treating anyone so cruelly even at the risk of having the same thing happen to her. It’s just not in her nature.

And finally, do you think there is a chance that her congregation may have pressured her into leaving school against her will? That is a huge conclusion to jump to and I’m a bit hesitant to do so. But if that is the case, then the only thing I have to say to that is, what a colossal waste of what could have been.

So yeah, that’s pretty much it. Obviously you don’t know her personally so you can only make guesses based on your own experiences. I can try to answer some questions you may have, but I’m sure you’ll understand that I won’t say anything that could possibly be used to identify her. But please, help me try to figure out how a person so seemingly full of contradictions could exist. Thank you.

---

**TL;DR:** Overachieving classmate happens to be a JW. She leaves school before realizing her true potential to spend more time with her congregation. I learned more about JWs and I am now confused as to how she could be one. I have some questions that I would like to talk about to try and make sense of this."

I've visited WA before a couple of times but didn't stay for longer than a week each time. I am quite nervous about this big change in my life."
26hqvn,2,2014-05-25,My life's at a stalemate.,IAmNotMrRager,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/26hqvn/my_lifes_at_a_stalemate/,"Summer's starting and I have no Idea what I want to do with my life. It's not like it matters. My family is probably gonna move in like a year and then I have to start everything all over again. 

My parents basically forbid me to apply to anywhere but a nearby Community College, That I had no intentions of going to. I wanted to go to film school or something like that I don't know. I wanted to study something that I was interested but I couldn't. My guidance counselor was dim witt and didn't do anything for me. the cost of applying to other schools was too high and I had no disposable income and my parents wouldn't even pay for me to apply to see if I would get in so I stopped caring about school and my senior year of high school my grades dipped but I didn't give a fuck. 

My mom got diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer during the beginning of my senior year so I had to do my duty as a son to stay with them. It sucks when you know you have no control and you see other people getting into their choice schools because they worked hard and their parents supported them meanwhile my parents want to do whats best for ""The family."" I just felt really shitty because whenever people asked me what school was I going to they would just give a ""oh, okay."" and I fucking hated trying to explain to them why I had to and I just gave up at some point, cause fuck whatever they think. 

Anyways so I start the new college semester and its fine. it's a shitty school. I work in a gas station so my life's divided between work and school like normal. My best friends on probation but we still drink once a month because life is shit and booze makes you feel good. I met my old theatre teacher and asked if she needed an intern at some point for one her shows. 

I like directing. that shit's dope. I like interacting with the actors and the set and all that good stuff. It makes me feel in control because I have no other control in real life. My whole life has been dictated to me by my parents and I can't take control of it. I can't just get away from my parents. I have nobody. we moved to the US like 5 years ago when I was 14 and all my friends and family are 300000000000000000000 miles away. Taking control of something as small as the way an actor saying something makes me feel good. Makes me feel like I'm actually good at something.

Oh yeah, I don't have any skills. I don't have good grades, I'm not musically talented, or a born artist even though I try sometimes and have bursts of shitty artistic expressions here and there. They are bad but fuck you, I made them. I liked doing theatre, working with cameras and stuff during high school but I'm at a place in New England where nothing happens. I try to go out of my way to find out if I can't find something cool I can take part of. A production, or like, I don't know anything. But I can't fucking find anything. 

So I started going to shows because I was working and I had money so fuck it concerts and shows it is, I went to 5 concerts in 3-4 months and a Broadway production in New York City (Waiting for Godot, Starring Patrick Stewart and Ian Mckellen.) I couldn't afford legit tickets so we went to the previews. That was awesome. Those nights were like bursts of happiness in my vast plain spectrum of life. Shit was cool.

I withdrew the first semester of Community College because I stopped going to class. I hated it. I wasn't motivated. It was stupid. I wasted like 5000 dollars I have to pay back but fuck it who cares, I wasn't happy. The only thing that keeps me going on is the thought of interning for my theatre teacher. its like the only thing I think about day and night. 

finally the day comes. I start interning for my teacher. the productions great, I love the people I work with. during the production I sign up for second semester of college. I start going to school again and this time I stick it out. I get a bit lucky and get decent classes. I still don't do any homework for math and thats a problem. but I do okay in other classes. I miss 3 consecutive days of classes because I had a moment of weakness but listening to Joe Rogan and Aubrey Marcus talk about being strong and sticking it out so I apply that to school. I still can't focus.

I see my doctor and tell her I can't focus. I can't sit down and read. I have trouble relaxing and I'm always freaking nervous. I get nothing done. She says it might be ADD. I have no clue.  I missed my follow up appointment. Haven't done anything about it since.

The production ends. The show was great. I'm gonna miss these guys. I date one of the actresses from the show after it ends. I get to involved with her. The most emotional month of my life. Stupid things are said and done. Emotional teenage drama. nothing new.

My dad leaves. for buisness. He is never around when I need him. He only wants to provide for the family.

During all this I foster homeless animals. give them a home. why should they suffer from being stranded in life. at least they should belong somewhere. However temporary. I like working with animals too. I feel comfortable working with them.

Right now at this moment, I haven't signed up for next semester classes. I don't know if I should. all I wanna do is do a theatre production, or something like that. I wanna go around and have fun during the summer. go to more concerts. take some classes. meet some new people. There is nothing around here tho. nothing. I looked up. if there is something its expensive. too expensive for me. I wanted to take dance classes but a decent one costs 200 dollars for two weeks. I don't make that much money. I hate where I'm living. I wanna get away, but my parents think if I drive far I will get in an accident and die. I have ambitions but I feel ever so restricted. I have 5 people I hang out with from time to time and thats it. I don't do much but I want to do so many things, but I can't.

My life's at a stalemate, and I hate it.
I feel defeated at life."
26htxs,1,2014-05-25,How long should I wait to email regarding a follow-up?,mllax,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/26htxs/how_long_should_i_wait_to_email_regarding_a/,"So last week I posted this: http://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/25ztb9/not_sure_what_to_make_of_this_interview/

recapping the most important bits: 

1) No HR department, just one lady transitioning from broker to HR.

2) Everyone thought my interview went well based on the info I provided

3) Was told I would get a follow-up regarding second round interview by the end of this (last) week.

4) Only one intern with interviews the entire (last) week.

My problem is that from the description of the internship, they expect someone to start June 1st (recruiter might've said something about this being the estimated, but most likely been talking about flexibility of schedule), and again, there's second round interviews. This makes me assume that I'm not being considered anymore, but the curiosity and wait, since it's already the end of the week, is killing me. 

And so, should I wait until Tuesday for an answer, or is it acceptable if I wrote to them now or tomorrow? Also, based on the long wait, anyone want to give a shot at my chance of a second round interview?"
26hvra,15,2014-05-26,I guess I've been in denial for three years. Hi.,magical_realist,infertility,https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/26hvra/i_guess_ive_been_in_denial_for_three_years_hi/,"Hi r/infertility. I've been lurking here for a few months and figured I should do an intro. I've been with my manfriend for almost 11 years. He's turning 34 this year, I'm turning 31.

The next part is going to be super TLDR so feel free to skip to the last paragraph.

We've been trying for about three years according to our RE, and about two years in my opinion. The first year we were ""not trying not preventing,"" which my RE flatly told us is not a thing, but I don't think she fully grasped how infrequently we were having sex that year (I was doing a full university course load and part time job, manfriend was working 50+ hours per week, so we weren't meeting up much and when we did see each other we were exhausted.)

Six months after we started really actually trying, it worked... sort of. It took me a long time to fully untangle the timeline, but eventually I worked out that this is what happened: that cycle (Nov 2012) we had sex two times, day 18 and day 20. So conception occurred no earlier than day 18 and potentially as late as say, day 24. I didn't know it at the time, because I got my period on time at day 30. It was a seemingly normal period. I started getting pregnancy symptoms during the next ""cycle"" and took a test on Dec 21. Not only was it positive, it was REALLY positive - a dark line that appeared right away. I did one of those Clearblue digitals and it said ""pregnant 3+ weeks."" Hmm. That was weird, because I wasn't even at my missed period yet. We had had sex on day 8 so I thought maybe I conceived then. Everything seemed normal, except I had never been pregnant before so I really didn't know what normal was. I had some painful cramping, but I read that can happen in early pregnancy from ligaments stretching or whatever and there was no spotting, so I chalked it up to that.

I knew I was pregnant for 20 days, from Dec 21 to Jan 10, and I know it's terribly cliche but that was truly one of the happiest times of my life. Any time I felt sad or stressed I would just think ""I'm going to be someone's mom"" and I would instantly feel better. My SO was so happy too, he couldn't wait to be a daddy. Jan 9, I had some spotting. I hadn't had any cramps in several weeks. I was referred for an ultrasound the next day, where they told me they thought I had a tubal pregnancy and I needed to go to the hospital immediately, at which point I lost it and just started bawling. Manfriend left work to pick me up and take me to the emergency room. We spent nine hours there, all of which I was compelled to spend lying on a gurney with no underwear on bleeding all over while random doctors popped in (including a Doogie Howser-esque intern and an older doctor who came in, said not a single work to me, shoved his fingers into my vagina, complained to the nurse that he couldn't feel my cervix and left). The gyno gave me the option of surgery or methotrexate and I took the methotrexate. They also insisted on sending in a grief counsellor to talk to us... she was like ""it doesn't matter if it's just six weeks, that's the same as losing a baby at nine months."" Um, no. That's not the same.

Afterwards, I was worried but people kept saying all that encouraging stuff about how I'd be pregnant again in no time and blah blah blah, and I basically chose to believe it. Cue cycle after cycle of disappointment. I finally got my doctor to put in a referral for the fertility clinic and we had our first appointment at the end of January. When the RE walked in, the first thing she said was ""Three years. That's a LONG TIME to be trying."" (Emphasis hers). I was actually taken aback. I can still hear in my head exactly how she said the words LONG TIME. I think that's when the bubble burst for me. Up until then, I assumed I would eventually get pregnant. For the last few months, I've been coping with the realization that it might never happen. Never. NEVER. I've been working on getting through the battery of diagnostic tests that were assigned - had an HSG a month ago  and both tubes are clear. We'll be done all tests by the end of this cycle and then hopefully get some sort of plan in place to progress from there.

TLDR: trying for 3 years, one ectopic, don't know what's wrong, basically in denial about the situation until a few months ago, haven't tried any treatments yet but that's coming up next."
26hyig,3,2014-05-26,"Me [20 F] with my former friend [21 M] of 6 years, I want to cut off contact but he keeps pressuring me to spend time with him",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/26hyig/me_20_f_with_my_former_friend_21_m_of_6_years_i/,"Hey everyone. I'm having an issue with a former friend of mine who keeps pestering me to spend time with him even though I am completely through with our ""friendship"" and wish to cut off contact.


I met this person 6 years ago in high school (2008). We dated for a couple months during freshman year until he broke up with me. After that, we were very good friends during sophomore year (2009). During junior year, we started being friends with benefits (FWB), which got very messy and ultimately led to us not speaking for awhile (2010). We became friends again during senior year of high school, and became FWB again for a short time during the first fall semester of college (2011). After that, we've been strictly platonic.


He treated me extremely poorly during our relationship and during our FWB phase. It was borderline emotional abuse and manipulation, since he knew that I loved him so much that I would do anything for him, and used that knowledge to take advantage of me. I honestly think he is borderline sociopathic since his complete lack of empathy can be disturbing. He has always had a reputation for treating girls rather poorly, but I was so blinded by affection for him that I only realized how horrible he was until after our last FWB encounter almost 3 years ago.


We have hung out intermittently since high school graduation, usually just getting coffee or lunch. My extreme dislike for him has increased every single time. This person is manipulative, passive aggressive, narcissistic, controlling, and has zero empathy for anyone. For example, he recently yelled at me for declining an offer to go to a concert with him, even though I explained that I was instead choosing to plan a weekend with my father who I see once a year. My former friend knows about the situation with my dad and still chose to make me feel guilty for ""ditching"" him.


My former friend is leaving soon for a summer internship, so he has been especially pressuring me recently to hang out with him before he leaves. He has very few friends and I understand that he might actually want to spend time with me, but the thought of hanging out with him makes me nauseous. He is probably my least favorite person that I know, and I would prefer to never speak to him or see him ever again. 


My question is, how do I avoid seeing this person? I'm using all of the excuses I can, but each time he guilts me and accuses me of lying (which some of the time, I actually am out of desperation). I know he is just trying to manipulate me into seeing him, but it still makes me feel guilty due to the fact that we used to be good friends. I truly dislike this person and I need to figure out a way to not see him while not blatantly admitting that I don't want to see him.

Thanks so much in advance!

I did a search too and did not see anything that answered my specific questions. 

I'm heading over to London in a little over a week for a financial internship and have some questions on how to dress while I'm over there. I need to bring business clothes in addition to causal clothes. I'm coming from Arizona, so my wardrobe is probably drastically different that what I need. I posted in /r/london as well, but wanted your points of view on the fashion side. Anyways I am over there from June through August. Any general advice would be great too.

1.  Do I need a rain coat to put over my suits, or is this unnecessary? 

2.  Any advice on a light jacket that can double as casual and business casual?

3. Shoes. Right now I'm bringing 2 dress shoes and a pair of vans. Should I add another casual shoe to my list...I have suede bucks, but I feel like these wouldn't do well in the rain. 

4. Building off the last question, should I invest in a nice pair of boots that I can wear when it rains on and off the job?

5. What is good to wear casual? I'm planning on bringing jeans, chinos, and button up shirts. Do not know if I should bring any tees or polos or if a good variety of button ups would hold up well enough.

6. Is there anything I should buy out there that I cannot get in the States?

Any other advice would be great! I'm really excited for this summer, but I am a bit overwhelmed. Thanks in advance for any help. If any other questions come up, I'll add them."

26id95,10,2014-05-26,Completely quit gaming on a whim - it's been four weeks,DarkwaterV2,StopGaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopGaming/comments/26id95/completely_quit_gaming_on_a_whim_its_been_four/,"Hello everyone,

Four weeks and a day ago, I quit gaming completely. I'd just finished a 13-week internship in Amsterdam and one thing I really wanted to hold onto after it was done, was my sleep rhythm. Go to bed at 10.30, get up at 7.30, e'rryday.

Late in the evening, on the first sunday after my internship, I was playing Titanfall on my desktop. When I play Titanfall, I'm always saying to myself 'just one more game'. They're just the right (wrong?) length! It's a very satisfying and exciting game, as I'm sure you know. Soon, the clock turned to 10 pm, then 11, then 11.30.

11.30 is by no means an ongodly hour, but seeing as it was outside of my intented rhythm, I was pretty miffed. I'm getting ready for bed and I think to myself 'okay, this isn't cool, but cut yourself some slack, man!' But I didn't wanna cut myself any slack. The moment I'm done with my internship, I'm back to being some gaming cave-dweller with no control whatsoever? Hells no. I wanted to stop, but I couldn't. That's an addiction right there, right? So what if I delete all my games? What if I just *do that?* See how it goes. Maybe just for a week, or until I finish the remainder of this year's schoolwork.

I did it. Deleted everything that night. 60 gigs on my game-drive. It looks pretty neat in explorer. Games (D:) - 0% used. I still have access to my Steam library and the games on my shelf, but I just don't pick them up. That was four weeks ago now. The weird thing is I missed gaming for maybe a week, but I don't now. I'm 25 and I filled up the majority of those years with gaming. Now I'm off it and I don't give a shit anymore. It's utterly weird, but I guess I just realized it's not how I want to spend my time anymore. I reinstalled a game here and there and gave it a whirl. I played short bouts of Dishonored and Risk of Rain. The experiences were 'meh'. Not like previous times I played them. Too much effort for too little satisfaction.

Via family sharing, I have Dark Souls 2 installed. My best friend plays it. We both played DS1. He'd like me to get it. We played some while he was over at my place and while I definitely had a good time, I still don't want to buy it. I can just *see* myself losing track of time, losing myself in this game and coming out the other side not satisfied *enough*.

It's bittersweet, you know? On the one hand, I'm very glad to be free from this magnetic force. On the other hand, I spent so many thousands of hours gaming. Thousands! Maybe tenthousands! I could have lived so many beautiful moments in those hours, but I filled them with a frenzy of button-pressing and mouse-clicking and I hardly even remember the details of it all.

Not that I'm some mega-productive superhuman now, but life is definitely better. I'm pretty proud of myself. I think this means I'll sell my desktop now.

I just thought I'd share this. Thanks for reading. I hope you find this a good contribution to the subreddit. To anyone struggling with gaming addiction: stay strong. This squeaky clean feeling is nice. :)

**tl;dr: quit gaming on a whim 4 weeks ago, don't miss it at all. Happy I learned the true value of gaming (for me), but sad about all the hours that could have been better spent.**"

One of HDMI or VGA, preferably both.

At least an FHD screen (Bigger is better). I'm sick of my previous laptop's 1280x800 screen.

~~--------------------------------------~~

The t440s has my attention for its solid build quality and price point. Specifically, I'm looking at customizing this from Lenovo (via B&amp;N discount):

* Processor: 4th Gen Intel Core i5-4300U Processor

* Display: 14.0"" FHD IPS

* Memory: 4 GB DDR3L - SDRAM 1600MHz Base

* Hard Drive: 500GB Hard Disk Drive, 7200rpm

* Micro Hard Drive: 16GB M.2 Solid State Drive Single

* Rear battery: ThinkPad Battery 3 cell rear

* Wireless Card: Intel Dual Band Wireless 7260AC

And dropping in a [Samsung EVO SSD](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820147249&amp;cm_re=Samsung_EVO-_-20-147-249-_-Product) plus 4GB of RAM after the fact for a total cost of about $1360 before tax.

However, as I mentioned in my title, I've been reading a lot of horror stories about shipping times on Lenovo customs being very drawn out (I can deal with it if I get the laptop before mid-August for the new semester) as well as unacceptable quality differences between LG (shite) and AUO (pretty good) screens being put into assembled units -- uncharitably referred to as the screen lottery because there's no way to control which you get and fighting support to get the AUO is a PITA (I'm not up for replacing the screen myself)

The rMBP 13"" line looks good as well (UNIX environment and I can use my company's AppleTVs for demos, yes please!), but I have a hard time stomaching:

* The price. With a student discount, the midline 13"" model comes in at $1400 before tax (plus a little to pick up mDP adapters for VGA/HDMI, plus a bit more if Apple has somehow locked out third party adapters). This puts it just above the t440s, and I trade 256GB of drive space for a Retina display. Potentially worth it.

* Interacting with the OS, coming from Ubuntu. I currently have a loaner from my work for the summer, and so far I'm unimpressed with the experience. OSX conflates the command key with the other modifier keys (see: ctrl+c, alt+tab, super == com+c, com+tab, com+space) although this might be fixable with some rebinding apps. I haven't found a way to do window snapping yet, the maximize button is weird, I can't middle-click to bury a window, can't alt+drag to move windows, etc. ... it's all really petty stuff but it adds up when I'm interacting with it all day.

Lenovo's t540p also looks tempting with the 3K IPS screen, but it's a bit heavy for my tastes and I really don't need/want a numpad (especially when it uncenters me from the screen).

Specifically, I'd be interested on feedback about the following:

* Shipping times with Lenovo custom builds

* Screens on the t440s line 

* Alternative choices that are comparable to the t440s and rMBP13"

They never have, and I imagine they never will, but it feels so much worse now that I know what is like to not live at home (live at college) and in this hostile environment.  There is always tension that is shown via attitudes, arguments, or yelling matches.  I cannot handle it.  I am only at home during the summer for a full time internship, but even being away for 40 hours a week is not enough.  I will do everything in my power to remain in my college town for next summer (I am a rising junior) but I honestly don't think I can handle this summer.

My mom is always micromanaging my dad, getting very passive aggressive (sighing loudly and making annoyed faces) when my dad does anything she disapproves of.  The list of things my mom dislikes goes on forever, but the top issues are him clearing his throat (which he does often because he has sinus problems - not his fault) and eating chips (Mom will say things like ""are you going to have something other than chips for lunch?"" when my mom is the one who put the chips on the table, knowing dad would have a few handfuls).

My dad has a very short fuse and carpooling with him to and from work is stressful because of his horrible road rage.  He claimed that a driver was incompetent and unfit to drive because they forgot to turn their turn signal off after safely and legally passing us on the left.

I used to have extreme anxiety problems from living at home, and the combination of being away at school during my sophomore year, getting out of an abusive relationship, seeking therapy for everything, and beginning a wonderful relationship with my current boyfriend, I have gotten so much better managing my problems...but now that I am back to the house with the people that taught me to live with these problems, I am seriously struggling.  I can feel myself slipping back to my old self and being very anxious, letting my OCD take over, seeing no way out and just wanting to end it.  My supportive boyfriend is the number one thing getting me through this.

I called my boyfriend today and was very upset after my parents had an argument about something I did (turning the lights on in an area they didn't believe needed illumination) and we were on the phone for about half an hour, and 15 minutes later, I called him back hysterically crying because my parents were screaming at each other and it scared me (I am very sensitive to yelling).  He told me it would be okay and he will see me next weekend and he loves me and stayed on the phone with me for another thirty minutes.

I don't want to burden my boyfriend with sustaining my happiness, but I honestly can't find anything to look forward to other than Skyping with him every night, and our occasional visits when we force our work schedules to cooperate with one another.  I am attempting to train for a half marathon (finals week derailed my progress a bit, so I'm not as far along as I would have liked) and I am capable of keeping myself busy, but the only thing that honestly makes me smile is him and I am worried about him being overwhelmed by how overwhelmed I am...

I am more than willing to be there for my boyfriend just the way he is supporting me now, but I don't have the capability of getting myself to his place.  He has a car, while I have to borrow my mom's.  I feel like the weak link in this relationship.  He has low self esteem, but he is honestly the most wonderful, attractive, fantastic person I have ever met...and I feel like all I will do is complain this summer.  I don't want to be that girl.

Please help me cope with being at home.  I realize it might not sound that bad, but I have struggled with OCD, panic attacks and depression my whole life, and this past semester, I genuinely felt like I was conquering it.  Being home is so rough on me and I have no support from my parents when it comes to my own emotions unless they view it as a good reason to be upset, and they deny that the arguing and yelling even happens on a regular basis.  (They also never believed that my OCD was real or that my panic attacks were for a good enough reason and just got angry with me about it.)

I have been hiding in my room all day, crying most of the time I've been in here, listening to them have multiple loud arguments and one screaming match, and I know I will be told that I'm being ridiculous for hiding away up here, but I don't care anymore.  I could borrow my mom's car, but I live in a town with basically nothing for just one person to do and there is no where else to go because all my friends from around here stayed at their respective universities for the summer.  As immature as it sounds, I never want to come out of my room, unless it is to leave with my boyfriend and go back to school.

---   
**TL;DR**: My parents never stop fighting/yelling and after bettering myself emotionally over the past semester, I feel like all my hard work is going down the drain after just 2 weeks of being home and I have 3 months left.  I don't know what to do..."

26k10o,1,2014-05-26,[21/f] Got into a fight with boyfriend [21/m] and left for five days. Don't know what to expect when I get home.,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/26k10o/21f_got_into_a_fight_with_boyfriend_21m_and_left/,"So, kind of a long story. We've been together almost a year (June 12), and have been dating ever since he got back from AIT for the Army. He's always been a huge party kind of guy, always had it easy with the ladies. He of course settled down on the ladies with me, but continued drinking.

I took internship last fall, turning our romance into an LDR temporarily. It worked fine, but he got black out drunk and made out with/went home with/did not sleep with a friend of a friend of a friend after someone's birthday back in October. He called and told me what happened literally the next day (when he was coming to visit), and went into a depressed kind of state, a little bit of self-harm and some obvious self-loathing for doing me wrong. He started counseling, and we took a break for a few weeks then got back together when he decided our relationship was based largely in friendship, not just sex. He stopped counseling.

We moved in together in January, and things were great! We take care of house well together, and were able to respect each others' need to be alone when necessary, even in a 1-bedroom apartment. In April, my family started falling apart (tl;dr, dad went to rehab, mom went to looney bin, divorce because dad had an affair, little bit of disagreement among siblings, on and on), and I've spun into a type of depression I guess over it. I haven't been able to make it to counseling so naturally all this gets taken out on him and my one girl friend. 

He's continued to go out recently and drink with his friends (which is fine), but I haven't wanted to leave the house much and so haven't participated in things like ""$2 tea tuesdays"" at the local bar. Well a couple weeks ago he came in black out drunk and said that one of his friend (Let's call him Asshole Friend, AF for short) spent an hour listing why he should break up with me. I asked if he agreed and he went on a brief bit about how I ""ruined him, am controlling, haven't tried to make him happy,"" and that I ""don't think his career is good enough to match mine""

This is not when the fight happened. The next day he woke up and apologized for everything, saying obviously I've made him happy, and have supported his career choices. He told me to remove the alcohol from the house (gonna stop drinking, we're on diets anyway and it isn't good for me and I'm an asshole with liquor), and said he wasn't going out to the bar district for ""a long time""

Cue last Tuesday. He convinced AF that we should do a calm evening, chill at the pool. He had work the next morning at eight, didn't want to be out late again, really didn't want to get drunk again. Then our other friend (Cool Friend, CF for short), was hungry and was in the middle of making dinner, so left the pool. So we all left the pool. After leaving, AF convinced Boyfriend they should go out tonight. ""it's tradition, I'll go and have one drink and drive myself home alone if I have to"" he said. So BF decided he'd go too. When I asked how late they'd be out, he said ""surely not past midnight."" Cool, the previous end time on our fun was 10 but ok 12 isn't bad either. But I texted at 1130 to ask if he'd be home soon, and he said ""We're chilling with AF's buddies, so whenever he wants to come  home, he has DD rights""...Well okay cool surely they won't be out all night. Doesn't matter, really, I fell asleep at 1230. 

But I woke up at 2, and he wasn't home. So I turned on my phone to see if there had been any updates; nothing. As a normal human woman, this both scares me and kind of pisses me off. He could have gotten in a wreck, been arrested, gotten wildly drunk, on and on, since last I had heard from him. I was slightly irate when he got home (sober enough) at 2:20. And I said I was upset he had been out so late since he said he wasn't going out in the first place. But he got really mad at me for being upset because ""he didn't even drink that much. Like maybe 5 drinks in the last five hours."" He then rolled over and went to sleep, ending the argument without discussing why I was upset. I can't sleep when he's mad at me, so after a half hour of trying, I woke him up and said I wanted to talk about that. All I wanted was in the future for him to send an update text, but it turned into a huge HUGE fight. 

The next day he was sick puking (I gave him my stomach bug, oopsie), and I brought him powerade and took care of him as a peace offering. It was a dumb fight, I know. I can get over it, we can move on. We watched one of his favorite movies together and things seemed okay. But late in the evening I asked if he was still mad and he said ""yes, a little....a lot"" and he slept on the couch again that night. 

Wake up next morning, he's still sick. I said we need to talk about it before I leave on a weekend trip. Which turned into another little mini fight about how I'm always ""judging, controlling, and yelling"" at him, fighting with him all the time anymore. I said that I just wanted to know if when he has his career and maybe a kid to attend to, will he still be going out until two in the morning. He said yes, that he wasn't ever going to stop having fun just because the world said he was supposed to. He also said ""clearly this is how you are, and this is how I am, and it isn't going to work,"" rolled over and went to sleep again.

So this time, I'm over it. I packed my stuff up, rescheduled an appointment I had that afternoon to morning, and got ready to drive to Oklahoma. He woke up again while I was about to go to the appointment and asked where I was going and I said ""to my appointment and then to Oklahoma"" and he asked (seemingly upset) ""Now?"" and I said ""does it even matter?"" and kind of fought tears to not clue in the person I was meeting. I returned after the appointment to pick up the dog and he asked if I was really leaving now, and I said yes to go to Oklahoma. He apologized again, saying he was ""mad, but not THAT mad"" about it, but I held strong and said I thought he needed some time to cool off. 

We haven't been in contact much since I left. I've been drinking every day trying to have fun. I know he's drank plenty since I left. He asked when I was coming home yesterday, but I can't tell if that means he misses me or if he's secretly just moving himself out. I made an apology at some point but he didn't really accept it and said he didn't want to talk all ""super serial."" 

I'm leaving and driving through the night to avoid traffic tonight, getting home around 4 or 5, so he'll be asleep. Anybody have a guess as to what I can expect when I get back??

TL;DR: we're both assholes, had a pointless fight, I just want to get back to the fun relationship I was in before my world fell apart."
26k8cn,1,2014-05-26,"Job, internship, or post-bachelor program? What should I do before applying to graduate school?",[deleted],biology,https://www.reddit.com/r/biology/comments/26k8cn/job_internship_or_postbachelor_program_what/,"I have found myself stuck in a quandary while deciding my next step in science. To illustrate this problem, I'll give a bit of background first: I attended a small (but somewhat prominent) college in the US, and because of its liberal arts system, I had some time to choose my major. Initially, I wanted to study neuroscience, but ultimately, I chose to major in biochemistry. By that point however, virtually all of the research opportunities offered by my college had already been taken by other students who had decided earlier than me, and because of various scheduling conflicts (as well as the obvious limitations of being a small school), there were many classes I could not take. 

Although I completed all the necessary classes and did graduate with fairly good GPA (3.45), I felt like I did not know enough to have any kind of inclination towards a particular field, nor did I have enough research experience to make me a competitive candidate, and so, I didn't feel prepared to apply to graduate school.  

But, as fate would have it, I had to carry out my obligatory military duty in my father's home country, which luckily bought me some time to think about how to boost my skills in science as well as what kind of scientific field I would like to focus on. I worked as an unpaid intern in a lab for a small biotechnology firm for the few months before my military service started, but I ended up leaving early after I realized I was not learning anything.

I am now planning to return to the US (to upstate New York) to prepare myself for graduate school after I finish my military service, but I have no idea how to do so. I know that biochemistry has a wide range of options, of which biotechnology fascinates me the most (especially agricultural biotechnology). But getting a job, internship, or post-bachelor program are three different ballgames altogether, each with their own set of pros and cons (e.g. getting paid versus having to pay, acceptance rate, different learning conditions, etc). I just want to be in the best environment to increase my molecular biology/genetics/computer skills, as well as have good networking opportunities. So I wanted to ask, can anybody recommend me one game plan over the others? And does anybody know of a specific program they could recommend?

26k9l6,4,2014-05-26,Me [20 M] with my overbearing Muslim/Indian mom [51 F]. She does not approve of me dating. What should I do?,obviisobvious,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/26k9l6/me_20_m_with_my_overbearing_muslimindian_mom_51_f/,"Background: I am an only child, and I currently live with my parents. I was born and raised in America, and I identify primarily as an American. I attend a university that is only a couple of hours drive from home, and I live in an apartment off campus during the school year. During Christmas and summer breaks, I live at home. I do not own my own car, and my parents are supporting me financially through college.

My mother has never been okay with me dating. She has always said that I should graduate and find a job before I start dating. I've tried reasoning with her before and telling her that that is not normal behavior in America, but it is difficult to reason with this woman. She had an arranged marriage back in the old country, and she's extremely Muslim, so appealing to ""Western"" ideals of independence, young love, exploring one's identity, etc., don't work on her. Just to understand what I'm dealing with here, this is a woman who believes that many ""Western"" women are asking to be raped based on what they wear.

Problem: I met an awesome girl my freshman year, and we've been going out for almost 1.5 years (my first real relationship), but the toxic environment at home surrounding dating is really putting a strain on this relationship.

When I first started seeing this girl in 2012, I told my mom about her, under the delusion that my mom would accept this relationship. Instead, my mom responded with hurtful vitriol like: ""Your girlfriend is just a girl from the streets"" (in reference to the fact that my girlfriend is not as financially well off as I am).

I went pretty ballistic because I couldn't believe what my mom was saying, and I told my mom that I hated her, that she had been meddling with and ruining my life since the day I was born, that she was stuck in her ways, that I didn't respect her or what she had to say, etc. Pretty hurtful stuff, I know, but I was incredibly hurt and frustrated and angry.

Eventually we made up with the understanding that this was just a phase in my life, that this relationship was temporary.

Fast forward 1.5 years. I'm at home for the summer, and my girlfriend is taking summer classes at our university. I work weekdays at my internship, and my weekends are pretty free. So this weekend, I told my mom that I wanted to drive up to see my girlfriend, and my mom freaked. She prohibited me from driving up to see her, and she said things like, ""You're still seeing this girl? I thought it was supposed to be temporary. There are better girls out there. You don't need to be with this girl from the streets"", etc.

And once again, I flipped my shit. I told her to fuck off, that I didn't care what she had to say, that I wanted her to stop meddling in my life, etc.

My mother is making it very hard, nigh impossible, for me to see or do anything romantic for my girlfriend. She tries to justify her words and actions as just ""looking out for my best interests"", but I feel like she's just trying to control my life. She claims that I am being led off the straight and narrow path, that I am being distracted/corrupted by my girlfriend. I'm unsure as to how I should proceed. I want to continue seeing my girlfriend, and I just wish that my mom would accept her/this relationship.

TL;DR: Been going out with a girl that I met at college for ~1.5 years. Mother does not approve and is making my life difficult."
26kecz,5,2014-05-26,How do I get back in the game?,[deleted],ems,https://www.reddit.com/r/ems/comments/26kecz/how_do_i_get_back_in_the_game/,"It's been about 5 years since I last worked on a rig. My employment with a large private ambulance company in central California had ended with my being terminated after a week-long investigation into allegations about a **co-worker's** behavior towards other drivers and improper usage of a company vehicle. In my ""unusual occurrence"" report, which I was asked to write, following the complaint, I had dismissed any and all claims regarding her alleged ""poor behavior"" towards other drivers (including flipping people off and other supposed obscene gestures) with the supporting evidence being the drive cam footage that was able to be obtained and reviewed, showing that these assertions of rude gestures were, after all, unsubstantiated. In summary, I stated that our trip from our last destination returning to our station (during which the complaint/call in question was received) had been uneventful and unremarkable. 

I was shortly thereafter asked if I would like to revise my written statement, which I declined to do. Just over a week later, I was called into the station, read a script off a computer screen by one of the station managers that stated that the company ""was no longer in need of my service,"" handed my last paycheck, and escorted out of the building. I had to move back in with my parents as I couldn't afford continuing to pay rent and the countless other costs involved with trying to live on one's own.

It took about a month before the effects of losing a job that I really enjoyed started to set in. I still feel like complete and utter garbage, as I've always tended to measure my self worth based on the type of job that I do. 

Since then, I've done odd jobs here and there. I've kept my EMT-B up-to-date and worked as a part-time on-site EMT at a local industrial site. I worked at Tesla Motors for a short while, on the assembly line, building the Model S (which was *really* an enjoyable job), but the long shifts combined with the often-3-hour-long commutes back home wasn't allowing me to keep my head above water in my classes.

I went through a local Paramedic program a couple years ago. Finished didactic with flying colors and spend 6 long, but insightful months in the ED during my internship while waiting to be placed with a paramedic preceptor for my field time. I never made it any further. The owner of the school I had been attending filed bankruptcy and closed the doors, leaving me out $12,000 in tuition and a little over a year in time lost. Some of that money had been borrowed from family who were hurting enough, financially, but ultimately wanted to see me reach my goals.

I've just finished up my 4th semester of prerequisite classes for the RN program at one of the local community colleges. I'm still doing the part-time industrial plant EMT thing, but it's not cutting it. My mother fell recently and suffered a concussion, which has affected her ability to work, so the family's income has been suffering a bit as well. I'm trying to do what I can do to help with things, giving the parents my paychecks, buying/restoring/flipping things on ebay, etc., but I lack a full-time job that would allow me to be of more help and eventually allow for me to have my own space again.

I've applied *numerous* times to other local ambulance companies, hospitals, etc in hopes of being hired. I think my main point in all this spilling-of-my-guts is that I feel that this **""terminated""** label is following me around like a dark cloud, making me appear as too large a liability to hire and ultimately blackballing me from ever working on an ambulance again. I'm so incredibly torn up about it. Any time I try to fill out the ""explain the circumstances of any previous employment termination"" field on an application, I feel that I appear as if I'm trying to take blame off of my self and place it on others, which looks awful to prospective employers, I'd imagine. I don't think very highly of my self, which I'm sure you've assessed if you've managed to read this far, but integrity is one character trait that I can say that I'm proud to possess. 

Has anyone been through a similar situation? How did you get back on your feet? I've lost contact with many of my previous connections from work, so getting my foot back in any door through networking is nearly out of the question. I'm at a loss and just want to work on a rig again, even if I'd be driving dialysis patients around all day. I need something to take pride in. I've had too many doors slammed in my face.

Sorry for the length, but I just needed to spill my guts to *someone* and I appreciate *anyone* taking the time to read through it."
26kewr,1,2014-05-26,I'm addicted.,TwoHundredDollaSuit,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/26kewr/im_addicted/,"Hi there!

As you've undoubtedly been informed by the title: I'm addicted. Specifically to:

* Porn
* Masturbation
* Internet
* Computers
* Video games

I've tried NoFap at least ten times. The furthest I've ever gotten is a laughable four days. But school's out now, my life is relatively stress free &amp; simple for the next two weeks until an internship starts, and I'm want to try again and do it *properly*.

For me, NoFap isn't just about PMO. It's about taking disciplined measures to improve your life, remove bad habits/addictions and introduce good habits. I see browsing sites like Reddit (well, if you only browse the default subreddits like I do) as just as bad as PMO, perhaps worse. So I want to fix a few things in one go. Specifically:

* I want to stop watching porn/masturbating entirely.
* I want to limit internet usage to 1 hour per day, and stop browsing sites like Reddit entirely and restrict my access to more interesting/fulfilling websites (lettersofnote.com comes to mind).
* I want to stop playing video games entirely.
* I want to limit myself to a maximum of two episodes of a TV show a week, or a single movie.

I also have some more long term goals (to be reached within 6 months):

* I want to gain 30 lbs over the course of the summer (increasing my weight from 205 lbs to 235 lbs).
* I want to strict press 100 kg x 5. 
* I want to squat 230 kg x 5.
* I want to clean 165 kg.
* I want to jerk 140 kg.
* I want to read a book a week over the summer and continue the habit into the school year.
* I want to visit a new place at least once a month and actually explore my surroundings rather than getting stuck in a bubble.
* I want to be more adventurous---both in activity and socially.

I really believe that your habits/behavior in your late teens/early 20s (my age) shape who you are for the rest of your life. And I want to make sure that I'm becoming a person that I can be proud of and like. To help me towards that goal, starting tomorrow, I'm going to comment in this thread every day with the following information:

* Current weight
* Hours slept the previous night, time I went to bed, time I woke up.
* General eating habit summary
* Books read today, how many pages
* My activities for the day
* Any new friends/social activity
* If used the internet, what pages were visited. Any interesting articles. Who was spoken to on chat. How long was it used for it?
* If watched TV/movie, what movie was watched.
* Any challenges for the day, especially in regards to PMO.

So I'm going to use this thread as a log to keep myself on track for my goals. It's not really meant to be read by anyone, but the fact that it's public and people can see it will hopefully further incentivize me. 

My counter will not only serve as a measure of how many days I've gone without PMO, but how many days I've adhered to my plan to reach my goals. I'm resetting it for 05/27/2014.

I'm going to do this.

26knc2,0,2014-05-26,Studying concerns during internship year. Can you offer your advice?,thecheetah16,medicine,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/26knc2/studying_concerns_during_internship_year_can_you/,"I am curious to know how I should study during internship. 

I have observed myself during 3rd and 4th year and I have noticed some  patterns I would like to somehow address. I seek the meddit's advice in remedying these issues. 

One consistent issue has always been that there is a lack of time to study at the end of each day. I find that once I arrive home I am tired from the day, I have to make dinner, and prepare my clothes for the next day. Ultimately, I am able to get in about 2-3 hours of reading maximum. This is a huge problem for me because it is hardly enough time to review my old notes AND review new material. 

I have already taken steps to make everything as efficient as possible by trying to make a large dinner once a week and often pre-preparing earlier in the week for each individual day.

I should state that I must review my old material because as it stands right now I have been forgetting more material than I would like. Subsequently, when I am called upon to discuss a topic I come up short because it has been several months since I last read that topic. Please note I am not forgetting everything! 

One day weekends... As I have already stated above I need to review my old material and one day weekends means less time for sleep and less time to study. 

I am truly concerned about this. I am not the kind of student who can go home read some thing and repeat it back verbatim the next day. I have always needed to take time to learn material. My 3rd and 4th year of medical school has been grueling since we spend so much time in the clinic or hospital and little time preparing for shelfs. I passed these exams but not by wide margins. 

I also want to add that I was allowed extra time off to study for boards. This was great since it allowed me to learn the material much better than I could have otherwise. I used Doctors in Training and Kaplan videos to prepare myself and I did well on Step 2. I owe my great score to those review materials and to the time I had off. 

I know internship year is supposed to be difficult for everyone but I am even more concerned about myself since I know I am at my best only when I actually get time to be prepared. With a minuscule amount of time at the end of each day and one day off a week how will I be able to do this? How will I be able to study for the next Board exam? How will I be able to study for in-service exams at the end of each month? How will be able to service patients well? "
26kse7,8,2014-05-26,SO's overseas family want to come visit soon after the baby is born. I'm so stressed. What do you guys think?,kazielle,BabyBumps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/26kse7/sos_overseas_family_want_to_come_visit_soon_after/,"My fiance and I are first time parents. His parents live overseas and we haven't seen them in three years. This will be their first grandchild, and naturally, they're excited to come meet baby as soon as they can. They want to pay for two of his siblings to come too, which means four visitors total and flight costs of over $8000 total. However, they've been pushing to come mid July, and I'm due June 11th. I'm not comfortable with how soon that is and I've made it pretty clear. My partner and even my mother think I'm being unreasonable, but I'm putting my foot down over this. Still, I'd like to explain the situation and get some advice from those who have been there before.

I'm due June 11th. My mother went to 42 weeks with both my brother and I, and then had to have an emergency c-section with both of us. We both have very petite builds, not sure if that's a factor, but due to my mother's history, I'm planning for a very real possibility that I might go to 42 weeks AND have a c-section. That means the baby might be induced June 25, arrive on the 26th, and I might have to stay in the hospital until around the 30th. That means that if everything goes wrong and they come mid July - around the 14th - I might have only had baby home for two weeks. Only two weeks of learning to be parents, only two weeks of learning some kind of schedule that works, only two weeks of learning to breastfeed. I think of the pain of stitches and tearing and recovery, I think of sleepless nights. 

The thing is, I love his family. I'd love to see them again, and I can't wait to have them meet the newest member of their family. And this is one of the biggest reasons I don't want them to come right away! I want to be able to spend some quality time with them, and more importantly, I want my fiance to be able to spend quality time with them. It's been years since he's been able to do that, and it might be years until he can do it again. Instead of being sleep-deprived, anxious, stressed from brand-new parenthood (and the fears that come with it - why won't baby stop crying? is he sick? do we need to take him to the doctor? i'll have to cancel that thing my parents were looking forward to and won't be able to do again!) and trying to juggle spending time with his family who will only be there for a couple weeks, I'd like them to come after a few months when we have a handle on what we're doing and can spend relaxed time with them (and not be jealous about handing over the baby all the time - it's going to be hard to deny grandparents who won't be able to see their grandchild again for a long time). I know I'm going to need a lot of support from my fiance in the first few weeks of our child's life, and I don't want to have to weigh my need for his help against his need to spend time with his family who won't be here for long (and I know what will end up happening is that I won't request his help when I want it so that he can spend time with him, but then I'll resent him for making me feel like I can't ask him - even though he'll gladly help whenever I need it. I just don't want to be needy and deprive him of limited family time). 

My fiance and mother keep mentioning that ""my due date is June 11th so I'm making a big fuss over people who will probably only arrive 5-6 weeks after the baby comes"". It's all well and good to plan for the most convenient scenario for everyone, but what if they book their $8000 trip and the worst case scenario DOES happen? Why am I the only one who sees the possibility there? 

I'm sorry, I've written a book. There is so much more here that bothers me. The main reason they want to come in July is because his sister starts an internship late July, and she wants to come (a free $2000 trip, who wouldn't?). So everyone pushed pretty hard for July or earlier, just so she could make it. I do love his sister, but she lives interstate, goes to school and travels the world entirely on his parents dime, while he and I struggle to pay day-to-day expenses. When she already gets so much help from them and we get none, it makes me blood boil to be pressured into inconvenience solely to suit her convenience. 

The other thing is, my fiance and I are HUGE on traveling, ALL our savings until this baby appeared have been spent on seeing the world together. Our lives have always revolved around each other and the next overseas trip we're going to take. We've spent thousands upon thousands of dollars traveling. My fiance's brother has more money than him and had significantly less expenses, and his sister, as I mentioned, lives an impressive lifestyle using his parents money, while we've always tried to be independent and never asked for help (actually, my fiance has helped out everyone out in the financial department, including his millionaire parents - yes, it's weird). But now, right when we're having a baby and are poorer than we've been in our entire lives, his parents are paying $2000+ per flight for his siblings to come visit us here, and all accompanying expenses. And I GET it, I absolutely do, and I know I should be grateful that we get to see them. I get that it's a family visit. But it really, truly upsets me that my fiance and I's lives have revolved around seeing new places and we've scrimped and budgeted and planned in order to see the world, and now that we're poor and unable to do that, his siblings - one who has a lot of money and has never bothered to leave the country, even at our urging and invitations, and one who lives in an expensive high-rent area and goes to an expensive school and travels overseas using their parent's money - get free $2000+ trips across the world. It just doesn't seem fair. I actually suggested we all meet up in Hawaii - it would be over $2000 cheaper to fly the entire family, including us, to Hawaii than for the four of them to fly to Australia where we live. And then my fiance and I would get to go to a place we'd never been and take a holiday we're not going to be able to afford to have for a long time. 

But I digress, and I'm so sorry. This is a really long vent. It all came pouring out!

Anyway, I was wondering - how soon do you guys think I should allow them to come? They won't necessarily have to stay in our house, though we do have room for them. His father has a cat allergy and we have three cats, so I think they might try to stay in a hotel anyway (although I think it would be easier to have them stay with us, so that we could all go places when it suited, instead of having to 'meet up' at a certain time and place and having to potentially cancel/delay when baby won't stop screaming and we can't figure out why.

Everything is all a mess. I've never done this parenting thing before. How soon is too soon for overseas visitors to come? AHHH. Help. :("

Let me introduce myself, my name is Vereenz, I’m 18 years old and I’m born and raised in Amsterdam The Netherlands.

I have made accounts on different social media, to keep it professional. I’m not very active yet on these accounts, because I want to sort things out first before I’m going to focus on that.

For the record, I don’t ask for donations or sponsors, although it would be nice but I now ask for some understanding and help.

I am a creative person and have been to creative schools, That's why I want to dedicate myself entirely to editing and streaming videos.

I also have a blog with on there a few video’s that I’ve edited just as hobby and to build some experience.

That’s been awhile ago, when I was in school.
The link of my blog and video’s that I’ve edited are here:

Meanwhile I went to many different schools, I had to walk internship, I had several part-time jobs, but it's hard to count on.  Because they do not see that I have rheumatism, and it is difficult to see that from the outside, so there is little understanding shown. I find it sad, but I also understand that.

But now I come back to the point for which I wrote this post, I have some money saved up over the years.

it is not a large amount, but it is a start to invest some + I get a monthly benefit for rheumatoid arthritis that I have.

I do not live in luxury, and also not in poverty, I accept the conditions in which I live and have my rheumatism also Generally accepted. 

Now to go about my life in detail, I don’t think that people are waiting for that. who knows in the future.

So what I am asking is; if anyone can help me to invest my savings into a new PC to stream and the necessary gadgets. I cannot pay anything in one amount, but can pay back each period. 

I also want to make a video on my blog of the people who want to help me and make a review of the PC and the necessary gadgets so that anyone can follow how it went.  I do not mind to mention Sponsors or names and brand advertising 

if you want to help and show interest, you can contact  through my social media.

26l4gi,3,2014-05-27,Inner struggle,CorporateGoose,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/26l4gi/inner_struggle/,"I feel as if I should seek help, but I don't know where to begin but here. So just to get some steam out, I've been living alone for 3 years and just graduated last december. I had an internship and scored a job out of college. Sounds like I got it worked out, but getting to this point was my ability to push through everything I shouldn't have ignored.

My freshman year of college I was talking to a really attractive girl online living two states away. I've been through this kind of love scenario plenty of times and I didn't think it'd become a reality. Come christmas break my great grandfather passed away to natural causes. Then my world came to a halt, flipped upside down and put into overdrive. My father was killed in a car accident a week after my great grandfather. If I could only begin to describe the bond between us then you could understand my situation a little better.

I'm a focused driven person and I get the job done when it needs done. I didnt take a break from college, I went back, started dating the girl, and she moved in with me the following summer. My mother started dating out of no where that fall and got married again the next spring. The girl and I split apart that summer and went through a long drawn out breakup to the next winter and finally broke ties the following spring. Since then I went through countless dates and super short term relationships. Shit was simple before college, I knew what I wanted in life, had a plan and was making my way. Now I feel so empty after achieving what I wanted, not able to hold a steady relationship, and still living alone. I've made it this far because of the emotional stamina that crosscountry in highschool helped me build. 

Now I'm at the end looking back and seeing everything that I once knew shattered or missing. I feel greatful for what I have, but I'd trade it all for what I miss. The emptiness hurts."
26l6g2,4,2014-05-27,My perfect end to a perfect vacation,[deleted],happy,https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/26l6g2/my_perfect_end_to_a_perfect_vacation/,"The last 5 or so days have been the best I've had in quite a long time. I'm feeling really good about things right now and I'd like to share with everyone. For a little backstory, the last 2 or 3 years have been kinda hard on me, with the death of my dad and long bouts of unemployment and depression it's really nice that good things are starting to come my way. This year in February I started a dream internship and got my life and career moving in the right direction and on my birthday in April, my mom and grandparents both chipped in to get me a flight to visit my high school best friend for 5 days in California.

The vacation was entirely awesome, on the flight there the plane was not crowded, and I [ended up getting a whole aisle to myself](http://i.imgur.com/jy3ZYVF.jpg) which is nice because tall people and airplanes don't usually play nice. We both just turned 21, so the first night there we went to the store and basically fill up the card with beer and spirits with the intent of drinking it all by Monday (which we succeeded in doing, by the way!). The next day we drove up to lake Tahoe and [had fun at the river and the beach](http://i.imgur.com/vJOpkws.jpg) and then made our way to the casinos in south Tahoe city, where my friend ended up winning 82 dollars in two rounds at the penny slots which we used to buy dinner on the way home.

Over the next few days, we [visited Silicon Valley](http://i.imgur.com/WsiSdaS.jpg), saw the trees at [the redwood forest](http://i.imgur.com/DyQ4v7B.jpg) and explored San Francisco (which I don't have pictures of). We also had some awesome [games of Cards Against Humanity](http://i.imgur.com/s7PwDOF.jpg) and [volunteered on the safety crew at a racetrack](http://i.imgur.com/0dXwXjD.jpg) and I got to [take a ride in a legit racecar](http://i.imgur.com/IGuXalm.jpg). Basically a jam-packed vacation with awesome around every corner.

As if that wasn't enough, after my flight home I got into a shuttle from the airport and ended up sitting next to a very cute girl. We immediately hit it off and chatted the whole ride back about music, TV, our trips and everything else. She told me she doesn't really know anyone in town who she can just hang out with randomly without tons of planning beforehand. She ended up giving me her number and I said I'd call her this week to do something spontaneous. 

So yeah, there it is, the perfect end to my perfect vacation. Thanks for reading everyone, and I hope you have yourself a great day!"
26lci1,0,2014-05-27,"So I'm binge-ing on Scrubs, first time watching. I'm 4 episodes from finishing Season 5 and I HATE JD.",lnpeters,Scrubs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scrubs/comments/26lci1/so_im_bingeing_on_scrubs_first_time_watching_im_4/,"So at this point in the show, Turk and Carla are pregnant, Dr. Cox and ex have their son, Elliot is in a completely inappropriate relationship with a very very sexy intern, and then there's JD.

JD's screwed up all of his relationships, which is no surprise to me since the character is like a perpetual child. I'm not talking about all the nerdy and kiddie stuff he does with Turk, I mean he has no maturity in his other relationships. Personal or professional.

I know the show is really light-hearted, and as a drama-tv watcher, it was a bit of an adjustment for me, but once I got into season 2, I was getting the flow of things and just laughing at the outrageously dumb jokes.

But the problem is that JD just gets more and more annoying (with Elliot coming in a close second.) But Elliot is the stereotypical blonde bimbo (oops, I mean, Barbie), but what's JD's excuse? Does he really have any redeeming qualities? Sure, he's got a good bedside manner, and I guess he's a decent doctor (they sure don't do much medicine on the show), but what else?

His idiosyncrasies just keep multiplying and compounding... Like the episode where he dates that really pretty girl who never laughs and just says, ""That's so funny."" Except I can't make that leap into _liking_ any of his quirks. And that f'ing nose of his... God damn, why do actresses have to get nose jobs and boob jobs and botox and acid peels when male actors can just show up looking like JD and get the lead role in a 9 season show?

Bottom line, and I honestly don't know why I'm posting this, but I hate JD. I hate the character, I hate the immaturity, I hate his voice, I hate that after 5 seasons (over 100 episodes) his character growth is infinitesimal, I even kind of hate the actor.

My question.... Does it get better after Season 5? 'Cause as much as I fucking love Dr. Cox and (JD's older brother), the irritation to sex appeal ratio on the show is only getting worse and worse."

I've tried spraying (nope), time out (nope), blowing in her face (nope), distractions with toys (still goes for arms) etc. I have no clue how to positively teach my cat not to bite, because when she feels like cuddling up and being kind, I conveniently tend not to have treats around.

I'm hoping it's not too late, but an acquaintance of mine is trying to give her cat, Cory, away because she is moving across the country for an internship after she graduates.

They are both shy. Same age. Flippy is very territorial but Cory is very chill. **Would taking in Cory help Flippy stop biting?** 

I'm also hoping they'll be cuddle buddies and playmates once they get comfortable with each other. Not sure if that will happen. I'm excited for second cat but also very worried."

I'm [28/m] in a relationship for more than 5 years now with a woman [30/w]. The first year was cool, but her jealousy about everybody who I talked to or interacted with, was driving me nuts. She also wanted to make me jealous sometimes, but I'm that kind of a person, that when I'm really convinced about the relationship, I have 110% trust in the other person, and therefore there is no jealousy. Trust =/= Jealousy. But she sometimes thought quite the opposite, that I just don't care about what she does. 

But time went on, she stopped eventually with the jealousy and the first nearly 3 years were quite like I think it's normal for that timespan. 2 years into the relationship she moved into my flat, which was to big for 1 person anyway, but is quite to small for 2. Or it's not to small, but it's kind of a loftthing, so everything is one huge open room, and then there is one very very small room too.

So our life situation was/is also not that normal, but whats normal anyways: She finished one field of study (translator for 2 asian languages) when we first met, but really wasn't happy with that. So she started geology studies, but they were to expensive. So after 2 semesters, so she had to stop that and work for 1 year. Than she started biology, and finished her bachelors degree last year and is now in the masters program. My situation was also not the ""normal"" way. After school, I started to get grip in the television business. I did some internships and worked for almost 2 years on different tv shows (as aufnahmeleiter, I really don't know how to translate that, sorry), tv movies or studentprojects as cameraassistant. But I wasn't that happy with the whole television industry, how that worked here in germany. So I started studying, but something in a completely different field. I really wasn't happy with that either, so I swiched and found my dream studies in design. Now I'm at the end of that and I'm writing my final thesis.

Jump back to the relationship: After nearly 3 years she was partiing and didn't come home that night. She just texted me, she was staying with her friend (another girl), because it was so late. So I, with my stupid 110% trust thought, strange, that she didn't phone, but only wrote a text, but, its ok, what could go wrong....

So after that night something changed in me and I started to lose trust somehow. I don't know why, but it just slowely went. I started asking 2 or 3 times and I have to say, looking back, I can't really recognize myself of that time. After 1 month than it came out, she was staying with another guy that night. She said to me, they kissed, but she backed off after 5-10 minutes because of our relationship. 

Now what could I do? I didn't belive her, but than again, I thought, the only way to rescue a love is with trust. So I struggled, but I managed after a couple of months to trust her in her statement, that they ""only"" kissed. 

But year no 4 of the relationship was terrible. We argued all the time, about everything. I hate argues. I really hate them. Since the incident we didn't had sex, even in the month I didn't know what happend. We tried about 8 months after that, it was weired, because it was so long ago, but felt normal. But after that it never happend. And I talked a lot about that topic, but she said, it stresses her out to talk about that. Now I really strongly believe, that you shouldn't have sex with your partner if you don't want to, just for the sake of pleasing him. I really think, that sex is something positive, that both partys have to want to do. And I also think, it's naturally that you do things to your partner that makes her happy, and that this makes you happey. 

But you see the conflict in this 2 things? I don't want her to have sex with me just that I'm happy. But I so often do stuff (or buy or whatever) that makes her happy. And that fact that she is happy, makes me happy. Sorry, I'm really struggeling with my english here, it's so complicated to explain.

But after a horrific year 4 came year 5 and it changed again. I started to sleep on the couch (in the same room, remember it's quite huge), I stopped talking about sex, I stopped talking about problems we had, what happend. I just went on. But this led to a kind of seperation. I started not to care about everything anymore. After half a year we had the idea to move the bed to this small room. There is only space for one bed and maybe 2qm left. But in the end she now sleeps there and I now sleep on the couch in the other room. Now since 5 months. And I have to say, after all this talks and problems and stuff, I like it to really sleep calmly without thinking of discussions at night in the bed or without thinking of the hope of sex, what would't turn true anyways. I got used to this. 

But she made a 180 in this 5th year. She started to watch shows about brides and weddings, talked about, that she is now 30 any you can't wait to long for children. 3 of her friends also got married in this timespan. And shes asking me a lot of stuff about our future. 

Now, we are finally in the present time of my story. I have the feeling, I'm more far away from her, than ever bevore in out relationship. I mean, we don't talk about problems, we don't have sex abit more than 2 years, we even don't share the same bed for the last 5 months. And she wants to glue it all togther with marriage? My parents were divorced, my grandparents (of one side) were divorced (and that was reeeeeally uncommon for that time, where they lived), and I said to me: I will never make the same mistake. I want to relationship to be 110% solid, and the marriage should only be the reminder, that its that solid. It shouldn't be the glue that puts two persons together.

So after reading this, you probably say, what I did wrong, what she did wrong, or have questions, for example, why we still live together. Well it's quite easy I think: Offcourse, we know us quite well, but its also the situation, how our life turned out. We are bound by our financial situation. We both have no family here, where we live. So move there is not an option. We also don't have financial support, execpt our sidejobs next to our studies. We have to share livingcosts. So why did't I have the proplem at the first place when I got this flat? Well back than I had still money left from my time, were I worked at television. I never would have guessed, that I change my studies midway and have to start studying something different from the beginning. So money is really scarce these days. But in 2-3 months I will be finished with my studies and hopefully find a job somewhere, just to get money at first. 

But I really don't know what to do with the relationship. I mean, I can't leave her, when (if) I finally get a job, because, she can't finance a life on her own, as long as she is doing her masters. So its at least another year, before she is finished. But what than? I feel guilty, because I don't want to marry her, and she wants all this stuff. But she is already 30 years old. She could have found somebody else to have her dreamlife much earlier. You know, if you are 30 as a woman and you want a family, how much time do you have? First you have to find somebody, than you have to get to know him, and than you are 32, 33. I mean, sure, you can also get kids with 40 (the second wife of my father did that), but you also increase the risk of the child to be disabled or not be alive and all that stuff.

Well, I really don't know what to do... But at least its r/offmychest

thanks reddit

edit: Right now I saw my title ""Relationship is making me depressive"" and thought again about it, and no, I'm not depressive in the medical way. I know one person, who has a real depression and it is horrible. I don't want to say, that my problems are even the quietest as large as of a real depressed person. But I wanted to say with that, that I feel really really down with that whole situation, because its just such a big part of my life (and of hers). I blame the phrasing on my lack of proper english :) A smiley at the end, what a symbol to end this post...

We do a lot of high-profile work using modern tech, including Ruby on Rails, PHP, Laravel, Foundation, JavaScript, iOS, and Android. In my first 6 months, I had already shipped apps in Rails, PHP (with Slim and Twig), and iOS. So, there's an immense amount of exposure to different popular (and thus highly marketable) skills and technologies.

And we will definitely keep up with modern technologies as they come out and become viable for us.

We have some of the hardest workers and most talented people I've ever met, but we have a lot of fun too. We grill during Cardinals day games and enjoy various festivities on a regular basis. The people are all friendly and the work environment is laid back, yet professional.

I'm a 22 year old student majoring in computer science, I play sports (lacrosse/tennis), and I'm diagnosed ADHD. My parents barely drink, my maternal grandparents are both alcoholics, and my maternal grandfather is diagnosed bippolar on top of that. I however, drink often. It has affected me greatly since I began college 4 years ago.

All of my life I have been praised for my intelligence. I went to college on an academic scholarship from my ACT score, and essentially partied it away. Since then, I've only had one semester of college that could really be considered *good* grade wise. Before the ""good"" semester, I was at a lacrosse party and blacked out. I blacked in on a curb talking to a police officer, with a large bump on my head. One 600 dollar ambulance ride later I woke up in the hospital. I spent that entire semester sober until my 21st birthday (~75 days). 

Since then, I've gained about 30 lbs of excess weight(200 to 230, I'm 6'). I drink 4-5 days a week, for some strange fear that I'm not going to be able to sleep. Even though my parents and SO know that I drink, I often hide from, drinking in my room or attempting to talk to my SO on the phone and claim (I'm a shitty liar) that I haven't been drinking. 

I have spent time sober in the past, and I understand how successful I was then. I am just having trouble making that final push into abstaining from alcohol in general. I am living at home in an internship right now. I do have a problem with free time - it is for sure one of my triggers. 

Any advice would be appreciated. "

26msic,9,2014-05-27,Just Need To Be Honest With Someone,[deleted],OpiatesRecovery,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/26msic/just_need_to_be_honest_with_someone/,"I first used opiates recreationally in college.  I don't remember a first time specifically but I'm sure someone gave me a Vicodin or Codeine or something like that.  I smoked pot in high school and tried psychedelics and ecstasy, but steered clear of anything harder.  By the time I was in my sophomore year of college I was mostly in to working and traveling.  I would use drugs if someone offered, sometimes I would drink, but that was about it.  I was a stripper, and I only cared about making money.  I didn't focus on a career, although I did enjoy learning.  I figured I would get married and a man would take care of me.  That's the kind of mentality stripping breeds.  When I got out of college I had no plan, an although I had a few successful internships and some promising starts, I didn't really have a clear goal, and I fell in with a group of people who loved cocaine.  I felt superior to them because I never used, although I had recently become friends with a CNA who had access to all kinds of pills.  That's when my love affair with those started, almost by accident.  Then I tried Oxy, and a friend did some heroin with me.  I loved money more than drugs so was unwilling to buy much of anything, and after moving to a new town for a fresh start I pretty much quit using pills but I never forgot how good they felt.  I think I just didn't have access and didn't hang out with people who offered them to me.  Over those years I did heroin a few times when it presented itself, or pills.  I started dating a man who was very abusive, and by that time I was using pills whenever they were available, and buying them.  I would use only at night, or only after my work was done for the day.  I even got a Master's Degree during this time.  But then during that horrible relationship I got injured, and got a heavy prescription for Norco.  I eventually used as soon as I woke up, all day, every day.  It kept me sane.  During that time I managed to break up with my abusive boyfriend and move back to my hometown, where I met my future husband, who had never used drugs and is without a doubt the most amazing, kind, caring and decent person I have ever met in my life.  But I had a problem by then.  I used Norco all the time, and needed it, suffering withdrawal symptoms when I couldn't get a refill.  I had to switch doctors when I moved away and I was honest with the new doctor, telling her I had been taking this drug full time for almost two years and needed her to taper me off of it.  She refused to write a prescription and said I was not withdrawing.  I tried another doctor.  She said the same thing.  At that point I was buying pills on the black market but when those ran out I could only find heroin and slowly over a few months I began to use that, and a lot of it eventually.  I smoked it, but probably would have shot if I knew how.  I hid this all from my boyfriend at the time, and we even got married during that year.  I was high at our wedding, or by that time I would just say I was normal, because I needed it to feel normal.  Eventually he noticed that there were days when I was sick, when I couldn't get the drug, and finally he confronted me and I was honest.  This was a very emotional time, and I kept using, constantly.  One time we went away for three days and I was sick the whole time.  As soon as we got home I used.  When I was high I felt like quitting would be no big deal, when I wasn't I felt like getting high was no big deal.  We were moving to a place I knew no one, and I figured I would quit then.  He said he would get me help then.  We moved.  I withdrew.  Lasted a week, then got a doctor to give me morphine pills.  They didn't really get me high, but kept the edge off.  Then I met someone over the internet who could get heroin.  And I got some.  My husband noticed but I kept lying and keep lying now.  He cut off my access from money, giving me only a credit card so he could keep track of how I was spending.  When we had to go home for a visit, the first thing I did was spend the cash I had on dope.  Enough to keep me high for weeks.  Then I ran out.  And withdrew again.  I bought more but my connection in out new town was horrible.  I want to be high, I want to be sober.  I love my husband but I think he only loves me high and just doesn't realize it.  I feel terrible for what I've done to such a wonderful man.  He says he misses the happy me, and once when he was angry at me for using and lying to him he asked me how I could do what I did to him, how I could have married him without telling him about my problem, he said he felt like I didn't love him when I acted like that.  At this point the only the keeping me sober is my access to drugs, nothing more.  I would pop a pill in a second if I could get a doctor to give me some.  I'm afraid.  And I feel like my husband wants me gone, but is to decent to admit it.  And I feel like I'm a horrible person if I stay.  Losing him is not worth the high, but I cry all the time, I'm anxious, and I'm making him miserable I think.  This post is horribly long.  Sorry for that, I just need some help.  I don't want to quit, I want to want to quit, if that makes sense.  I don't know how to want to be sober."

When I first met her, i was doing an internship at a local engineering firm and life was pretty fantastic for me, and for her as well. As time went on, I returned to school to finish my final year, she took courses to up her marks for med school. I graduated, and then we went travelling for a couple months around the world, and since then I have been looking for a job related to my degree but haven't had any luck.

Now, the job search has decreased my morale and motivation, and can make me very upset when I see my friends around me getting jobs that I didn't and all that. But, I would associate that with me, myself and I, and no one else.

However, lately, because it has been getting me down (having taking night shifts doing general labour jobs on top of a part time sales job, all while not getting any reponses from my engineering job search), my girlfriend is starting to believe that since we started dating, that she is causing the bad luck that is happening in my life. I've had some bad moments in the past year in particular; job rejections, lots of car malfunctions, night shifts messing up my sleeping pattern and when i'm actually 'awake', running low on funds (therefore, not really hanging out with friends). However, lately, she keeps bringing up the fact that it's probably all her fault, and that I should leave her because she can't do anything for me.

Now, I'm fairly independent, and am very used to being sheltered and kind of having a cynical view of the world. I've grown up believing that I can't expect help from anyone, or shouldn't ask for help ever. I'm not sure if I'm making her feel useless because when she asks how she can help, I usually respond ""dont worry about it"" or ""nothing, it's not your responsibility"" etc etc.

So, anyways, I guess thats the gist of it. How can I let her know that it's not her fault and that I think her ""I'm a bad luck item"" idea is bs?

Thanks, and hope to hear some responses soon!

Could use some advice... I was dating a man for a few years and we broke up a few months ago due to distance (we lived across the country from each other and had done long distance) his laziness and 
lack of motivation both in his own life and in our relationship. Everything was fine and we both moved on in our own way and thought it was the best decision. Before we broke up, I had planned on moving closer to him when I could but after the break-up I didn't factor him into my decisions. I was happy with our decision to break up, went on a few dates, traveled, etc and he was too.  

When I visited his hometown and had a chance to see him it felt like nothing had changed and when we found ourselves living in the same town again it was like we hadn't broken up and still get on very well. I still like him and like spending time with him and we seem to always end up in some sort of relationship where we end up falling in love and everything is wonderful (he feels the same). He seems to have improved some of the qualities that resulted in our break up in the first place, however, I'm moving away for an internship soon and this man is making me question all of my previous decisions. When I made and thought about this decision, he wasn't a factor in it as we were only talking as friends. He encouraged me to make the best choice for me. I had a really hard time making the decision but decided it was a good opportunity. 

Now that I have had a chance to spend time with him I find myself wondering if I should have taken a position closer because of him and this idea that we could live happily ever after despite our issues and because I also miss being close to my hometown very much. 

Reddit, would appreciate any advice you can give. Thanks.

26nvd0,41,2014-05-27,What the hell just happened between me [22F] and my dad [62 M]?? [UPDATE],[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/26nvd0/what_the_hell_just_happened_between_me_22f_and_my/,"Original post [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/26gwg6/what_the_hell_just_happened_between_me_22f_and_my/)

Edit: So I wanted to thank you guys for really helping me think out the event from a lot of angles. 'Talking' through it helped me feel like I had a little bit of control in my life and I appreciate the support.



Shit got real tense real fast. I spoke to my mom the same night. She asked if I was ok and gave me a hug. She said “I’m fine so you should be fine.” I said that I was pissed at dad and that I was angry at how he treated me. I said I didn’t think I had done anything wrong, was she really upset that I hadn’t gotten her a gift? She said she did expect a gift and that ""these things only happen a few times a year. Something small, but something."" She asked how I would feel if I didn't get a present on my birthday and I said that I didn't think that was a valid argument and that the way my dad treated me was inappropriate. She got annoyed and said that wasn't about her, told me that if I felt that way then I could keep crying, and left. Well ok then.

I woke up the next morning and my mom once again came into my room, but she was very angry. She had NO IDEA what my dad had told me until I told her and now was pissed that I got her a gift ""because I had to"" not because I wanted to. She said she was returning the gift because it was given out of hate and not love. I tried explaining that I had planned on getting her that all along but I felt like I had to wait until I got paid to buy it. She said that my dad was being protective and that Mother's Day should be honored, that if I couldn't afford something expensive I could have done something cheap, but that she deserved to be honored with SOMETHING. She said my dad has no idea that I'm even upset and that he will never apologize to me for it. I asked how it was my fault and she said that ""saying that not getting birthday presents is an invalid argument is invalid."" And she stormed out.


It is almost a possibility that to try and prove their point, they will not get me birthday presents. Which, I mean whatever, I'm an adult and I don't need presents, but knowing that it's coming from a grudge is pretty hurtful. I wanted to ask if that would be happening so I could celebrate elsewhere, but I let it go. I left the house for the whole day, spent it with great friends, and came back when everyone was asleep.


This morning my mom had an endoscopy and was coming off of anesthesia. She started talking to me normally so I responded and the situation was totally diffused. I have no idea if she will actually return the perfume or not. My dad however is ignoring me. He walked into the room I was in and turned around and walked out without responding to my offer of giving him the space. 


I'm less angry because it's exhausting but I am still hurt and want my apology/respect. I feel the urge to play his game. I know that if I act normal, he will act normal, and the whole situation will be forgotten...but I don't want to forget. I also don't want to waste my energy being angry and upset any more. I'm going to my best friend's house tomorrow to speak to her lovely mother about the whole situation. It's coming down to the matter of whether I am going to let the issue go and try to patch my relationship back together with my dad while preventing it from happening again, or sacrifice my emotional health and keep demanding that he see the error in his ways and apologize while living in his house.





**Edit 2:** It's pretty interesting to see how divided people are on the issue of commercialized holidays. With more distance from the situation, I've calmed down a lot. I know I was wrong to not at least tell my mom I wanted to do something with her to celebrate Mothers Day, or send a card. I know now that in my family, gifts are expected for holidays. I know I should have apologized immediately to my mom and realize that I didn't want an apology, I wanted to be understood. I'm going to wait a day, write out what I want to say, and apologize to my mom for hurting her. With my dad, I'm just going to ask that he try to understand that what he said and how he said it hurt me. If he chooses not to consider my perspective, he doesn't have to respond to it, but at least I tried. After that, I can only let it go and be polite until my internship ends. And I have also learned that narcissism is a big deal around here.


---   
**tl;dr**: shit got real, then shit got normal, but shit is still tense and I can either let it go or be butthurt. Tempted to do both.


**tl;dr**: hindsight is helpful and a lot of people now think I'm an asshole"

LOS ANGELES- Fans of the legendary singer-songwriter Tom Waits just don't get a lot of chances to get together. And the last time he toured, fans in his old hometown of L.A. were out of luck—the closest show was in Phoenix, Arizona. 

So once each year, Esotouric, the bus adventure company whose offbeat tours expose L.A.'s secret history, offers a bus tour celebrating the life and work of Waits, a rare opportunity for fans to scratch that gravelly voiced itch in good company. 

CRAWLING DOWN CAHUENGA: TOM WAITS' LOS ANGELES  is the definitive tour of Tom Waits' formative creative life and the people, places and late night pastries that shaped it. 

Calling all rain dogs, gin-soaked boys and Gun Street girls! Climb aboard as your hosts David Smay (author of the acclaimed 33 1/3 series book on Tom Waits' ""Swordfishtrombones"" album) and Esotouric's Kim Cooper (a Zoetrope Studios intern who'll tell how she used teenage subterfuge to arrange a private concert by the man) lead you on a scrupulously researched ride through Waits' epic misdeeds and shenanigans, from the Trashing of the Troubadour to epic nights at the Tropicana. 

And oh, there are such tales to tell, from food fights with L.A. Punks and smackdowns with L.A. police. We'll crawl through the Sewers of Paris, tattle on the Ivar Theater, and get the lowdown on Waits' legendary performances at the Wiltern and elsewhere. 

Before departing for points rural, Tom Waits left his mark all over L.A., from Francis Ford Coppola's Zoetrope Studios to Sunset Sound to Skid Row. We'll show you where he found his true love and collaborator, Kathleen Brennan, and how all the pieces came together to transform a drunken, desperate singer into the multi-faceted, multi-media artist he'd become.

Raised near San Diego, Tom Waits launched his musical career in L.A., signing with David Geffen's Asylum Records in 1972, living in a famously cluttered room in the raunchy Tropicana Hotel (where he sawed off the kitchen drain board so his piano would fit), and building a reputation as a songwriter willing to risk his own health and sanity to get inside the sad sack characters that peopled songs like ""The Piano Has Been Drinking (Not Me),"" ""On The Nickel"" and ""Pasties And A G-string (At The Two O'clock Club)."" 

By 1980, Waits was 31 and starting to feel the effects of his hard living. While scoring the music to Francis Ford Coppola's ""One From The Heart,"" he met Kathleen Brennan, whose influence would completely transform his life and his art. After a whirlwind courtship the pair married and began a 30-year creative and personal partnership, beginning with the revolutionary album ""Swordfishtrombones,"" the subject of tour host David Smay's latest book.

Passengers gather in the historic Arts District, the neighborhood that best evokes the gritty 1970s-era downtown where Waits found inspiration, before boarding Esotouric's luxury coach class bus, where the mood is set with vintage photos and live footage. CRAWLING DOWN CAHUENGA spans Tom's personal city, from The Nickel (aka Skid Row) to once-ratty West Hollywood, favorite strip clubs and midnight diners, recording studios, night clubs, record labels and film studios, before rolling back downtown with plenty of time to get the night started right.

ABOUT THE HOSTS: Longtime collaborators David Smay and Kim Cooper co-edited the books ""Bubblegum Music is the Naked Truth"" (""quite simply the most fun music book I have ever read."" --Bucketfull of Brains) and ""Lost in the Grooves: Scram's Capricious Guide to the Music You Missed"" (""the perfect book for the advanced record collector"" --Ear Candy) before penning their solo 33 1/3 series books on Tom Waits and Neutral Milk Hotel. Kim hosts Esotouric's true crime and occasional rock and roll history tours and is author of the acclaimed mystery ""The Kept Girl"" starring the young Raymond Chandler. David Smay lives in San Francisco, where he is working on a history of the Beats.

26o8mi,0,2014-05-28,I felt like writing about my dating life for a little bit. This includes my experience on OkCupid and life in general. Thanks for reading.,[deleted],OkCupid,https://www.reddit.com/r/OkCupid/comments/26o8mi/i_felt_like_writing_about_my_dating_life_for_a/,"**Highschool Rewind**

I'm with my first girlfriend. We have a typical first time relationship, everything is new and awkward and pretty intense. Looking back it was your typical teenage relationship, things were uncertain and both of us didn't really know what we were doing. 

Eventually after almost a year together, we mutually decide to break it off. At that moment in my life, I asked myself: *I've been together with this person for a year, do I really want it to keep going?* The answer was no. Later, she wanted to get back together, and despite feeling lonely and missing her a bit, I just couldn't do it. I wanted to move on. We are on good terms now, though. 


**My Senior Year**

After I had broken up with my girlfriend, this old friend I had known in another city before I moved pops back into my life. It had been a while since we last contacted each other, and I was pretty excited to be able to see her again. Despite going to different schools, we went out a few times and I started falling for her. We had a lot in common, wanting to go into the same field of work, similar goals and aspirations, ect, ect. 

I believe that she eventually sensed that my feelings were getting intense for her, and for whatever reason, she faded. She stopped responding to e-mails and contacting me. After this happened, I was pretty upset I decided to take a break from the whole relationship thing for a while. *I needed time to grow up and enjoy life, I thought.* *I'm too young for this shit.*

**Fast forward**

Still single, and still away from the whole relationship scene. At this moment in my life I guess it just wasn't my direct focus. I don't know how else to explain it.

I believe this was a mistake I made - once you're away from the dating scene for a while, it takes time to get back in it. You not only need time, but you need to learn all of the skills that are associated with dating. It's like I had to learn to walk again. 

What a coincidence, I run into my old friend at work (where she was doing an internship). She explains to me that she's in a long distance relationship with someone in another State, and I'm okay with that. At this point, I just wanted to be friends, but I would be lying if I said I didn't feel some feelings towards her. 

We're at a co-workers house warming party. My friend makes some moves on me and BAM! It's like all those feelings I had for her came back with a vengeance. We started going out and I went out of my way to be with her, give her my attention, *everything.* We never got intimate though, besides making out a few times and cuddling. I was clearly being pulled along here, and I fell for it. 

Opening up to her again was a huge mistake, as she ended up fading on me again. This time, it left me absolutely heartbroken. It seemed like her relationship with the guy in another State was on the rocks, so that's why I continued to be strung along. I was in a trance here, a hypnotic trance of infatuation that left me thinking about her and wanting to be with her. How it ended up developing is a long story and that's not really the point of this, so I won't really continue. All I want to say is, I don't really fault her for what happened, she had her reasons. There's no hatred in my heart for this person what so ever. Shit happens, and this was a very big, fundamental life lessoned that I learnt. I don't talk to her anymore and have no interest in ever doing so again, but I really do wish her well. 

This is where my current ineptness with dating originates. I was as in love as you could be with a girl without being loved back. All of the time I was spending with her I could have spent pursuing other girls that actually were interested in me. I'm to blame for this, I acted like a love intoxicated fool. 

I'm generally horrible at getting the signals from women and bad at flirting ([this meme comes to mind])(http://weknowmemes.com/2013/05/what-girls-think-is-enough-of-a-sign/) Looking back though, I had many chances that I just ignored or indirectly brushed off because I was way too infatuated with someone that didn't want me. As I said, what happened to me was a huge, huge lesson. 

**Now**

Thus, we arrive at the present time. Still single, and not getting too many dates. A good friend suggested I get OKC since he found his current partner on there. 

I've had three dates so far. The first one went terribly. Girl arrives late, and leaves early, not to much chemistry. 

The second date went well, we chatted and had good chemistry. She stopped responding to my texts and deleted her account (only to reactivate it later, I noticed). Obviously, it didn't go as well as I had thought it did.

My third date, which I had just recently, went the best of all. She talked for hours, we got on pretty well and are going to see each other again soon. 

In all honesty, I'm scared shitless. I'm now thinking: 
*what do I do*?, 
*do I actually like this girl?* 
*how can I be less awkward?,* 
*what are the next steps?.* 

- Among a plethora of other things.


All of this is fucking frightening. I pride myself for doing things in the past that have taken me out of my comfort zone, but this whole OkCupid thing is really, really hard. I mean, from the point where you initiate that first message, until you meet whoever it is you've been chatting with - everything about this process is difficult. Creating chemistry out of an online correspondence is almost impossible. It has to arrive naturally, and that's what so terrifying. 

Overall, My OkCupid experience thus far can be compared to an insane up and down emotional roller coaster. Sometimes I hate Okcupid because my good quality messages are ignored. I've sent out tons to people that I thought would be good matches, tons. 

Sometimes I think about how incredibly stupid online dating is and how we judge prospective dates (at least initially) on appearance. OkCupid has made me depressed, angry, conflicted, and a whole set of other emotions. There are times that I get so frustrated that I just want to delete it and continue living my comfortable, but solitary life. 

However, coming from a guy who has been single for a long, long time, I have to say that it's helping me at least on a very minimal level. somewhat. That's what I have to focus on. Some days I'll think this It's made approaching girls not a big deal for me anymore. Even if I don't get anymore dates, I feel a little bit more confidence in real life because I can go up to a girl and ask her out with a little more ease. 

*I got rejected on Okcupid tons of times, who cares if It just happens to me in real life?* I know it's silly to make that kind of connection with online vs real life, but it's true. 

I don't mean for this to be a ""OkCupid changed my life post"" because it didn't. The point is that *I* am changing my life, OkCupid just kind of pushed me to do it. Dating should not be the primary focus of anyones life. We live in a society where it is imposed on us. 

Life is one big journey, and we just have to be who we are.

Outside of Googling gender therapists, I really don't know what else I should be doing to search for someone. I will do my personal research, makes calls, etc. But I figured I might as well ask here first. I live in the Baltimore area if anyone has any recommendations, and they'd be much appreciated. But more to the point: 

* **How'd you find a gender therapist?**
* **Is there anything I should look out for when looking for a therapist?** things to avoid? what makes them a good choice?
* **Were you satisfied with the experience?** Why or why not?
* I'd like to minimize the amount of sessions I need to get a letter. I don't feel like I really need long term therapy and I don't want to spend all of my money on this. **Would I be able to expect or ask a therapist to give me a letter in as few sessions as possible?** I know there is technically a minimum, but I've heard of some people getting away with just one session.
* **What should I expect in therapy?** I guess it varies, but this is the part that scares me the most to be honest. So I'd like to be prepared for it.


Thanks,

26otii,2,2014-05-28,Need some help on starting something. (20M),[deleted],dating,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/26otii/need_some_help_on_starting_something_20m/,"So, I'm a sophomore going to be junior in college and I'm working a summer internship downtown. Love the work, love my job, love everything about it. I don't know how people view workplace relationships, but one of the other interns completely caught my eye- drop dead gorgeous, and the fact she's doing an internship is very attractive to me. The fact she's working in her field and has determination to stay with it is a huge plus in my eyes. 

Anyways, here are the main details you should know:
- I'm 20, she's 21
- I'm a Computer Science intern, she's a Marketing intern. Not gonna be working with her. 
- The office is small, I work in the front, she works in the back. Not gonna be seeing her.
- She only works 2 days a week as she's currently in school, I work 5.
- We don't have a lunch room, so everyone just eats lunch at their desk. 

Basically, any form of communication is impossible. We talked yesterday while we were waiting for an executive to unlock the door, and we ended up leaving at the same time as well. She's incredibly easy to talk to, as am I. I have no problems talking with people, be it girls or boys, but it's a pain in the ass when the only viable form of communication we have is email. So, I figured I'm just gonna have to deal with that.

The main question: would it be weird to ask her to lunch the next time she's in via email? I figured I'd pull the old ""I forgot my lunch, want to go grab something?"" card. I don't want to ask too soon, but there's not even a guaranteed chance we'll interact when she's in. The company is still start up, so any talk I make with anyone is free game to be heard by all my lovely coworkers.

26p96u,7,2014-05-28,"Help - In-house Tech Writer/Designer, No Web design experience, being pushed to redesign corporate website",Fizzbit,Design,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/26p96u/help_inhouse_tech_writerdesigner_no_web_design/,"Quick background:

1. I moved to a new city (EDIT: husband got new job, I didn't move on my own), started looking around for a job. Found a Technical Writer/Graphic Designer job and applied. Had a great interview, sure I had the job.

2. A month after the interview (owner constantly out of town), I was told that the owner of the company not only wanted a designer who could also write for technical documentation AND marketing literature (difficult to find already) but also could design websites. Coming to find out that also includes web development. The only web design I know is how to design visual layouts, slice graphics, and edit HTML and CSS. Coding and actually structuring are where I fall flat. I panic when code is put in front of me. For fuck's sake, my portfolio is an Imgur gallery.

3. I was hurting for a job and the department was hurting to fill the position. They hired me knowing that I knew fundamental HTML &amp; CSS editing skills, but the ""Web design"" was kept in the job description.

4. That ""Web Design"" keeping there is hurting me professionally. Despite being added in to the job description AFTER my interview and literally moments before they offered me the job, I'm expected to redesign the corporate website. 

Now I'm not the first to admit that the corporate website is HORRIBLE, and the back end is incredibly sloppy. It needs a complete do-over. Start from scratch. 

Again, my problem is I am not a web designer. I am a Designer &amp; Tech Writer. And some of the elements the owner has hinted at in the past (""Build it yourself"" purchasing system, automated ordering, etc) are jobs for a web developer, not a designer. I'm still trying to design my own portfolio website. 

My manager and I have tossed the idea back and forth of proposing hiring a paid intern to design our website for us if I can design the overall layout and provide graphics. 

I guess what I'm looking for is 1) How to approach this demand, and 2) How the fuck do I get over my phobia of code? I went through Codecademy and got familiar with fundamentals of CSS &amp; HTML but tell me to actually build a site and I freeze up."

We've had an extremely happy relationship. He goes to college while I dropped out and work full-time. In order to graduate, he must complete an internship in his field. He got a well-paid offer from a company 900 miles away. I told him that he should go, seeing as it's difficult to find a paid internship at all and it's perfect for his field. However I can't afford to move with him for just those three months, so I'm staying home and working.

We've lived together for the last year, and we do literally everything together. We both work and go to school and immediately come home to hang out, play videogames, cook dinner, binge-watch TV series together. I can't even begin to imagine having to live the next 3 months without him by my side. I already know that I struggle with long distance relationships due to a short bout where I was commuting away for 4 days a week. During that time, we mostly fought a lot about stupid shit, and every argument basically boiled down to ""why can't you just be here..."" 

Basically, I'm looking for tips on how to make a long distance relationship stay fun. I don't want to spend the whole summer moping about not being able to see him. I'm trying to focus on the fact that I'll get to see him for a few weekends here and there, but all I can think about is the long stretch of hot lonely days between visits.

26pm0k,22,2014-05-28,On Casual Sex and its discontents,DivineAbsurdity,exchristian,https://www.reddit.com/r/exchristian/comments/26pm0k/on_casual_sex_and_its_discontents/,"So like most people who grew up Christian I was taught that sex is bad and should be avoided until you are married otherwise it will mar your eternal soul etc. Well I heeded those words and unlike most of my friends remained a virgin for until I lost my faith this year at the age of 22. After losing my faith in Christianity and its teachings I realized how far behind I was socially and thought it would be best to dive right into the secular social world in my last semester of college while I still could and learn about sex, drinking, and picking up girls. So I took an internship out of state to get away from my Christian friends and figure out life without God. 

Long story short I met a girl that I liked, was honest with her about my inexperience and she gladly showed me the ropes. I had hit the jackpot! I had my first make out session, oral sex experience, and sexual intercourse ever. I was thoroughly unprepared for how physically taxing it would be, but the girl I was with was quite accommodating and was enjoying teaching me all these new things. Needless to say it wasn’t like the movies, I was really bad at the whole thing, but I couldn’t wipe the smile off of my face. I had finally done “it”. Well since that day in February I have had a few one night stands (six in total) most of them occurring during my graduation weekend (last weekend) where I slept the three girls in two days. 

For a guy who was a virgin for 22 years I think I might be overdoing it and am starting to feel that hole that Christians say consumes your heart after “living in sin”. I feel like a scumbag; dirty and morally bankrupt and I regret some (not all) of these easy lays from these college parties. I think I’m going to take a break and reevaluate my moral compass. I’m probably going to wait until I’m in a relationship with someone I care about before having sex again. Just needed to vent this today. "
26pwmy,2,2014-05-28,"My (23F) boyfriend (22M) has destroyed our relationship with his manipulation, confused and lost [serious]",FeelingWorthless100,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/26pwmy/my_23f_boyfriend_22m_has_destroyed_our/,"[WARNING: long, but I've tried to make it concise, but all of the details are necessary to get a clear picture of what's going on]

We'd been together four years; initially he was the most genuine and truly kind person I'd ever known. But he's always had an issue with self-esteem - he'd been in therapy as a teenager because of a birthmark he has that affects him psychologically to this day (though it's not visible under clothing). He once got a haircut he didn't like that made him cry. He is a nerd (which I like - rather, liked), but he would try to hide his hobbies because they weren't ""cool.""

When he went to college he broke up with me because he was four hours away (and obviously wanted freedom). He got into drinking, so much so he was falling asleep under tables and not doing his classwork. His parents pulled him out after a year and sent him to a community college because they pay for his tuition and didn't appreciate him throwing away the education they were paying for. I don't have a problem with him drinking, but I also didn't like the person he became when he drank, and since he's a lightweight it only takes half a beer for him to start to lose it. Though we had little contact after breaking up because he didn't want to speak to me, he once texted me drunk, telling me the booze made him a better person.

Six months later he wanted me back. I agreed, on the condition he lay off the alcohol to the extent he was taking it in - I don't have an issue with drinking, I just don't like people who have to get shit faced every time they drink, like he was. For the next four years we were fine, though he always held against me what he perceived to be me not liking him drinking AT ALL. I don't know how many times I've said over the years I DON'T MIND if he drinks with his friends, and that I only didn't like when he took it to an excess, but he never stopped thinking I just didn't like it at all and, by extension, didn't like him spending time with his friends.

His issues with me were that he didn't appreciate that I had to work to put myself through school (he's never worked through his five years in college) and thought I spent too much time there and not enough with him. He wanted me to come visit him but when I couldn't get the time off from my job he resented me. He resented that my dad initially wasn't ok with me spending a weekend with my boyfriend four hours away and told me I needed to stand up to him. Every issue he had, I acquiesced and made the changes he asked of me. 

Last summer he had an internship, where he became chummy with a group of Ivy League kids who wanted to party hard with him. He got sucked in, broke up with me, and completely broke off all contact with me (mind you, we live just up the street from each other, so that was especially hard). But he kept flip-flopping about leaving me, telling me he loved me and didn't want to hurt me, sleeping with me (though I'm not blameless because I let him) and telling me he wouldn't leave me like he did freshman year of college. He ended up cheating on me with an intern, going out with her and the other interns and lying to me about where he was. He ended up completely fucking up at that internship, to the point where his bosses were so disappointed in him he was the only intern that they didn't ask to give a final presentation because he wasn't doing any work while he was there. He officially broke things off when he went back to school in September, and I was devastated. In response he told me I should go to therapy, like he did, to come to terms with it.

It wasn't until December that he admitted to me that he cheated. We were in his car and I flung open the door to storm out, and he grabbed my arm and wouldn't let me leave. He pulled me back, locked the doors, and begged me to give him another chance, telling me he wasn't a bad person, but someone who made big mistakes. That the therapist he saw told him he shouldn't tell me the truth about what happened if we weren't together anyway. He told me he loved me, missed me, and that he would work to rebuild my trust in him.

I went to see him at school in February, then in April, and each time he treated me like he used to when we first started dating. But something felt off. I NEVER used to try and see his phone or look through his social media accounts before the internship incident, but after the endless string of lies he started telling for three months, I became that ugly girlfriend that started to snoop, because I wasn't getting the truth from him, ever, anytime I asked. But when I saw him this last time, I went through his phone and found things that made me realize what was going on.

In March he went to Vegas for his friend's 21st bday. After Vegas, I noticed he started following some random party girl I'd never seen or heard him talk about before on Instagram. I figured he had to have met her there. When I went through his phone in April while he was sleeping, I found a photo of her on his phone. I confronted him, he claimed one of the interns he was still in contact with saw the girl and wanted a photo of her, so he screenshot it and sent it to him (which made no sense because her profile is public). He claimed he didn't have her number in his phone, that she walked up to him in one of the casinos in Vegas and asked him to follow her on IG, so he did.

After coming home I noticed his interactions on IG with her becoming more frequent. My college graduation was last weekend and he didn't come because he conveniently contracted strep throat. On a hunch, I logged into his Snapchat - he'd been chatting with her, meaning he lied again to me when he said he didn't have her in his phone. Her story on her Snapchat included a close-up of her tits with the caption, ""Real or Fake?""

I was so disgusted, so incredibly betrayed, that I finally told him I'd had enough. I couldn't take the thought of sharing a bed with him while he was communicating with some skank he randomly met in Vegas that he wouldn't have told me anything about if I hadn't been paying attention to his IG. He pinned the blame on me, told me I'd always been too negative, that he's met a new set of friends and doesn't have time for me - he has another internship this summer. I also discovered that around two weeks ago this girl came down to his school to party with him and his friends, something he again hid from me, when he claimed that he's ""honestly been so depressed lately about what he's been doing to me that the guilt is tearing apart his insides."" Guess he wasn't so depressed and torn apart inside that he couldn't party with her and his friends.

He tried claiming that he's never done anything with this girl, whose name I don't even know because she carefully hides it on all of her accounts, and again insisted he loves me and that he can't tell me enough how important I am to him. That I'm his best friend. I feel sick to my stomach waking up every day knowing that I was used for sex, that I allowed myself to be used, denying every feeling I had that he was lying to me. They say cheaters have a tendency to cheat more than once, and I kept wondering not if, but when, it would happen. I'm convinced he has, because every detail with this girl parallels the situation with the intern last summer.

The day I told him I couldn't take any of this anymore, and he said good bye to me, he continued to Snapchat the girl.

He's always been desperate for social acceptance, gravitating towards party animals because he's always felt insecure about being a nerd. He won't dress how he likes to dress while he's at school because ""nobody else around there dresses like that,"" he claims over and over that he doesn't like to drink but drinking is, literally, all that he and his new friends do when they're together, he admitted that he let himself get sucked into the non-stop party life with the interns last year because he'd never felt so socially accepted before, yet admitted to me that he knew that they didn't like him for him but liked him because he had the money to party. He hides his interests in video games, Magic, and computers and doesn't really engage in them because they're not what the bros he hangs with like to do, then claims he merely ""doesn't have time for them anymore""

What really hurt was when he said that he cheated on me because he didn't feel loved, by me or his parents. His parents, who pay for 100% of his existence and would do anything to help him succeed, who hold his hand through college, and me. Me, who have told him every day without fail how much I love him and how much he means to me, who has given him everything I have to offer and have told him that if I had more to give, I would.

Please help me. I am so distraught, so depressed, that I'm feeling and thinking things I know I shouldn't be. And feeling like worthless, used trash. 

TLDR: boyfriend has cheated on me, I took him back, he's fooled around again behind my back, has pinned all of his mistakes on being mistreated by me and his parents, prioritizes friends, now I'm feeling confused and lost, need help."

26q23u,8,2014-05-28,"So, there's this boy...",[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/26q23u/so_theres_this_boy/,"I know that a lot of you will think this juvenile and lame and if you don't want to hear an eighteen-year-old ramble about boys then I suggest you stop reading now. I also don't know if this is ""gender-related"" but I don't really know where to post this. This community is really kind and supportive so I figured I'd go for it, haha.

So, I've been at uni for a year now, and the whole year I've been single. I'll occasionally hit up guys I'll meet at a club (I'm studying in China, so legal age = 18), or kind of flirt casually with guy friends here at school. I personally really enjoy being single. It's nice kind of just caring for myself, trying to wade my way through the pool of sweaty nervous freshman without another half next to me. However, I also like sex and I'm also very quick to fall in like (yes that was on purpose). [It's rough](http://cdn3.whatculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/house-gif.gif).

At the beginning of the year, I really liked this one guy, even though I *knew* he didn't like me back. But I still allowed myself to embarrass myself by being really flirty with him even though I knew he wasn't that interested but was too nice+awkward to say so. Cringe moment - he and I were watching a movie together in my room (Silenced, or 도가니 in Korean. Absolutely tragic movie and based on a true story. It's a great watch but a sad time), and I put my head on his shoulder. Near the end of the movie, I started crying (*it's a really sad movie, okay*), and he just kept his eyes on the screen. I'm sure he felt ridiculously awkward and uncomfortable and ***ugh I cringe evrytim***.

Throughout the year, I've had this one friend who I met at the very beginning of the year, and the first thought I had was, ""Wow, this guy is *seriously* cute."" And he is! He's really attractive. He's going to intern at *Vogue* in Hong Kong this summer. Like seriously...wtf. 

The whole year, he and I have just been friends (probably more like good acquaintances, honestly...), but recently, he's started being very...personal. Like, he'll just really compliment me, or put a really comforting hand on my shoulder, or other things that are just the right amount of sweet but also respectful. Tonight, we went out and he paid for everything and opened every single door for me. He even pulled my chair out for me! I've always found that incredibly gentlemanly. 

The cynical side of me is saying that he just wants to get into my pants, but the optimistic, love-dovey, romantic side of me is saying, What if something good might come out of this?

My last relationship ended up with me calling the cops on my boyfriend because he'd gotten drunk and was threatening to cut me up with a knife. He broke into my apartment - literally banged my fucking door down - and started screaming at me for denying him sex (we'd had sex like the day before he did this) and when I tried to get him some water and sleep he ran into the kitchen, grabbed a knife, then came back, sliced a chunk of my hair off, and waved it in my face saying, ""You want your nose to be next, you dry little bitch?"" 

The thing is, I had no idea where that came from. He and I had been dating for a year and a half and we'd had a really great relationship (for those of you who believe high schoolers can't have serious relationships, I promise you, we were an exception of that belief). We were sexually active but healthy about it, and he'd gotten drunk in front of me multiple times with no negative events. He'd also show up at my house drunk a lot, and I would just give him water, help him wash up and go to bed, and make him breakfast in the morning. We'd *never* had an issue like that, and I honestly will never understand what happened.

So now, I won't lie, I'm a little scared to let my ""walls"" down. I'm finding it hard to trust people just because I'm *so scared* something like that will happen again, completely unprecedented. I've been sticking with the casual and trying to keep myself from getting too comfortable because scary shit can happen out of nowhere. 

But tonight, we were coming back from our dinner+movie group date when I caught a glance of myself in the window and kind of grimaced a little (my thighs are so *jiggly* ***ugh***), and he noticed. He looked at me and said, ""You look really beautiful tonight."" [And then he kind of just touched my cheek a little and smiled.](http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2012/362/0/1/i_got_a_boy_tiffany_by_maribeat-d5pis6p.gif) 

[mfw](http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130607195419/degrassi/images/f/ff/Tumblr_lhn2fgjYLH1qaz51t.gif)

And it was just such a genuine, kind thing to say...I haven't had a single guy talk to me like that so sincerely since my exbf a year ago and I just...I don't know. I think I've just been really lonely. Maybe it's time to open up a little?

Okay. If you made it this far, thank you. I'm kind of nervous to tell my friends about this because I'm afraid I'm overreacting and it won't actually work out, then I'd have told my friends for nothing, haha.

26q60z,10,2014-05-28,[f19] I can't help but feel increasingly guilty that I want to move out the same time my roommate (f20) does. Please talk to me straight.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/26q60z/f19_i_cant_help_but_feel_increasingly_guilty_that/,"I posted [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/26inlr/my_roommates_cat_20f_will_be_a_victim_of_a_murder/) a couple days ago about a minor issue of her cat waking me up all the time. It turned out to be a facet of a much bigger problem. 

**The background**

---

June and I aren't like, super best friends, but we hang out sometimes and discuss boys. I moved in february of this year and have dutifully paid rent and utilities since then. I didn't have a job, shaken from my last horrible roommate experience, but was happy to see that June was self sufficient and responsible. I even looked up to her. She made me aware she was leaving June 20th (before the lease ended) and I guess I never really considered that because I'm so new to leasing and generally adult related responsibility. 

So, I went around getting a roommate for just one month in july, then moving into a new place come august. That was plan 1. However, I didn't want to live with strangers (for my own safety) so I thought I had one with an old ex of mine. He ended up not being able to be my roommate for that month. Then, the people I was going to move in with turned out to just be way too new to adult type responsibility or just lazy, and I couldn't deal with the constant ""I dont knows"" and ""I'll have to ask my mom"". 

After the most recent fallthrough, I've decided to just live by myself. Its been several months and I know now that I can't put up with another person in the same living space as me if they aren't responsible with their finances. 

----

**The Problem**

Well, to catch up with June and I's situation, *I was never put on the lease officially.* I remember telling her that I really needed to be on the lease so that I can get a state ID (and this is before I knew that I didn't), but she was busy so I just left it alone and gave up and went to the landladies and asked what I could do. One of them ended up sort of putting me on the lease, but it wasn't official until June signed it. The day I got back from the DMV, I told June point blank that it wasn't official until she signed it. 

Couple weeks went by, I ended up forgetting about it because I had to deal with a death and staying up all hours looking for a job. 

Well, lo and behold Jenn never signed me on. I asked her about it and she told me that she must had not been paying attention or drunk or whatever. I said okay, well I'm not on the lease anymore AND, I can't stay here anymore. I don't want to live with a stranger for a month. Well, turns out that June didn't know when the lease ended; she thought it was the end of July but it was the end of August. School starts for us both August 25th. This puts another cramp in the haphazrard plan because she's moving out June 20th to a new apartment, and said she'd be paying double rent.

She uses loans and her job to pay off her housing. I use what little I make off of freelance and what little money my dad sends to get by for now. In looking frantically and at all hours a day when I finally found both an internship AND a job oppurtunity... two hour bus ride away. But! It was a job! And I was estatic. I've yet to be hired at the second job but its a good chance I will be. I also found another place to live much closer to both school and work.

AND, I spoke to the leasing office and said well.. I'm not on the lease, so I'm not financially responsible. However, June did help me out so I decided I will. The landlady said I had six months to pay backowed rent (which would come up to 614, and I can pay 100 a month easily without stretching myself thin) so it worked out. Or so I thought.

June blew up and was so pissed. she said she wanted me to stay here because she didn't want to break her lease (even though she's moving out two months ahead of time). I told her that one, I couldn't afford to stay here because of how far away it was from everything, and two, the bus rides at night for when I get out of work/school is too dangerous for me to be alone on. She then told me to either take a cab or get a friend to drive me, but she didn't want me to leave. Find a roommate or something, she says. 

And then, she told me that we'd have to write a contract to say I'd pay it back, she siad six months was too much and do it in two or three, and all sorts of other things that I simply cannot afford. I'd rather be barely getting by in a safe area 15 minutes from work and 5 from school than two hours away on a bus just so that she doesn't have to break her lease. But if I stay until the end of August!!! most places wont have vacancies. This is my only window to get that ONE available unit in the place I found, and I can't guarantee being on time to school/work which'll lead to me getting fired and losing a credit. 

However, I feel like my safety is in jeapordy if I stay here. I'm not even on the lease so a have a lot of people telling me to not even bother and dont pay her, but she'll be a senior in college and I don't want to mess with her thesis. I mean, I Thought we were friends, but after the argument we had the other day I was shaken that she'd rather me spend four hours a day on the bus than move out and have me pay for six months- of which thats guaranteed money! 

Today we tried to discuss it again. She told me she didn't remember me telling her about it at all, and that it was my fault I didn't get on the lease, and that its ridiculous to expect her to pay for six months at this place. I can MAYBE swing three months, but I'm already working on 50 or less on food a month, and thats without it. When I get hired I'll be making a little over 2K a month! I still have to pay back my SO for some plane tickets and a medical bill.

After she stomped upstairs and clsoed the door, I felt so frustrated. I felt like I did everything right. I jumped on the ball and got myself on the lease cos I couldn't wait for her. I spent two months staying up every night looking and applying for places to work. I spent extra time working on commissions so that I can get some money. She got angry I spent 15 dollars on a chair and a lamp the other day because I thought I could maybe at least get something nice if I move out anywhere since the only furniture I have is a folding table, a bed on the floor and a desk chair. 

----

TL;DR: I moved in with an acquaintance several montsh ago. She intended to move out two months before her lease ends, and expects me to stay here so that her lease doesn't get broken and won't hear out any alternatives of me paying in six months.

My schooling (I believe) basically revolved around a position in an institution similar to the one I have been working at since graduation in 2010.

Starting in 2011 I was an unpaid intern doing the stuff I went to school for, shooting web videos for this institution and having them (the museum) promote events and activities using my videos.  I got a lot of constructive criticism that allowed me to hone my skills in video production that was/is extremely valuable.  These videos and internship were done under the largest department the museum has.  Fast forward two years, and I've found a day job, because I need money to live and eat.  In my spare time, I find freelance jobs where ever and whenever I can.  A local university hired me to shoot a lecture series for a single class lecture and gave me an intern.  This intern was very rough around the edges, he mishandled equipment, had zero production experience and ultimately proved to be more of a hindrance than as productive member of the team.  Whatever.  After many months of teaching this guy the ropes, he's finally at the point where if I bring him on to future projects, he isn't as much of a dope, than a handy extra pair of hands.  
The project wraps up and he graduates.  I'm still doing videos for the museum at this point, about one every two weeks and my 9-5 job is taking up more and more of my time.  I'm not one to shy away from stress or anything like that, but having both positions required me to be in two places at once.  So I brought him on, at first as just a second camera, and then I could offer different perspectives on new videos since it was just one camera and me for the previous projects.  Again, let me clearly say that he was only apart of the museum because of me and was not, at any point, an actual intern that went through the proper channels (like I did) to secure a position.  At some point, someone at the museum asked him for a resume, he listed internship at the museum as a job reference and they weren't happy that he was doing that since he never actually had been in the position.  For some reason, instead of ending it there, they gave him an internship on the same level as me, to make his reference on his resume legitimate. Again, whatever, I've been spread thin and there's no way at any point will this guy (due to his lack of real world experience and work ethic) will ever work his way past me.  

Some time goes by and he ends up working more with the AV department rather than the previous department we started at.  I'm working random events for both AV and the initial department but because he is a recent grad, and living at home, he has more free time so he works more often.

Starting at the beginning of this year, we were offered two part time positions at the museum due to the extra events booked this year.  So on top of the usual duties at the museum with videos, I'm working evenings because my 9-5 is obviously, taking up my time during the day.  20 hours a week, nights and weekends, (I should also mention that my fiance is a school teacher so the only time I ever get to see her is nights and weekends) and I'm there, doing what I went to school for and, for the most part, enjoying it.  My fiance understands the sacrifices we both have to make because she knows and understands my goal is to be hired in a full time capacity at the museum.  

The next big project at the museum is live streaming events.  They bring me in for consultation for cameras, microphones, and other equipment because I have some broadcast experience.  This other guy, has ZERO clue.  We've done a couple of streams at this point and the higher ups in the museum LOVE it.  At this point, I'm thinking that there isn't a thing I could do wrong for them to not offer me a full time position when it becomes available.

This guy and I also have teamed up for a couple of freelance projects.  The first project went extremely well.  We actually won second place in a competition, including prize money.  The second, not so well.  To give him credit, he found the job in the first place, thanks to his parents saying that he was this video whiz at the museum.  I told him that he can take the lions share of the projects money, as I'm taking the training wheels off because I'm busy my other jobs.  He coordinates interviews and ended up doing the majority of the editing, but I had to take off work to help him set up shoots (costing me money) and rent equipment (which we budgeted for, but he didn't ever pay me for it).  Once I got the final check, I find out that I lost money on this project.  SIGH.  Ok, the project looks awesome so it's not a total loss...

Two weeks ago, the museum finds money in the budget to offer someone a full time position.  I'm thinking here's my chance, it's been 3 years, I've got countless real world experience, I've shown my dedication to the museum via my work in both departments and the sacrifices I've made.  I'm thinking the interview is going to be a shoe in.  Nope.  Got word this morning that the job has been offered to this younger, less experienced guy who I had taken under my wing to help him get on his feet, professionally.  Only because he worked for the A/V department longer than I did.  Which he wouldn't even have had the opportunity had it not been for me, and the museum just handing him an internship without going through the proper channels.  

I am pissed.  They've since asked me if I want to continue my part time position but at this point I've had it.  Obviously me and my talents aren't appreciated and even when I calmly explained to them that this sets me back professionally, and I respect their decision (not like I'm going to delete all the videos I've done and burn bridges flipping the bird on the way out) my supervisor refuses to write me a letter of recommendation. Kicking me while I am down. 

Personally, I feel like what I have gained out of this experiences doesn't make up for what I have lost.  With the dedication I had to get real world experience out of college, I would've grown professionally anywhere and doing anything.  The museum was just a place that I always enjoyed going to growing up and my interest in history in general.  I feel used, looked down upon, and betrayed by this guy who never had any interest in working at the museum and was completely under qualified! I know your first reaction is that I'm not telling the whole story, but the only explanation to me as to why I wasn't offered the job was because and they said that it ultimately came down to his time in the AV department."
26qd7a,11,2014-05-28,"My (23F) boyfriend (22M) of four years has destroyed our relationship with his manipulation, confused and lost [serious]",FeelingWorthless100,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/26qd7a/my_23f_boyfriend_22m_of_four_years_has_destroyed/,"[WARNING: long, but I've tried to make it concise, but all of the details are necessary to get a clear picture of what's going on]


We'd been together four years; initially he was the most genuine and truly kind person I'd ever known. But he's always had an issue with self-esteem - he'd been in therapy as a teenager because of a birthmark he has that affects him psychologically to this day (though it's not visible under clothing). He once got a haircut he didn't like that made him cry. He is a nerd (which I like - rather, liked), but he would try to hide his hobbies because they weren't ""cool.""

When he went to college he broke up with me because he was four hours away (and obviously wanted freedom). He got into drinking, so much so he was falling asleep under tables and not doing his classwork. His parents pulled him out after a year and sent him to a community college because they pay for his tuition and didn't appreciate him throwing away the education they were paying for. I don't have a problem with him drinking, but I also didn't like the person he became when he drank, and since he's a lightweight it only takes half a beer for him to start to lose it. Though we had little contact after breaking up because he didn't want to speak to me, he once texted me drunk, telling me the booze made him a better person.

Six months later he wanted me back. I agreed, on the condition he lay off the alcohol to the extent he was taking it in - I don't have an issue with drinking, I just don't like people who have to get shit faced every time they drink, like he was. For the next four years we were fine, though he always held against me what he perceived to be me not liking him drinking AT ALL. I don't know how many times I've said over the years I DON'T MIND if he drinks with his friends, and that I only didn't like when he took it to an excess, but he never stopped thinking I just didn't like it at all and, by extension, didn't like him spending time with his friends.

His issues with me were that he didn't appreciate that I had to work to put myself through school (he's never worked through his five years in college) and thought I spent too much time there and not enough with him. He wanted me to come visit him but when I couldn't get the time off from my job he resented me. He resented that my dad initially wasn't ok with me spending a weekend with my boyfriend four hours away and told me I needed to stand up to him. Every issue he had, I acquiesced and made the changes he asked of me.

Last summer he had an internship, where he became chummy with a group of Ivy League kids who wanted to party hard with him. He got sucked in, broke up with me, and completely broke off all contact with me (mind you, we live just up the street from each other, so that was especially hard). But he kept flip-flopping about leaving me, telling me he loved me and didn't want to hurt me, sleeping with me (though I'm not blameless because I let him) and telling me he wouldn't leave me like he did freshman year of college. He ended up cheating on me with an intern, going out with her and the other interns and lying to me about where he was. He ended up completely fucking up at that internship, to the point where his bosses were so disappointed in him he was the only intern that they didn't ask to give a final presentation because he wasn't doing any work while he was there. He officially broke things off when he went back to school in September, and I was devastated. In response he told me I should go to therapy, like he did, to come to terms with it.

It wasn't until December that he admitted to me that he cheated. We were in his car and I flung open the door to storm out, and he grabbed my arm and wouldn't let me leave. He pulled me back, locked the doors, and begged me to give him another chance, telling me he wasn't a bad person, but someone who made big mistakes. That the therapist he saw told him he shouldn't tell me the truth about what happened if we weren't together anyway. He told me he loved me, missed me, and that he would work to rebuild my trust in him.

I went to see him at school in February, then in April, and each time he treated me like he used to when we first started dating. But something felt off. I NEVER used to try and see his phone or look through his social media accounts before the internship incident, but after the endless string of lies he started telling for three months, I became that ugly girlfriend that started to snoop, because I wasn't getting the truth from him, ever, anytime I asked. But when I saw him this last time, I went through his phone and found things that made me realize what was going on.

In March he went to Vegas for his friend's 21st bday. After Vegas, I noticed he started following some random party girl I'd never seen or heard him talk about before on Instagram. I figured he had to have met her there. When I went through his phone in April while he was sleeping, I found a photo of her on his phone. I confronted him, he claimed one of the interns he was still in contact with saw the girl and wanted a photo of her, so he screenshot it and sent it to him (which made no sense because her profile is public). He claimed he didn't have her number in his phone, that she walked up to him in one of the casinos in Vegas and asked him to follow her on IG, so he did.

After coming home I noticed his interactions on IG with her becoming more frequent. My college graduation was last weekend and he didn't come because he conveniently contracted strep throat. On a hunch, I logged into his Snapchat - he'd been chatting with her, meaning he lied again to me when he said he didn't have her in his phone. Her story on her Snapchat included a close-up of her tits with the caption, ""Real or Fake?""

I was so disgusted, so incredibly betrayed, that I finally told him I'd had enough. I couldn't take the thought of sharing a bed with him while he was communicating with some skank he randomly met in Vegas that he wouldn't have told me anything about if I hadn't been paying attention to his IG. He pinned the blame on me, told me I'd always been too negative, that he's met a new set of friends and doesn't have time for me - he has another internship this summer. I also discovered that around two weeks ago this girl came down to his school to party with him and his friends, something he again hid from me, when he claimed that he's ""honestly been so depressed lately about what he's been doing to me that the guilt is tearing apart his insides."" Guess he wasn't so depressed and torn apart inside that he couldn't party with her and his friends.

He tried claiming that he's never done anything with this girl, whose name I don't even know because she carefully hides it on all of her accounts, and again insisted he loves me and that he can't tell me enough how important I am to him. That I'm his best friend. I feel sick to my stomach waking up every day knowing that I was used for sex, that I allowed myself to be used, denying every feeling I had that he was lying to me. They say cheaters have a tendency to cheat more than once, and I kept wondering not if, but when, it would happen. I'm convinced he has, because every detail with this girl parallels the situation with the intern last summer.

The day I told him I couldn't take any of this anymore, and he said good bye to me, he continued to Snapchat the girl.

He's always been desperate for social acceptance, gravitating towards party animals because he's always felt insecure about being a nerd. He won't dress how he likes to dress while he's at school because ""nobody else around there dresses like that,"" he claims over and over that he doesn't like to drink but drinking is, literally, all that he and his new friends do when they're together, he admitted that he let himself get sucked into the non-stop party life with the interns last year because he'd never felt so socially accepted before, yet admitted to me that he knew that they didn't like him for him but liked him because he had the money to party. He hides his interests in video games, Magic, and computers and doesn't really engage in them because they're not what the bros he hangs with like to do, then claims he merely ""doesn't have time for them anymore""

What really hurt was when he said that he cheated on me because he didn't feel loved, by me or his parents. His parents, who pay for 100% of his existence and would do anything to help him succeed, who hold his hand through college, and me. Me, who have told him every day without fail how much I love him and how much he means to me, who has given him everything I have to offer and have told him that if I had more to give, I would.

Please help me. I am so distraught, so depressed, that I'm feeling and thinking things I know I shouldn't be. And feeling like worthless, used trash.

TLDR: boyfriend has cheated on me, I took him back, he's fooled around again behind my back, has pinned all of his mistakes on being mistreated by me and his parents, prioritizes friends, now I'm feeling confused and lost, need help."

I'm used to having shorter hair since that allowed me to hop out of bed and not having to worry what my hair looks like. Lately I have been growing it out to give you guys some more options. I am about to start a nice internship and I want to look the part. I'm getting it cut/trimmed tomorrow so I would appreciate ideas and advice!

Needs to be business professional. I don't want to spend too much time on it each day (around 5-10 minutes). I also need lots of advice on hair products because I have next to nothing.

At the end of my album I have a hairstyle I tried that you could give feedback on.

Thank you so much for any help you can give!"

This idea is based off the experiences in my life and wanting to give other people the same opportunities I had.

In a nutshell, I want to create a non-profit organization that provides low cost IT and computer services to businesses and individuals alike. That may sound pretty basic, but what makes my idea different and special to me is that I want to use the business side to offer training and internship for troubled young adults (17-24). Basically the staff would be made up of individuals who need help getting into a career but can't afford college, or someone who is involved with substances and trying to get on the right path. The organization would provide mentoring, training, and a wage (~$10/hr). IT is the perfect industry for this because anyone can learn the basics and then branch out into so may different areas after time. 

This idea is still in its infancy and I am just looking for input on it. Feel free to critique it if you'd like. 

Any help on where to get started on something like this would also be great!

Thanks

I was morbidly obese as a kid. I was the social reject in high school and couldn't get a date to save my life. And when everybody in my senior class was getting their acceptance letters I left school empty handed and headed on over to community college after graduation. I

One of my childhood friends' mom referred to me as ""The Black Forest Gump"". My coaches and teachers thought I was dumb and soon I truly believed I was dumb. Especially when my class rankings came out and I was in the bottom 50%.

I had a job at Target as the cart attendant or better known as ""The Store Bitch"". I basically did everything anybody else didn't want to do.
I was in the break room one day reading ""Howl's Moving Castle"" and one of my co-workers came in and looked at me so surprised. Almost as if he thought I couldn't read. And I'll never forget the day when an old man asked if I was retarded and I think something snapped inside of me.

I picked up web development courses at my community college and I practiced hard and earned myself a nice internship at a beautiful company. After that was over with, I became a project manager who oversees a team of developers. I did this all without a degree to define who I am and I'm just here laughing at all of the people who called me stupid my whole life.I have a beautiful fiancee and we have a deep love that most people would envy. Now whenever I look at other girls, they come off as basic and insignificant to me, even if they are pretty.

However, this had made me pretty arrogant. I know that there are millions of people better than me at what I do. There is just a buzz I get out of seeing people blow all of their money going to school for a piece of paper. I get a buzz out of watching the people who waved their expensive university degrees in my face who are now working average 9-5's. I may not be making as much money as them yet, but I know that my potential will be much higher.

Just watching the student loan balance skyrocket into the billions and watching people get their monthly bills of $300+ is amusing. My siblings are going to be in debt for awhile, and I should feel bad for that but I just don't feel bad... at all. They got both got elite private school educations while I got put into a special needs school. Which I appreciate, don't get me wrong. They helped me deal with my learning disorder and turn it into something good.

I see people who major in business and marketing as people who are just looking to get into the bottom barrel of a company and hope to crawl their way up. The whole education system isn't broken. People just go about it the wrong way. It is a tool, not a gateway. If I flashed a community college degree at someone expecting to get a job, I would get laughed right out of the building. But if I combined the education I received and continued to refine myself with it, I'd become successful. This is a working progress, but I'll let you know if this is true.

I have taken pride in knowing that my boss has hired me for my brain and the blood that runs through my veins and not a piece of paper or a school I went to. He even told me that it's just a piece of paper. I have a long way to go and I'm not making much but I feel as if my hard work and defying the odds just makes me better than all of those university graduates. My mom wants me to get a degree while she's on this earth, but I just don't see that happening.

What do you think? Does that just make me evil? What are your thoughts on this?"

It's been a little while, hasn't it? Gallerian did give me permission to tyoe up his stories with FancyHam and share them with you all. I tried to get him to do it himself, but he's kind of scared of Reddit so I'm the messenger. All of these have been related to me by him. I did not. However, personally witness them, so they may have been embellished a bit. 

Characters: 
Gallerian Marlon: mid-twenties client/tech-team liasion dude. Badass cancer survivor, and my ex (although we're still very good friends). From a very wealthy family and... admittedly, does like money a lot- this is important later. 

Large Marge: A secretary at Gallerian's company. Middle-aged, quite obese, but a pretty fun person overall- I met her at the company Christmas party. Sometimes will quite literally throw her weight around though if you piss her off. 

FancyClient: A balding middle-aged man of average weight who is one of the biggest clients of Gallerian's firm- he owns a business that does work with his company. Has about as much personality as a bowl of oatmeal, and tries to make up for that by wearing really expensive suits. 

FancyHam: FancyClient's wife. Middle-aged as well. I met her once- fairly short, probably getting close to 400 pounds. Is disturbingly attracted to Gallerian despite the fact that she's married. 

It was supposed to have been a pretty normal day for Gallerian- makin' dat money, bullshitting clients, you know, the usual. He had two meetings with clients that day, one with a woman who had ordered some payroll software for her business, and FancyClient. Neither was going to be a big deal- the woman had given Gallerian (and by extension, the programmers) the go-ahead to do whatever as long as it was functional, and Gallerian has been working with FancyClient for a while. The first client came and went, and Gallerian got ready for FancyClient. 

All of a sudden, though, Large Marge knocked on the office door. 

&gt;Marge: Heads up, FancyClient said he's bringing a guest to the meeting. 

&gt;Gallerian: Oh? 

That was a bit weird because FancyClient had *never* brought in someone to a meeting before- he always came alone, but Gallerian can roll with thiings. But then things got even weirder. 

&gt;Marge: I honestly don't know how many guests he is bringing, though, because when he called he requested that there be two dozen donuts in the meeting room. So I sent one of the interns to Dunkin Doniuts to get them. 

&gt;Gallerian: 24 donuts? How many people is he bringing! They won't all fit in my office! 

&gt;Marge: Well... that's the weird part. He only said he was bringing “a” guest, not “guests.” Well, whatever. You'll handle it? 

&gt;Gallerian: I guess, yeah. 

So the intern returned with the donuts, and Gallerian set them up in his office. He mooched a few chairs from his coworkers, hoping that there really wouldn't be that many guests, because he wasn't sure if they would all fit. 

Then, he heard this thundering sound. One thing you should probably know about Gallerian's office building is that it's in a refurbished block of what used to be townhomes. The stairs leading up to the floor his office is on do have this weird hollow quality that makes even a little kid going up them sound like a herd of elephants.. This... this sounded like someone had strapped metal shoes to the elephants. Gallerian and Marge looked at each other,, and then the door flew open. 

A woman approximately the size of Marge herself, probably a bit bigger, barged into the room. According to Gallerian,, she was dressed like she was going clubbing, and had on these sky-high stilletto heels- that would explain the strange sound of the stairs. FancyClient was right behind her, poking his head around the massive woman. The woman wasn't impressed with what she saw. 

&gt;FancyHam: This is the firm that does the work for you? It's so cheap and tacky looking! 

&gt;FancyClient: Dear, we've used this same company for years and we've never had a problem with it before. 

&gt;FancyHam: Hmph. Whatever. 

&gt;Marge: Ah, FancyClient! It's good to see you! Are your other guests coming? 

&gt;FancyClient: Oh, no, only one guest. My wife, FancyHam, wanted to come check out the company, so I said okay. 

&gt;Marge: Oh. Okay. Well, Gallerian is waiting for you, so if you'll just go right ahead into his office... 

FancyHam thundered past her and barged straight into Gallerian's office. Gallerian is somewhat frightened and looked up to see this woman bearing down on him. 

&gt;FancyHam: Well aren't you just the cutest thing! I could just eat you up! Awww, and you got me donuts, too! 

Gallerian watched in horror as FancyHam picked up an entire box of dozen donuts and started snarfng them, but not before she complained that there weren't any vanilla cream-filled donuts. 

&gt;FancyHam: Make sure there's vanilla cream ones next time, those are my favorite! At least a dozen of them! I need donuts in the morning! 

FancyClient came in and he and Gallerian talked shop while FancyHam snarfed the donuts- all two dozen of them, one after another. The rest of the meeting went well, at least, Gallerian thought it did. Just before they left though, FancyHam turned to Gallerian and smiled at him- he said it reminded him a bit of a very hungry shark. 

&gt;FancyHam: I'll be seeing you very soon, my husband just does so much business with your company! 

Gallerian later told me he knew *exactly* how Nozomu must have felt when Banica was hitting on him. 

TL;DR- my ex meets a client's wife, said wife devours 24 donuts and ominously predicts that they'll be seeing a lot more of each other.

Those of you without cars should know how frustrating it is to need be be somewhere but not have any car to get there. I mean, I can't even get to a fucking interview cause my parents work and they need the cars. I can't get choose the schedule of classes I want cause of no car. I can't work more than two days a week cause of no car. I can't be with my friends cause I don't have a car. I've missed out on so many opportunities because I don't have the job hours to keep up with car, insurance, and gas payments. 

Jesus H. Christ! I remember as a kid how much I took transportation for granted. If I needed to get to school, I got there. If there was a concert for me to perform, I got there. If there was a doctors appointment, I got there. Now, as a near adult I find my parents bailing on my internship interviews. I can't hang out with the few friends my introverted, unsociable self has cause they can't spare the gas or the time.

And yeah, yeah I know, work more hours! Find a cheap car! Get a friend to ride you! Easier said than done...

If there's one good thing it's that I've gotten desperate enough for transportation for me and my parents to agree that all I ought to use  my financial aid money to get a car, even though it was explicitly given to me for the use of tuition, books, and fees. Oh well, hope the donors don't find out, and if they do and they're disappointed, then sorry but thats what desperation does to ya...

There, rant over."
26qzn7,21,2014-05-28,What makes someone a good Accountant?,freechild,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/26qzn7/what_makes_someone_a_good_accountant/,"I'm about to be a Senior in College and I was just wondering what it takes to be a good Accountant. How much does Accounting knowledge from courses help when it comes to real world practice? I always hear people say that what you learn in school is useless when it comes to the real world, so I'm not sure at all if I would be a good or bad Accountant. 

I will be doing a Tax internship at a B4 this Summer and I feel like I'm not going to be very good at it. I have a pretty decent GPA and I do well on Exams, but I remember the one time in my Tax class where we had to actually file a Tax return. Everyone in the class was clueless and we all consulted our textbooks throughout the whole project and even then, we still struggled a lot. So while I make good grades, I feel like I struggle with applying the Accounting knowledge that I learn. 

Is an internship the true weed-out process to see if you are good at Accounting or not? Is there any other way to tell if you'll be cut out for it? Also, how good is the training that interns and new hires go through? Will someone with poor Accounting knowledge (I just feel like I don't remember very much from my Tax class a year ago) be able to learn what is necessary to do the job well? 

Thanks everyone in advance for all your help! "
26rcml,2,2014-05-29,Back from college depression,forensikat,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/26rcml/back_from_college_depression/,"I'm not sure if I have depression as I've never been diagnosed with it. I do have anxiety, though, and have been in a group therapy for it. But right now, I am certainly depressed.

I really have no idea why. I just feel sad and worthless. Like, what's the point of anything? I recently finished my first year of college and it was a blast! But when April started coming to an end, I fell into a terrible depression. Like, couldn't get myself out of bed, eating my feelings in Chipotle depression. The thought of leaving my beautiful college town and new friends broke my heart.

And now I'm home, back to working at the fast food place I've been employed at since I was a junior in high school. My friends and I meet up every now and then and my boyfriend and I text nearly everyday. But I'm just sad. 

Mom wants me to get more hours at work. I know 20 or so a week isn't enough but going there is so painful. It's not a bad job and my coworkers are kind and funny. But doing the same thing over and over again, being berated by customers for stupid mistakes I shouldn't even be making is hard. I dread going to work. I can't even make the time go by quicker. I don't sing as much as I used to while doing the dishes or wiping things down. 

I know I'm spoiled. I had it so good in college. Between the freedom to walk anywhere I want (the town I live in during the summer has no sidewalks and you can't get anywhere you'd actually want to go without driving 15+ minutes) and the family I found in my speech and debate team, I had a home. And now I'm here. And yes I do want to sleep all day so this summer can go by quicker. I had a few plans for summer (jogging in the mornings, getting an internship at a local newspaper), but I can't motivate myself to follow through.

I love my parents dearly and I'm happy to be here, but I want to go home. And I know my mom thinks my change in mood is because of her or to hurt her but it's not. There is literally nothing I can do to raise my spirits or cheer up. I've tried. I don't know what to do, and because I feel guilty for hurting her, I ended up hurting myself and I'd gone 6 whole months without doing so. 

I was happy for a while today when I got a job get for next semester, but it all came crashing down when I had to remember that FASFA screwed us over and we lost thousands in financial aid and have no idea why. 

I just want this mood to end. I'm sick of being sad. I don't want to hurt myself anymore and more importantly, I don't want to hurt anyone else."
26rpek,5,2014-05-29,Econ or CS? [SERIOUS],crasss,makemychoice,https://www.reddit.com/r/makemychoice/comments/26rpek/econ_or_cs_serious/,"I know this question's been asked before [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/makemychoice/comments/1x2b0s/should_i_pursue_an_economics_degree_or_a_computer/) but my situation's a little more complicated and versatile. 

As of right now, I'm a freshman at UCLA in Engineering Undeclared currently taking CS and Economics classes. So if I do transfer to Econ, I probably cannot switch back to CS.

Also, I have this sort of fantasy that whichever one I do, 1. I'm going to try to land a job in some artsy / media company like Vimeo or Adobe or 2. I would somehow incorporate my passion in film and art with the job or 3. I would make the mulah and be able to afford to travel and make films. 

So far, the workload for CS is crazy and I've had no time for anything, so I'm wondering if it does get easier or if you just get used it (by that I mean you still spend ages on a program but you just have more patience). 

As for Econ, it's definitely a lot easier and if I do switch majors, I would be learning AfterEffects and making videos on the side (as well as be more involved with clubs and social stuff). I might even try to do film internships on the side if I get good enough. But also, idk about future jobs in Econ. 

I know I don't want to do the film major, since my interests are more on short films &amp; commercial edits and not on narratives but I am open to other majors.

TLDR: is there a job that incorporates creative arts and compsci / econ / (some other major that makes money)? I would like to get some professional degree and keep one foot in the arts"

I did well. I became a public speaker nationally. My team is the most dedicated team on earth. We helped people. We saved lives.

But as time went on, I became involved in many other things, as is my personality. Student Government, internships and classes consumed my life. So did my fraternity. So did many things that... got in the way of Lost and Found. I really screwed up my priorities, I guess.

I still speak for the organization, much less than I used to. I still love it, and everything it has accomplished. But at this point, if I am not putting Lost and Found first, am I stifling its progress? Am I helping the organization that not only helped so many people, but helped me?

I'm not. I am hurting progress. I am difficult to reach. In February, I am scheduled to join the Peace Corps.

I know while this decision may not be the best for me, it is the best for everyone who is involved with Lost and Found, and even better for the people the organization can help."

26sw9h,1,2014-05-29,I [20 F] am not sure how to move forward with my boyfriend [21 M],[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/26sw9h/i_20_f_am_not_sure_how_to_move_forward_with_my/,"i have been in an on/off relationship with my boyfriend for the past (almost) three years since the beginning of college. we are now heading into our senior year. we broke up last december and essentially got back together last summer but did not make it official until this past november. because of the nature of our relationship, i never pushed for anything. he made the move to want to get back into a relationship, and due to a shitty housing situation, he also moved in with me this past year. reasons that we broke things off in the past were because he felt like he needed time to figure stuff out for himself and because we communicated very poorly which led to a slightly hostile environment at points, but we never lost feelings for each other. when we got back with each other this year, things were great. we learned to communicate well with each other and we're very open, we haven't fought about anything in ages, we haven't lost any sort of affection towards each other. i felt like we've really grown in the relationship. 

yesterday, he asked me if we could talk. he felt like things were weird and he just wanted to discuss it with me. i was happy that he was being honest about how he was feeling (because in the past, we have had issues with that). basically, what he said was that he feels like he hasn't had a true college experience because he has just been dating me and doing work the whole time. he hasn't been able to go out and have that much fun (which is mostly due to work, in my opinion) and i think he feels slightly tied down by the relationship...which is true but for me, i don't mind because i think it's worth it. he also feels like he doesn't want to date me for X number of years and not have us get married in the end because we've put a lot of time into this. but at the same time, he doesn't really see us getting married at this point. and he would feel bad about himself if i was the only person he dated and we didn't even end up getting married for that long. i am confused as to why he is already thinking about marriage, when we're barely 21. he said that since people get married after three years of dating, and he cannot see us like that, he doesn't know how he feels. but i think that's crazy -- i mean, dating in college is much different than people dating for three years in the real world and deciding to get married. i, for one, do not want to think about marriage for another 3-4 years at least.

at the same time, i do see us potentially having a future. i would like to see how our senior year goes, but i could see us staying together after college if it works out that way. 

why is he so stressed about our relationship and marriage? i would love to get someone's perspective on this. it seems like he is partly thinking about all of these things because during the year, with schoolwork and everything it is hard to think about things...but now that he has a lot more time, i almost feel like he's over thinking. and i really don't think he would've said these things if we were still living together like during the year. i feel like the lack of contact over the summer + the time to think about things really isn't helping. i told him i could give him some space to think about things, but i don't know how to feel. it's making me doubt the relationship even though i thought things were fine. to make things more complicated, he is leaving the state for an internship this weekend for 9 weeks so we won't be able to see each other except on the weekends every now and then. 

tl;dr my boyfriend cannot seem to get over the fact that i am the only person he has dated through college and feels like he might be missing out because he does not see marriage in our future at this point"
26t10l,23,2014-05-29,[Hospital/Medicated/Positive/VBAC] Penelopes' Birth Story!,chantpleure,BirthStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/BirthStories/comments/26t10l/hospitalmedicatedpositivevbac_penelopes_birth/,"It was early in the morning on the 16th of May 2014.

I was woken up by Arthur but I was too tired to actually get up and get dressed.  Both of us had come down with some sort of terrible cough-your-lungs -out cold a few nights before.  So I brought him into my bed and closed my eyes, hoping he'd get the hint (this never works).  So I was laying there trying in vain to get a few more seconds of sleep when I felt something snap inside me. 

Shit.  Shit...shit shit shit.  Definitely waters breaking.  Shit. 

I lay there for probably a full minute with Arthur staring up at me thinking to myself, well.. If I don't move, nothing will happen..right?

Tentatively I stood up and fluid fell out of me onto the carpet. 

Shit...I meant to get the carpet cleaned this weekend too.  Bollocks. 

I grabbed the nearest cloth, my pajama bottoms and wedged them between my legs.  Then I grabbed my phone and called Brian.  It rang for a while and I thought I might have to call his school and talk to the secretary.  Thankfully he picked up the phone just before it went to the answering service. 

""Hey, my water just broke"" I said and the reality of what was happening was starting to sink in because my legs were shaking from adrenaline at this point. 
""Ok, crap..really?  I just got to school.  Ok, I'm turning around."" 

I had to wait half an hour for him to come back, during that time contractions started in earnest.  This was a surprise as I never really experienced them with Arthur.  I wandered around the house with my pajamas between my legs, catching more fluid.  I went to the toilet at one point and more gushed out.  This made the contractions more painful. 

I called my parents house and spoke to my brother, ""I'm having a baby today!"" i told him and he laughed.  Then I spoke to my mum.  I wish she had been able to come. 

Finally Brian arrived and we got everything ready for Arthur to go to my friend's house and be watched by the nanny.  Then we drove to the hospital.  I had the bright idea of stopping in walgreens on the way to pick up some pads.  I had packed my underwear with cloth diapers and believed that I wouldn't have another big gush.  We walked around the store for a few minutes.  It felt really weird to have the staff greet me while I was having a contraction.  The day seemed brighter, more vivid somehow... and the people just going about their ordinary business seemed out of place in my world that was changing so rapidly.  We were standing by the cold case looking at drinks when there was suddenly another uncontrollable gush of fluid.  It seemed to go on and on.  I grabbed Brians arm and said 'Shit shit shit shit' While I felt certain that there must be a puddle around my feet and I'd leave a trail of fluid when I tried to leave.  When the gush finished Brian checked me and there was no puddle, no river of amniotic fluid.  So we went to the cashier.  She looked at my belly and at me as I had a contraction and I said, 'We're having a baby today.'.  She wished us luck and congratulated us.  Then we went to the hospital. 

There was an elderly lady (I'm guessing a volunteer) working the welcoming desk.  She told me that someone else was being checked in and would I like to sit down... so I told her I didn't want to leave a puddle on the chair.  She said she usually had pads in her desk but that she had run out.  So she handed me a teeny tiny facecloth to sit on.  I felt really silly perched on the edge of the chair with this tiny square of cloth protecting the fake leather upholstery.  Unfortunately I am a typical Brit and hate to make life harder for other people. 

When we got back to triage the nurse hooked me up to the monitors and offered me juice.  I watched the contractions with interest.  They had definite peaks and were coming every 2-2.5 minutes.  They were painful but not too bad.  The sensation of fluid dripping out of me every time I moved or did anything was probably the hardest thing to get past.  When we potty train we're taught that that wet feeling is bad and it's hard to let it go and relax enough to just let it happen. 

After about 2 hours in triage the nurses who were going to take me to my labour room showed up.  The main nurse was called Debbie and she had an intern with her whose name I don't remember (sorry!).  They walked me down the corridor to Room 10, where I would spend the next 7 hours.  Debbie had this habit of opening her eyes really wide when she was talking to me which drew my attention to the spidery application of her mascara.  She had really pretty blue eyes and fair hair.  She was a great nurse and never broke eye contact when she was talking to me, even though I looked away plenty of times. 

Debbie brought me the birthing ball and Brian decided he would go to the canteen to find food.  Honestly, at this time the contractions were becoming so painful I didn't want him to leave me but I knew he was hungry so I told him to go.  I had always thought that I would want to move through the contractions to help with the pain but it started to get so bad that I became very insular and still during them. 

At about 2pm I decided I wanted the epidural.  Debbie had been on the phone with my OB and she suggested starting pitocin to try to get things moving faster.  I really wanted to avoid another cesarean and I thought this might be the best way.  Between feeling water coming out of me and the pain of the contractions I was unable to relax in between them. 

The epidural insertion was fine.  Brian didn't have to leave the room and the anesthesiologist was fairly gentle though he seemed to not believed me when I started to talk about my previous c-section and the pain relief I received.  At this point I was thinking that I would have a vaginal delivery so I just hoped that I wouldn't have to see him again. Something I never read about is how the epidural doesn't take effect right away.  It takes about 15 minutes for the pain relief to get to its maximum.  Once it got there I felt pretty good.  Debbie had me propped up on a pillow to help the epidural spread to both sides. 

At around 3PM I started to develop a slight fever and Penelope's heart rate was not coming down in between the contractions.  An oxygen mask was put over my face and I started to feel scared that a cesarean was going to happen.  I was shaking.  My Doctor showed up at some point in there and checked me to find I was at 6cm.  She suggested tylenol to see if that brought the fever down.  So I took the tylenol with the smallest amount of water possible just in case I needed a cesarean.  No one offered me ice or water anymore.  I felt like it was going to happen and there was nothing I could do about it.  I started to feel very scared and like I wanted to get up and run out of there.  Debbie raised the bed so I could sit and hopefully Penelope's head would put some pressure on my cervix.

My Doctor came back with the repeat c-section paperwork.  She put it on the table and I turned my head away from it while trying to suppress the tears I felt welling up inside me.  Brian said he knew I'd be devastated.  Everyone was talking about me like I wasn't there and with the oxygen mask over my face I felt as though I had been gagged, that I couldn't say anything at all. 

My Doctor decided to check me again at 4:15PM.  She smiled at Debbie as I watched them and told her 'she's a 10!'.  Maybe it would be ok. 
She told me most women push for at least an hour if not more with their first labours and she wouldn't let it go on for too long because Penelope's heart rate was still staying in the 180's.  I felt disconnected from everything at this point.  I still had the mask over my face.  They said with the next contraction I could try pushing.  When it came I pushed and my Doctor and Debbie both let out sounds of exclamation, with one push I had pushed Penelope's head all the way down the birth canal so it was peeking out of me.  When the contraction ended Debbie went to get the mirror so I could see.  The stupid mask was removed.  I was allowed to have ice!  It was going to happen!  I felt overwhelmed at this point because she was nearly here and I was going to birth her myself.  I became very internal.  My doctor left the room to talk to NICU and I pushed again with some more contractions.  Debbie knew when to call back my Doctor and in she came.  I was barely holding back sobs at this point.  I remember as she put on her blue outfit and the mask I felt so overwhelmed and excited.  I pushed two more times and the head came out.  I stopped pushing and started to cry, 'don't stop Sophie! One more push for her body, come on!' so I pushed once more and felt her slide out of me and she was placed on my chest.  I was crying, she was crying.  I stared at her and finally stopped sobbing enough to say hello.  She instantly stopped crying and opened her eyes to look at me.  It was magical!  After a little while NICU needed to look at her so they took her to the warmer and I lay back, so relieved.  My Doctor caught my eyes and I exhaled what felt like the breath I had been holding the entire day and smiled at her.  She said it was the best smile she'd seen me give for a while."

Ten minutes into the party and she already had beer spilled on her going out dress. At least in Kim's mind it was a going out dress. Her going-out-on-Friday-night clothes looked like everyone else's Wednesday afternoon clothes.    

Why did she let Angie and Dawn drag her to these things? Roommates were the worst part of college. She could be back at the dorm.     

Weekends were prime League of Legends time and she was certain her rank was going down with every stumbling drunk couple she passed in the hallway.
    
And her head hurt something fierce. Her roommates thought she'd been using the headaches as an excuse to be antisocial. They were so insistent that telling them that this was one of the worse ones yet. It wouldn't just sounded like a bigger, lame excuse.
    
The downstairs bathroom line was practically out the front door. Kim found her way upstairs to a second bathroom that reeked of vomit and possibly other body fluids she didn't want to think about.
    
There was a guy passed out in the shower, not the bathtub, the shower, door closed, his face smushed against the glass. Maybe he wanted to get away from the smell but still needed to crash.     

She checked herself in the mirror, the beer stain was larger than she though. A big wet, brown circle running down the front her top.    

Her head was throbbing. She checked the medicine cabinet for aspirin. The only bottles she found in there was for some mouthwash and Pepto Bismol. Did Pepto work on headaches?    

Another stain appeared on her hand while she was reading the label. A tiny red dot. She brought her hand up and it came back dripping with blood.    

She closed the cabinet. Her nose was bleeding. Her nose never bled.
She scrambled for something to wipe it on, realizing the bathroom had no towels or toilet paper. She ended up accidentally rubbing her nose on her sleeve before she thought twice about it.    

Once she saw the bloody streak on her shirt she felt a quick burst of anger rise up – why was she so awkward and stupid!?    

CRACK, the bathroom mirror broke. It didn't shatter but now there was a fracture crawling right up the center.  
What are the odds?  
She sat back onto the rim of the tub and reeled back when her hand came back wet.  
She didn't have to wonder about the smell anymore. It was very clear someone had left a stomach load of vomit in tub. The guy in the shower wasn't so dumb after all.  
Who's house was this anyway?

Eddie loved Jeff Struber's parties. Good music, good people, and a smoking hot brunette that was guiding his hand up her dress.     

Eddie had his eyes on her all semester. Angie he thought her name was. “Angie” wasn't a knockout, but she had firm tits and knew how to work a dress that was two sizes too small. She was only one of at least 12 chicks he had invited to the party, but she was the one he wanted.    

He also loved that it wasn't easy. This school was full of what he called Two Drink Minimums, get two cocktails in them and it was pretty much all good to go. “Angie” (maybe her name was Allie) could hold her liquor and had been surprisingly good to talk to. Eddie was the type of guy who liked a bit of tit for tat – it made him feel like his game was that much tighter. And he'd been on fire the last few months. His roommate Pete had given him this weird book all about the power of suggestion. Basically you believe and want something hard enough and the universe gives it to you. Pete was trying to use it land an internship at a tech startup. Eddie had been using it to get girls.
And if Angie/Allie wasn't proof of the power of suggestion he didn't know what was.     

He'd suggested they go to the backyard because there'd be fewer people. But when it ended up being just as crowded and he suggested they carry on anyway, she got to it. The girl was a 7 at best but she made out like she was earning payments into her 401(k). When the headaches started up, Eddie was annoyed at first, but he kept pushing through. Tequilla shots were usually enough to quiet them down. He'd been having more of them lately. Pete joked it was probably just his “eternal hangover.”    

*Please don't let my period start now.*    

Eddie heard her voice clear as day. Impossible because their lips were locked at the time, but it was unmistakably her voice. “What's that?” he asked. She gave him a confused look, then pulled him right back in for another cigarette-flavored kiss.    

-----
    
Angie and Dawn wouldn't answer their phones.    

Kim was a mess, too embarrassed to go back downstairs. Instead she was sitting, curled up on the hallway floor. Whenever someone came by she put her head down, pretending to be passed out.    

One or two nice guys asked if she was okay, but she was too embarrassed to look up. She gave them a nod, head buried between her knees and they moved on.    

She could still feel the headache. But at least the nose bleeds had stopped.    

Her phone buzzed – finally!  
But it was a text from her mom – random characters. Her mom was the queen of the butt text.  
A second buzz gave a little more hope, but it was just a Facebook update. Someone had released the new ranking rules, it'll be based on your current ELO and top ELO from the preseason. That was good to know. But she knew somewhere there was a kid in Korea practicing to kick her ass.    

She texted Dawn again – Where R U Guys? I think Angie is wit sum dude. I need -  
Another text from mom popped again in the middle of her typing. Kim cursed and her phone flew out of her hand, crashing into the far wall.      

Had she thrown it? She crawled over and picked it up, it was smashed to shit, the screen wouldn't even work.  
She hoped that crack in the wall where the phone hit had always been there...    

-------    

Eddie was downstairs pounding another cup of beer. His head was killing him.    

He'd lost track of Angie (Allie?...Alice?). Pete found him and asked what happened. Eddie lied and said he'd gotten a blowie.    

The truth was...he wasn't sure. Things just got weird. The more Eddie thought for her to do something, the more she did it. It was like she was reading his mind.    

But there was also an impression, not voice, just a really strong feeling – like he could tell she didn't really want to be doing this. He felt other notions to: he felt she wanted to quit smoking, she didn't want to be a finance major, her roommate with all the computer game shit kinda grossed her out. As they continued to kiss Eddie got a strong flash of an image of Angie/Allie/Alice, it was of him, standing at an altar at the end of an aisle, dressed in a tuxedo, then putting a ring on her finger.
Too weird! Eddie pulled back. He was gone before she could say anything.    

It was too crowded and loud down here. This was the fifth time they'd blasted that damn Drake song. The one song in the whole universe of top 40 hits he couldn't stand. And each time they played it everyone acted like it was the first time.    

Upstairs was a good plan. He hoped he wouldn't find a bunch of people rolling on mollies or something weird up there.    

------

    
“You okay?” She was leaning up against the wall. She tried to play it like she didn't notice, hard to do when you're the only two people in the hallway. “Huh? Yeah I just, I lost track of my friends. And my phone broke.” She showed him. It was more like a handful of crumpled parts than a phone.    

“I uh, I guess I dropped it.” She said, anticipating his question. “Who're your friends?” “You know Dawn and Angie?” “I know an Angie...I think.” “Did she have some guy's tongue and fingers meeting through opposite ends of her body?” Eddie felt a wave of embarrassment, he wasn't sure why. But that image of him sliding a ring on Angie's finger popped into his head again. “Uhh, nope nothing like that.” “Wasn't the same Angie then.”    

Who was this girl? He hadn't seen her at any of these things before. His head was starting to feel better. The idea that he'd stumbled across an untouched freshman excited him. It could have been the alcohol finally kicking in...better late than never.    

“Rough night?” He'd taken notice of the stains on her clothes. Kim had been angling away, hoping he wouldn't notice.   
 
She'd seen this guy around before. His name was Ed or Pete or something like that. She remembered Dawn gushing all over his Instagram one night. Kim didn't realize you could take pictures of your abs from so many different angles.     
   
“Just clumsy I guess,” she finally replied. “Lot of people down there.” “Yeah, that sort of thing tends to happen at parties.”   
 
He didn't know why he was so sure, but he was certain this chick was thinking about his abs. Dudes at the gym always said don't skip leg day – sound advice, but ab and core day was the work that got you laid. Just be nice, he thought.     
Be nice to her. She needs help. You can be the hero that swoops in and saves the day. She'll do a lot for that.     

Kim knew there was no reason to, but there was a warmth coming off of this guy, something alluring. Kim hoped deep down she wasn't a slave to Instagram abs like Dawn.    

“Something I can help with, you need a ride home maybe?” Say no, she thought. Just say you're fine and stay right here. You can sneak out when the party dies down.    

Tell her you'll walk her home, Eddie thought at the same time. It'll be like chivalry. Let her know you're a nice guy. 
“I mean we could just walk if you're not comfortable. Are you in one of the dorms?”  
Kim found herself stepping toward him. She hadn't even realized she'd started walking. He seemed like a nice guy. 
Eddie thought the girl was actually pretty cute. If you ignored the stains and the fact she was dressed like Old Navy was her favorite store, the girl was at least a 6. Sixes were totally doable. He wondered what her tits looked like.    

Kim was close to him now. Close enough to see those Instagram-famous abs poking through his shirt. Had she even said she would like a ride home? She couldn't remember.    

Her head was pounding. It was hard to think straight.  
She pressed against him. She wanted him to know what her tits felt like. Eddie smiled. It was always the quiet ones. She didn't protest when he took her hand and put it around his waist.  
She likes that, he thought. She likes guys that take charge. They all like that. Just make a move man.  
They pressed again the wall and for an instant Eddie felt like he knew a lot about this girl. He didn't mind the impressions this time. He felt impressions of a grey cat with white stripes, a woman butt-dialing someone?!...When he closed his eyes he saw flashes from some kinda video game.    

--------
    
“What's League of Legends?” he blurted out.  
Something snapped in Kim. How had she ended up in this position, up against the wall with this guy? Who was he?  
She'd had one drink downstairs. Had someone put something in it? Had this guy put something in it? It didn't seem plausible, but why else did her head hurt so much? Why was she so dizzy?  
No she, thought. She'd been warned about this sort of thing.This always happens at these kinds of parties.Who was this guy? This was Angie and Dawn's fault. Who's house was this?    

“Jeff Struber.” His answer surprised her. “You just asked whose house this was.”  
Had she asked? It didn't feel like she'd said anything.  
Kim thought about fighting. But he was so much bigger. If she did it might just make him angry...don't fight.  
Another sudden image came for Eddie – a flash, this girl naked, lying curled up on the floor, crying. Torn clothes on the floor. It hit him like a punch in the nose, Eddie stepped back.  
“What was? -” She wondered what he was doing. This was her chance, she had to call for help. Maybe someone would hear over the music. Someone would have to hear.  
He seemed as confused as she was. He was probably wasted. As soon as she thought about it she could smell the tequila and cigarettes. He took another step toward her.  
NO! Kim wanted to shout, but no words came. Instead the pressure in her head hit her like a lead pipe.  
Eddie had been punched in the stomach before. That's what it felt like. But he was certain the girl hadn't moved.  
It was only when he noticed her moving away from him that he looked and saw his feet floating up off the floor.  
It happened in slow motion first. It was like that moment on a roller coaster when you're teetering over the first big drop, waiting to go down.    

Then it hit him all at once. He flew back with a force that took his breath away. He hit the wall behind him and felt it give out, splintering around him. His feet dangled two feet off the floor.  
Then the wall gave out and crumpled. Eddie fell sideways, tumbling down the stairs.    

When Kim opened her eyes there was a hole in the wall across from her. No sign of the guy with the abs. The music had stopped. She could hear the yelling from downstairs. A few girls screaming. Guys yelling for someone to call 9-1-1.    

What happened?    

Kim moved to the top of the stairs. She saw the guy, lying at the bottom. The floor had cratered where he'd fallen. His knees were touching, but his feet were pointed in opposite directions. No way he was that flexible.    

He wasn't moving. There were guys standing over him calling his name – it was Eddie. They told him not to move, help was coming.  
Eddie saw her. The horrified look on her face. Her nose was bleeding. When did that happen?    

She came a few steps downstairs. Their eyes met for a moment, it seemed to frighten her. Or maybe he was really messed up. He couldn't move enough to tell. He couldn't feel anything but the hammering sensation in his head.    

He felt another impression before she disappeared back upstairs. She felt sorry. Why? This wasn't her fault It couldn't be. But what had happened? His head hurt too much to remember.    

...Kim. The thought hit him like he'd know it all his life. Her name was Kim.    "

Thank GOD my program starts tomorrow, I am so freekin bored! This morning I went on a small adventure to find breakfast as well as just see more of my area. I found a super market that's way closer than the one I went to yesterday and also found one of my favorite street food breakfast items. I'm not sure what the Chinese name for them is, so I just call them crunchy egg wraps. Tons of street vendors make them, all in their own unique way... However they all include at least a thin layer of cooked egg (it ends up lookin like a huge crepe) with these crunchy bread things and spicy jam (same thing I put on my noodles for lunch yesterday, did I mention this stuff is everywhere in China?)l mine included cilantro and also ginger I think. At some point I HAVE to make it over to the university, they have by far the best street food I've found in Shanghai.

I took my food back to the hotel and ate while screwing around on the internet, thankfully it's much faster than the last time I was here (still easily 10 times slower than any US internet I've been on). After I finished I sat out on my balcony and realized my hotel has a whole park for guests, there's even a really cool pool and gym. So I decided if I'm gonna be bored I may as we'll be bored and sexy, so off to the gym it was!

So the gym was a nice break from boredom, even if their equipment wasn't great... Point is it got the job done. I had to buy a swimming cap for the pool since I guess they don't want hair in the pool? I felt like it was a little redundant considering the amount of hair on my face...

After the gym it was back to my room for a shower. I was watching tennis when the front desk called me to let me know I needed to check out in about an hour, so I got ready to leave. Lucky for me, the hotel I was staying at for my internship was only about 2 blocks away so walking there was no problem. 

After checking in.... Holy crap is this room nice! Looks like I will have only one roommate as well considering this apartment only has two bedrooms. Since I was the first to check in, I snagged the big bedroom and got unpacked. Another thing to like about this place is that I have wifi and it's not too bad (again shit compared to almost anything in the US). So, I did some planning for places I want to go this weekend. There are some incredible museums in Shanghai and they are super cheep for students so I'll surely be hitting those up. I also want to make it down to ECNU (CSU's partner school) to find out when the CSU kids are getting there and also to eat my body weight in delicious street food and Muslim noodles!

Tonight there is a dinner for the interns where we will also get our SIM cards for our phones. I can't wait to see what other kinds of people will be interning with me. 

Damn were there a lot of cool people! My room mate is from CSU, but he's the only other person I've met from Colorado. There are a few British kids, one from Germany, and then another from Italy. Kind of as I expected, people are gravitating towards me because I speak Chinese. Last night we went to Nan Jing Dong Lu, the famous walking street in Shanghai. After that we attempted to walk down to the Bund. Unfortunately we ended up taking the most inefficient route there. What should have taken about 20 mins ended up taking over an hour! Since we took so long to get there, we ended up missing the last subway back to the hotel. Getting back was easy though because the taxis here are super easy. I'm pretty sure that once we all got back, we went right to bed from being so damn tired.

26u63a,1,2014-05-29,NDad still has financial control over me. Help me.,[deleted],raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/26u63a/ndad_still_has_financial_control_over_me_help_me/,"I just need to vent and see if there's anything that I can do. I'm not sure if I can say my dad's a full blown case of NPD but he has strong narcissistic traits.

I graduated college 6 months ago and my dad did all of my financial aid, which likely includes forging my signature on paperwork and god even knows what. He never discussed my financial situation with me even when I've asked.

I saved some money by being an RA. I didn't have a car until I was about to start my junior year of college so getting a job was not really an option because my father refused to let me take public transit and university transit went only to a very limited number of stores. I was unable to get an internship.

Now that I'm out of school I have a double major in psychology and Spanish in an area with a decent sized latino population. Well, it's been hard finding a job as you can imagine. I figured some businesses would take psych degrees and I could get my foot in the door in business but that hasn't happened. I did land a job which is in mental health and is 30 hours a week. Well, the job is extremely demanding and as you can imagine I'm barely getting by with the insane amount of time I put into this job. My job in mental health is finding people with disabilities jobs and things with that have been going really poor the last month or two because of a new manager and some really bad policies that are taking up our time.

So my dad is trying to get me to take a second job at a grocery store or something but my first job doesn't have a reliable schedule so it's not been easy to get a job like this because I don't have stable availability. I can't even find my client's jobs so how can I get a second job?

So I've been living with my mom (parents divorced) for the last six months and now the loan payments are coming in and I'm so stressed out. My dad didn't realize that he is 38K in the hole with MY student loans and just dropped this bomb on me 2-3 days ago. I also have my own 29K in my name. I stood up to him for the first time in my life
I had no idea my dad put himself in this kind of debt for my education. Why the hell did he not build me a college fund? He takes my stepmom on nice exotic vacations. I was supposed to housesit for him while he goes to Cancun or something next week. Now he's getting my stepbrother to do it because for whatever reason suddenly I'm not responsible to him. And he doesn't want me spending time with my boyfriend that I've been with a year and he supposedly likes alone. They're super conservative Christian parents. I really needed that week away from my family to de-stress and now he's taking it away from me as a punishment whether he admits it or not. I have no outlet for my stress. My boyfriend just graduated school and is in the unemployment boat himself but has a normal family.

Very obviously my father is stressed out because he did not manage my student loans well and never spoke to me about them. He still has financial control over my car and cell phone because I'm poor right now. He seems to think a job is just going to magically appear and it isn't. So now he's taking out his poor management of money onto me and driving me deeper into stress when I'm already stressed out about the fact that I can't find a full-time job, my job is unreliable and I don't even get paid for the amount I work, and I can't even get my clients jobs right now let alone me. So how do I survive? I'd take any job that's full time. I'd really like to work for the county but I don't have any connections. How do I make him stop taking his stress out on me and punishing me for standing up for myself to him for the first time in my life? My mother is just blindly following him on this and is talking about charging me rent on top of this horrible financial strain."

26u8nm,1,2014-05-29,SEO: Buyer Beware - How Can You Protect Your Business From an SEO Agent Who Just Wants Your Money,[deleted],SEO,https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/26u8nm/seo_buyer_beware_how_can_you_protect_your/,"SEO, or search engine optimization, has gained quite a reputation in the past decade or so.  Businesses turn to Internet marketing firms or SEO specialists to discuss how to advertise on the web.  In the early days of SEO, and for various reasons, there wasn't much consistency on how a business could advertise their products or services more than a competitor's while still retaining fairness to both companies.  Google seemed to be the great arbiter in all of this: as a result, SEOs devoted a lot of thought how to think like Google, and therefore maximize their SEO techniques.  As one might imagine, two camps emerged: those who played by the rules and within the parameters set by Google, and those who wanted to crack Google's algorithm and invest in fraudulent ""black hat"" techniques to game the system, gain notoriety, and look like heroes.

SEO: How It Works

If you think about it, businesses have a personality.  Look at their logo, or brand, and read some of their marketing material.  Immediately you'll determine whether the company is buttoned-up and conservative, or loose, friendly, or environmentally conscious.  This message is just as important as their logo, getting it wrong usually ends with with someone looking for another job.

SEO done right, works.  The first step is to work within the company's message. Determine what unique keywords set the business apart from the rest of the herd.  This sounds easy, but it's not.  A list of two word or longer keywords needs to be drawn up, analyzed with real world data, and reviewed to see how well it performs against competitors.  This process alone can take days to finalize.  Once completed, the company's website is ""optimized"" against these keywords.  In other words, steps are taken to improve the likelihood Google will find your site's homepage or subpage when a specific keyword is typed into the search engine.  Once completed, a variety of SEO strategies are implemented, some on social media, to encourage word of mouth, and entice users to visit the website.  The goal, of course, is once a user arrives at your website, they will ""convert"" into a client.

Where It All Starts To Go South

SEO firms make a lot of money.  As mentioned before, SEO takes a lot of time, hard work and effort to produce results; sometimes it is difficult to attribute an increase in business with a successful SEO campaign.  Regardless, there are always people who want to make a lot of money, get all of the credit, and do very little work.  

Meanwhile, businesses treat SEO agencies as they used to treat conventional advertising budgets: here's some money, make me popular, and trust I won't ask questions. Like most con-artists, SEO charlatans count on the fact you won't ask questions, won't supervise the SEO process reviewing all changes, won't address consequences, or hold the SEO agent accountable by backing up their promises and tasks in writing within the SEO contract.

Protect Yourself From SEO Charlatans &amp; Cover Your Ass

Never go into an SEO pre-sales review alone.  Make sure both participants are awake, engaged and can ask the SEO Agent the really hard questions.  

Don't be dazzled by impressive looking reports with data that isn't meaningful to you.  Make sure you understand everything and that the SEO agent takes their time, addressing your concerns along the way.

If it sounds like a promise, it probably is.  Protect yourself and have them put everything in writing in an SEO contract, including reasonable consequences and a clause to call the whole thing off, should that be necessary.  It should go without saying, review your SEO contract thoroughly before you sign it.

Your website should be attractive, engaging to users, and optimized for SEO.  Some SEO agents will try and ""think like a computer"" by ruining a website's aesthetics in favor of attracting users with SEO techniques and ugly calls to action ""above the fold"".  Never sacrifice your brand, your message, or your website for SEO. 

Website calls to action need to have a purpose.  The explanation why is your product or service is the best, the ""what's in it for your client"", has to come first and before the inducement to fill out a form.  No one is going to fill out a naked form without some kind of incentive.  Thirst always precedes the drink.   

Not all businesses have engaging word of mouth content.  Sure ""gulf oil rigs"" is a unique keyword that probably won't have a lot of competitors. An SEO agent dreams of such a viable keyword to capitalize on, but ask yourself: would you or a casual reader really read a blog with ""gulf oil rigs"" as its focus, even if that is your business?  SEO agents often miss the forest for the trees and are afraid to admit not all businesses are sexy.    

At its core, SEO is not that different from traditional advertising: it should inspire word-of-mouth while driving people to investigate and purchase your product or service offering.  If SEO fails to do that, it fails.  

For the right business, blogs can be wonderful arenas to let your hair down, discuss what you do, and engage visitors along the way.  If, however your blog is boring and no one is going to read it, don't let your SEO agent convince you to devote time and money toward its growth.  

If your SEO agency has a media consultant who writes your blogs, social media, or press releases, demand you meet them personally.  Ask to see their credentials and find out whether or not they will be writing your content 100% of the time.  Some SEO agencies outsource their content creation to high school interns or to overseas representatives.  Keep in mind you are signing over your entire business's message to someone else. Do you feel confident they will always have your best interests in mind, preserving your brand's integrity at all times? If they don't ask questions or seem indifferent to your brand, RUN.

Morally corrupt SEO agents will want to string you along, promising improvements, but never giving you the whole solution.  Though it is true SEO takes time and there are always things to improve, that is a far different situation from an SEO agent knowingly giving half-measures so you'll be a paying client longer. Know for sure which situation you are in.  Ask questions.
 
Ask what work was achieved to determine the list of keywords and why these keywords were selected in favor of others.  Some SEO agencies won't even devote the time or energy to develop a keyword list, opting instead to use the same boring, generic keywords as the business's competitors. Regardless, it is pointless to optimize a website's keywords if they perform poorly.     

Have the agent explain their entire SEO campaign vision from start to finish: how will they start, what will they do, how will they report their results, once completed, what will be the next step, and the step after that.  What SEO strategies will they use to draw clients to the website and convert?  If the SEO agent can't explain in simple English what steps they are going to do, there is probably a reason: they don't know or they are incompetent.  Either way, you should walk away.              

Make sure you're checking on all news articles, blog and social media posts, and SEO campaigns. Independently determine how well things are going and ask questions if you feel you don't understand. Take the SEO agency reports with a grain of salt, because sometimes SEO agencies will spin things in their favor to justify their existence.  Trust, but verify.

An increase in SEO performance does not necessarily equate to an increase in clients or revenue.  An SEO agent might maintain an increase in organic or PPC rankings from position 7 to position 5 will result in an increase of 25% new clients.  They will say, ""since you told me that each client is worth $500, you're going to be netting $5000 in no time and I've barely even gotten started!"".  Not true.

Don't forget, you have an existing client base.  Sometimes SEO agents will see conversions from users visiting the site and immediately take credit for their job well done.  In reality, repeat clients are merely coming in and using the website as they're supposed to.

Don't let the SEO agent overwhelm you with SEO technobabble.  Example: In pay per click campaigns, such as Adwords, there is something called CPC, or cost per click.  SEO agents tend to devote lots of discussion to the inexpensiveness of CPC, all while neglecting to mention CPC is determined by cost, or bid, divided by click, or searches.  If the bid amount is high and the client has a low ineffective budget, CPC becomes irrelevant as there are few to no clicks toward that specific keyword.  Moreover, the entire campaign will be confined to perform only to within the customer-defined budget.  If your Adwords or PPC discussion doesn't center around performance as a function of budget, you are probably not being given the entire story.

Google ""black hat SEO"" and familiarize yourself with these fraudulent industry techniques.  Constantly be on the lookout by ensuring the SEO agent isn't risking your business with these illegal SEO strategies. Buying followers for social media is very common."

26ue1c,43,2014-05-29,Possible negative correlation between alpha personality attributes and intelligence?,[deleted],TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/26ue1c/possible_negative_correlation_between_alpha/,"Just wanted to get some input from fellow redpillers... perhaps they have a better explanation. This is something I have consistently noticed throughout my life but have struggled to accept. It seems that an alpha personality is almost always accompanied by a lack of intelligence or more specifically analytical skills. I have yet to meet someone who possessed high degree of both of these attributes at the same time.

My observation mainly comes from working in a prestigious software corporation. My coworkers are the cream of the crop of this field (which is already mentally demanding). There is no place on earth with a higher concentration of beta men. Out of 100s of guys in their 20s not a single one has an attractive gf. The few times we get an attractive marketing intern, the beta attitude literally drips from everyone. The few guys that are slightly better off than others are serious under performers and are in easier roles.

Other thing I noticed is my personal inability to be analytical and alpha at the same time. Time and time again I have noticed that whenever I start to workout more, increase my risk tolerance and intentionally force myself to become more alpha... my job performance goes down. (despite the exact same amount of time devoted to it) My mind simply does not see the patterns as quickly and effectively and is no longer as creative at finding solutions. It's like I cannot afford to have a relaxed alpha attitude if I want to perform well in this line of work.

Anyone else feel the same way?"

I've (27M) been engaged with Sarah (33F, not her real name) for about two months. We've been together for about 7 years. We were roommates before we started dating and only lived apart for about 9 months while I was doing an internship out of college. Our families get along great and we rarely fight, but lately a few issues have become really apparent. 

I've begun to develop harsh criticisms of who she is (internally) and I'd appreciate Reddit's opinion on whether or not these criticisms and concerns are significant enough to call it off.

1. She doesn't exercise. I exercise a lot. I'm an active person. I'm not a gym rat, but I really enjoy walking, jogging, swimming, and playing soccer. She will go jogging with me occasionally, but she just doesn't have the drive. In recent years, I've noticed her ability to bike and hike with me has waned. She has always been a bit heavier, and I don't mind that, but her fitness is preventing us from enjoying the kinds of activities I'd like to do together.
2. Television... she watches SO much television. She typically gets home from work at 4PM and I get home around 7PM. She'll watch television 4 hours a day or more, and I really have no desire to do that. I like playing video games together, and I enjoy board games and reading with her. It really irks me how much she watches television. 
3. Sex. We were very active when we started dating. At least 5 times a week, but probably once a day. Nowadays, on average less than once a week. She shows no interest unless I get things going. Our sex life is gone.

I feel like these are really basic irreconcilable differences. I'm not the same person I was when we began dating 7 years ago. She isn't either. I believe we're both better people, and we'll continue to change in the future. I'm just not sure it's a wise decision to settle down with someone with whom I now share so little."

I got into fitness and a healthy lifestyle about 2 years ago and have seen awesome results from it.  Went from about 180 lbs down to 158 which was way too skinny for me, so I started eating more and working out even harder which brought me to a solid 175-180 last summer that I was so happy looking at the mirror at.

This past winter, I tried putting on more weight and bumped up to 190 without putting on too much fat and was still happy about my strength, physique, and overall health.  Then came finals.  I stressed, and basically didn't have anytime to go to the gym for 2-3 weeks.  I lost a lot of that mass I put on in the winter, and I pretty much went to a pudgy 190-195.

Now that school is over, I've been doing a lot better with eating and working out.  I go to the gym either 5 or 6 times a week and even though it is kind of discouraging to lose the strength I once had, it feels good knowing that I get to shoot for the goals and lifts I once had.

This past week, I started an internship which has me sitting behind a desk for 8 hours, 5 times a week.  I recalculated my calories and macro needs for this, but I'm still kind of scared that things aren't going to work out as planned.  Right now, I'm attempting to lose 1 pound a week until I get back down to 185 (currently 193).  I calculated I should be eating 2087 kcal, 221g Protein, 88g Fat, and 101g Carbs.

I was just wondering if anyone has any tips at the gym or things they do daily to try and combat their desk jobs.  Before this, I worked at places that kept me on my feet and walking all day.  Any help would be appreciated!  Thanks /r/fitness."

As the title says, I'm looking for help developing a financial plan for the future. 

I'm a 20 year old computer science major with 2 years left to go in my college career. College is mainly the source of all my worries, because I'm taking out about $30k a year in loans. (Federal and Sallie Mae.) My parents have promised to pay off the interest payments of all my loans until I get through college, and my grandfather also helps out with loan payments in exchange for good grades. 

When I'm in school, I work part time in the campus store which is more than enough to provide for food/entertainment costs. Generally, I'm very frugal and don't spend money often. (With the exception of food, obviously.)

This Summer, I am participating in study abroad, which kills any chance I have at an internship/summer job. I plan on looking for and working an internship next Summer, that will most likely be paid. My school also has a lot of job placement services that I will plan on using to get this internship and a job once I graduate.

However, financially, I don't have much of a plan. I would consider myself fairly ambitious in my financial goals - I would love to move into a condo/apartment with my SO (or my own house if luck somehow works out) ASAP after getting a good job, while still being able to pay off my debt in a timely manner. Added to this, I want to take responsibility for my health insurance/cell phone bill/car insurance once I get a good job.

As for my current finances/financial history, there's not too much to say. I have both a checking and savings account, but I have not started an emergency fund or anything yet. (It's not needed currently. I may start doing this within the next semester.) I know that my credit score is &gt;700, as I am very diligent in paying off my credit card after using it for ""bigger"" purchases. (This number is from a student loan document I received a few weeks ago.) 

Basically, what I'm asking for is advice - what can I do NOW to adequately prepare/buffer myself from my student debt repayments? "

It's at a large hospital and I'm assuming these scientists are really going to be the best of the best.

I have skimmed some papers and a lot of it talks about GWAS. From what I understand people with the disease are going to have certain SNPs compared to a control group that do not have the disease. You collect a lot of data that indicates which SNPs could be common among people with Crohn's and run some statistical tests to determine significance. From here you decide which SNPs are relevant  . Is this correct? Where do you go from there, once you know which SNPs are relevant?

What sort of lab procedures are undertaken in this sort of genetics lab? Do they take people's blood and extract DNA? How do you go from having a sample from a patient to finding out which SNPs they have, etc? 

I would really desperately love some help

PS. I am also going to be alternating between this lab and a skin disease genetics lab so any info there would be great too, although I imagine it's fairly similar.

26w9ii,3,2014-05-30,Transition from plates to membranes? [Structural],BananApocalypse,civilengineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/civilengineering/comments/26w9ii/transition_from_plates_to_membranes_structural/,"I'm a civil engineering student in a structural internship position. I'm currently about half way through my undergraduate program and still have a lot to learn. My question regards plates and membranes, and the differences between the two. I am quite familiar with beam theory and the bending properties of materials, but not so much with thinner, more flexible membranes.

For example, I am currently looking at very thin sheets of steel under a uniform wind load. In my original analysis, I looked at the effects of bending, for which the component clearly did not meet requirements (as expected). I calculated ridiculous deflection values and very high moments.

Now I know this is the incorrect approach, but I'm struggling to find resources to help me better understand the true behaviour. Looking at it from a 2-D perspective, I understand that the difference is analogous to the plate/beam, membrane/cable comparison. Is it true that the allowable flexure of a membrane allows it to act as a tension member instead of one experiencing bending? If so, how can I find/check the capacity given all geometric, material, and loading conditions?

Also, if the thickness of a plate was gradually decreased, is there a point at which it would no longer behave as a plate but instead a membrane? Or perhaps it can experience properties of both at once.

Thanks in advance, any help is appreciated.

Company Description
**eBay** was born over Labor Day weekend in 1995, when Pierre Omidyar, a computer programmer, wrote the code for an auction website that he ran from his home computer.

Today, Omidyar's hobby is known as eBay, the world's largest online marketplace - where practically anyone can sell practically anything at any time. It's an idea that BusinessWeek once called ""nothing less than a virtual, self-regulating global economy.""

With a presence in 39 markets, including the U.S., and approximately 84 million active users worldwide, eBay has changed the face of Internet commerce. In 2007, the total value of sold items on eBay's trading platforms was nearly $60 billion. This means that eBay users worldwide trade more than $1,900 worth of goods on the site every second.

The benefit to consumers is clear: eBay provides an open trading platform where the market determines the value of items that are sold. Over the years, the site has become a cultural barometer of sorts, providing a view into what objects consumers want most at any time.

Since its initial public offering in 1998, the company has continued to innovate and connect people - and not just through its marketplaces. Two critical acquisitions have made eBay Inc. a global leader in online payments and communications as well.

PayPal enables any individual or business with an email address to securely, easily and quickly send and receive payments online. Acquired by eBay Inc. in October 2002, PayPal builds on the existing financial infrastructure of bank accounts and credit cards and uses the world's most advanced proprietary fraud prevention systems to create a safe payment solution. Today, PayPal is a global leader in online payment solutions: It has 149 million registered users and is accepted by millions of merchants worldwide - on and off eBay. PayPal's Q1 2008 global total payment volume of $14.4 billion accounted for nearly 9 percent of worldwide eCommerce.

Acquired by eBay Inc. in October 2005, Skype is the world's fastest-growing Internet communication company that has revolutionized the way people talk online. With more than 309 million registered users as of early 2008, Skype allows people everywhere to make unlimited voice and video calls online for free using its software. Skype is available in 28 languages and is used in almost every country on Earth. This business unit generates revenue through its premium offerings, such as calls (using its software) made to and from landline and mobile phones; voicemail; call forwarding; and personalization, including ringtones and avatars. In addition to its presence on eBay, Skype has relationships with a growing network of hardware and software providers.

Other key acquisitions have strengthened eBay Inc.'s portfolio of ecommerce companies, including shopping.com, a pioneer in online comparison shopping; Stubhub, a leading online marketplace for the resale of event tickets; rent.com, the most visited online apartment listing service in the U.S.; StumbleUpon, an online solution that helps people discover and share content on the web; and market-leading online classifieds sites including LoQUo.com, Intoko, and Netherlands-based Marktplaats.nl. The company has also grown its classifieds business through Kijiji, which launched in the U.S. in 2007."

Have done a ton of research, but I think I am overwhelmed and I would like some advice from someone with lots of life and travel experience.  
  
My situation:  I am unskilled/unemployed (I do have a certain type of engineering degree, but I want to be an entrepreneur, not related to that field, so I say unskilled).  I am 32.  I have 1.2 million dollars in reserves from working for 11 years (also worked internships during college, and went to college on a big academic scholarship so most was payed for).  
  
I can fly for free (standby) anywhere that american airlines can fly (I am based in DFW).  
  
I am torn because most of all, I want to be an entrepreneur of some sort, and so I don't get excited about travel because I feel like I should be figuring out how to start a business and make money, since I am unemployed (I quit my job, I was not fired, I was actually highly esteemed and promoted within my company, it just wasn't what I wanted to do).  
  
I am wondering about maybe flying into Zurich or Madrid or London (they have a nonstop from dfw), but it seems like traveling around Europe can get pretty expensive.  I know places like Milan and Amsterdam are fun to see, but I don't even know how much fun I am going to have because I'm going to be worried about what I am doing with my life the whole time.  
  
Maybe I should forget about making a living for a couple months and just go travel and enjoy myself.  
  
I am wondering if maybe part of my drive has to do with my parent's expectations of me, and maybe that is not my expectation, and I need to find that out.  Maybe travel will help me get away from their reach, and help me figure things out on my own.  I am not sure.  
  
I feel so god damn confused right now, I have no one sane to talk to.  I don't know what to do for my next step, I don't know what is happening with my life.  I feel so overwhelmed, I am shaking while I am writing this.  
  
Which should be ridiculous because hey, I've got over a million dollars and I am only 32, I should feel good, right?  But I am scared that if I don't figure out a way to make more money that I'm just going to burn through this money, and then I will have to go back to my job, and quite honestly, I'm pretty sure I would rather be homeless.  And that's not a situation I would want to be in either.

26wx5q,1,2014-05-30,I'm a human doormat.,[deleted],confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/26wx5q/im_a_human_doormat/,"[Traditional]: 

As far back as I can remember, I've lived my life with the intention of making as little waves as possible. ""Go with the flow"" my steadfast mantra. ""Oh, don't worry about me"" my slogan, my brand name.

I was homeschooled until I was 12, and abruptly placed into the public school system. My Dad was never home, my Mom was always drunk. Drunk Mom wasn't a great teacher.

I never learned the fundamentals of arithmetic, nor the finer points of grammar (apologies), and quite a few other basic building blocks you're supposed to at least be exposed to by age 12. 

Naturally, I struggled quite a bit. To this day, basic arithmetic takes me about twice the time a normal person takes.. And don't even talk to me about fractions.. and to this day, my Mother will proclaim to the world, every chance she gets: ""I'm so proud that my children are doing so well as adults. I'm so glad I'm homeschooled them.""

And I'll nod and smile..


In High School, I wasn't the leanest kid on the block. And anyone who has been in High School knows that fat kid always gets it 20X worse than any nerd or freak out there (I use the word freak as a term of endearment. I'm quite freakish myself). Yes, I was feeling sorry for myself. Yes, I could have used their hate as motivation to better myself. Yes, I should have stood up for myself. But I never did. And I never do.

After High School, I thought my problems were over. My senior year was finished at a continuation school (I skipped over a bit, but I'll sum it up by saying I got into some trouble and had the hs credits of a freshman my senior year), where I met my fiancé. 

We (fiancé and I) moved out of state so I could attend a trade school in a field I was interested in. I came out of my shell there. I thrived there. I was a brand new person. I was going to school, working at possibly the coolest job an 18 year old could have, and the people I met at my school were all like-minded individuals who are, to this day, very close friends.


But then came time for me to finish up school and start my internship. I ended up going back home for practical reasons, but mostly I just missed my friends. I was struggling with finding a decent job, I bummed it with my current fiancé for a while.. but it ended up working out I went into business for myself and things were looking up financially, but my introversion became worse as I was now also working from home. I went full hermit, and have been for about 5 years. 

My fiancé cheated on me a 2 years ago. We'd been together 5 years at that point. She lied to me.. she got drunk with some guy, and there's no need to go into it from there, but it was messed up (didn't even make him wear a condom). She told me the next day, and apparently felt horrible.. of course, I was quick to forgive, and life went on. 

Then the panic attacks started. I guess all the years of built up frustration had to go somewhere.. And it reached capacity after that. 

A few months ago, a lady cut in front of me in line at a store. She didn't see me standing in line, because I was standing out of the way of the main aisle, as I didn't want to be in anyones way. Another woman in front of her said ""Excuse me, Ma'am. There's a gentleman right behind you who was here first."" the lady then whipped around at me and barked ""Well were you going to say anything?!"" I looked down and awkwardly murmured ""yeah, I just didn't notice you'd walked in front of me.""  bullshit. I saw her walk in front of me. I saw her carelessly waltz in the middle of the aisle without so much as a quick 180 to see if perhaps there were people who were avoiding cart collisions.. I wouldn't have said a damn thing and I would have hated HER for it. When it was MY cowardice that made HER feel like a jerk.  This sort of thing happens to me on a daily basis.


My Mom lives with me now. Moved in last year.. I have a 2 bedroom apt. This was meant to be a temporary situation, that turned into a permanent one. My office is now her bedroom. When I need to work, I sneak in quietly. She pays no rent. She's had and lost 6 jobs since she's been here. She has a lot of bills, and for the last year, I've been paying most of them. She was arrested for getting drunk and assaulting someone around new years. $1500 bail. No questions asked. Drove 3 hours to where she was and got her out. She never said thank you. She never said sorry for the trouble.
I just said ""I'm glad you're okay"" and left it alone.
 

The reason a 23 year old was able to handle all this crap, was because I'd finally reached a point in my career that was pure gold. My partner and I got a huge contract. I don't care to go into the details, but I was making a lot of money.. Waaay more than I needed, and so I was careless. My partner ended up renegotiating our contract when renewal was up. Turns out they were going over budget, and guess who was the odd man out? I did 90% of the work. He was DROPPED 3 months later because he was completely incompetent. He got what he had coming.. But I never told him off. I told him ""Well, maybe this is better. I was thinking about starting fresh anyway. And I thrive under stress afterall!""

So losing that contract actually was a harder blow than I thought it would be. You see, I'd become accustomed to a certain lifestyle that I could no longer afford suddenly.. I didn't save any money.. No safety net. The money I had was used up within a couple months.. And that brings us to about 3 months ago where I hit rock bottom and I'm basically back to minimum wage income status.

I'm going absolutely nuts this summer with boredom. 80% of my friends did not return home for summer break, what with either graduation or internships. The ones who are home are more ""fair weather"" friends and I want to use this opportunity to get to know some more people. 

I'm sure you want to know a little about me. I am 6'2"", thin, and incredibly attractive (or so my grandmother likes to tell me). I like to joke around and sometimes I may cross the line, but I have a pretty big conscience so if I ever feel like I did, I feel really bad. So (not so) deep down, I'm a nice guy.

I get along with just about everyone. I adapt really easily and I hate that period in time where you don't really know someone so it is a little awkward while you get to know them, so I usually tell people an embarrassing thing about myself and they tend to open up a lot faster. 

I enjoy long walks (not necessarily on the beach), rubbing a dog's belly, rollerblading, watching Netflix, eating peanut butter, and exploring town. I've never been kayaking but I really would like to sometime! 

To be honest, I don't know what I really want here. I'd ideally like a friend. Someone who wants to get out and do something so that the summer isn't quite so boring. I'm not at all opposed to letting it become a relationship, if that's what you are looking for, but I don't want to put pressure on that it HAS to be a relationship. 

At this point, I either have you hooked or you aren't interested. I'd love to swap numbers, meet for a drink or some food, and see if we click. We can text for awhile before meeting up, just to make sure we get along. But I'm a nice guy and I generally use correct grammar, so I think I have a lot of stuff going for me. We can swap pictures if you'd like as well, just let me know!"

As of today, May 30th, I have $4814.18 in consumer credit card debt. A lot of this debt I've racked up from school-related expenses, and cost of living during periods I was unemployed while at school (TWO businesses closed while I worked there...). Right now, I am working roughly 25 hours per week at $8.25 an hour as well as 25 hours a week for free (internship).

Next month, June, my monthly credit card payments and rent are going to cost me $705.17 and I'm only going to net about $575.00 after taxes from my retail job.

I'm considering selling off my only substantial asset in order to just pay off all my CC debt and finally be debt free. In September my parents bought me a new car after my beater was on its last leg. They paid $15,000 cash for a 2012 Toyota Corolla that now has almost 24,000 miles on it. 

Reddit, I think I should talk to my parents about selling the car, paying off my debt and buying a cheaper car with the remaining cash. Is this a good idea? The title is in my name and if I decide to sell it I have no clue where to even start. 

I'll take any advice you guys have. Thank you so much."

Mikko: Is very possible, my friend.

Is why, at Off The Rails, I take one worry off his mind. I defeat my friend James, I walk away as RWF Champion, James can get help he needs, without pressure of being champion!  Everyone happy.

Dawson: So you're saying you're going to beat James Harshaw... to save him?

Mikko: In a sense, yes.

Dawson: Well, that's one way to go.  Any final thoughts before we wrap this up?

I recently had the opportunity to facilitate a training for the Florida Council Against Sexual Violence Biennial Summit on “Awareness and Engagement” practices. I was very excited to come back to my home state and share the work we’ve been engaging in to help the 1 in 6 male survivors of childhood sexual abuse. It was the time I spent teaching violence-prevention education in a correctional facility in Florida that encouraged my focus on men. My personal excitement for coming home to Florida was in seeing my parents. I had not seen them since I moved to California over two years ago. Although our separation was due to work and  life changes, it was and continues to be a most difficult adjustment. I thank video calls (and my parent’s willingness to use technology) for the  gift of seeing their faces from 3000 miles away. Mother’s day, their recent 48th year anniversary and their presence at our training made the trip extra special (and emotional).

I didn’t realize how much my family didn’t know about me, our work or the movement to be inclusive of men. It is true for many of us in the service-provider fields, that our families are clueless about our work. We can blame ourselves for not explaining it enough times in detail, or the fact that they cut us off when they don’t want to “hear” more about the realities of sexual abuse and the subsequent need for research, awareness, prevention, policy and response.  I THOUGHT they knew, but I realized even my friends can’t really explain our work. Sometimes I feel like Chandler Bing from FRIENDS or Barney Stinson from HIMYM, “what do you actually do?” was an ongoing mystery in both sitcoms and the prevailing punchline. 

Do we really apply our awareness to our inner circle of friends and family?

I recall a keynote address by Dr. Dorothy J. Edwards author of the Green Dot Violence Prevention Strategy. She stated the same dismay about her own inner circle and their lack of awareness (and intervention). Dr. Edwards said that awareness and prevention should start with our own group of friends, family and neighbors. Ok, so you may not be able to get your 76-year-old parents to attend your workshop, but her point still makes sense. The more involved we are with the people closest to us, the more effective we can be in preventing sexual abuse and violence as a whole. 

After the training (and the exuding pride of my Colombian parents) I overheard my mother and father discussing what they thought needed to happen to encourage the public to acknowledge men as survivors of sexual abuse. Mom thought we needed to change the public “mentality” (to dispel myths and misconceptions that perpetuated barriers to disclosure and healing). My father said (in Spanish), “No se puede cambiar la mente de la gente” or “You can’t change a person’s mind, but it’s true, men need help too”. I realized what was happening: my parents were talking about strategic ways to address sexual violence. Holy smokes! We are starting a journey towards awareness! It was my turn to beam with pride. Two elder, Roman Catholic, working-class immigrants, from the mountains of Colombia were openly engaging in a rich conversation about abuse, and offering views on how to prevent, intervene and heal.   

To all the service providers and volunteers in the movement to end childhood sexual abuse and improve resources for the 19 million (and more) men dealing with it’s effects: keep teaching, keep talking, those closest to you are listening.

I have been seeing this guy since December, we met on an internship I was doing, he started texting me and we have been hanging out about once a week or so since then. Yes he is much older than me. Things have been good, we became exclusive last week or so, but due to the fact that my parents would probably kill me if they knew I was dating a guy of this age, I haven't told them or anyone really. we've pretty much just been enjoying each other, having great sex, hanging out, talking and getting to know each other. To my knowledge he hasn't really told anyone either for the same reason of the judgment. Maybe if we keep seeing each other I would tell people but in these early stages I haven't yet.

Anyway, fast forward to last night, we had a great night out, went to dinner, came back to his place and fell asleep--he was exhausted. So me, being drunk and not totally trusting him because I have my doubts why he would even hang out with a woman of my age, pick up his phone and start to look through the messages.

Please do not tell me I'm a horrible person, I know this is a huge huge huge privacy/trust issue, but I already didn't trust him to begin with, I just got that gut feeling. We have all done it at some point, I have had people go through my phone, honestly it doesn't bother me because I have nothing to hide.

So the last two people he texts are girls (WHILE he was on the date with me). I start reading through them and my jaw DROPS. I'm reading stuff the girls say like ""come cuddle, it's been too long"", ""I want to massage oil on your shoulders"", etc etc, I can't even remember some other stuff because my heart was beating so hard. He was calling them babe too (which he also calls me). This is way more than just friends. I'm not sure how recent or how often he texts these girls but it seems pretty often.

At this point I'm freaking out (and still pretty buzzed) so I wake him up and the idiot I am, I straight up ask him if he sexts other girls. He goes ""why are you asking this"" and I tell him that I don't trust him and I just have a gut feeling. (I put his phone back where it was). He says the only girl he is seeing is me (I'm pretty sure he just said ""seeing""). He asks if I went through his phone. I say no. He starts getting angry and long story short, tells me he was in a relationship with another girl before and she went through his phone and everything changed. I asked why everything changed, what does he have on his phone that he is hiding. He says he has pictures of naked girls... I'm like...why do you have pictures of naked girls... he says ""I don't know"". So then I ask him if I can go through his phone and hes like ""it'll change everything"" and he doesn't let me. I tell him I think he's ""sketchy as fuck."" At this point he gets up and starts getting dressed and tells me he's leaving (it's like 1am). I convince him not to leave but he tells me he doesn't trust me anymore since I don't trust him, and he goes on this spiel about how he doesn't really trust anyone, and I came in here and he told me stuff about his life, money, family, and I guess he trusted me a lot... or so he says.

I guess I don't know what these messages mean and I don't know what to even think or do now. Obviously I can't confront him about it because then it would be my fault for reading his texts. But I'm laying there thinking, ""how many other girls have you told the same exact shit to, how many other girls are you texting"". I'm pretty sure he's not SLEEPING with any others or even hanging out with them because I believe both of them live far away, but I'm assuming at one time this was happening. I guess I'm just ranting but I would really like to hear what you guys think. Sorry this was so long I'm just freaking out and I'm pretty heartbroken that I let myself get this close to him and now I find all this out. 





EDIT: so I asked him why he said It would change everything if I went through his phone and his response was ""it ruins trust that right now was apparently just starting with us, but when in a relationship for a long time, it puts trust to the test."" I don't even know what that means.

**tl;dr**: went through guys phone that i'm exclusive with, found some really sexual texts, lost all trust in him and now he says he doesn't trust me now, don't know what to do about it."
26ysan,9,2014-05-31,My [20F] asked for a break with me [20M] we've been dating for 18 months. Don't know how I should handle this.,advice_welcomed,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/26ysan/my_20f_asked_for_a_break_with_me_20m_weve_been/,"Long time lurker, throwaway for this. Sorry it's gonna be a long one

A little background - I've been dating my GF since January of 2013 and for the most part things were going good. I'm from a small town and lower middle class, She's from one of the biggest cities in the South and very well off, so while we didn't see eye to eye sometimes, we balanced each other out. This becomes important later.  

Here's where things get complicated. We both went home for the summer and I only got to see her maybe 2 or 3 times for that time. I also began having serious premature ejaculation issues out of nowhere. I went from lasting 15-20 minutes in bed, to maybe 2 at most. This starts making both of us angry since I didn't know how to deal with it and didn't want to accept that it was happening. 

So all of our sophomore year is either hit or miss, some great nights, a lot of average ones, and some where we go to bed together pissed but make up in the morning. All the while my PE continues, the bedroom becomes an issue and eventually sex dwindles to maybe once every two weeks, Causing more tension. 

So the past month we've been arguing a lot, neither of us are happy. This summer, I'm staying in my college town to take classes and work and she went back home to do an internship. About 4 hours from each other and she always has work on weekends so seeing her is complicated. This past weekend I went to see her for her birthday and stayed with her for a week. We got into a fight almost every other day. The night before I was suppose to leave, everything came to a head. 

I asked her what was the problem and what we need to do for it to work. She admitted that she was unhappy and that she didn't know if we would work. She said that the main issues were sex(she said she hadn't had an orgasm in months, something that still keeps me up at night) and that always fighting about our different financial upbringings and situations. She said that she's been thinking about a break for the summer and I asked not to do that and that just let us sleep on it for the night and talk about it in the morning since it was already 3 am. 

So in the morning we go at it again and she reiterates that she's hates the fact that she can't even enjoy sex anymore. And that she just needs time to figure herself out and find what makes her happy. I yielded and accepted but asked her if we could still talk. I know breaks don't usually work but I love this girl and I want to make it work. 

So here is my question. Do I ask for a set of rules for the break? Such as no hooking up/sex with anyone for both of us. And that we can occasionally talk. I don't want to shut her out of my life for 2 months and then think everything will work out. But I know that she's going to want to have sex with someone else to get her fill and I can't bear to think of that, I don't know if I can take her back after that (selfish I know). I just want to know what I should do to make it to where we can actually come out of this happy and together. 

I'm working on the issues from my end, getting back into shape, buying fleshlight stu after this paycheck comes in to fix my PE issues, and going onto anti-anxiety medication to fix my general anxiety issues (something I've struggled with for a while) And figuring out what I want in life. 

Tl:Dr - GF wants a break to figure herself out and I'm scared it won't work out later. Need advice on what to make of it.

So I am just wondering if I should ever bother to contact my ex again? I shall refer to him as J throughout this...

We got together new years eve 2012 (be picked me up from work and we went back to mine and kissed etc...) he didn't want a relationship but wanted it to just be us... then after a few months of me moaning I wanted to make it official we did... he didn't like the idea of having me as his gf on fb, I never met any of his friends, I only got invited to family events if his brothers gf was confirmed to come first... So that's all a great basis for my insecurities. 

I didn't know if he still did weed after I asked him to stop because it turned him into a complete arse hole! His choice to stop but I did ask him if he could and he said he had... Which turned out to be a lie at the end of our relationship his friend told me he had been smoking for a few months... great. I wouldn't have minded but the fact he lied is a bit shit and I was pretty open about him telling me and said I just didn't like how he acted when he was stoned and plus he smelt bad haha.

Anyway... So yes, we hung out slept together (too much) and I just didn't feel emotionally satisfied by him but yet I had fallen head over heals in love with this guy. We saw each other way too much as we lived together at uni (which is how we met). and it just got intense... anyway, summer came round and I started to become mentally ill with depression and anxiety pretty badly. I went to see CBT psychiatrist for a few months and felt really alone and sad. I cut all my hair off often wrongly screamed at him, ran off at night and behaved really quite badly. Which I feel shit for now but at the time was really at the stage where I'd end up doing something silly and hurting myself (not on purpose just out of being so messed up). SO I got through that and then a year had gone by... I was really insecure and always asking him if he looked at that girl and why? This is because my named A had cheated on me and I ended up getting beaten to near death more or less... I have memory loss from that night and it just messed my head up and I jumped into this relationship WAY too soon after and didn't give myself time to heal. Which was majorly unfair for J and I accept that and have on a million occasions apologised and genuinely felt guilty. 

My best friend said he wasn't there enough for me and handled the situations badly but I KNOW he cared and I feel bad for the fact he found me hard to deal with even though he tried very hard.

Anway so now to recently, I hadn't met his friends still... he was getting distant, not spending time with me... ignoring me more not turning up to dinner because 'i was annoying' and only visiting me for a 10 second shag a few times a week then leaving! I felt so used and crap and had tried to talk to him a few times about it but he just said I was causing problems every-time I tried too. 

All my friends had moved away from uni as they were older or dropped out... seriously, they all went. over 20 people! It was so shit! 

I was in my last year and had SO much work to do. I made a few new friends and saw them a lot, one girl in particular she was lovely but had worse relationship problems than we did which made mine worse in a way as I started to behave how she was to her bf... not well and like a brat.

BUT here you will be reading this as it is all my fault... so I am going to just discuss why I was like that and how my ex J behaved towards me.

So, I have had depression and anxiety medically diagnosed as pretty bad. I also have a hormone imbalance in my body resulting in higher testosterone which sucks! I have pills to fix the latter and recently after the break up with J went onto anti-depressant/anxiety tablets that work a treat!!!! I am back to myself now. 

My ex J never wanted to listen to my problems or how I felt and I really (obviously) needed to speak to someone like my bf... about them. I felt really alone and just wanted some form of fun and comfort at the same time. 

I asked him loads of we could go to the pub / bars meet his friends and hang out so he could spend time with them and me and I would get to see him and he could see his friends.

He would see his friends about 4/5 days (whole days) a week and me probably one.. I once asked him if we could see each other more and plan it better as it was airy fairy and I spent WAY too much time sitting about waiting for him or hanging on texts which he ignored. He said he saw me plenty and to stop moaning. 

Whenever I tried to talk to him about how crap I felt in our relationship and how it was he told me I was intense causing problems and to stop behaving like a child or he would leave me. I often asked him the same questions over and over... because of my mental anxiety and he got SO angry at me. so much so he got up and left quite regularly. I was never mad or anything in the last year I asked like I would ask someone to pass me butter or milk at a table. 

He also cancelled on me a lot or turned up VERY late to things or just didn't at all.. I found myself running after him a lot bare foot when he left in a huff, I also walked to his flat (in a city 10 min walk) at night 1am.... because he was angry at me... we usually had sex and he walked me home.

He also wrote a list of all my negatives and positives and told me if I didn't change my negatives he would leave me. 

My positives were 'you are pretty, fun spontaneous' whereas the negatives were 'you are intense, question me, behave badly and your feelings are wrong'...

basically I just felt really used and I had it three weeks ago. it was 7am in the morning and his flat mate was playing music REALLY loudly. it woke me up. I let it go for an hour... and said to my bf it was bugging me. He just told me to shut up and sleep but I REALLY can't. I didn't have any clothes on me but my bf did so I asked him to go and ask his flat mate to turn it off for me (flat of dudes) he didn't for ages so I asked him again and he finally did and came back and told me to get out so I threw water at him because he was being so insensitive and rude to me. 

I instantly regretted doing that and probably look like a crazy ass bitch to you all reading this but I really HAD it I was so sick of him pushing me about and not letting me have an opinion or ask him to do something for me so I decided to ask him to sort the music out and he proved my point of he never likes to do things I ask him to do, yet I make him breakfast, clean his bathroom... I do a lot for him yet he near the end of the relationship did literally nothing. That night he had offered to cook me dinner, WOW GREAT I was happy... he was offering to do this because he had cancelled on me the night before... even though I came back to uni from home specifically to see him...! GREAT. He cooked me a roast... all out of a packet too and I put it all on the trays and basically did it all. I was NOT impressed. 

There was a time he used to properly cook for me... ok he did this twice but I genuinely felt like we were improving in our relationship. 

SO everything in the last few weeks was shit.... It started to get good the last week before we broke up as I met his friends and stuff... but nope he just went totally weird. 

As you can see I blame myself for a lot of this and my psychiatrist said that it is not my fault and he has manipulated my thought process to assume feelings and opinions I had were A LIE. . . which she said is impossible... a lie is something you do purposefully whereas if I feel neglected or upset he said they were lies? 

Anyway... when we were happy we were REALLY happy and I loved him with all my heart.

I just needed to get all this out and hopefully someone somewhere will read though it all!

I am MUCH better now, I have lost my temper, I am chilled out... active doing things, seeing loads of friends I hadn't seen in ages because they are guys and I felt awkward seeing them before! I even got an amazing summer internship that pays SOOO WELL! SO I am happy now.... 

I just have this little niggling feeling that I miss him a little... that I don't know what his problems were and why he couldn't get over whatever he needed to get over and accept that I was mentally ill for 11 months of the relationship but got better.... he still blamed me and brought up stuff when I was really not well and said I do it on purpose which I REALLY do not... none of my ex's or friends ever experienced that and my best friend said she was SO worried about me and probably posted on reddit loads about it as she uses it!

Anyway I am single now and have been for nearly a month. I haven't spoken to him in a whole week now and he hasn't contacted me.

He has been on Whatsapp a few times clearly to see if I had messaged him as he didn't use it for anyone else (yes I sadly checked) but I am not going to contact him again because I just feel like I would be entering another manipulative sad relationship which I feel could have been great if he had accepted help. 

just to add... he never spoke about anything emotional... the relationship, his family friends NOTHING. I knew NOTHING about anything to do with him. I did ask! He also blamed me for his anger issues.

Anyway, look forward to replies :). Sorry for the dissertation of text.

26yzpn,2,2014-05-31,Getting to Cityplace from south Arlington?,peruisay,Dallas,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dallas/comments/26yzpn/getting_to_cityplace_from_south_arlington/,"Hey, everyone! I could really use some traffic tips:

I've got a summer internship with a firm at The Tower at Cityplace. I start at 8:00 AM weekday mornings, and so far that's meant leaving home by 6:40 AM. I can't help but feel like that's way, way too long and that I'm doing something wrong.

I live near I-20 and Bowen in Arlington, and I've tried taking George Bush, 161 and 480 and Loop 12 north to I-30. 161 is probably the best of the three. My GPS then suggests I take exit 44 to Beckley, take the new bridge onto Woodrow Rogers and 75 and then exit onto Haskell.

I think it's the last bit there that trips me up - I can get to downtown Dallas reasonably quickly, but there's always traffic downtown and having to drive straight through it isn't ideal.

Is there a better way to navigate downtown or any way to skip it completely? Back roads, other exits? Any and all suggestions are appreciated. Thanks!"
26z00g,27,2014-05-31,"Going to start learning vim, pretty overwhelmed!",babyhands1,vim,https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/26z00g/going_to_start_learning_vim_pretty_overwhelmed/,"Hey guys! So I am going through the vimtutor right now and I am pretty overwhelmed. I am starting an internship writing in php (never written in php) and I have to as well learn the cakePHP framework, so learning vim on top of this is kinda overwhelming. I know as a computer science student, and as a programmer, there will never be a time where I am NOT learning about new things, so I know learning vim will never be super convenient. 

This being said, I know learning vim will make me a more efficient programmer in the long run, so I am willing to put in the time and effort to become proficient at it! I do, however, have a couple questions:

First: Coming from eclipse, sublime text, etc, I have grown fond of a couple things. First is that they automatically indent the code for me. I think this is installed by default in vim? Another is that whenever I type an open parenthesis, bracket, or brace, the editor will automatically close it and put my cursor in the middle. How do I get this up and running in vim? The next is color/code highlighting. I know vivify lets me set all that up, and I will just google how to install that. So I guess I am just wondering how I get the auto-paren/bracket/brace setup (and if auto-indent isn't installed how do I get it installed)? 

Second: There seems to be an infinite amount to learn, and it seems overwhelming! How do you guys manage a slow steady amount of learning while still being productive? 

Third: I am really going to miss not having a file manager+tabs at my finger tips. It makes opening up new files and working with multiple files so easily. I understand the terminal is a file manager, but it isn't quite the same as having a file opened and being able to click on multiple files and open them in new tabs. How do you guys deal with this?

Thanks for all of your future help! "

Now, at 26, I am stuck in a dead end job and still live with my parents",justanotherfailure99,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/26z6ym/i_had_delusions_of_becoming_a_billionaire_when_i/,"I still remember like it was yesterday... I was 10 and got asked by one of my teachers what I wanted to be when I grew up. I naively said ""a billionaire"". True, I had no clue how to become a billionaire, but that was my dream. By 20, my goal was to become a millionaire, and by 30, a billionaire. I started reading a whole load of business, entrepreneurship and investing books from a young age. I wanted to invest in stocks early but I had no money. I couldn't get a loan from my parents because they said investing was too risky and it was all just ""luck and random chance""; the same as gambling. They said that I should have more realistic dreams like becoming a doctor, lawyer or an engineer. Because no one in my school had any interest in entrepreneurship or investing, I naturally obeyed my parents and started concentrating in getting into a good university. I still kept up my interest in business, entrepreneurship and investing, though it was more of a hobby now. Time went by and I got my bachelors in science. I couldn't secure any entry level jobs or even internships because the job market was so competitive. I was also still under the delusion that I could become a billionaire and beat the 9 - 5 rat race everyone was stuck in, so I applied for a Masters to buy more time. 

It took me a while to figure out that getting a job required networking with people, so I started to go to dozens of career fairs during my Masters. But even careers fairs didn't get me anywhere. All the employers at the stands ever did was tell me about their application process if I was interested once I got through the huge queues... Because careers fairs were so crowded, I couldn't connect with anyone because the employers had ""heard it all before""... I was no star candidate or prince charming that all these companies were looking for.

After I finished my Masters, I was back to square one. I tried to understand how I couldn't become a billionaire, let alone a millionaire at aged 22. Most of the people I hung around with hit it big with either their startups or securing 6 figure salaries in their FIRST TIME jobs. I was confused. I couldn't understand why I couldn't hit it big aswell. I couldn't understand why I couldn't get a graduate level job either after my Masters. Months went by and my parents started to get really annoyed with me wasting my time around the house so they told me to get any job.

I came across mainstream news articles on the web by people saying ""think you'll get a job with a Degree? Tough. You are no different to a high school dropout"", or ""be happy with any job you get, even if you hate it in this job market"". All this negativity by even the mainstream media started to get me really depressed and demotivated to do anything. It made me feel completely worthless. I felt betrayed. All those years of hard work at school, college and graduate school were for nothing.  All those years of reading several investing and business books were for nothing because they did fuck all to tell me ""if you follow steps 1 - 10, you'll get x results guarenteed"". Everything I ever did was pointless because I didn't gain any hard measurable skills or master anything at all. I had no competitive edge. I was not good at anything at all. I was just like everyone else... 

The only jobs I could get were low paying menial ones after I discarded my entire education history. So I started doing odd jobs and kept a low profile as i didn't want anyone to find out I had a frikkin Masters in Science. I did some volunteering but still they were of no help. I couldn't connect with anyone at work because they acted so happy all the time for no apparent reason. Volunteering actually gave me the creeps but I still forced myself to do it for a while to see where it would go. 

Eventually, I got myself a job in the big city, but it was one I hated to the core. The pay was just over minimum wage, so I normally work 12 hours a day to get shitty overtime. People kept telling me its better than nothing, so I stuck to it. I hate everyone here but I still work my ass off to not get myself fired. Even though I know I'm just a little bitch and data monkey with no hope of ever moving up the ladder, I am still doing this shitty job 4 years I graduated with my Masters.

Because my parents are still generous, they allow me to live with them because rent in the big city is just fucking criminal. I come back late at home in an overcrowed train with thoughts I want to kill everyone in there because I often have some other guy's armpit pressed on my face. During the weekends, I sometimes take bus or train trips to literally nowhere and come back home late at night, trying to figure out what would make me happy, because nothing does anymore. My dreams are pretty much shattered because I didn't know how to achieve them in the first place.

How pathetic...but what can I do. I would be too selfish to kill myself, so I have to keep living a pointless and unfulfilling life.

If I could go back in time to when I was 10, I would slap myself on the face for having such silly dreams. Dreams do NOTHING but bring delusions because reality is a fucking bitch, and then you die anyway.

Its too late to do anything now as I have no motivation to do anything at all. Even if I had any motivation, I still wouldn't know what to do with it...

26zabp,6,2014-05-31,"Moving to the UK next week, wondering the best way to bring money.",[deleted],UKPersonalFinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/UKPersonalFinance/comments/26zabp/moving_to_the_uk_next_week_wondering_the_best_way/,"Hey there, been lurking for a while and hope this is at least relevant!

So I'm an Irish guy moving over to Cambridge next week to start a year long internship and am trying to sort out my money situation. 

From looking around a bit I think I'm going to end up setting up a new bank account in the UK, probably something like a [FlexDirect from Nationwide](http://www.nationwide.co.uk/products/current-accounts/landing-page/flexdirect?cmpid=Aggregators_205#~).


I have a bank account over here in Ireland, with about €3,000 in it. I was wondering mainly about what some of the best options might be for bringing it across? 
Usually for small amounts I would probably be just using my debit card at cash points for getting money, but I would assume I'm getting hit with at least some bad conversion rates if not additional fees (I'm not really sure).  As it is a bit of a bigger amount I'm trying to make an effort to not get screwed.


Would something as simple as withdrawing cash at my bank, bringing it across and simply opening the account with that money(euros) be an option? I don't have any experience with bank transfers or anything, but I guess once I have the new account set up I could transfer it across to the new account? (I'm not sure how complicated this would be with myself out of the country).


Any ideas would be awesome as I'm fairly clueless at this point! =)"

If not does someone have one that they would be willing to share? The developer day machine is x64 which I can't run unfortunately.  I'd prefer 11g but 12 would be good as well.
26zh3y,0,2014-05-31,Roughly $1200 Gaming Pc,pcthrowaway35,buildapcforme,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcforme/comments/26zh3y/roughly_1200_gaming_pc/,"* What will you be doing with this PC? Be as specific as possible, and include specific games or programs you will be using. 

I've always console gamed and I'm making the switch. I'm hoping this will kind of be the ""last pc you buy for awhile"" kind of thing. I got a well paid summer internship so I'm going to sell my xbone and but the cash into this build. Since I'm used to console gaming I've never had to worry about whether or not I can run a game. So something that can run most games that would be on console would be perfect.

* What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes? 

I'm looking to spend about $1200. Its not exactly a very strict budget though.

* When do you plan on building/buying the PC? 

My goal is to complete it by the end of the summer. I'm starting so early so that I can keep an eye out for sales during the summer as my paychecks come in. 

* What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc) 

I've always been a mac guy so I need literally everything. I would enjoy a double monitor setup so I know this could push it more to about $1500. You can leave the keyboard and mouse out since that is highly opinionated.  

* Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location? 

US PA and yes, I can drive to a microcenter.

* If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated. 

N/a

* Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU? 

Probably not

* Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc) 

Not particularly. 

* Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components? 

Be creative! Try not to make it crazy gimmicky please. (Giant black tower with tons of red flashing lights or something like that) That's not what I'm looking for. Something simple.

* Do you need a copy of Windows 7 or 8.1 included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference for one or the other?  

No I do not

* Extra info if required:

Thank you in advance, I know you guys work very hard for complete strangers!"
