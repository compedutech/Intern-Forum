1diidx,1,2013-05-01,I [24F] ruined my relationship with now-ex [20M] through depression. Need advice.,clichethrow,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1diidx/i_24f_ruined_my_relationship_with_nowex_20m/,"Cross-post for r/relationships. I apologize, but there's a bit of a long story here. Maybe I just need to get it out to feel better about it. Throwaway, because he and a bunch of mutual friends are redditors and I don't want them to see what's going on.

I [24F] met my now-ex [20M] (I'll refer to him as T) in December 2011, and have dated him for about a year and a half. I had just returned to school to finish up my degree after a 3-year hiatus, and had joined the school's car club, which he was a part of. I wasn't aware of his age (18 at the time), because he was so mature and even looked older. His age initially made me shy away, but it quickly became apparent that age wouldn't be an issue between us. The beginning of our relationship was full of cliche's. Pretty much love at first sight. Out of the dozens of long- and short-term relationships I've had, I've honestly never felt this way about anyone.

Our relationship progressed quickly, but at the end of the school year, we acquired internships 700 miles apart. We began a long-distance relationship, which continued to be just as fantastic as being together in person. We saw each other every other weekend, went on trips together on weekends, and overall things were just wonderful. Then, we returned to school and things started to go downhill.

Things began to go wrong for me the day I returned to my college town. I moved into a new apartment with a girl I hadn't seen in years, and it was immediately apparent that it would be a terrible living situation: my car broke down and my computer broke. My field requires a LOT of computer work, most of which can't be done in labs due to open hours and software needed, and I was living 20 minutes from campus. Needless to say, I was stressed.

T returned to school about a week after I did, and immediately offered his nearly-on-campus apartment up to me. I began my last year of school taking 6 classes where we're only supposed to take 3, so I'd be able to graduate this spring. He supported me, cared for me, listened to me when I was so stressed I thought I'd break, and continued to be his amazing self. I know I couldn't have made it through without him.

On top of the stress from the broken car and computer, I was stressed about money and family problems. My savings quickly dwindled, and I wasn't able to replace anything. I had worked full-time in my very well-paying field for 3 years during my educational hiatus, and still had all of the bills associated: car loan payments, insurance, cell phone, credit card (used to pay tuition the year before), rent, gas/electric, internet, etc. My savings quickly dwindled, and soon I had nothing left for food. T completely supported me for 3 months.

I began having issues with my parents as well: my mother is severely bi-polar, and often takes it out on me with every type of abuse possible. She stole what little money I had from an old account that still had her name on it. She was fired from her job, and expects me to take care of her after I graduate. My father, always physically and emotionally distant, finally decided that he hated my mother so much (they went through a horrible divorce when I was 2) that he couldn’t stand even seeing my physical resemblance to her. He hated talking to me, because I never had anything positive to report on. He decided he no longer wanted a relationship with me since I was “done growing up” and wanted to cut the cord.

All of this added together put me in a very dark emotional place. I poured myself into the work for my classes, holding onto the light at the end of the tunnel: graduation. I stopped putting an effort into my relationships, especially with T. I experienced all of the classic signs of depression (except for sleeping - I had to go with only 4 hours of sleep a night for 6 months to just get my school work done). T did everything for me, and I did very little for him. I acknowledged this, and tried harder to do even little things for him to make him happy, but he never appreciated anything. He never tried to understand what I was going through, and instead chastised me for having so many bills and not working.

Around February, after I'd barely passed two quarters of 6 classes with the most difficult course work I’ve ever encountered, things began to turn around for me. I had slowly bought enough parts to build a new computer, and had slowly bought the parts for my car, with the meager scholarship money I was receiving. I was able to become more independent again, but the routine of seeing T all the time stuck with me. I would go out with other friends about once a week, and went back to my own apartment more often. I began to notice that he'd stopped doing anything with anyone else aside from me, so I tried to encourage him to go out on his own with his friends more often. This is where things went bad.

T eventually became cold and closed off. He began accusing me of lying and cheating, saying he needed more and more space, and I no longer saw the man I'd been so in love with. He often claimed I didn’t care about him, and was just using him. Every attempt to discuss the issue was shot down; no matter how I tried to talk to him about things, he'd immediately get defensive, then start attacking me. I went from being a calm, rational, understanding individual, to a highly emotional cry-ball. T would be sweet and caring again one minute, then snapping at me the next for seemingly no reason. I kept trying harder and harder to make T happy, which seemed to only push him away more.

Things finally came to a head a few weeks ago, the day after his birthday. I'd got him a gift that I thought was really thoughtful and appropriate for him, and he didn't like it. I just looked at him, and said ""You want this to be over, don't you."" He agreed. Lots of crying on my part, lots of him saying this had all been a mistake and he never loved me.

I immediately took this break up as a time for self-reflection. I thought about everything that’s happened and changed in the past year, and realized that I’ve been severely depressed. I lost everything he and I loved/respected about myself, and withdrew from everything except my coursework. I’ve spent this time working on turning things around for myself, mainly by working out, eating healthy, and spending time with the friends I’ve been out of touch with this year. My course load has been easier this quarter, and I’m finally set to graduate in two weeks and have a VERY good job lined up in our college town. I’m starting to feel happy again, and realized I went almost 6 months without a moment of true happiness.

For the past few weeks, nothing has really changed between us. We're still having amazing sex, he'll cuddle with me when we sit down to watch a movie, and I drive him everywhere he needs to go as my car is (mostly) fixed now and his is broken. We spend the night together, go out to dinner together, and continue to be active in our mutual hobbies together. I’ve been helping him with his work, as his field is very similar to mine and I know a lot of the programming languages he’s learning. He'll be sweet and friendly one minute, then yelling at me and telling me to leave him alone the next.

I guess the point of all this story is that I want him back. I don’t want him back right now, or like it was for only the last couple months of our relationship. I want him back after I’ve fully regained myself and my independence, which I’m already close to. I want the old him back, who I still see every now and then. I see it when we’re out with mutual friends, or doing the things we love together. I’ve always closely followed this subreddit, and know that people tend to just say “you’re not right together, move on”, but this is different. I’ve never met anyone whose personality and interests so closely align with mine. Whose values and goals are so exactly matched.

My question is, how do I get him to talk about/understand what’s happened? Any attempts to communicate are shot down, with him suddenly shoving me out the door. I don’t want to fight, or argue, or beg; just explain to him that the girl he loved so much took a brief hiatus due to the stress that’s accrued from this year. He “doesn’t believe in depression”, even though I can see signs that he’s experienced it himself this year. I want to start over and go slow. Has anyone experienced this, or have any advice to give? I really need it right about now. Thanks for reading if you made it all the way through this.

TL;DR - Had a completely awesome boyfriend. Got depressed and screwed up. Want him back once I’ve fully corrected this.

I have an internship this summer in Massachusetts and will be living in New Hampshire (internship is on the state line).  I haven't traveled extensively in either one, but my whole fiance's family is from Boston, so we have a good support network.  Money is going to be tight for a bit, as I'm only working part time and he doesn't start his job for a few weeks.  We will be living together for the duration of the summer.  We're both from the Atlanta area, and will be driving the 17 hours up there.

*If anyone knows of good priced farmer's markets or csa farm shares in the New Hampshire/Massachusetts state line area, let me know!*

**THE BIG QUESTIONS**

1. I'm going to have to bring (cheaper) whatever cooking equipment I need, or buy it up there (more expensive) and haul it back (annoying).  I have access to soup pots, a wok, frying pans, etc that I can borrow from my family.  I do most of my own cooking in a wok.

2. My fiance is a very picky eater, but is getting better.  He has the metabolism of a ADHD bunny on meth, the lucky bastard, so he's skinny while eating all of this.  He likes burgers, sandwiches (meat and cheese), pizza, chicken fingers, hot dogs, grilled cheese, bagels, and general bread.  While some of the meat I don't have control over, if anyone knows of good, cheap ways to make these yourself or if it's easier to get them at a grocery store, you're my favorite person.

3.  How the hell do I put all of this together into a shopping list and meal plan?  I'm 22, and have never shopped for two before.  I'm hoping to make a once or twice a week trip only.  That's the bit that feels most overwhelming.

Thank you so much!  I'll be happy to answer any questions or clarify anything I muddled."

Depression has a nasty habit of making me underestimate myself. Things I said I could never do eventually start to get done. Boundaries are pushed and I just keep going.

I'm just looking for emotional validation. I've stopped talking to my parents about a lot of this stuff. They mean well by telling me I can do it, but that's not the problem. I know I can do it, it's just that it's tremendously difficult to keep going day after day. And they aren't brushing off my depression, but at the same time, as cliche as it gets, they just have trouble grasping how I feel.  

I just got an internship at a data center. It's gonna be good for job experience, but it just feels like an obligation. Maybe I'm expecting too much. During the interview the guy asked me why I wanted to work there. At that moment I realized that I just didn't have any passion for this. And because I'm paranoid as fuck I'm worried he'll see this and fire me, but fuck it. I think the only thing I really enjoy is solving problems, I'm just really good at sitting down and not leaving until I fix something. Despite possibly going into the IT field, I don't fit that tech stereotype where they love computers and technology. I just happen to be good at fixing issues with computers. It's just been a natural talent and I figured I'd foster that talent. 

I don't know anymore. I just feel like I keep doing things because I have to, not because I want to and it bothers me. I'm driven by a survival instinct, but I don't really feel alive. 

If anybody has any similar situations or stories to share I'd appreciate it. It always helps hearing somebody else talk about their experiences.

1dhfkc,10,2013-05-01,I've thought long and hard about whether or not I should post here... I guess now's the time.,iiRockpuppy,MyLittleSupportGroup,https://www.reddit.com/r/MyLittleSupportGroup/comments/1dhfkc/ive_thought_long_and_hard_about_whether_or_not_i/,"I feel as though I have serious issues. Like I'm a retard, and that's just who I am. And I'll never learn and I'll never be good enough for my family, at least not for an extended period of time. Not enough.

All my mom talks about is how good I used to be. When we still lived in Pennsylvania before my dad destroyed my mom's family business and we - me, my mom, my brother, and my sister and dog and all our possessions - were forced to move away from the shame our father brought upon our family to New York. My father was a drunk and never god the jewelry repairs done and even sold some of people's jewelry that they asked to get work done on. My mom was a fool to protect him and she suffered a harmful blow when he blamed her. So we moved away.

When we first moved up to NY, it was a very difficult change. The new house was much smaller and we had to put a lot of our stuff that we didn't have room for into the barn out back used as storage. When spring came around, the snow melted and the water rushed down from the hill right behind the barn and destroyed most of our possessions. The house was bad enough, with the toilet water dripping down from the ceiling whenever we flushed the upstairs toilet, and the water recking of sulfer. It was very hard for all of us after that. 

The public school right up the road was extremely different. I was only 5th grade and I had to go to middle school up here. I still had 2 more years until middle school back in PA. People were assholes and there was one point I was asked if I was gay because there was this kid by himself at a lunch table and looked like he was crying so I came over and tried to comfort him. So, that led to my mom taking me out of there to a new private school 32 miles away that we couldn't get a bus too. So now, with the money being spent on the new private school and gas money to get me there, it's even harder for us.

Meanwhile, my dad decides to get sober for his own health... like he couldn't have done it when we needed him to do it. When he still had the business and we begged him to. No, he decides to go to AA after we ove up here, and even finds a new woman there, which is against one of their rules. One of the biggest rules there is to not get into a relationship with someone at AA... but he always gets his way. So while he's got his new girlfriend, we're still struggling. Child support doesn't even pay completely for the gas that gets me to my school. We're (me and my brother) scheduled to meet with my dad every third weekend of the month, and he would cancel sometimes so he could be with his girlfriend. Or sometimes even, we'd come down and he'd drop us off at my cousin's house so he could go ""work"". Needless to say, I was constantly neglected.

Fast forward 5 years, present day (or year, I should say), life went on... things were still hard as ever. We've moved into a new house, much better even though it's got problems. Now, we can't afford the private school I've so desperately held onto and made friends at and I have to go back to the public school... they're all still assholes, and now that I like ponies, even more people think I'm gay.... Now, my dad's gotten married to that cunt girlfriend that distracted him from us. That same cunt girlfriend who threatened my mom when my sister back down to PA for Thanksgiving and told my sister, ""I can make your mom disappear!"" and attempted to do so by sending a letter to the police in Albany.

But my mom's got a job now, catering for films. Which is great, because I love film and sometimes I help. But it doesn't pay enough, we're still struggling. But it's definitely not as bad as it was in the old house. At least I have a computer and an internship at a computer store. At least I had a Wii and 3DS. At least I was in a school and there was food in the house. At least I still had the brony community and tons of great pony gear and other interests around me to shelter myself with when things got bad.

The beginning of the school year and I'm not doing a god damn thing, no school work being done at all and just goofing off everyday after school to the computer store and play video games. I am praying everyday that I might return to my private school with all my friends and the laid back life and easy grades because all my teachers respected and loved me... 2 quarters later, there's no sign of me going back and I'm failing. I actually quit my ""internship"" at the computer store because I realize my boss is an huge liar and steals money from people, charging a refurbished computer for the full price of a new one. He even did it to me, when I got my MacBook. Which was intended for movie editing, which I did next to nothing on and just played video games instead and reddit.

I was really fucking up my life very slowly, and then it all came crashing down in a split second. I was damaging my entire family's life because of the private school. And when I didn't have what I wanted, I got angry. Two months ago, I took it out, physically, on my own mother, the one who made everything happen for me... I wish I could have been taking it out on my dad. But my mom acted as the punching bag. And I'm ashamed of that everyday... And I'm reminded of that directly from her. And that angers me even more. And you can imagine why! Who would want to take it out on their mother? Who would want to take it out on anybody other than the one who dealt you all the pain and heart ache? I'm reminded from her almost everyday of what I did and keep doing and it doesn't stop.

Everything started falling apart after that. After getting my computer taken away, my connections at my private school were lost, and the video games and... my whole world that I sheltered myself in when things got bad. I had no communication and I lost all my friends. I had no way to relax... and I thought I would get everything back after getting my grades back up, because the computer was a distraction from my school work which kept piling up, but after it didn't happen. That's not all it took to redeem myself. She told me, ""There was no agreement like that."" And I feel like a retard for not understanding that... because my objectives are clear to me but I can't follow through. 

Three weeks ago, my opportunity to get back to my private school was taken away because I didn't do chores. I went upstairs and took my anger out on myself. I ripped up everything My Little Pony related I owned. Everything: posters I bought at bronycon, cards, figurines with autographed boxes, magnets, buttons, t-shirts... I threw it all away.

My 3DS ended up getting chewed up by our new puppy. There was a film camp my mom would've worked to get me too and I got that taken away because I was caught on the computer using her limited internet. Just yesterday, my mom threw the Wii out the window and I went out there I smashed it to pieces. You want to know why? Because she keeps telling me ""I was wasting my life with that *stupid pony shit*."" The only thing that made me happy and I was wasting my life with all ""that *stupid pony shit*.""

And I'm still reminded of it from her... **I don't need to be reminded of it. Because everyday I wake up and see the damage I've done. Me beating her, my 3DS and Wii now gone, my** ***""stupid pony shit""*** **is all GONE. I'm so ashamed of myself and I wasted so much of my life watching everything I owned being destroyed.**

...I guess I was wrong. I didn't have everything, I never did. And I don't feel like killing myself or anything stupid, I just want a way to turn my life around. I've realized my faults and I try to control my anger and try to do everything right but... nothing works.... Nothing I try works anymore. It's too hard for my mom to work around my rage issues because she doesn't have anybody else supporting her. So if she can't work with me, trying to make things better and control my rage, should I even bother? I've got job now and I do all my school work... and now I have nothing to ""distract me"" so I can do my chores. No computer, no video games, no ""*stupid pony shit*."" What the hell else should she expect from me? I'm only 16 and I know I'm going to need to mature but god dammit I DIDN'T HAVE CHILDHOOD BECAUSE OF MY FATHER. **I am mature.** I have people tell me that all the fucking time. SHE even has people because she tells me. But she never says anything like that about me. I can manage when I'm old enough, when I'll have a license and a car. But right now, I can't be the man of the house. I can't control my rage, I can't do it myself... 

What do I do? I still believe in friendship and tolerance, but it's too much for me... I can't do it myself, and I know I'm alone. I can't get friends at this new school, I've tried. Nobody in my life is willing to help me now because of what I've done... but I've realized my actions were hurtful and I'm trying to redeem myself, but so much gets in the way... and now that I don't have anything... what the hell am I fighting for?

**Edit** - I won't be able respond to anything, I don't know when my mom will be back... Until then, I suppose."

Personally, I'm looking for a more modern look.

I'm on a fairly strict budget, though I hope to upgrade after this summer.  After reading through some threads, I noticed that the Allen Edmonds are often recommended, not a bad looking pair of shoes in my opinion, though I'm looking for something a bit more modern.  After looking through Zappos' selections I picked these out:

So I locked in an internship for the summer and want to get a decent watch to wear there. I have been looking at this Stuhrling, I really like it's look.

[Thar she blows](http://www.stuhrling.com/Mens/Classic/Cuvette/492.33152.html)

The description says it's mechnical, but it doesn't say automatic or hand-winding. Does this mean it's quartz?

Also, it this a decent beginner's watch for the price? I really like it's look, also looking at an Orient Esteem(?) 

I'm also considering just saving up a few days pay and getting something like a Seagull 1963 or Tissot Le Locle."

Most of the Cedarville stereotypes don't apply to me.  I'm pretty chill and spend my spare time gaming or on the internet.  I don't need much, just a room or whatever.  I do have a cat, although I can find alternate summer housing for my cat if that's a dealbreaker."

(USA)",[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1dkxa8/partiallypaid_9k_in_student_loans_want_to_plan/,"Sup. Okay my story isn't a massive mess like some of the horror stories from some Drexel students, but I don't want to fall flat on my face in another ugly mess.

I applied for University of Nebraska and took 2 years of Computer Engineering and received an out-of-state scholarship that required me to maintain a 3.0 GPA and I received it despite having a 24/36 ACT score. Yeah here comes the part that sucks: After two years and a 3.8 GPA in Computer Engineering later, I have to transfer to the bigger University (relatives are trading me around, basically). I walk in there and they drop my scholarship from both schools because all of a sudden that ACT score matters now and apparently I couldn't retake the ACT to acquire the scholarship a second time.

Yup. I'm a victim of shitty standardized tests despite having a fantastic performance record under a program overseeing students in a high-demand, hard-working field. I don't understand it, either. The saddest song in the world stopped playing last year. I've been poutin' it like a manbaby at Wal-Mart as a cashier and I've had enough of that, I wanna make a man outta myself, already.

OK so girlfriend lives in Pennsylvania and is willing to room with me, and I'm sitting here in Texas with my folks. There are two possibilities, both include having to live on my own. I could go to a university in Texas and support myself entirely (+ roommates) or I could hoof it to PA and numbercrunch some logistics until my girl and I are confident with living together. One sounds better, and she urges me to go to Drexel but hold up I see those horror stories about the hundreds of thousands in debt fuck that shit with a full ten foot volleyball net pole bye

A good number of my basics are complete + a couple of engineering courses and lab experience is under the belt. I like the idea of moving to PA. Got about $1000 in personal savings atm, so this is a months-in-advance kind of scheme. This is a plan, mind, so I'm gonna be saving up a bit more, tell my friend I'm not buying shit anymore, I'm a poor ass sucker, etc.

First of all, I need another good TX/PA school that won't rip me to shreds with debt, if not help maintain a sensible total accrued. I am not gonna get a decent computer job with the low level of experience I have, and I have memorized those fucking tomato codes so damn much (I HATE the tomatoes) I barely remember how to code in Java. I'm gonna start researching internships and companies based around the areas, plus start snatching up scholarships.

I'm self-employed, too, music production, so taxes can be kinda rough on me. I'll be looking through other threads to figure out how I'm gonna get used to living poor and not spending everything I own like a dummy. Anything else I should be sticking my nose in?"

A PhD has been sort of a pipe dream for me; I've always wanted to be a professor along side a public office position or a research job with a thinktank/etc.  

I just feel completely underqualified and fear the unknown.  I'm working on getting my 6th internship next fall, as well as start my thesis in August.  I lived in D.C. for a semester abroad and worked in a think-tank, I currently have a 3.8 GPA in Poli-Sci classes and an overall 3.6 (Hopefully getting that up)

I just feel like I don't have the necessary experience/knowledge to get into a PhD program and succeed.

Any advice?"
1dkq9e,5,2013-05-02,"I graduate in two weeks. Exams are almost over (and I'm doing well), but I'm still having panic attacks about graduating. For the first time in my life, I have nothing planned.

I had nowhere else to go. Unfortunately, my grandmother and a close friend cosigned for these loans, and I need/want their names off as soon as possible. My school's financial aid office misrepresented many things to me; the difficulty of removing a cosigner was among them. 

I know; I know. Another (soon-to-be) unemployed English major who should have chose STEM or business.

I've won awards for my writing, and my grades are fairly solid. (3.81, as of this post.) I have a great deal of work experience. Of this, most notable is my two year internship at the world's biggest research institution, where I did technical and grant writing. I actually wrote the training guide used to instruct new researchers on a massive project. For the past year, I've worked for my university in one of their offices and as a research assistant for one of my professors. 

I'm at a crossroads. I want to take the exams to get my certification to teach as something to fall back on (I should have done this sooner), and I've been applying for technical writing jobs. Unfortunately, the sequester has hit my area hard. My mother's a professional tech writer who encouraged me towards the field, and even she admits that it's pretty barren these days. 

I've been applying for jobs left and right, and I've received few responses except for a few who seemed to lose interest once they learn I'm not graduating for a few more weeks. Public schools in my area won't look at me without my certification; I haven't even seen any paraprofessional jobs open up. Private schools are pretty promising, and I have a few leads but they won't know anything certain until the end of the school year. My internship isn't hiring. Again, budget cuts. 

Things have gotten better lately, so I shouldn't feel so stressed. My grades are fine. I've lost thirty pounds since January, and I plan to only intensify my weight loss journey once school is done. I've found an affordable room to rent upon graduation with people I care about. I've stayed with them in the past, and I know the rhythms of their household. I most likely have a part-time job I can start in a few weeks if I choose. I should be getting my license within the next week or two. (I failed on Tuesday based on my back wheel being two inches too far from the curb while parallel parking. Sigh.) 

Things are looking up, and I know the job market is tough with thousands of applicants graduating from college this May. Still, I really want stability. 

This morning, I woke up thinking about joining the armed forces, especially the Air Force. Health insurance, room and board, and steady income is a huge draw for me. With a degree, I can become an officer; I know the training/candidate schools are selective when it comes to college degrees, but I don't know how selective they are. I need to lose more weight, but I'm confident that I can continue to make progress on that front. Before I started college, I know I could meet the requirements for women easily; I just need to get back to that point.

My Sallie Mae loans are gathering massive amounts of interest, sending out job applications is making me feel worthless, and I don't really know what to do.

Do you have any advice? Or: ask me about my time as a semi-homeless college student! "
1dkhw1,12,2013-05-02,I was the victim of a mugging/attempted sexual assualt.,bradysaysblerg,MMFB,https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/1dkhw1/i_was_the_victim_of_a_muggingattempted_sexual/,"I was mugged on Friday night. I was leaving a bar in the West Village at 1:30, walking uptown to get a cab back to queens. I took a right and immediately got pushed into a wall. He kissed me and started groping me grabbing my wallet from my pocket and phone from my hand in the process. He said “ I’m gonna fuck you right here.” The initial shock wore off and I managed to push past him and run. I got into the first empty cab I saw and told the driver my destination. We started moving and I said “..I think I got attacked.” He pulled over and told me to get out. I started running again and got to another cab. We got to 50th street and I realized that I must have dozed off. I felt my pockets and realized I didn’t have anything. I said something to the cab driver about how my wallet was gone and I had no money. At this point I was in shock or denial or something. Almost like I had forgotten what happened entirely. My first thought was that I left my stuff at the last bar or in the first cab. The cab driver said “You can’t pay me?! Well you’re going to jail. If you don’t pay me you’re going to jail.” I started crying and as soon as we stopped I got out and ran. I ran as far and fast as I could until I had to stop to throw up on the sidewalk. At this point I realized my jacket was gone and I convinced myself that I left my wallet and phone in the pockets. I started walking back downtown in the direction of the bar. On the way I ran into 2 police officers. I told them my stuff was missing and I had no idea where it went. Being inebriated, I stumbled a bit and their tone shifted immediately from somewhat concerned to condescending. They told me to revisit the places I went that night in the morning and I decided to keep walking. A while later I made it back to the nearly empty bar on Christopher and 7th. My jacket was on the back of the chair I had been sitting in, the pockets empty. I told the bartender that my stuff was gone. I had no idea where it was and didn’t know if I left it in my jacket pocket or in a cab, completely blocking out the fact that I had been a victim of an attack. She saw how hard I was freaking out, gave me the bars phone number and hope that someone picked up my stuff by mistake and would return it as well as $20 to get home. I was sitting on the N train looking out the window with tears in my eyes when it hit me that I had been attacked. I made it back to my place around 5am. My roommate let me borrow her phone to call my mom and I told her what happened, her knee jerk reaction was to be angry at me for drinking and then she started canceling my phone service and credit cards. I passed out on my bed in tears and woke up to my sister handing me a bagel and explaining what I needed to do to get my life back together for the last week of my internship with no money or phone in New York City.


To the Bartender who gave me money to get home:
You saved my ass. Neither of us had any idea what was going on and you offered me support when I needed it the most. I hope you like those cupcakes that I dropped off when I returned the money. I would have waited for your shift to start but just being in the same neighborhood, I was having a panic attack, and could barely breathe when I told the bartender the story.


To Stand-Up Comedian Jen Kirkman and her manager:
Saturday evening I had tickets to see Jen Kirkman preform at the Bellhouse. Having no way to prove I was 21 I assumed I wouldn’t be allowed in. It was a stroke of insane, you being in the same restaurant as me when I met my sister and her roommate for dinner before the show. You were really confused when I walked over and said “I hate that I’m being this person….. but I’m huge fan and I was wondering if you could sign my book.” You immediately smiled and said of course. I told you I wasn’t sure if I would be able to get into your show since I had been mugged. Your agent promised me she’d get me in. You wrote “Brady, Nobody better steal this book! XOXO Jen Kirkman” and gave me a hug before you left. I got into the show and when you were doing the impression of your mom, everything that was happening in my head was gone. When you asked two guys under 25 onstage, I sprinted up. You gave me a hug, seeming genuinely excited that I got in. You’re a good person, Jen Kirkman.


To the police officers who took my report last night:
I get it, I waited a long time to file. It makes your life harder, but maybe for one second consider that I’m freaking out and that sympathy might be in order. I don’t know what the right way to approach the situation and remain professional was, but I do know that you saying “So you almost got raped and waited 5 days to tell us?” was not the right fucking thing to do. It took everything I had to not just say fuck you and go back inside my house. You don’t fucking understand the kind of effect that has on person? That maybe berating me isn’t the way to go? That the shame and disgust and anger and embarrassment and sadness I’m feeling isn’t enough? You have to pile another load of guilt on my shoulders? What is wrong with you? I was finally in a place where I felt comfortable and sure enough in what events actually occurred that I was willing to tell an authority about it, but all of the strength I confidence I had rebuilt over the last 5 days vanished in an instant. I’m the kind of person that rationalizes behavior “well maybe they’re having a bad day or they just lost their phone or something” NO. You don’t deserve that. You made the victim feel like shit and are therefore doing it wrong. I regret reporting the sexual assault that was committed against me because it would have saved me a panic attack and a sleepless night if I hadn’t spoken to you on Wednesday. 


To my long distance boyfriend:
All I wanted was to be held after it happened. You are a few states away and when I see you on Monday, you promised to console me as much as you could. I want to apologize for piling all my shit on you. I was already a little broken coming into this situation and when I was attacked, I shattered. I hurt a whole fuck ton and I don’t know how to make it hurt less. I don’t know what the fuck it is that hurts but it’s unbearable and I can’t reconcile it with myself. Thank you for trying. I love you so much… you deserve a lot better than me, but the fact that you are here and waiting patiently for me to get back so you can hold me and tell me everything is alright, means everything and is the only thing I need right now. You’re one of the best things that ever happened to me. 


To my family:
My family is a constant source of support. I’m famous among you guys for solving problems before they are problems, but I don’t have a solution for this one and when I really need you, you’re here. Thank you. 
To everyone at work who offered help should I need anything: 
I’m basically a stranger to most of you and the amount of support and concern I was offered was incredible. You are all good people and help me restore faith in humanity


To my best friend in the world:
You have no idea how much you helped. Commending me for getting away and for being brave enough to talk about it. Reminding me about the great things in my life and telling how happy you are that I’m part of yours, talking about how your former mentor now has a lot to teach you. I love you. I’m so glad that you’re still in my life, that you love me, and are excited for my success and happiness, that being 6000 miles away hasn’t changed our relationship, and that you were the first one I came out to. I wouldn’t have rather told anyone else.


So reddit make me feel better, in the last 6 days I met the worst and best of humanity. How the fuck do I move past this? How do I make the panic attacks stop? What about this is hurting me so much? I didn’t even know what was happening when it happened. I do I defend myself if it happens again when I’m fighting against something that I am oblivious to? I just fucking need someone to tell me what to next.  

TL;DR: What the fuck do I do now?"
1dkhoz,2,2013-05-02,"""Taking space"" from SO (23/M) of roughly 3.5 years is causing me to be depressed (22/F). Lots of text, but I really could use some help.",[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1dkhoz/taking_space_from_so_23m_of_roughly_35_years_is/,"I'm sorry for the wall of text, but I just cannot explain how I feel now without giving all of our background. I'm leaving out a lot of details just because I do not want to broadcast every bit of our relationship. I just really need some help. There is a TL;DR at the end if you just scroll down one mile.

My (ex)boyfriend and I have had a lot of problems. All of these problems stemmed from a decision he made when we first starting dating to not tell me something. He told me this thing two years into our relationship. At the time, what he told me absolutely crushed me. Now, it doesn't bother me at all. 

After he opened up to me about what he had been hiding, things just got bad. We fought on and off for about a year. I resented him so much for lying to me and not being as empathetic as I needed him to be. We were stuck in a really shitty situation because of his roommates that caused more stress on our relationship. We fought and fought and eventually, after a few months of knowing his secret, he decided he needed to take some time to think about our relationship. 

That, the idea of losing him, immediately made me change my ways. I wanted to let go of the resentment and I wanted to stop holding the situation in which we had no control against him. I did a pretty decent job of it, but really I was just suppressing my hurt. More than anything, I just wanted us to live up to our potential to be the happy couple we used to be. We used to be the couple that every other couple envied and that all of our single friends wanted to find a relationship like. 

We were happy for a while, but eventually my passive aggressiveness and his frustration from not finding a job (he was graduating) got the best of both of us. He took his stress out on me and I took my hurt out on him again. We started fighting again, but not nearly as bad as before.

Summer came and I had an internship near his home town. He still hadn't found a job so he moved him, which was about 30 minutes away from my new apartment. This was the lowest point of our relationship. I had moved on from my hurt and pain, but I still resented him for a lot of reasons. I never felt appreciated. Especially over this summer. I had helped him through and been there for him through a lot of problems; this was over two and a half years into our relationship at this point. He took his stress from being jobless out on me completely. He did a lot wrong that summer and I was heartbroken. Eventually, it got so bad that I had to break up with him completely. I don't really want to go into detail about any of it, but I really had no choice on staying with him or not. 

We broke up but it wasn't ever really like we broke up. We stopped hanging out, but we talked nearly every day and still spoke to each other like we loved each other. He got incredibly jealous at this point and then did something that made me cut him off completely for a while. A few weeks later, he had a job an hour away from my hometown now. I moved back home to go back to school. We met up because we just missed each other. It was great, until the end of it when he went through my phone while I was in the bathroom. He found some stuff out he did not want to or need to find out. Stuff that happened while we were apart. We got into a terrible fight. We decided it wasn't the time to think about getting back together.

I've never been very strong when it comes to being the one that decides to take space. I always fail within a day or two. I continued to talk to him even though we were broken up. We didn't talk everyday, but we did talk at least probably three times a week. I wanted to get back with him, but I was so hurt from how thing went the past summer. I was heartbroken. Once he started his job, he completely turned himself around. He took responsibility for his actions and grew up a lot. But I just acted single. I was going out every single weekend, which is something I'd never done before. I was meeting guys, talking to guys, and even hooking up with them. But I continued talking to him. I'm not proud of how I treated him. I regret it and would change it in a heartbeat if I could. I led him on for a long time. The semester went on like this the entire time. Eventually January came and he told me he just couldn't do it anymore. He needed to move on. I didn't argue. I didn't fight it. I knew he needed to. We weren't close anymore and we hardly talked. 

I tried to move on and he did too. For a month we had nothing to do with each other. It was the longest we'd ever gone without talking. I couldn't move on though. Instead of liking him less and less, I love and appreciated him more and more than I ever had before. With each conversation I had, even with my closest friends, I started to realize how perfect for me he really is. I missed him a lot.

I ended up calling him. He answered and we felt the same way. We both wanted to meet up and talk and just fucking hang out like we used to. We met up the next day. Everything was great. It was so good seeing him. All the stupid bullshit just immediately left me. I was over every negative feeling I had just because I missed him. Leaving his apartment that night was probably the happiest I've ever been in my life. I really mean that. 

We started dating again and both eventually cut off those distractions we had started talking to while we were apart. We really started to change. Our relationship had made a completely make over. That was until the first night we drank together. We went to a restaurant and had a couple drinks. 

He ended up getting a little drunk and his jealousies immediately came to the surface. He started asking about different guys. We got into another fight. We took a day or two to cool down, something we had never really both agreed to do. That was the best thing we could've done. We both saw that it was stupid and moved on. 

After about two months, we considered each other boyfriend and girlfriend again. We were back together and better than ever. We finally sat down and talked about the semester immediately after we broke up for the first time. I started to see how bad I had hurt him. I felt horrible and insanely guilty. I ended up telling him about everything that I had done while we were ""apart."" He needed to know since we were talking the whole way through. I did not cheat on him, but again, I definitely led him on. Just typing that feels like a kick in the stomach. 

He was mad, obviously. But he told me he wasn't going to break up with me. A couple days later, we hung out again for the first time. Things didn't go well. We didn't fight, but there was tension. 

He was supposed to move back to my hometown to go back to college. He was going to start moving his stuff back here last Saturday. His plan was to drop off his UHaul at his friends and then come spend the evening with me. He got to my house, we went back to my room, and he broke up with me. 

He said he's just really mad at me right now and he just really needs some time to move on from that anger. He also told me he's moving back to his mom's house and he's leaving tonight. He's moved four hours away. I was hearbroken and completely in shock. I'm still kind of in shock five days later. We aren't going to speak for four weeks. No talking whatsoever. 

We are most definitely going to get back together. He just needs time to get rid of his anger so he isn't just taking it out on me. He said that if he doesn't get a chance to let go of this anger, he's going to act on it and eventually it will drive us into the ground all over again. I understand that completely. That's what I did that drove us to break up in the first place. 

We plan to fully get back together at the end of summer, if not before. I completely believe him. We still love each other very much. We still want to be with each other forever. We had, before I told him everything I did while we were apart, been in the best place of our entire relationship. I loved him more than I ever had and in a way I never had before. We had both made very obvious changes. All of our problems at first came from a petty, immature, and prideful place. Since then, we've both moved away from that. 

I really love him. But it's hard to go through this. He's doing it for us. He's not doing it for himself. He wants to be with me right now just as bad as I want to be with him, but he knows it won't work in the long run if we get together now. It'll just be a short lived try. This is for the better of our relationship.

It's hard to keep that in mind all the time. I'm still just really sad from how he left. I'm devastated. Really, he probably did everything in the best way possible. I'm just really lonely. I lost that person I can talk to about everything. I know I'll get it back, but right now it's really hard. I'm finished with classes so I have nothing to do everyday. I am going to get a job. But right now, I'm even too sad to go out and talk to people about getting one. My two closest friends are busy. One of them lives a few hours away. My other is a school teacher here, so she's busy most of the day. I live with my mother, but she's at work all day. I'm just alone. I have plans for this evening, but still. I've spent most of this week alone. I'm crying for hours each day. Or screaming and yelling in frustration. I don't want to leave my bed. I don't want to do anything. I know once I find a job, it'll be easier because I'll have something to do. Something to look forward to. I've looked into volunteering, but I cannot find anything that's actually going on this month. I'm just really fucking lonely and it's making it hard. 

I know this is the right thing. I know it'll be worth it in a month or at the end of summer, when he moves back. It's just hard to keep sight of that all the time. I don't really know what to do.

Typing everything out, getting it out of my head, has made me feel so much better. It's reminded me that this is the right thing. It's the first mature move we've ever made in our relationship. But it SUCKS. I guess I just want to know if anyone had had any sort of similar experience and how they made it through. I just need some positive and uplifting words. Some encouragement. I know this is right and I know, from the bottom of my heart, that we will be very happy together, but right now, we have to spend time apart. 

**TL;DR** My (kind of ex)boyfriend and I have had a lot of problems based coming from pettiness, immaturity and pride. We've finally moved past that, but now he needs some space to move on from his current anger so he doesn't let his resentment run us into the ground. It'll probably be the best thing we've ever done for our relationship, but I'm still incredibly sad and feel hopeless. I miss him a lot and am trying to find ways to fill up my free time. I just want some encouragement from anyone that's been in the same position. Thank you!"

1dkavz,1,2013-05-02,Any advice on what to change?,veazer,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1dkavz/any_advice_on_what_to_change/,"So here's my story, I'm 20, in engineering school (parents/scholarships paying 100% thankfully), and have the following going on:

At 18 years old I obtained $20K + interest from a settlement when I was 3, all is currently invested in mutual funds, hasn't made much, but didn't lose anything either.  Until turning 20, I had only worked minimum wage food service jobs and never had more than 2 grand in the bank.  Part of the reason is that 50% of what I made (matched by my father) went to a Roth IRA that had probably like 4-5K in it at my 20th birthday.  

Fast forward to April of this year, 3 grandparents died and I got 8 grand from one of them.  Father put 5K in my Roth acct, now just under 10K, and the rest is in checking.  I haven't spent much, but I did buy myself a computer, otherwise tried to save for gas and whatnot.  This summer I'm working an internship @ $20/hr full time for 12 weeks, so I'll have about 9000 more after this summer.  

I know keeping 10 grand in a wells fargo checking account is pointless, especially when they try to charge me a 13$ monthly service fee every time I blink, but should I do something specific with it?  Move it to something else?  Also, when should I try to start building my own credit, and how would you go about doing that? ($300 max cash backed card, or real credit card or something else?)  Anything else I should do with my money that's already invested?"

He is constantly asking who i'm hanging out with..he calls quite abit, which isn't a problem, but if I can't answer he will always send a ""sad face"" text mesage afterwards? He talked about the possibility of being exclusive when I finally do make the move. Then...he asked me if I was ""hooking up"" with other guys and I told him the truth that I was..since we haven't even met yet it shouldnt be a problem?

I started a throwaway account because I'd like to share a little bit more personal detail about my situation.  Here it goes:

29 years old.  Married.  Two kids born in '08 and '10.  Graduated in 2011 in Construction Management with $27k in student loans.  I was working in an internship that rolled into a full-time job at $45k/year after I graduated.  

My wife and I both fell into the trap of thinking ""We deserve some sort of reward for all the hard work we've done"" and went out and got two cars totaling $20k in loans.

A few months later we saw the light after sitting down and putting a budget together to see when we could realistically have a good down payment for a home.  We were saving ~$300 while making the minimum payments on all of our debt.  A down payment seemed impossibly far away.

One thing led to another and over the next 19-20 months we sold both cars and replaced them with a beater that I bought for $1 from my father-in-law, and a $3000 car that we bought from my wife's grandmother.

After a year at my job I got a promotion and a raise to $55k/year and by then we were aggressively paying off our debt.  Just this past March I got another raise to $62k/year and a $6k bonus that helped push us to make our last lump sum payment towards our [student loan debt](http://i.imgur.com/AVDk6Ql.jpg). 

What I'm actually most proud of is that we've cut our monthly expenses down from ~$3200/mo to $2100/mo while our income has increased dramatically.

We're now saving ~$1800/mo towards an emergency fund and a down payment on a house as our two bedroom/two bath apartment is feeling a little small as our kids get older (and bigger).

Sorry for the wall o' text.  Like I sad at the beginning, I hope my experience can help and inspire someone else to keep pushing.  My wife and I haven't been on any vacations, birthdays and Christmas are on the cheap, and it hasn't been very ""fun"" but definitely rewarding in the end."

1djqmg,3,2013-05-02,How long is too long to wait?,rship,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1djqmg/how_long_is_too_long_to_wait/,"My bf [21m] and I [21f] have been together for almost 4 years, and we lived together for the past 2. We attend university together, and are graduating this spring. 

My bf is constantly busy with a few spurts of rest in between. He pays far less attention to the relationship in these periods than I do. I extend the same level of affection, desire and attention towards him, no matter how busy I am. Granted, he says he's always busier than me, and I can't really argue that with him. He definitely takes on WAY more work than I do, and really extends his limits. So, he stresses himself out way more than he should, but he gets great satisfaction from his hard work. This brings me back to my point: he works so hard and has very little time for me, even though we live together. We barely ever have sex, cuddle, spend quality time together, talk about  meaningful things that don't involve HIS work, etc. All of this is because of him, not me. I give him plenty of massages when he asks for them (which is at least every few days, oftentimes a little every day). If he wants to nap from 1am to 3am, but I clearly want to just sleep, I'll stay up to make sure he wakes up (he's a very heavy sleeper), thus sacrificing my sleep. I do this often for him. I make sure to wake him up in the mornings, too, even if it means I can't be to class as early as I'd like. I bring him meals when he's busy studying or working. I tell him I love him, I make it a point to hold his hand and let him know how proud I am of him. In return, I get very little. I don't ask for much, just the basics. I have to ask for cuddling or sex, and even those requests are denied. 

He is always busy. When I bring up my frustrations to him, he reassures me that it's only because of the stuff he's busy with. That once it's over, he can give me the attention and affection I want, but for now, he doesn't have the time for it. It's always something different. Sometimes, it's being at his family home (he lives abroad on breaks), so he can't skype, email, text, call, etc. Sometimes, it's his school organization. Other times, it's his internship, job, classes, research, theses (he's doing more than 1), etc. There's always something that takes up ALL of his time, leaving next to nothing for me.

I've been very patient, just waiting for this stressful period to be over. I've gone over a month without sex. Minimal cuddling time. I had to practically beg for cuddling yesterday, and we only cuddled for a few minutes. He says 'I love you' sometimes. For the past several months, he often (over half the time) comes to bed (or even just home many times) very late, past 3am. The other day he came home at 7am. I always wake up around 8:30 or 9, and I'm a light sleeper, so I was upset because he disturbed my sleep again. It's even worse when he disturbs my sleep between 3-6am. Anyway, I feel like there's a lot going on in this post, but the gist of it is that I don't feel loved, appreciated, or that attention is being paid to me. The icing on the cake is that even though I've been so patient, I feel taken advantage of. My patience is wearing thin. He's been out to parties, socials, and friend's apartments while he's been busy, so he's definitely making time for other people. Why not me?

Is it this normal to be so busy, and to refrain from normal relationship activities? I understand needing stress relief, so I have no problem with him going to parties and having fun with friends. It's just that I'd like to think spending time with me, cuddling with me, talking with me, having sex with me, is a good stress-reliever, too. Almost important to note: although he doesn't have sex with me very often because he's busy, he masturbates every few days. He tells me it's because ""it's convenient"". He'll masturbate in the bathroom while I'm in the apartment with him. You'd think having a horny gf in the apartment with you is convenient enough, but nope. Apparently not. He pretends to be oblivious to my advances, saying I ""never initiate"". This is not true. I have to also ask him outright if he wants to have sex, and he usually declines because he's: busy, tired, stressed, has other plans, etc.

TL;DR: My bf is always busy, leaving little time for me. I'm starving for his attention. Is this normal in a relationship? "

1djdx1,2,2013-05-02,"Is she ""that"" into me?",arz99,AmateurWriting,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmateurWriting/comments/1djdx1/is_she_that_into_me/,"""Yes I simply adore her and I won't let her go no matter what"", I tell myself. She is just the perfect girl for me or rather for anyone. We are in college together and I am sure there are so many guys in my college that would love to have her in their lives and be a part of her life. But none is as lucky as I am. I am the one she chose to be with - the first and only official guy in her life. Though there have been others but none she was really involved with. I am glad about it, though I wonder that do I even deserve her? But that doesn't really bother me. What does is that, does she love me the way I love her? If you think I doubt her, then you are VERY wrong! Doubting her is beyond me. She can never and I mean never cheat on me or think about someone else as long as we are together. In fact, there have been times when she has told me about fellow batch mates telling her that they have a crush on her. But what worries me is this ""Is she THAT into me?"". 

Let me tell you something about her. She is beautiful, an angel in herself. She is sweet and cheerful, has a smile on her face always and talks to everyone with ease and makes them feel at ease. She has her own unique way of living life, does what she believes in - irrespective of what the entire world believes around her. I am sure whoever knows her, respects her for the kind of girl she is - principled and untouched by most of life's pleasures like drinking, smoking, etc. Some may call her orthodox and uptight. She says she doesn't care. And I am sure she doesn't, otherwise she would have given in the peer pressure that exists regarding such stuff in a management school. Well I guess this is the reason I love her so much!

It hasn't been long since we have been seeing each other - just about a month. When she first told me that she likes me too, two days later she said she wasn't sure if she wanted a relationship. I know being in a relationship was new for her, a big change in her life. And knowing the way she is - closed to any change in life and extra thoughtful in everything, I knew she can think about it all her life without being sure. I didn't ask her to take a decision at that time itself, just spoke to her as friends for hours. I asked her again a few days later and she said she likes me. That was all that I wanted to know. 

College is off on a term break and we speak every day on phone. It is normal. But I have known since always, it is not easy for her - to accept me or rather anyone in her life. And so I fear sometimes that some day she would just say to me that she can't handle it. We meet rarely these days as we both have an internship and the timing just doesn't fit. 

Last night when we spoke, it was normal. But at the end she said ""Let us meet tomorrow. I want to talk."" This did not freak me out. But after a long pause she added the two words ""about us"". She had certainly given it a deep thought as she said it on a Friday, because it was only possible for us to meet on the weekends. I felt like the moment had come which was the only fear I had about her. She will say to me, that she can't handle it. ""No! I cannot let that happen. I won't. Maybe I am just thinking too much. I'll meet her tomorrow and remove any doubts she has. I'll not let her go just like that.""

I was waiting for her at the decided place today. I had reached before time. When she arrived and I looked at her, there was just one thought in my mind ""She is the angel of my life"". She looked so pretty. Her open hair reaching half way to her waist. Her face bearing a smile as always. We greeted each other. We talked about how are internship was going, work load, etc. I wanted her to start that topic that I was fearing. But after about half an hour, I couldn't wait any longer. I asked her what she wanted to talk ""about us"". She became silent. She often got silent on such things. I insisted her to speak something. 

She looked at me with a strong gaze. Her eyes wanted to say something but I didn't understand. Her smile had gone - something very rare for her. I knew she wasn't going to say anything good. She was trying hard to speak and I waited patiently for words to come out. Finally she said, ""You are the only guy I said ""Yes"" to. You mean a lot to me. Do you like me the way I like you?"". Her voice trembled on the last line and tears came till her eyes. She fought them back. 

I cannot put in words what I felt at that time - supreme happiness, to say the least. I was speechless. I just hugged her tight and kissed her on the head. ""You mean everything to me, I like you veryyy much"" I told her. 

It is half past midnight. I just kept the phone down after talking to her. ""Yes I simply adore her and I won't let her go no matter what!"""

A little background information on myself:

23 year old male

about to graduate college


meditating off and on for the past 2 years... induced by a random/spontaneous kundalini experience- post concussion syndrome 


im a cool dude and very empathetic 

July 2012. 
I was living away from home working an internship when I got sudden news of my aunt being diagnosed with cancer. My aunt was one of my best friends and although the news was difficult I held my hopes high. What bothers me the most about this is that I only got to see her once before she lost her ability to speak.  We spent the last four months of her life communicating with our eyes and i could feel/see every emotion and feeling she was going through.  I would come home every weekend to visit her but the time i spent away at work during the week really effected me because all I could think about was my aunt and how i wasn't there for her at all times; this led me to turn inward and I've been stuck dealing with her loss ever since.

Whenever I meditate I can dissociate myself from these lurking feelings, however, its the opposite whenever I'm going about my everyday activities. 
I get an anxious feeling, somewhat like i'm dying. This feeling drowns out my concentration and leads to small bouts of depression. 

I feel like a part of me died with my aunt and I'm having trouble getting back to equilibrium because of this issue. If anyone can offer some advice on how to better cope with this issue or ways I can meditate on this experience it would be very much appreciated and helpful

1dj4t0,28,2013-05-01,I hate who I am,[deleted],confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1dj4t0/i_hate_who_i_am/,"I'm not really sure how else to say it. I'm too nice. I'm not assertive. I have no motivation to live to life the way I used to. Every day I wake up more depressed on the inside than I was the day before, but because I'm the ""leader"" of our social circle, no one can see it. My ""friends"" always use me to get stuff done for them, get alcohol, or generally plan out events so they don't need to expend their own effort. 

I haven't been on a real date in a few years. The girl I last tried with let me take her out under the assumption that it was a date, had a great time( going around to her favorite spots around town: romantic walk on the pier, restaurant on a lake front on the other edge of town, comedy show.. the works), pay for everything (I'm old fashioned this way), and then tell me she's seeing this other guy who ended up emotionally abusing her, but she really liked me and wanted me to wait for her because she didn't think she'd be with him much longer the way he treated her. She wasn't and again after the breakup, I expressed my interest in her and got the same response, citing that she wasn't ready to jump back in to anything, so I was patient with her because I really cared about her.

Cut to 6 months ago, that same girl, who I've naively held a candle for all this time because we've remained close friends in the interim, gets engaged. It's seemingly out of the blue, because she hadn't even mentioned that she'd been dating this guy to me in all our talks, but apparently it had been an ongoing thing that she didn't tell me about because she knew I had feelings for her. Naturally because I'm still crazy about her, I'm crushed. 

Every other girl I've ever dated has cheated on me, usually multiple times. Because I'm a doormat, I forgive them and take them back telling myself I won't do it next time, but she'll never do it again anyway so it won't matter. Of course I'd be wrong...This is one of my least favorite features, I always convince myself of the best in people, when in reality, a lot of people are fucking assholes.

I lost all motivation to succeed or better myself, put on 30lbs, started sleeping 10 hrs a night, skipping classes and alienating friends. I'd never do anything to hurt myself or others, but after copious self-reflection, I definitely hate who I've been my whole adult life thus far. Over the last 6 months I've seen all of my friends getting into what seems to be serious relationships or taking the ones they have to the next level. I've watched co-workers at my internship move on to better things. Even my younger siblings seem more together than me lately. 

I've tried everything I can think of to get over this, but keep coming up empty. My main problem is that I constantly come back to that girl. Even with her fiance she still complains (although much less frequently, and I've met the guy, he's genuinely a good guy) to me and mentions how she wished he was like me in certain respects. Every time I hear stuff like that, it's like a new wound I have to try and heal. 

The only resolution I've been able to come up with is leaving the whole area and never coming back. I know running away from your problems is a poor way out, but it's what I have.I graduate next fall, and the only thing I'm certain of after graduation is that I'll be moving away from everyone, deleting my facebook and skype, and changing my phone number so no one can reach me. I just had to get this out since the only friend I had to talk to about stuff like this is engaged, you guessed it, the girl. I've had no one to talk to for a long time and after next fall, I won't again, but it'll be by choice. I feel like that control will be the first step to changing who I am to be successful in the life I want to have.

Thanks for listening.

I have been looking for an apartment for a few days now on reddit and craiglist and have been having a hard time finding a good fit.

I can go with just about anything (I am very easygoing) but my price range limit is $1000/month at MAX, so hopefully a little lower than that.  

-I'm fine with no furniture, (I have a bed and desk and other things for a room)
-I keep a clean room and always make a point to clean up after myself
-Fine with any type of pets, love cats and dogs
-I don't have a lot of stuff, enough to fill a room but that's it

A little about me:
I am a 20 year old male whose interests include rock climbing, tennis, football, other athletic activities, music, drumming, videogames, and computer programming.  I will most likely be very busy during the week with work and could potentially have a decent amount of work to do over the weekends, but I'll certainly have some time to relax and enjoy the area!"
1dixoq,2,2013-05-01,Is it selfish that I [22F] don't want to move to his[23M] city?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1dixoq/is_it_selfish_that_i_22f_dont_want_to_move_to/,"Info:Been together for 2 years, but have known each other for 5. Have talked about marriage, kids, the whole shebang, we are on board with each other on everything but are happy to just be dating for now. Neither one of us is looking to actually get married anytime soon. I really see a great future with this man. 

So, he is going to be graduating from law school in about a year (I know I know, the field is crappy right now). I am currently living in a majorish city south of him, about an hour away. We've been doing this distance thing for a bit, but we are really sick of it. Problem is, he says he will be mainly looking for jobs in the MAJOR city about an hour north of him (2 hours north relative to me). Problem is, I HATE that city. Maybe I hate the city because of how in love with my city I am, but regardless, I would hate to live there.

 Additionally, my currently city has a lot of job opportunities for my field. MAJOR CITY has some too, but not as many and the competition would be rough because of MAJOR UNIVERSITY. Right now I have a really nice job that treats me well that I can grow with. I plan on working full time and getting my master's online (my job is flexible enough where I can do a lot of school work on the clock) and then moving on to something more related to my masters.

 He always seemed ambiguous about where he would look for jobs before, but now that he is solidifying his internship prospects and job hunting, it is looking more and more like he is focusing on MAJOR CITY, saying that he has more connections up there via networking and stuff.

I truly love this guy and want to make this relationship work, but financially and emotionally, moving to be with him doesn't jive. I would be sacrificing my fledgling career and I don't think that is a good idea for me to do.

My question is, how selfish is it that I don't want to even consider moving up there? I KNOW he could find something down here in his field, but moving up there is basically a dealbreaker for me. Is this relationship dead in the water? Should I cut my losses now, or hang on and see what happens? 

**TLDR; I hate the idea of moving to a city, but should I suck it up for my bf?**

Lately, i have been fighting with depression and loneliness, and have had a lot of stress.  Story is below.

Last month, I took a class that went overseas, as part of it's study.  ever since, i have not been the same, and have not felt the same as I did before i went abroad.  On this trip, i became attracted to a girl, only to find out that she did not find me attractive at all.  I figured she is very busy, already had a boyfriend to take care of her, and didn't need me bugging her when we we got back (I tried texting her, and she never responded).  she appears to be happy, and I am fine with that.

Second part of the story, I have been frantically trying to find work (i am a college student) and have struck out, and not hear back from anyone, and if i had hear back and got an interview, everyone has politely said that they aren't looking for someone like me; someone with more experience in the field (it is an internship. how am I suppose to have prior experience if an internship cant even accept me).

Third, i have been trying to involve myself as much as i can with the clubs on campus, and have taken on leadership roles in them, and volunteered to help with events and i greatly enjoy helping and finally becoming a leader. however, i find myself stressed out beyond belief because of trying to maintain a higher GPA, involving myself as much as i can, and trying to find a job, and then facing the consequences of potentially not getting a job, and having to go back home for the summer, and be even more alone.

I do have people i hang out with around campus, however, most of them are close acquaintances, and not good friends.  I figure why should i sit with them, or close to them, if i am just going to not talk, or bum people out?  So I normally have been going off alone, and in that case, i am kind of isolating myself because i can now see the world for the place it truly is; a lonesome cruel place, that if you are the little bit different, or try to act different, you will be spewed out alone. All my good friends are back home, and i dont want to bother them with my problems, and put that burden on them.

this just felt like the best place to say all this.

I won't be attending ND, due to bad family situations that affected my grades, which aren't important, but I may try to transfer once i can get away attend another college for a while. 

I guess I am looking for some ""insider"" knowledge.  I would love to have an internship this summer, or at the very least be able to be involved/help with something on campus.  I would like to have a ""job"" out of interning, but I am willing to work for free for purely the academic pursuit. 

So my questions are: 

 * Who do I talk to?
 * Are there already programs?  
 * What can I do to prove I would be worth it?


I would love to do anything in business, especially finance as this will be my major.  And computer science is next up, with international relations finishing last.

  I am pretty much willing to do anything, so pride or being overworked is not much of a problem.  I am also very intelligent and believe I can catch on to anything extremely quickly (I won't waste their time).

There was an internship for their chemistry department, but they had enough juniors, so they did not need us seniors.

Anything is helpful and I am looking forward to your responses!"
1dn7u1,1,2013-05-03,Been feeling a need to share my testimony,Baelzabub,Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1dn7u1/been_feeling_a_need_to_share_my_testimony/,"I've been feeling a need recently to share my testimony with people and thought this would be a good place for it, so without further ado here it is:


I was born and raised in a Christian home and was raised almost entirely in a single church.  For my early childhood I went through the typical church kid's experience, of Sunday School on the weekends and prayer before dinner.  Things went fine like this until I hit middle school.  I had always been on the shorter side of the spectrum when it came to guys my age, but in elementary school nobody really notices the difference.  However it really started to show in middle school.  By the time I hit eighth grade I was standing at a tiny 4'8'', the shortest kid in the school.  This immediately set me apart from my peers, combined with the fact that I tried to keep my head down, I was the perfect target for ridicule of any kid trying to look cool.  However my school didn't stop simply at teasing or making somebody an outcast.  

By the time I was halfway through my last semester of middle school I had had two attempts on my life.  The first was a boy trying to slam my head against the floor and the second was a girl pulling a knife on me.  Both times I was saved by the security officers of the school and the matter was resolved, but the damage was done.  I had as of this point spent nearly a full year thinking that people didn't see me as somebody worth being alive, and so I began to contemplate suicide.  I would have gone through with my plans if not for a neighbor of mine, an (at the time) eleventh grader who saw somebody in need and reached out as a friend, despite how it would have looked to his friends.  He never knew what he did in saving my life because I never told him what was on my mind.  Merely having someone to talk to and laugh with for the first time in over a year was enough.  He helped me survive to high school where things took a turn for the better, beginning with me growing eight inches in the summer between eighth and ninth grade, but the damage to my faith had been done.  I had it drilled into me as a survival instinct that I did not ask for help from anyone.  And so despite going to church and getting into the youth group at the church, I wasn't really paying attention and never grew in my faith.  Spiritually, I was stuck at age thirteen.  

I never really noticed this difference all through high school because things never really got bad.  I graduated and made the transition to college without incident.  However, in March of my freshman year, I received a call from my mother saying that my friend from middle school, the one who had kept me from killing my self, was found in his room after hanging himself.  I was beyond devastated and had no idea what to do with myself.  I became a social recluse, only leaving my room for meals and classes and begin to revisit thoughts of suicide.  A call two weeks later informed me that his journal had been opened and his last entry was him wondering how Jesus could have let the world get to such a state without coming for the Rapture.  This was where my faith died.  I couldn't process how such an amazing person could be allowed to fall so far, why he couldn't have someone come to his aid like he came to mine.  I wondered if there was something I could have done and threw myself into parties and alcohol to ease my pain and anger at God.  Before I realized it I was drinking 4 nights a week at age 18.  

I kept this up for several months and watched my grades plummet and found myself put on Academic Suspension by the school.  Being home got me out of the atmosphere of readily accessible alcohol and also gave me a chance to meet my friends mother, who was understandably a bigger wreck than me.  I had already told myself I would tell her what I had never been able to tell him, about how her son had saved my life and how much I had looked up to him for years.  For the first time in nearly five years I allowed myself to cry and cried with her for nearly an hour.  All the pain from middle school, my anger, my sorrow at loosing someone so important, all came out in that time taking a huge weight off my shoulders.  Suddenly my mind was more clear than it had been in years and I was able to see what my life had become clearly.  I was still unsure of what I was lacking as my faith, before I lost it, was so immature.

I spent most of my sophomore year of college trying to figure out what I was missing, what the hole I felt was but to no avail.  Looking back, I'm sure there were signs aplenty that I just didn't, or wouldn't see.  It wasn't until this previous fall that God decided to stop with the subtle hints and decided to beat me over the head with his desire for me to know him.  My roommate was having friends over for drinks and to just hang out and people came and went as they pleased, but the last two people to stay were a pair of girls form the BCM, a campus ministry and church group.  We talked for hours about our pasts and the question of faith came up.  I told them my story to that point and even talked about the sense of missing something.  It was here that they actually laughed.  The first girl, Jen, said that she had been praying for my roommate (an atheist) that God could act to bring her to the church, and upon receiving the text inviting her over, felt that God was pushing her to go.  Her friend, Kim, had felt something similar that she was supposed to go with Jen that day and so went with her when Jen invited her to come to our apartment.  Jen and Kim invited me to come to see what the BCM was all about, and after a couple of visits I found myself not only going to church on a nearly weekly visit but also going to my first bible study.  As of this semester I have turned my life completely back to God and have dove headfirst into His Word.  And low and behold my grades have improved, I have an internship at a lab here at school for the summer and a happiness I haven't felt in years.


I know this was a long post but I have felt a weight on my heart to share my story with as many people as possible and this was the first step I could think of.  If you have any questions I will be more than happy to answer them and I thank those of you who actually took the time to read this."
1dmqax,1,2013-05-03,Humanities student seeking experience in finance,dberesheim,finance,https://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/1dmqax/humanities_student_seeking_experience_in_finance/,"Hello,  I'm currently finishing my junior year at a Big East school in NYC.  I'm a dual major in philosophy and rhetoric. ideally, I will receive enough funding from a graduate program to continue my education and get a Ph.d in the latter discipline.  However,  I am not going to bet the farm on that.  I was hoping r/finance could offer advice on how to develop my resume to possibly gain some form of  employment in finance after I graduate.

I know its going to require an entirely different set of knowledge, but I have a whole summer to study and I've found what I've learned so far not terribly difficult to pick up. Could anyone recommend decent introductory literature, as well as a few habits that could help me along the way? I do have a few outstanding concerns though:

How do I distinguish myself from a business student when applying for internships?  I have extensive experience in being contracted for academic research (been working for a phil/econ prof for a year and a half) but no office experience.  I am confident that if I can at least get my foot in the door,  I can make the case that I am intelligent and competent.  I view it as a matter of not having my resume put in the rejection pile.

Secondly,  I know like any industry, there are tiers of prestige amongst companies.  Intuition tells me I would have better luck applying to lesser known firms if I want to get interviewed.  Am I mistaken in thinking this?  I would imagine GS, MS, Citi, Moody's  all want the applicants who've been basically bred to write programs for Bloomberg one day.  I am not that person.  Should I try to develop just general professional and office experience before trying to move specifically to finance?

Lastly,  is this a lost cause?  Am I too deep into my education to be trying to get involved in finance?  I would like to think its not the case, but I could be wrong.  I view an internship as my golden ticket into an actual career in finance, as knowledge without experience is not desirable in any applicant.  I don't necessarily expect a paying position upon completing my undergraduate,  but having the work experience  is what will permit me to continue along that path and eventually find something.  I view now as the time to do this if I am ever going to but am unsure of both its feasibility and method of execution.  I will appreciate any advice anyone can offer,  even if its not what I hope to year."
1dmm16,3,2013-05-03,"I(24f) display typical ""cheating"" behaviors, even though I am totally faithful to my (25m)SO!",[deleted],ihaveissues,https://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/1dmm16/i24f_display_typical_cheating_behaviors_even/,"We have been together for 3 years officially and 4 years unofficially. We started off on the wrong foot and even though I feel like he totally trusts me now, I still have do things that make me look guilty, even though I am not.

The ""wrong foot"" I mentioned was that we first began our romance while I was exclusively seeing someone else. My SO at the time (24m) decided he had enough of our home state and was going to move across the country to pursue his dream job. I was sick of school, needed a break and there was an awesome internship I got in the same place. I took it and I followed him down there 3 months after he moved. We did not live together but continued the relationship almost through the whole 6 month period. My current SO and I met through mutual friends and my relationship with my ex was definitely near its natural end; he didn't enjoy having sex with me, I wasn't ready to move in/marry/have kids (he couldn't wait). However 19 year old me didn't have the guts or respect to end the relationship on my own, so I let the kiss from my current SO do it for me. Then, I made it very clear to my current SO that I was not ready for the kind of relationship he wanted. This was all in a 2 week period and current SO never brought up anything about a lasting connection. I told him I liked him a lot, loved spending time with him but we never had any talks of exclusivity or monogamy. He thought that was implied by our actions and level of intimacy, I did not. I returned home after the internship and I started playing the field, being mostly honest about my intentions and whereabouts. I never outright said I was seeing other people, but I never hid the fact I was hanging out with other guys... And he never asked or questioned it. Long story short, he was not on board and we stopped talking (my choice out of the options he gave me-- all or nothing) once he found out I wasn't being ""faithful"" because I basically came out and said that I was not ready for a long distance, monogamous relationship with a guy I only knew for a few months and only really started liking the last few weeks of the internship. He was very, very hurt.

3 months later of no communication I realized I had made a mistake and asked if we could take it slow, begin talking and building a friendship but did not (stupidly) address the monogamy issue. Since I fucked it up last time by kissing other dudes, I did not kiss anyone else. Apparently, he thought we were still ""doing our own thing"" and I saw a picture of him getting a NYE kiss on a social networking site. I flipped and realized, if it made me this upset, maybe we should see where things go, exclusively. He was so upset that he didn't know I wanted this from him, said it was all he ever wanted in the first place, and we became exclusive a little bit after that.

There were a lot of trust issues, he made me feel so terrible for that first few months. I basically cut off all ties to other males, any post on my wall or comment from another guy was an accusation. I would get comments from males, and he would flip. I almost couldn't even go out without spending hours reassuring him, etc. I had to get a second job during school because I needed some extra cash and he said, ""you better not get a slutty job""-- implying bartender, shot girl, etc. basically, no credit was given where credit was due. I agree, it was toxic for a little bit because I really didn't feel like I had even cheated on him because we weren't ""exclusive"". I see where he is coming from to a certain extent, but I still stand by the fact that I got WAY more shit than I deserved and the 2000 miles in between us really didn't help. Regardless, we continued to work on it from both sides.
Fast forward to now, We made it work, I am so glad we did and now have been able to move to the same city and after a year of that, moved in together. We are happy. So happy, we love each other to pieces and I really have no complaints.

Wow-- here is my issue now. I do things that make me look like a cheater. When I'm telling him I'm going out with friends, I stumble over words, I try to make the location sound ""acceptable"". I over explain things so he knows every single detail, which makes it sound unbelievable (don't liars have every little detail nailed down so it looks like it is an honest story?) I turn off my phone as soon as he walks into the room ( I do this because I think it is rude to stare at your phone when someone else is there to engage with you, but it looks like I'm hiding something) I tilt my phone so it looks like I'm hiding it, even when it is something completely mundane, like online banking. I do not accept friend requests, I ignore males completely (not that I flirt when he isn't around, but will speak to them like humans). I have a strong urge to delete any communication from male counterparts, regardless of content.

 He still occasionally talks to one girl he messed around with (I am under the impression it stopped before sex) and has plenty of female friend (totally respectful) that I am fine with. I am very easy going about that sort of thing, he is not and it is actually making -me- more untrusting and urging me to monitor him like used to monitor me... It's only fair, says my brain. I basically am so anxious he is going to find a reason to see me as unfaithful that it has made me into someone who looks unfaithful.

TL;DR I act like a cheater, but I'm not"
1dmiej,23,2013-05-03,[UPDATE] [21/m] My girlfriend [20/f] (of 3.5 yrs.) and I are on the verge of breaking up and I have no support network to talk to.,redyellowblue5031,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1dmiej/update_21m_my_girlfriend_20f_of_35_yrs_and_i_are/,"Link to original thread &gt; [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1d5jld/21m_my_girlfriend_20f_of_35_yrs_and_i_are_on_the/)

First I want to thank the whole community for your support; I didn't expect such a response and I really am grateful. You people are all awesome.

I have accepted the internship, and I need to start looking for an sublet. Me and my girlfriend had a rather large blowout when we finally talked that day last week when I first posted. We worked things out to a point where we are together right now. We both acknowledged that we both are not happy with how things have gone and ~~want~~ need change. 

We came to the conclusion that she needs me there for her no matter what, and I said I can't put up with any violence. We have been working from there. She came to a bike race that I had registered for that Sunday and was very supportive. We had no major fights this week. However, while talking about the internship (and currently) she isn't happy about it. For her it comes down to a matter of that for how much pain and difficulty our relationship has gone through, it's almost impossible to have me away that long and still want to continue forward. I believe the reasoning for her is that having your significant other move out and into a different apartment for a summer with different people is something that wouldn't be much of a struggle in a healthy relationship, but we don't fit that bill and so it's very difficult to be trusting of the future and she has (and so do I) many bad feelings that need to be resolved. 

Our relationship is far from good, or even stable I would say. I want to work it out with her though. I am also reconnected with my old psychologist. I presented my theories on many problems I have. Basically, I think I'm emotionally and psychologically underdeveloped from a lack of feedback from my parents. Let me put it this way, I had a mother and father, but no mom or dad. I had a roof, food, clothes. But I had no compassion or feedback. No ""I love you"", ""you're important to me"", never saw my parents kiss, hug, hold hands, say I love you, etc. *Ever*. This came to a climax when my father passed away unexpectedly (sort of) at 57 in 2010. I've been sort of a zombie since then and haven't figured all this out. 

How does any of that tie into the relationship, you might wonder? I think it does because I never got any approval from my dad in any fashion. Nothing felt good enough. I think that in a weird twisted way, I see my girlfriend as my father in that I seek her approval and part of the reason I react to problems in our relationship is because of how I see her, and I can't deal with the rejection that what I've done isn't good enough. 

So now I'm here. All of your comments really forced me to think hard about what's important to me and what I want. I'm still figuring all of that out. This is what I have so far. I know I need professional help to get through my past issues so I can be a functional person who doesn't break down at the first sign of rejection/disapproval. I'm not sure how to fix my relationship exactly, but I know I want us both to be happy. 

Thank you. 

tl:dr

I posted about me and my girlfriend having serious issues last week, and I needed a support group. I got that support from this (awesome) community. I have since been to my old psychologist, accepted my internship and am still together with my girlfriend. I have some moderate psychological issues to sort through and still would love any advice, thoughts, comments on the situation. Lastly, Thank you for reading this, my old post and providing any feedback; I appreciate it from the bottom of my heart. "
1dlumu,38,2013-05-03,"For all of you Ents ""studying"" for your drug tests...",[deleted],trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/1dlumu/for_all_of_you_ents_studying_for_your_drug_tests/,"I know many of you fine ladies and gentlemen have been fasting from the devil's grass for upcoming drug tests for internships or jobs, so I'd like to give you a little advice from an experience I had. 

I quit smoking for 40 days in preparation for my drug test last summer. It was brutal, but I was happy to get it over with. My ideal plan was to buy some buds, roll up a nice blunt, and smoke it on the ride home from the test. However, being home for the summer, none of the dealers I knew from high school were around, so sadly I couldn't find any.

Before the test, I wanted to make sure that I passed, so I drank a good deal of water before to ensure some clear-looking piss. Everything at the testing center went smoothly, but I was still upset that I was dry. And I stayed dry for 3 days. Just as I got a hold of someone, I received an email from the testing center saying that my urine was too diluted to get a good sample, and that I had to retake the test. 

Thank god for bad pot dealers. If everything had gone according to plan, I would've had it in my system for the retest, and my internship would've gone down the drain. So here's what I have to say to you:

MAKE SURE YOU RECEIVE CONFIRMATION THAT YOU PASSED BEFORE YOU TOKE AGAIN. I got lucky, but not everyone else will be. Be smart, be safe, and don't let the wonderful herb ruin your future. Toke on, my friends. "
1dlokh,1,2013-05-03,I [F21] am irrationally jealous of my boyfriend [M21]'s ex-girlfriend and want to stop feeling like this.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1dlokh/i_f21_am_irrationally_jealous_of_my_boyfriend/,"How can I keep myself from getting irrationally jealous of my boyfriend's ex-girlfriend?

In a nutshell, my reasons for feeling this way are:

1. I have seen her facebook pictures and she is objectively more attractive than me (very slim, very cute, seems to have many friends)

2. I know that the only reason he and she broke up was because of long distance after high school, so he still cares for her. In a parallel universe, they could be perfect for each other.

3. She shares interests with him that I don't: she's a great singer, actress and performer. He really likes musicals and acts in our college plays.

4. Her parents are really accomplished in the academic world and have helped my boyfriend find internships, while he doesn't really have a relationship with my parents (because they disapprove of me dating a white guy).

I have been dating him for almost 2 years. We are both juniors in college, so his ex and him haven't dated in a very long time. He is a great boyfriend and seems to care for me, but I can't help but think that he has downgraded from his last girlfriend.

Before he and I started dating, he and I were very close friends and he told me intimate details about his ex during that time. This was freshman year, they had broken up due to long distance, and he still had very strong feelings for her. I know details about many aspects of their relationship-- when they first had sex, what her parents do, her interests, why he loved her so much, etc. 
After he realized that he couldn't be with her, he went through an angsty period, and around January of freshman year, he stopped talking about her as much because she had started dating someone new. By this time I had feelings for him. In February 2011 we started dating each other.

For example, I know that because she was a virgin and he respected her, he waited a long time to have sex with her and made sure she felt comfortable (they did so after 6 months of dating). With me, from basically day 1, he has been very touchy-feely and continually pressured me to have sex with him (I was also a virgin). We didn't have sex until 6 months into our relationship but I would constantly have to turn him down/ ask him to please wait until I'm ready. We have since talked about his behavior during the beginning of our relationship and he has apologized. He now always makes sure that I am comfortable about the physical things that we do.

I have not always been so insecure, but sophomore year was a difficult year academically and socially for me. I had a difficult time with classes (we go to a really hard tech school) and even socially, I started becoming jealous of more attractive close friends. I never voiced these insecurities. I think beforehand, I always identified myself as the 'smart girl' but in college, everyone seemed incredibly intelligent. So my new role for myself became 'pretty girl' and when that image (to me) was shattered as I gained weight sophomore year, I started having very low self-esteem.

Junior year has been much better academically. I've been mentally stable and happy, until about a month ago. About a month ago, I began feeling similar emotions of insecurity. I'm not sure what sparked this, since I've been exercising, getting fit, doing well in classes, and enjoying time with my friends. 

I have been seeing a therapist about these feelings, and he suggests that I talk to my boyfriend about how I'm feeling. So today, I admitted that I am seeing a therapist about insecurities regarding his ex-girlfriends. My boyfriend said that luckily he loves only me, but he's glad I told him about how I'm feeling. I didn't mention any of the reasons WHY exactly I felt insecure. 

Is this conversation over? I know this is something I should deal with, considering he's not at fault and I am simply battling with my own emotional problems. But what do I do? My therapist wants me to talk to him more, but I don't know how to bring it up again. My boyfriend didn't really seem to want to talk about it (he quickly switched the conversation topic to 3d printers).

He never compliments academic accomplishments nor my physical appearance, but to solve this problem, I'm not sure if seeking validation from him is the healthiest approach. I just want to at least hear him say that he loves me more than he has ever loved her. Is this wrong and unrealistic? 

TLDR: I keep comparing myself to my boyfriend's ex-girlfriend and can't help but think that she was a better 'catch' than me. How do I block out these feelings?"

Something must've went wrong last month, because last Thursday (after realizing she was a week late) we got a pregnancy test that confirmed she was pregnant.

Regardless of how unlikely this all is, neither one of us is ready to be parents, are still knee deep in our college education, and don't have nearly enough money between the two of us. I advocated for an abortion, but she is too scared of it and her family would literally disown her if they found out she got one. We're probably going the adoption route.

Pretty much her entire family already knows, but I haven't told anyone in mine yet. I'm absolutely terrified to tell them. I feel like they will never look at me the same. To make things worse, she has an internship for most of the summer in the town where we go to school and is living there, while I have mine in my hometown about 2 hours away. We won't be able to see each other a lot this summer, and she will be by herself over where she lives (her roommates have moved out). I feel unbelievably guilty about not being there for her this summer, even though she repeatedly has told me she'll be ok.

What should I do? How do I tell my parents? They're coming to pick me up from school tomorrow morning to take me home for the summer. My head is literally spinning right now. I'm not ready for this at all:/

tl;dr My girlfriend is pregnant and we aren't ready to be parents. I have no idea how to tell my parents about it all.

**UPDATE:** Sorry for the lack of responses the past couple days, I've been going through a lot. I told my mother last night. She was shocked at first and seems a tad overwhelmed but after talking about it for a while and putting my GF on the phone, she calmed down very quickly. We're both looking at it all as rationally as possible. She is very supportive, but at the same time wants to make sure that my and my GF have multiple plans in place for this. 

My dad's been super stressed recently doing work-related stuff, so I'm holding off on telling him for a couple of days, when he'll be in a better state of mind to handle news like this. My mom thinks it's a good idea too. Hopefully he will take it as well as she has. It's a little weird knowing it's out there now, but my mom isn't treating me any different than before. She said she didn't want me too feel overwhelmed right away, and it's actually really comforting. 

My girlfriend and I are still pretty scared about the upcoming months, but I think we'll be able to get through it. Now the hope is to find the right adoption family. Thanks again for your suggestions and support. I really appreciated it.

My girlfriend and I are still pretty scared about the upcoming months, but I think we'll be able to get through it. Now the hope is to find the right adoption family. Thanks again for your suggestions and support. I really appreciated it.

1dl4jk,1,2013-05-02,Advice for a summer intern,bearington,Charleston,https://www.reddit.com/r/Charleston/comments/1dl4jk/advice_for_a_summer_intern/,"I've been lurking this subreddit for awhile because I'm currently a Purdue grad student and have a summer internship with Cummins starting in about a week. Thanks to everyone's help (unbeknownst to you) I have chosen to live in Summerville for these 3 months. It was the right match of price, safety and location for me. I do have a few questions if anyone has any advice:

1) I'm an avid pool player (8-ball or 9-ball) and am looking for the best places to play. I'm especially interested in any summer leagues or tournaments. If nothing else, just advice on places to shoot. It seems like North Park Grill and Fast Break Lounge seem the best but you never know what you're getting with pool halls. I'd hate to walk into a bad situation, lol

2) Where can I play golf on a budget? I don't need a ""cutoff jeans &amp; a wife-beater acceptable"" type course but I don't want to put up a week's play just for one round.

3) Where can I buy health foods and local, free-range meat? Are there any famers markets, etc?

4) Any advice on ""must do's"" over the summer? I'm already planning on doing all the touristy stuff and possibly buying a bike to get a more in depth feel for the town. I'll have my car so I'm open to suggestions in the surrounding region as well.

Thanks a lot! See you all in about 10 days!

Software Engineering student looking for summer internship,usernamecompromised,houston,https://www.reddit.com/r/houston/comments/1dp36j/longshot_software_engineering_student_looking_for/,"First off, I'm not sure if this is allowed here, I looked at /r/houstonjobs but it didn't look very active at all.

I am a Junior Software Engineering student at UT Dallas and I'm home for the summer. I planned on taking summer classes at HCC but it turns out they aren't offering the classes I need afterall. 

So, now I'm stuck with nothing to do for 3 months and I would really like to work on something related to my field. It's way too late for summer internship applications so I just wanted to check if any of you guys needed a hardworking student to work in software development/IT/ or literally any other computer/tech related field. 

PM me if you know of anything and I'll send my resume over ASAP.
Again, if this isn't allowed here I apologize and I will delete it.

Thanks! I'm excited to be back in Houston for the summer :)"
1dofos,9,2013-05-04,"Trouble with a monster landlord, badly in need of advice. (Warning, enormous wall of text)",[deleted],toronto,https://www.reddit.com/r/toronto/comments/1dofos/trouble_with_a_monster_landlord_badly_in_need_of/,"I apologize in advance for a VERY long-winded and possibly slightly incoherent explanation of my situation. I want to make sure I include all of the details and I've barely been sleeping since this nonsense started.

 

In December 2011, I moved into an all inclusive basement unit of a 6 unit duplex. The landlord always seemed to be a bit... odd, but I had mostly no issues for a few months. 

 

In May 2012, my S.O. moved in and the landlord said that she required an increase of 75 dollars per month, to cover utilities. I did not argue, and signed a new lease with my S.O. on it. I have since come to find that this increase is illegal, but over a year has now passed so I don't know if it'd be admissible in court. She did not file for an above guideline increase with the board.

 

Soon after, the superintendent of the building, who had been there almost 30 years, was suddenly moving out. She didn't seem bitter about it so I did not question it. The landlords then began to renovate the apartment, claiming they were doing if for their son to live in.

 

Then, about mid-march of this year, the LL sent me a message stating ""Hi [laurlala], We are going to rent out the main fllor unit (above you). If u know someone who wants it, let me know. It's 1200 + hydro""
(That is with the exception of the [], the exact text. I have record of all of my sms interactions backed up to my email for reference, as things started getting more complicated from here.) 
I asked her in person something along the lines of ""doesn't your son need the unit?"" and she told me that he did not, and he was instead moving to their unit. 

 

Once again I did not question it. We moved in april 1st, Then the actual issues began.

 

On our lease it states that any people who are to live on the premises full time are to be approved by the landlord in writing. I did not want to rock the boat, so I asked her how this would occur, since my SO and I now had a 2 bedroom unit with a bedroom going unused. She said she had to discuss it with her property management company, and husband, then told us that a roommate would cost an extra TWO HUNDRED dollars a month. That's a 16% increase in rent on a house built/rented prior to 1991, which, if I had done my research correctly, was illegal. I asked her repeatedly to discuss this and she dodged my question. 
 
 
 
(LL= landlord, OP= me SO=My significant other. Just in case there's any confusion)

LL:I'm just waiting for a reply from a property mgr on another rental, so we know what to charge

OP:For sure. she's able to move in asap, so just say the word

LL:Your proposed room mate will need to fill out an application also

OP:That's fine, I'll give it to her whenever you can provide it

next day

*OP: Did you get an answer regarding an additional tenant?

*LL: Yes. It is $1400.  I told SO last night. I'll get the application for u today

*OP: Can we please discuss that increase tonight?

*OP: Will you be available around 8:30?

*LL: Is friend coming to do the application?

*OP: I'll call and ask if she's available

*LL: Ok, otherwise I'll leave the application under your door. Then we need to exchange keys

*OP:She has to fill it an application, but cant she also live with us as an additional tennant, not on the lease?

*LL: She first needs to fill out the appllication, then I need to add her to the lease and amend the rent

*OP:Are you available tonight to discuss this?

*LL: She goes on the lease.

*OP: She doesn't know how long she'll be in toronto, as she is looking for internships worldwide for her thesis. She doesn't feel comfortable signing on for a year.

*LL: She can do a month to month. Its 60 days notice to vacate

*OP: I'd much rather discuss this in person

*LL: U can call me

*OP: I'm at work

*LL: Ok. Talk later

 

When I got home, I knocked on her door and asked if she was able to discuss the increase at that time. She said she'd meet me in my unit. 
She stumbled in, drunk, at which point I showed her highlighted sections of the RTA, as well as some internet resources for tenants and landlords that I found, clearly outlining this exact situation, and informed her that I had come to find that her actions were illegal. She then went on a rant about how she had been ""in the business for years"" and that she had sued people (can this be interpreted as a threat?). She then let it slip that she ""kicked out the old superintendent"" and was ""running the place [her]self now"". LL also told us about how not having a name on the lease was a liability, citing a situation with Toronto Metro Housing, in which a grandmother on a sliding scale rent allowed her daughter to live undocumented in an apartment, got caught and lost her court case. She then wandered through the apartment claiming that she needed to test a key for the back door. 

 

Now my SO and I are not unreasonable people, and we understand that even though we are covering hydro costs, there is an inherent increase in the costs of water and wear and tear with another tenant. We offered to meet her in the middle, and pay an extra 100 dollars a month. She said that she would discuss it with her husband, we said thank you, and that we love the unit, and she left. 

 

The next day, this is the sms conversation that ensued.

 

*LL: After talking to my husband, he suggested we meet halfway between 100 and 200 and compromise at $150 for your room mate

*OP: One hundred was the halfway point

*LL: No, the rent is 1200 for 2 people. I want 1400, you want 1300?

*OP: Well theoretically i wanted 1200.

*LL: My offer has always been 1400. We did check a previous lease, and it was ano extra $150 and that was 5 
years ago

*LL: In reality, you signed a contract

*LL: So 1350 is $450 each on a 3 way split

*OP:I just spoke to the residential tenancies board. They told me that that which you are asking is an illegal rent increase, and the portion on the pertaining to additional roommates in unenforceable by the rta. I also asked about the metro housing situation. Sliding-scale rent based on income has nothing to do with a set rent not based on income. I'd like to go about this in the most amicable way possible, as you have been a fantastic landlord thus far, and I love the unit. I'd like to have new roommate on the lease too as it makes things easier on 
SO and I as well. A 12% rent increase is just too exorbitant.

*LL: Ok no problem laurlala. U decide what u want to do and let me know. Thanx

*OP: I'm willing to go about this your way in terms of paperwork and the lease, and I'm even willing to discuss a raise in price calculated by the overall costs of utilities. I really don't think we've been unreasonable in all of this, and I hour I haven't created any bad blood.

*OP: Would you like to discuss this in person tonight?

*LL:No, my husband told me not to worry about. Thanx

*OP: Would he like to discuss it with us?

*LL: No, you go ahead and do what you want. No need to worry about it. Thanx

*OP: Okay, well we'd like to amend the lease to include her name if possible.

*LL: No that's ok, we'll just leave everything status quo

 

After that, she was a ghost. She watched my roommate move in, didnt even say hello to her. She'd say hi to me if I said it first, but otherwise ignored our presence completely.
 


May 1st at 11:15 pm, she serves us an N12 form, stating that the landlord or landlord's family member requires use of the unit. I find this suspicious for two reasons - when she has moved out the previous tenant, i was under the impression that it was for her son. furthermore, she changed the name of the landlord to her husband, and some person who apparently lives in their unit, who i have never seen or heard of. (I have a suspicion that this is a parent of an international student who was due to mov into our former apartment, and that they have struck a deal with this person to get us out.) I went to their apartment where I knocked on the door, and she opened and I said ""what the hell is this?"". She told me to read it. I said I had, and repeated ""what the hell is this?"" I told her that she knows that this is bullshit, and that I found it very suspicious that her family just gave up personal use of the unit and needed it again, a month later, after signing a lease with a tenant. She told me to take it up with the landlord. (who is apparently no longer her)

 

The next day, I get a letter saying that I came to their house at the wee hours of the night, banged on their door, and harassed and verbally abused the now landlords wife in an ""emotional and hysterical manner"" Then they accused me of doing damage to their home by slamming the front door (the glass in their front door has had a crack in it since October of last year)



I sent texts to the number with which my landlord had ALWAYS contacted me for the past year pleading with them to be reasonable, and asking if we had until the end of our lease to leave. Once again, that night, a letter slips under our door, more threatening this time, and full of more false accusations and exaggerations, informing us that we are on a month to month lease, and that we had sixty days to leave. It also informed us that they had not received our rent (we've been trying to figure out what the hell to do), and called us to tribunal regarding this.
 


Our power was shut off the next day due to repairs that i had forgotten about. I asked her to fix it:

*OP: Our power is not on. Please fix it.

*LL: You were sent a notice on April 30, 2013 about electrical upgrades to the meters and there would be power outages between the hours of 10 am and 4 pm

*LL: Also, you were hand delivered a letter from my husband, [name] on May 2, 2013 to communicate with him in writing for any issues you may have. Thank you

*OP: Oh I apologize, I thought this was still a valid method of communication with y.all. Does he have a cell that I can text him on?

*LL: You can txt him at [phone number]

*OP: Thank you, very sorry to bother you.

 

ANOTHER letter slips under our door that night informing me that I have been harassing the former landlord via text after being told only to do so in writing (Is text not writing?) and that they are going to sue us for a laundry list of accusations. It also told me that I had ""vehemently refused to contact toronto hydro to put the hydro bill in [my] name"" After I had emailed them multiple times the month earlier to do so, and they got back to me yesterday (may 3rd) at which point we set up our account. 

 
I have no idea what to do. I plan to find another place, as no place is worth this level of harassment, but I want it legally on record that all of this occurred, so that if any tenants have issues in the future, that the RTA board has proof of earlier complaints. How can I best proceed?
 
tl;dr :landlord wants more money illegally, does not get more money illegally, attempts eviction, makes our lives hell."

Today we Celebrate **EVERYTHING** StarWars. Here at /r/SubredditOfTheDay its become a time honored tradition. It started when SROTD first [started itself.](http://redd.it/h3ppm) And last year's feature was even [better.](http://redd.it/t6ldf) I don't think I can top it. I mean for god's sakes man, there was a poem, a prologue and even a disclaimer! [Ah....](http://i.imgur.com/JQSzoAN.gif) We'd also want to take this moment and honor the fine Jedi MODS Masters and their wonderful achievements. But to do so, you need to know their past. Here is a brief history. 

A long time ago in a subreddit far far away. /u/Noche created /r/StarWars and it was good. Then came a mysterious fellow by the name of /r/jaxspider who promised to bring peace to the ~~galaxy~~ subreddit. And so he did. He vanquished the blogspam siths and did away with the boring default CSS stylesheet. He formed a council of wise Jedi masters to help him, first came /u/Wazow the ever present and motivated one. Then one day /u/ugnaught bumped into them and it was destiny. Over time the council has grown and become even more powerful. Even today they work hard to keep the peace in the subreddit. ~~For the night is dark and full of terror~~ Something something darkside. They are updating the rules as of late so stay on the lookout for that mod post.

Normally we ask the mods questions to make you, the reader, know more about the subreddit. But this is Star Wars. Its an American institution at this point. If you don't know about Star Wars... have you been living under a rock for 40 years? Go to /r/StarWars, HoverZoom over the pictures, comment in the discussion threads, and enjoy yourself. If you love any part of Star Wars, be it light saber battles, Expanded Universe questions or even  something nostalgic this is the right place for you.

&gt; To spice up this feature I'll  ask you the readers some questions instead!

&gt;&gt;1. What was your first Star Wars memory?
2. Whats your favorite scene and why?
3. How excited are you about the new movies?
4. Would you let the wookie win?
5. In your own words why is The Empire Strikes Back the perfect sequel? 
6. How would you torture Jar Jar Binks to the death?
7. Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, young Obi Wan Kenobi. Fuck / Marry / Kill. Go.
8. Star Wars is not without it's cringe worthy moments. What real life moment related to Star wars do you still cringe to this day?
9. What one thing would you like to be officially retconned out of existence? 

**Warning** If I made a mistake or grammar error, please be patient with me. I haven't featured a post in a while. What with all these wonderful writers &amp; super eager interns doing amazing work, I've become quite rusty."

Camacho Corojo-
Personal favorite of mine, recommended to me by the B&amp;M owner. 

Romeo y Julietta Habana Reserve-
Delightful cigar. Great draw and survived the heavy winds on the golf course- smoked it down to a nub. 

Rocky Patel Vintage Connecticut-
A nice easy smoke, pretty light but enjoyable and a great stick to just pass the time as I watch some games. 

Camacho Triple Maduro-
Absolutely kicked my ass, had it over a bonfire this evening and my head was spinning but I loved every second of it. 

Just started smoking cigars slightly more than a year ago and trying to broaden my tastes and brand exposure. Suggestions?

Does anyone here know of any job opportunities either around the community or within their workplace?

I'm a UF engineering graduate with a minor in business admin (and music performance, in case that's interesting), with courses in technical writing, risk assessment and management, and computer programming. Since last summer, I've been working in IT, primarily doing desktop support and business development. Before that, I did an internship at a utility, teaching at a summer camp, and a few undergraduate research projects.

Additionally, I'm studying programming on my own, specifically Python and Java; I'm also fairly proficient in Fortran, and I'm expanding my skills in Android development. Information security and business analysis have become my primary interests, and I would like to eventually transition into those fields as a long-term career. However, I am open to any position where I can learn, utilize and expand my current skills, and enjoy what I do.

I've done a lot of project management and technical team leadership throughout my education and extracurricular activities. Previously, I obtained security clearances and have continued to maintain a clean background. I'm also okay with traveling within the Central Florida area, or further, provided that my home base can remain in Gainesville.

Anyway, if anyone does know of any leads in the area (technical or otherwise; I'm pretty open to anything), it would be of huge help. I can also send you my resume in a PM, along with my LinkedIn profile and email address for better correspondence. Thanks again for any help that you can provide!

Stuck. 22, out of University for a year, still a waiter, my hobbies dont seem interesting anymore.",[deleted],getdisciplined,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1drc9q/just_kinda_stuck_22_out_of_university_for_a_year/,"I thought I would come here seeking a little advice. 
I am 22 and from the UK. I graduated university last year in Music Business (to some its a joke degree, however Music Industry is all I've ever wanted to do. Plus such a transformative industry riddled with uncertainty intrigues me, you have to be so well rounded for it). 
 
  Anyway, I have played drums or 8/9 years and now I work 42+ hours a week. The job is very busy constantly, quite stressful. I started learning HTML, CSS, jQuery, Java, and I also started learning Japanese. I have been studying these things for 7/8 months and now all I do is work, come home, have a beer and go to bed. I see my girlfriend as often as I can, and I have a horrible predicament where internships turn me down in order to give the position in order to give somebody with less experience an opportunity. On the flip-side though no one will employ me because I dont have enough experience. 
    
Now I get up each day, sit in bed for an hour or two then get up. I have nothing to get up to anymore, my hobbies, my HTML computer stuff etc. I know nobody who shares that shares my interests in real life. I cant talk to anyone about anything I care about without boring them to death. I don't play drums much anymore, I haven't practise Japanese in weeks, and I lazily go over my coding.
    
What do I do? I get up quite early, eat well, drink lots of water, I feel I should either apply for jobs I have no interest in and give up on what I want to do for a couple of years and live the normal 9-5 with weekends rather than 12 hour shifts that start at midday with no weekends/ evenings/days off. I just like being a waiter as if I get an internship I can be more flexible with my hours and work around it while paying rent etc. 
    
I apologise if the format of this seems terrible, but any advice, stories, direction I would appreciate it. This isn't normal is it? It can't be.

edit: I a word."
1dr90n,3,2013-05-05,How do I stop being so angry?,GravidRak,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1dr90n/how_do_i_stop_being_so_angry/,"Here's a rundown of the people involved for clarity:

J: boyfriend of six years. Relationship was rocky, lots of emotional abuse punctuated by good times. We lived together for over two years then separated after a domestic violence situation. The day after I found I was pregnant and told him about 2 weeks later. He moved in with his mom and I moved in with my Foster parents. I told him he could cut contact and not worry about me or the baby and that I wouldn't come after him for child support. He said he would like to make it work. We lived apart for the pregnancy and when our son was ten weeks old I moved in with him and his family for 2.5 years. Last year we moved into a rental house and had our civil wedding ceremony in December.

E: met her about two years ago as she was going through a painful breakup. Her boyfriend had cheated on her. She found out she was pregnant right after and I helped her throughout. She and the dad tried to make it work, but she ended up basically cheating on him and dumping him him 2 months into a year lease just as he lost his job. I advised her against getting back together with him and moving in with him, especially when she was more-or-less with this other Guy. Everything got ugly, but I supported her and ended up being her doula and breastfeeding support. 

Three months after the wedding, j blindsided me and separated from me. Two days later, he moved e in to our bedroom. I was too dumbstruck to protest. Her daughter was 9 months old and e basically let her trash the house with her finger foods. I became a maid. My son was confused and upset and I didn't make waves as to not upset him further. I stayed her friend for some reason. This went on for a month. Two weeks in, I became suicidally depressed and told both e and j I needed her to leave because I was going to end up killing myself. My son was becoming more erratic and upset. 

Neither cared. I found myself thinking my son would be better off without me and realized I was in the bathroom with a straight razor and a bottle of muscle relaxers. I put them up, called my psych and then called a friend, S, went over to his house and told him everything, sobbing. He is actually J's friend as well, but j told me to go talk to him. S was disgusted and furious and has given me his house as a place of solitude since. 

Anyway, e and j had a falling out because she was riding the line between two guys and j asked me for another chance. I gave it. He lasted a week before he was talking to her again about dreams, torture of being apart, and etc. I told him to.get his shit together and separated, but eventually told him I couldn't trust him and this relationship wasn't going to work. 

I'm stuck in this lease with him for 10 more months. I have no self-respect, pride, self-esteem, anything. I feel subhuman. I'm incredibly depressed when I'm in this house. I feel empty and the.only time I feel joy is when I'm with my son or S. J is still talking and hanging with E, even though he hates her kid. He regrets what he did and resents me for not wanting to be with him. I am so angry at him and e to the point of hatred sometimes. I don't want to be because I wont be able to bear the next 10 months. I need to be civil. The last straw for me was me trying to call him to to pick up milk for our son to have him reject my call and find out he has been forbidden to answer my call when he's with her. We also all work at the same place, which really rocks.

They feel they were in the right. Nobody has ever hurt me so badly in my life. In addition, j has told me he.only had the wedding to ""shut me up"". My youngest sister is happily married and expecting her first and my middle sister's boyfriend is custom creating a ring and planning a perfect proposal while she's in China on an internship. I feel so jealous and betrayed. I have decided to never pursue a relationship again and just focus on my son. What kills me is j is taking my son because a) he makes more money and I will have to work two jobs to stay nearby (I.don't believe in child support in this case) and b) I don't want to risk this level of depression returning and affecting my child. I probably sound like the worst mother ever and I have sobbed myself to sleep nightly over the guilt.

I'm getting into counselling and just trying to focus on my time with my son and the fun and long talks I have with S. He really helps to center and rebuild me. Oh, and I've lost 53 pounds in two months on a keto diet/exercise regimen and only have 63 more to go til my weight goal! 

Does anyone have any tips to defeat the.rage? I just don't know what to do? I think I.have rolled the pain in a shell of.anger as to not feel it.

Thanks for reading. :)

The nasty person is still at her current library job, where I haven't heard good things, but because her department head was meek and lazy the nasty one was never reprimanded and when used as a references apparently didn't want to upset her employee. 

Try to sabotage the new hire by letting the school know? Just ignore it? Find her weakness and commit a fun prank to mess with her?

Christmas 2011. I was in a relationship with a girl, my first and only serious one, for about 1.5 years. We had a lease to live together in the fall. She was on a Christmas Break trip with her dad in Cancun. She called the first few nights to let me know how her trip was going, but stopped a few days in. I thought nothing of it. Mostly because I spent the entire week building a custom-designed table for our future apartment. She came back Christmas Day and I surprised her with the table in front of my whole family. It was a great moment. 

The next day she tells me we had to talk. ...What. She sits me down and tells me she had been hooking up with another guy pretty much all week in Cancun. I was devastated, but willing to give her a second chance to make it work. It just wasn't the same though. 

I spent that New Year's drinking alone watching Avatar's special features haha. I was so alone, living at home with my parents. 

Things lasted a few more days until she called and broke up with me. That was January 9th. It kicked off a pretty terrible week. Later that week, my 35-year-old cousin hung himself. My mom, a breast cancer survivor, was unexpectedly in the hospital (turned out to be dehydration), and a few days later my best friend's grandfather died. All in one week. Not to mention, at work I was electrocuted one day, stuck part of my hand in a fryer, and my car slid off the road early in the morning. That week was hell. 

Also looming in the distance was the uncertainty of graduation. I was a Geography major and had fulfilled all of my requirements except finding an internship in the field. It would have been possible for me to not get my degree because I couldn't find a job. Feels a little backwards, doesn't it? (But that argument is neither here nor there). 

I was in a really rough spot, so I took to my fraternity (yeah, I'm an actual bro) and laid everything out to them in an email. I'm a pretty introverted person, so my problems are often internalized, but I just really needed some help. 

After that, I got really close with some of the best dudes I know. It was the perfect remedy for the negativity in my life. I got happier, got an internship, got over the ex. Things were looking up. Summer started and I left my job at McDonald's to start my internship. Life was good...and then I fucked it up...

Out drinking one night with some friends, I decided I wanted to go home. I woke up about an hour later as my car was fading off the road into a 6-ft ditch. Yep. I'm a dumbass and lucky no one was hurt. I was facing an OVI charge, which would surely screw over my future. I lawyered up and manage to get it dropped to a Reckless Operation, due to a number of issues with the police's procedures and reports. As part of the deal, I was sentenced to 30 days in jail. Thankfully 27 of those were suspended and I was placed on a 2-year unsupervised probation. The other 3 days were assigned to a driver's intervention program. 

Facing almost $3000 in total charges related to my accident, I had no choice but to get to work. I was granted work privileges, so I went back to work at McDonalds. I let the internship know what had happened, as it was transportation related, and they were okay with it. They let me finish out my term there. 

For almost 3 months, I would wake up at 6am, work the internship from 7a-4p, drive to McDs to work 5p-10p, then head home and sleep. I did that Monday-Friday, plus an 8-hour shift on Saturdays. I had almost no social life. It was exhausting, but necessary. I set myself up for it and had to deal with the consequences. It was no one's fault but my own. 

The internship ended in September of 2012. I was not offered an extension due to ""budget constraints."" So back to McDonalds it was. I had been a manager there throughout college, so that's how I invested most of my time while looking for a ""real job."" 

Application after application, resume after cover letter, email after follow-up email. I never got an interview. Not a single one. Kept sending them out regardless of how defeating it was. It was disheartening. So many of my friends were graduated and getting jobs, making money, getting girls, etc, etc, etc. and here I was...  a 24-year-old college graduate, living at home with his parents, in the middle of nowhere, on probation, working full-time as a Manager at McDonalds. 

For far too long, that is how I would value myself. I was constantly comparing my situation to that of my peers, and deriving my value and self-worth from that. I was down. I was low. I was ready to give up the job hunt and accept my fate that I would never do anything bigger or better that just work at McDonalds the rest of my life. 

Fast forward to February 2012. Still working at McDs, just grinding it out. It sucked, but I really liked most of the people I worked with. Early February though, I was hit again. One of my crew, 19-years-old, overdosed on a variety of things and died unexpectedly. Great kid. Saved up money to go to school. Was set to go to college in the fall. Then he was gone. This really shook a lot of people, myself included. Too damn young to go out like that. JC, my man, I miss you. 

March rolls around and I'll be damned, tragedy strikes again. Three sorority sisters from my university were struck head-on by a wrong-way driver 10-miles out of town on their way to Spring Break. One of those girls was my date to the final formal I had gone to with my fraternity the year before. SH, you are an angel. 

So much loss and pain in the two biggest areas of my life. My coworkers reeling from the loss. My university and Greek community reeling from their losses. Then I headed into April. I was at work and got a phone call from an old friend that one of my friends that I had grown up with was in an accident and things weren't looking good. I come from a really small town and had grown up with this girl pretty much my whole life. She was the second girl I ever kissed. She was one of my dearest friends. I left work to go up to the hospital to wait, as the doctors were running tests to check for brain activity. 

It was odd. I had grown apart a little from a lot of people back home, even though I still lived close-by. We are an incredibly close group of friends though, and so many of my best friends from my youth were there. It was a reunion of the worst kind. 

Anyway, waiting for the results still kind of haunts me. I was there when they delivered the results. I was there to hear her family howl when announced she had no brain activity and was only being kept going by life support. I was there to grieve with my close friends and family. I was there to say goodbye to a beautiful soul. AG, I love you, girl. 

Two years of just awful experiences. So low. So much loss and pain. Throughout so much of the years though, I lost focus of what was important in life. I focused more on being financially successful than leading a successful and meaningful life. 

Then I found this sub. It was almost like a switch went off after everything I had been though. My introverted and analytical nature, coupled with the motivation rampant here, made me realize that happiness and value are products of my own mindset and efforts. Quote after quote from here rang true. I began to litter the wall of my bedroom with post-its, each with messages taken from posts here. 

""Feed the right wolf.""
""Just because life is hard, doesn't mean life is bad.""
""Empty wallets never held anyone back; empty hearts and empty minds hold them back.""
And on and on and on. I began to keep a journal, to keep everything in perspective and as an outlet for my thoughts.

From there, still living at home, I decided to just make the very best of whatever situation I was in. I made a conscious decision to no longer consider my self-worth from the money in my wallet. I figured if I couldn't be rich in money, I would be rich in spirit and life. 

By now we're at Summer 2012. I started working out and dropped 10 pounds. I got a girlfriend. It only lasted a month because she moved, but whatever haha. I started a new position a McDs, which came with more money. I began to save up and budget appropriately. I was making all the right moves necessary to be happy and successful in life. I spent the rest of the year just investing in my life and relationships with all of the great people in it.

The grind was hard, but worth it. Yesterday was my last day at McDonalds, after 8.5 years. I'm moving out to Cleveland today to live with my best friend, who got me in at the company he works for. I'll be out of the country life, into the city, making double what I would at McDs. Bankers hours. No more coming home covered in grease and who knows what else. 

I haven't made it yet. I don't know it if I ever will. My story hopefully inspires someone out there to keep going. Not sure how the editing will look, since I'm typing this on my phone. Thank you for taking the time to read this, if you do. Don't ever quit.

1dpyzu,21,2013-05-05,I 24M Met a Great Girl 24F and Now She Is Not Ready for a Relationship,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1dpyzu/i_24m_met_a_great_girl_24f_and_now_she_is_not/,"Sorry for the long write up here, but I am pretty confused right now as to what has occurred over the past few days. I (M24) met a girl (F24) a few weeks ago through mutual friends.  She’s a graduate student and knows where she is going in life and is very mature for her age. We hit it off pretty much on the first date and spent over 4 hours having a few drinks and just going back and forth about everything.


__
The second date went even better than the first. We went mini golfing, then to Froyo where we talked for almost 2 hours. After we drove back to get her car from the mini golf place we ended up going across the street and kissing, etc. for a while. Again, the date ended very well.


__
For the third date I picked her up from school.  We went to a nice restaurant, had a great romantic meal and laughed and talked the entire time. I then drove her home and met her mom, which we talked for about ten minutes and I got a good “vibe” from her. After her mom went to bed we talked for a while and then ended up having sex. Sex was incredible and the night ended well.


__
A few days later she invited me over to her house making the meal of MY CHOICE. I of course brought two great wines of her favorite type to go with the meal. The meal was delicious. Good conversation the entire time including when we got back. Ended up having sex again.


__
Two nights later she had me over to meet some close friends for snacks, drinks, and various board games.  Things went pretty good overall, the friends generally seemed cool and we all laughed throughout the night. A couple hours after midnight some of her friends began to crash out, so we went to her bedroom and talked/kissed and went to sleep.


__
Few days later for our 5th date I was going to take her out for drinks because she aced her last final of her first year of grad school. She ended up not getting out of her internship until a couple hours later than expected so she recommended that we just hang out at her house and have some drinks there. After we had drank some and were talking on the couch I told her that I wanted to be in a relationship with her. She told me at this time that her last long term relationship ended a few months ago. I had no idea up until this point that it ended so recently. The reason she ended the relationship with her last bf was because he did not want to get married, have kids so she felt there really was no future with him. I told her that I was okay with not getting in a relationship right now and just continue to see where this goes. We talked for some time about relationships, etc. We ended up having sex again, for another fairly great end to our little night.


__
The afternoon the next day she messaged me that her friend had canceled on plans to hang out with her after her internship and asked if I would like to come over and watch a movie. I did and we went to pick out a movie. Somehow we ended up picking up a movie that had direct parallels to her last relationship. It was supposed to be a comedy but it got pretty serious. Literally 80 percent through the movie she gets a weird look on her face and goes this movie is terrible I don’t think I can watch it. I agree with her and we shut it off. She then tells me that it’s reminding her of her last relationship. At this point I’m thinking uh-oh, we have been holding hands the whole movie, things going relatively well and then this. We go downstairs and she tells me that she told her mom earlier that night about what we had talked about the previous night, with her not being ready to be in a relationship. Her mom apparently said that she needs time to be single and learn to live like that for a while. She also told her to “be careful” with regard to me, which I took to mean be careful not to hurt me. When she told her mom I was coming back over that night, she said her mom rolled her eyes. I again reassured her that I was fine just keeping things the way they are, not jumping into a relationship just yet.


The next day we only sent a few texts, which was definitely less than usual but I figured that she was just busy.

On the 3rd I texted her Good morning! and she didn’t respond until that evening with basically:

Sorry I haven’t been talking to you as much. I realized I need more time being by myself. I’m not ready for a relationship like I thought I was. I am sorry to disappoint you :(

I responded saying that she has yet to disappoint me. That I understand that she needs more time. And also that knowing that we both like each other, I’d hate to see something possibly great for both of us thrown away just because she needs time.

She then said sorry if she’s “mia” for a while but she needs time to herself and to focus on stuff other than a relationship.

I clarified if she doesn’t want to hang out or talk at all and she said she does but that she just wants a “breather for a bit”.

I told her “Okay. That’s fine just give me a call whenever you’re ready”

She said OK. Thanks for being so understanding. It’s not like I just wanna stop talking completely but I think you know what I mean.

I actually don’t know what she means by that but I figured I would give it a week off from talking to her and see if she comes to her senses after a cool off period.

What are my fellow redditor’s thoughts on this? I’m sorry if this is fragmented, this is my first ever post about something like this.

TLDR: Met awesome girl that got out of a LTR a few months ago and suddenly changed her mind about wanting to be in a relationship. What is the deal?"
1dpyad,1,2013-05-05,No Direction,kersius,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1dpyad/no_direction/,"So a few years ago, I was working a dead end office job. I was really failing there, playing video games and surfing the web instead of doing my work. I started out as a star employee but slowly dropped. Finally, one day I went for a walk and decided that I was done. I have thought a lot about suicide over the past 12-15 years but that afternoon I made the decision that I was going to finally do it. A great weight lifted off my shoulders and I felt free for the first time in years. I decided to focus and finish college and study what I wanted to study: social work not business. After all, what's the worst that could happen? I could always come back to suicide if it didn't work out. I worked my butt off. Went to community college and graduated with a 4.0, perfect GPA. For context, when I went to college the first time, I dropped out after 2 years with maybe a 2.0. I then transferred to one of the best public universities in the US. I was still doing well, learning a lot and doing well in my classes. I got into the golden key society for the top 15% of my class. Last summer I had a great internship and learned a lot. I had a tough fall semester but still pulled off As and Bs. I start getting my usual anxiety about school and am nervous about applying to graduate school to get my Master's which I need to do what I want to do. I end up only applying to 1 graduate program, the one I think I am most likely to get into. The others are out of state and I can't see spending that kind of $ in loans to attend them. Fast forward to now. I get my notice that I didn't get into graduate school. The program that was supposed to be my ""safety school"" rejected me. Now I don't know what to do. I'm afraid that I will have to return to the hell that is retail, and that I won't be able to get to where I wanted to go. A BA in Sociology doesn't help much unless you're going to graduate school. 
Now I'm feeling that I gave it a shot, I tried my best and failed. I will graduate in two weeks but it won't help me much. Career wise I'm not much closer than I was 3 years ago. I've barely been able to hold on and keep pushing myself in school knowing that I was on track to fulfill my dreams. Now that it's been derailed I don't think I have it in me to keep going. I tried my best and it wasn't good enough. Some people just aren't meant to make it I guess. 
I look back at the decision I made 3 years ago and I'm having trouble not following through this time. I made a deal with myself then that I would give it a shot and I did. I really did, I tried my hardest and I failed. My fears were confirmed. I just don't know what to do.
TL;dr: Made a deal 3 years ago to wait on suicide plans and to try one more time. Didn't get into grad school which I need for career. Trying to find a reason not to commit suicide now."

I actively developed for Android over the past 4 months, at a company where I was a co-op ( intern).

I was looking at Robotium and I actually implemented automated testing at work, my employers were really impressed. 

But a point on its [website](https://code.google.com/p/robotium/) has me confused. Under the section titled ""Robotium provides the following benefits:"", the fifth point says:

Could anyone give me a technical insight as to what that means or even just where can I get more info on what that means?

1dt01r,1,2013-05-06,Can't decide what to do about my marriage [29m/28f],neversure42,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1dt01r/cant_decide_what_to_do_about_my_marriage_29m28f/,"My wife and I have been together for about 5 years now. We got married two years ago. This is my second marriage; I had an ill-advised first marriage when I was way too young that ended after about 10 months. No kids.

I don't even know how to start this. Things seemed really great when we met and for the first few years I was incredibly happy and in love. It only seemed to get bad around the time we got married.

We got married by a judge at the courthouse, mainly to get her on my insurance with a ""proper"" ceremony to follow. People found out about this (my fault) and this ruined her expectation of a ""proper"" ceremony so we never had one. Resentment built up over this for a long time. A year later, she was late getting home one night and acting suspicious. I glanced over at her phone and she was texting a male coworker. After a long string of denials, I found out she had a romantic interest in this guy. She had been giving him rides to work for a while.

What followed was the most emotionally painful period of time I have ever endured. She kept telling me she was done with this guy, then I'd find out she was still seeing him. It went on for a couple months. Finally I couldn't take it anymore and I asked her to move out. She wanted to call it a ""separation"" and not a divorce because she didn't feel ready to let go of me just yet. While she was moved out, she started seeing two additional guys. 

Now, all of this behavior is crazy and way out of character for her. She had always been a kind, empathic, sweet person, and I never would have thought she was capable of hurting me this badly. She had been having trouble with anxiety in grad school and had started seeing a psychiatrist who put her on an astounding variety of things: Klonopin, xanax, lamictal, wellbutrin, in addition to vicodin, soma and ritalin her regular doctor was prescribing her and a daily weed habit (she was high pretty much any time she wasn't at school or work, and sometimes went to those things high too.) I felt at the time like she was on so much stuff that she just wasn't herself. She wrecked her car twice during this period. She had always had a tendency to smoke too much weed and I never thought she needed the vicodin or ritalin prescriptions, but she seemed to manage that stuff pretty well. The other stuff just sent her into a tailspin, I think. 

A big part of the pain from this period of time was how worried I was about her. I knew she was on way too much medication and I worried that she would get taken advantage of, or would destroy her career, or would flat out die in a car wreck. It wasn't even about wanting her back, it was about wanting her to be healthy and safe.

Fast forward a few months. I make a decision that I am done with her and ask her for a divorce, in the same week that she finds out she's going to have to go to Colorado for an internship. She tells me that when she pictures herself starting a new life there, she pictures me with her, that she loves me and misses me, and she wants me to come with her.

I think about it (shit, I've always wanted to move to Colorado anyway) and tell her that if she gets off all the drugs I'll do it. She agrees and spends the summer weaning off of everything. I thought maybe a fresh start would be good for both of us. So we move to Colorado, and we've been here for about a year now. Things seem much more stable; she still probably smokes too much weed, but she's off all the other crap, and I don't believe she's still cheating. She seems genuinely remorseful for the things that happened and she's seeing a therapist to try to deal with the parts of herself that led her to do these things.

The thing is, it seems like something within me has changed. I remember the way I felt about her when I proposed, how happy I was. I remember fantasizing about the children we could have, about growing old together. I remember how proud of her I was, always talking up her grad school accomplishments. I don't feel those things anymore. I don't feel like I can trust her. I feel a lot of doubt and fear about the future. She wants to have children soon and I just don't know; I feel like I would need to see a lot more stability from her, for a long period of time, before I could think about bringing a child into this.

I think that if we weren't married, if she was just my girlfriend, I would dump her and leave. But since we're married, and especially because this is my second marriage, it seems like a much harder decision. I don't want to admit defeat and give up on it. I desperately want it to work, but I'm not sure I will ever feel the same way about her again, not sure I will ever be able to trust her. I'm not sure if those feelings will ever come back, or how long I should wait for them. And I want to keep my word. And I don't want the stigma of being twice-divorced.

I have no idea how to even begin to think about making this decision. Neither choice feels particularly appealing.

**tl;dr: Wife cheated on me for months right after we got married, and now even though things seem to be better I'm not sure I want to be married to her. I'm also not sure I want to be divorced. I don't know how to make this decision.**"
1dsvit,109,2013-05-06,"I'm (20F) currently dating the man (42M) who ""molested"" me when I was much younger. AMA",confessHer,confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1dsvit/im_20f_currently_dating_the_man_42m_who_molested/,"I say ""molested"" in quotes because while I'm sure that's what most people would call it that I didn't feel taken advantage of or harmed at all when our first relationship began. That later changed and I have hated him for years. Now we're dating again and all my friends know about it is that I'm dating a much older man. Let me try to explain.

When I was eleven years old my best friend's parents were divorced. She spent every other weekend at her dad's house and sometimes I spent the weekend there with her. His place was outside of the city, a small horse farm with riding horses, goats, a five minute walk from a lake, really nice place. So much different than the city.

Mr. Dean was really cool too. He would bring us out for ice cream, let us just wander his property without constantly checking up on us, that sort of thing. He treated us like mature adults not little kids and I loved that. I even told him that once one night after my friend had fallen asleep. That's when he gave me his YIM ID and said that if I ever needed to talk to an adult about something I didn't want my parents to know about, he'd be there for me.

So we became YIM buddies. I kept this secret from everyone, including my friend, because like Mr. Dean said his daughter might think he's using me to spy on her (he did ask about her a lot: how was her home life, was she happy in school, things like that). As for my parents he pointed out that they wouldn't understand how a girl my age and a man his age could be friends. That much was definitely true, my parents were very over-protective. So he was my secret friend and I thought it was really cool to have a grown man as a friend, especially one who was always complimenting me so much and telling me how special I was. It wasn't long before I developed a crush on him.

It took me awhile to realize he was flirting with me. Thinking back about it I now realize he had been flirting from the start but at eleven years of age I had little self confidence, especially with older boys and men, and just couldn't believe a guy like Mr. Dean would be physically attracted to me. That changed when he found out from his daughter that we had taken my parents new digital camera out for a school project, probably hinting she wanted one for herself (she was always trying to get him to buy her things). When he asked me about it online I said that yes, my parents had a new digital camera and it was awesome. That's when he asked me to take some ""special pictures"" of myself for him.

He didn't ask for nudes at first, only pix of me in my underwear. I remember being so embarrassed when he asked for that. But he explained it would make him feel special to know that I trusted him enough with such pictures especially if I was taking them only for him. So one day I relented and took about a dozen pictures of me in my nicest undies, all while making ridiculously silly poses due to my embarrassment, and sent them to his e-mail account.

After that things began to escalate really fast. He sent me a picture of his penis with the title ""Look what your pictures did to me!"". He then asked me for nudes and by now I was feeling older and sophisticated so I complied. He started asking me if I ever touched myself (I did) and then if I ever thought of him while I touched myself (I did). That led us to full on Internet sex. He then started providing me with passwords to (legal) porn websites, asking me to watch various videos and then chat about them. 

Basically within two months of beginning our online friendship he was turning me into his personal little pervert girl. And I was happy to be that for him, I wanted to make him happy. Whenever I disappointed him he would disappear for a few days and when he came back I would be so relieved that I would do anything I could to make sure he didn't do that again. He was manipulating me like a master psychologist or something which isn't much of a stretch: I eventually learned that he went to grad school for a masters in social work and then interned for awhile as a adolescent psychologist. He never finished the internship because his stay at home business really took off and he ended up focusing on that exclusively. But still he had the skills. He knew how to turn a bratty tirade of mine into the exactly conversation he wanted within minutes. He especially knew how to use my insecurities and desire to please him to his advantage.

That's what led to our first real sexual encounter. I was almost twelve now and he said that it was time for us to spend some real time together. He came up with the whole plan and then one day after school I met him at a nearby gas station and he brought me back to his farm for the night. My parents thought I was at a sleepover at another friend's house. He had a cell phone that he'd given me the number for to give for them. When they called later that evening, which of course they did, he answered and pretended to be my mystery friend's father. We ended up using the fake friend throughout the course of our relationship with my parents never figuring out that she didn't exist.

He started things off with me slow, very slow. I'd never even kissed a boy before and he knew that. He also knew how extremely nervous I was. That first time we basically just made out but we did both spend pretty much all of that night naked. He fingered me to what I mistakenly thought was an orgasm and then he showed me how to reciprocate by jacking him off. 

After that night we started seeing each other a lot more often. I lost my virginity to him shortly after my 12th birthday. We ended up ""dating"" like that for about two years. During that time he really messed with my head as much as he did with my body. He explained that promiscuity was a natural thing and that I shouldn't turn into people like my parents who saw sex as this dirty, evil thing. He actualy encouraged me to be with other boys and that's what I did in my stupid attempt to please him. I got pregnant when I was thirteen, most likely from a boy from my neighborhood. After the abortion my parents cracked down on me even more than ever so it was awhile before I could see Mr. Dean again. But we saw each other most nights, online, sharing pictures of each other and talking about the most perverted things imaginable. He once convinced me to try and seduce my older brother which led to his disgust and horror and a threat to tell our parents. When I tried again due to Mr. Dean's insistence he followed through on his threat and my parents put me into therapy. That was the beginning of the end of my relationship with Mr. Dean.

Up until two months ago I've hated him for what he did to me. He definitely abused me, both physically and mentally. He made me love him but convinced me through subtle means that I wasn't really worthy of love myself. He exposed me to things no child should be exposed to and gave me a warped view of sexuality and relationships. 

And despite all that I am now dating him. For the last two months since randomly running into me at work we have been dating openly. He hasn't changed much either and I hate myself for being too weak to do the right thing and cut him off. But there's this part of me I can't explain that enjoys reliving the past. After a wild spree after the last time I saw Mr. Dean back when I was fourteen I had only been with two men in five years, both serious relationships. Sure I've been a bit of a party girl at times but I haven't been a slut, not until I started seeing Mr. Dean again two months ago. Now he's involved me in three three ways, all with different male friends of his, and one semi-gangbang.

None of my friends know about any of my recent behavior or the past Mr. Dean and I share. Outwardly he comes across as a normal, educated, very intelligent and polite man. Some of my friends initially questioned why I'd date someone old enough to be my father but all of them have come to accept him. Some are even jealous because he's extremely handsome and obviously very well off financially. He showers me with gifts and will be taking me to Puerto Rico next month for an entire week and he's paying for everything. All of my friends think he's a romantic and I let them believe that. But none of them know the truth of our past or what he is currently trying to return me to in the present: he wants me to be his doting little pervert girl again and he has been succeeding. Worst part is that I don't know if I want him to fail. Just the thought of him getting bored with me or something makes me upset. 

I'll try to read any questions you might have and answer them through this afternoon or if you just want to comment or give advice that's fine. If you viciously attack me for being a horrible person I'll just ignore you though."

Dated for three years, two of the years were LDR.  I love her, and I feel she makes me feel happier then I have ever felt by myself or with another girl.

Problem is I'm in medical school about to be MS2 (2nd year).  I have two years of schooling left and then three years of residency.  She's in California and I'm in New York.  I want her to move in with me in a year.   She wants to but she is too afraid of her family.  She still live at home and still needs permission to go go hang out on weekends and no overnight trips.

Its frustrating.  Waiting.... I don't know when we will start our life together.  She says she definitely will in three years when I start my residency (mandatory internship for doctors).

I mean a 1 year wait compared to 3 years seem like nothing in the scheme of things, but emotionally I'm frustrated.  Part of me wants to end it when I get back after finals in 16 days.  Other part of me says she is worth the wait.  I'm more frustrated at her inability to stand up to family.  If she didn't want to go to NY and wants me to comeback to California, I will be fine with it.  Problem is she does want to go to NY, but she ""can't"". 

I tell her this and she say wait for a year and see how it goes.  She is trying to summon courage to move out first in an apartment 15mins away from home.  Problem is she had apartment for two months and still haven't told family yet.

I can't fault her family, since her dad died when she was 6, brother raised her practically.  So he is really protective of her.  Talking about juggling jobs in high school and college to support family type of sacrifice.

Any advice?"

1drug0,1,2013-05-05,Transgender Fundraiser,tufforg,fundraiser,https://www.reddit.com/r/fundraiser/comments/1drug0/transgender_fundraiser/,"My name is Jacob Rostovsky, I'm a 22 year old transgender male, student and Point Foundation scholar who is working on getting their non-profit off the ground. As you may know, getting a non-profit started can be really difficult, and has many expenses. As a college student, all of my finances are spent to pay for classes and books. I’m currently working 40 hours a week at a non-paid internship, so I cannot have any other source of income.

Ever since I transitioned at 14 years old, I knew that I wanted to dedicate my life to helping the transgender community in all possible ways. I know my soon to be non-profit, TUFF, will change the transgender community and help to better so many lives, especially those of our at risk youth.

TUFF (Trans United with Family and Friends) needs help getting its 501c and raising money for supplies to outreach to the community! You can help!!
Since I was fifteen, I've wanted to work in the transgender community, trying to help individuals less fortunate than I was. Realizing how expensive transition is, and how many insurance companies don't cover anything in that area, I knew someone had to help those who couldn't afford to transition.

I've realized that once a person medically transitions, their entire life changes. They are happier, confident and hopeful, and for some people this is the first time in their lives they've felt like this. I don't want anyone to be held back from giving the world their all and reaching their full potential just because they can't afford to transition.

What is TUFF? TUFF is a non-profit organization, based in Los Angeles, that gives financial assistance to transgender and gender variant individuals, and can be used towards the cost of transition and medical needs. The money is distributed on an as needed basis. Recipients must apply for an award, and are chosen based on their financial need, personal, social, and advocacy goals for the future.

Who can apply for funds? Anyone who identifies along the transgender/gender variant spectrum, regardless of their financial needs. Applicants must fill out an application form that requires them to provide information about their medical transition history and financial needs. They must also submit 2 essays that ask about their future goals and involvement within the transgender/gender variant community.
What is this fundraiser going to help TUFF with? Right now, as executive director and founder of TUFF, I am using my own funds to pay to file paper work, purchase fliers, buttons and posters and travel across the countries to various conferences and workshops to spread the word about TUFF. As a college student, using my own income has proven to be extremely difficult and hard, especially when I also need to fund my education. By donating to this fundraiser, you can help launch TUFF and fulfill my dream of running and creating this non-profit. 

I know that left and right there are campaigns online asking you to donate. But know, this is an extremely important cause that can help save thousands of lives.
I ask that you spread this message to anyone you see fit, and to help get the word of my fundraiser out there.

Thank you so much for taking the time to read this and thank you in advance for your donation,

Jacob Rostovsky

1drh6p,4,2013-05-05,"Wiser redditors, How do I stop stagnating and stop wasting life? My life is going NO WHERE.",geeewee,GetMotivated,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/1drh6p/wiser_redditors_how_do_i_stop_stagnating_and_stop/,"My life isn't moving forward at all. I feel trapped in and I want to do something about it.

Please someone tell me how. 

A week ago my 22end birthday passed and even for being young I have not even done simple things people my age have done. I'm not depressed. I don't want to feel better, I want something to change. when I look objectively at my life it's just really bad, and yet I can't see my life improving.

I had a pretty bad childhood and grew up as a latch key kid with little support(I was an immigrant and my parents were usually busy), my childhood was filled with bullying and not fitting in due different background which caused some serious lack of self esteem, confidence issues, and inferiority complexes.

I'm currently not depressed at all but the state of my life has really been stagnate for the past few years. My life is generally tedious and uninteresting, yet I feel I'm not in any position to change anything about it. I want to get out of this but I feel like there's dead ends everywhere and it causes this immense feeling of extreme frustration and feeling of being trapped. 

I graduated HS 4 years ago now and I've been attending a small boring community college. I didn't feel passionate about anything and couldn't figure out what I wanted to do which caused some serious time wasting and bad grades. The place was packed and I often couldn't get any classes I needed which wasted a lot of time. I began taking classes I didn't need so I could acquire priority in registration. During my time at community college I often had extreme bouts of negative emotions, felt depressed, extremely lonely, bored, directionless, regretful. I withdrew from a lot of classes and this screwed me over. I had nothing to strive for, no goal, I was going through the motions, and began to have issues sleeping and started having awful grades, this kept going down in spiral. The campus was often empty, drab, and no one was around. There were no clubs. I just wanted to get out and I could not. I'm socially proficient, yet despite all attempts I found it extremely difficult to make friends at community college(due to the nature of the place).

I constantly feel like my failures eat up the present and destroy my future. everything constantly repeats.

I graduated HS without accomplishing a thing, without good memories, friends, or or any accomplishments. I couldn't get accepted into the university of my dreams and 4 years later I still can't.

I entered jr college full of regret, pain, and loneliness. I spent the first year without a single friends. Massive depression, massive regret, loneliness, my grades suffered. I was totally apathetic and unmotivated, and even suicidal. just wanted some friends. Loneliness was crushing. My eye was never on the ball, I didn't even know what to major in, I didn't know where I was going, where I wanted to transfer or anything. I was completely lost for years and in limbo, this lack of goals led to massive failure. I messed up in a lot of classes and could have passed many of them since the courses are easy as cake, but I've always had tons of problems, depression, massive insomnia, lack of motivation, loneliness, no girl, no friends, etc and withdrew a ton of classes. My GPA is awful, it's 2.9 and it's embarrassing. I can't even wake up in the morning. I have massive insomnia. I felt like a failure and still do.

-21 I finally decided on a major. My mood has stabilized significantly. I'm currently working towards my major of choice. I feel bad that I fucked up again, it feels like everything just keeps repeating itself. I've been aware of it for years but have no idea how to fix it. I just keep making the same mistakes again.

-22 During the last few years I put significant attention towards my social life, changing the way I dress, talking to people, becoming social. I'm an excellent socializer and extremely quick on my feet. I still have no new friends(due to the commuting nature of jr college) but I'm better with women. I still feel like a failure in my life though. I want to be successful.

I'm 22 and I don't have a degree. I don't even have a girlfriend. I even got a second chance to change my life when I entered jr college and I fucked up again.

I FEEL SO BEHIND in life. I have done NOTHING for the last four years, NOTHING. I don't know how to advance my life further.

I feel trapped in college. I just want to graduate and get out and have some sort of ""new"" accomplishment for myself. My life is not moving forward and I don't know what to do.

I spent the two years or so slowly improving myself even more, talking to people, dressing better, going to the gym every so often, but not much changed in my life. I still have only 3 friends and no social network to speak of. My weekends are spent at home, yet I highly dislike being at home all the time, I often feel VERY alone and VERY lonely. I did finally just recently find a girl and we went on a date, went well. I do look good on the outside and people often assume some very positive things about me(That I'm cool, have friends and that I'm intelligent and get good grades and have my life together), but the reality is I'm a failure. I often feel very odd when people compliment something positive about me.

--Compared to many people I am incredibly underdeveloped life experience/success wise for my age, yet at the same time I have the potential but no conducive environment for it. I'm not around anyone successful, I'm not around anyone my age who's doing something fun, or interesting, I don't have a group, there's no one for me to ""network"" off of. I'd love to get into a niche, or meet some person who's doing something interesting, or be in a place where something is happening. I'm still in the same town I was when I graduated, surrounded the same people, and experiencing the same things. I hate my life everyday. I have potential and but I'm not in the right places and around the right people............I'm just here......stuck.

Most people my age are living it up, having so much fun with their lives, yet I'm stuck here and experienced none of it. Fuck I haven't even gone to a real party yet, and I just recently got my first kiss. I'm so behind compared to the way people seem to generally view me, and it's really annoying. My lack of life experience makes me extremely frustrated. I'm wasting away my 20s and some of the best time of my life, where I have the time, youth, and energy.

In the last six months I finally settled on something for a major. I need about one more year till I transfer, at the same time that many of my peers are GRADUATING and getting internships and jobs and getting paid well. This is something that causes me a lot of turmoil. MY GPA IS AWFUL. it's 2.9. I won't be even going to an interesting university or experiencing anything new. I live a couple of miles from the school I will be going to.

My failure eats me up inside. I know it's not a race but I personally WANT to finish already, I can't bear being in the same situation any longer. I so badly want my life to ""start"" and I keep feeling like my life hasn't ""started"" yet. It's like big puzzle piece and I want the puzzle to finish but the goddamn fucking pieces aren't coming together and I can't make them together because they're just not there so I have to waste more of my life. A lot of those four years of life were completely wasted, I try not to dwell on the past but I'm still not going anywhere. I just wanted to get out of this place and I can't, I have to wait about one more year, then after that there's at least 2 more years when I transfer. This makes a total of approximately six years to get my degree. Now let's just hope I even get a chance to get a job....that's another story.

My parents are very old and sick, and I'm from a lower poor class. They're very demanding and negative about me, and I admit I have many short comings. I need to step up and I always needed to but I never did and wasn't able to, and I let them down.

I feel trapped in my situation, I'm trapped in school, I'm trapped in my lacking social life, I'm trapped by my lack of money, I'm trapped at home. I want my life to start already, I want the rocket to launch but I feel grounded, stuck in the dull black tar pit of my life. My personality is one that seeks novelty, yet my life is extremely monotonous. After four years and seemingly no feeling of ""moving forward"" anywhere school has become a chore. I have a constant feeling of ""frustration"" like I'm stuck, trapped, at a stand still, like I'm trying to run but I'm bound. The ennui of life is bearing down on me and I feel like there's no novelty or purpose to my life. It feels like I'm in life's stream swimming in a pool of molasses.

I just wish there was a clear list of things to do that I can accomplish to stop fucking up in life.

tl;dr

-I'm 22 now

-only 3 friends, no social life.

-stagnate life that is going no where

-people around me are growing and i'm here wasting my life, no degree yet, still have 2 years of school

-no money, poor, parents sick, very old

-4 years wasted at community college, still not done, feel trapped in my situation

I just want to be successful in life for once.

From what I've seen, they dress very casually and comfortably at the office - shorts, jeans, t-shirts, etc.

While I typically wore suits for internship interviews at bigger, more corporate companies, I'm planning on dressing down for this. I was thinking dark jeans or olive chinos, a blue ocbd, and walnut strands. My parents think I should also wear a blazer, and while I don't think it's necessary, it's probably not a bad idea.

After looking around a bit, I'm not entirely sure what to get. Material, structured vs. unstructured, color, solid vs. patterned, fit. 

This will be my first real blazer, so I'd like to get something versatile of decent quality. Brooks Brothers has the friends &amp; family sale, so I've been primarily looking there. I've also browsed J.Crew, but they don't seem to have as wide of a selection.

Here's what I've found so far in my size (36S):

They're all a little steep price-wise, but I don't mind paying for something in this price range if it's high quality and something I'll use for a while.

Thoughts? Advice? Give me a few options, because some of the items I found are on sale and will probably sell out soon.

I'm active duty Navy stationed in San Diego. I'm an IT and have been doing desktop support for the past 4 years, and get to do it for the next 4 years as well. I have A+, and am currently in a school where I'll be getting Sec+. We're also halfway through the Cisco Network Academy for CCNA, sadly we won't finish the whole course.

I plan on getting out after this tour and pursuing a Network Engineer job. At the time I get out I'll have a Bachelors in Computer Science with a focus in Networking, CCNA, A+, Sec +, and possibly others. I would like to try and get some actual networking experience before I get out. I obviously can't quit my day job, which leaves me with nights and weekends. Have any of you ever seen an internship or apprenticeship open up in this field before? I don't even need to be paid, I just want the experience. If not, do you have any suggestions on how I could go about getting more experience? 

Thank you."
1dvhec,17,2013-05-07,I[m19] am experiencing severe burnout and my mother[57] is threatening to stop paying tuition,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1dvhec/im19_am_experiencing_severe_burnout_and_my/,"This story is bit complicated, but I'm going to try and reduce it to the bare minimum you need to know. 

This year and semester in particular have been very hard on me. I've experience depression, burnout, and self doubt, without getting into the specifics too much. At this point, I really need the summer to recover. I'm a 19 - almost 20 - year old male from the USA. 

I should preface by saying that in the past, working over the summer has been an issue between my mother (57 - highly conservative and traditional) and me. I attended a rigorous boarding prep school for high school, and was usually so exhausted and emotionally drained by the end of the year, that I needed the summer to relax so that I could function properly during the next school year. I finally did get a job last summer - nothing special, just a cashier position. 

Of course, this is no longer enough for my mother. In her eyes, the fact that I go to a top university means that I need to be getting internships during the summer, because she believes that I am one of the only students who hasn't had internships since they were in high school and because she believes that if I do not have an internship now, I will never secure a job. On top of that, she believes that my desire to rejuvenate over the summer means that I never want to work and will never hold a job. She has in fact told me that she worries about me becoming homeless because of what she has decided is a complete lack of interest in working (not true!). What more, the profession I am trying to enter (classical music) has nothing to do with any of the internships that she wants me to enter. 

Because of the difficulties that I have experienced this semester, I know that I will be on the path to either dropping out of college or perhaps becoming suicidal if I do not stop and take the break I need now. I have told my mother this via email, but she was not responsive, and has said that a break of no more than a week is necessary for any type of exhaustion, and that if the school is as stressful as it is, then I need to switch to a community college near home, because ""if I don't want a big fancy job then I don't deserve a big fancy education."" Switching schools is really not a good idea at this point, because the amount of money saved would be trivial, I have a near perfect GPA, and I've implemented a dozen or more measures to ensure that I will work at a humane pace starting in the next semester. 

It seems as though my mother is completely ignoring the many things I've done right to get where I am and can only focus on the fact that I do not want an internship in the field she wants me to enter. I refuse to talk on the phone with her anymore, because all communication with her becomes emotionally abusive very quickly. I do acknowledge (and have told her) that I see that her intentions are in the right place, but the fact of the matter is that my interactions with her have been a significant contributor to my depression. 

Today, I will be meeting with my adviser to discuss what happens should my parents stop paying my tuition. I will also go to my school's counseling services to see if I can get some sort of official recommendation for an extended break, and maybe that will convince her.

I have shown several of my friends the correspondence, and although they are biased, they do say that they believe my mother is being incredibly unfair. At this point, I am scared to return home for the summer in two weeks, and am desperately trying to arrange alternative housing with friends. 

The arguing reached its climax yesterday (and may continue to get worse), and since I woke up today I have been nauseous to the point of not being able to concentrate from being nervous and anxious. 

At this point, I'd just love it if my mother understood my position better, but I'm not sure how to do this as I sent a very neutral toned email explaining my concerns (and not accusing her of anything!). It seems as though she is disregarding what I believe to be some serious mental health issues that need to be addressed. 

Therefore, the ideal situation would be for my mother to understand and back off such that I feel safe going home and spending the recovery time I need, but I'm not optimistic for that outcome. I feel that if she properly understood, then she would realize that the measures I've taken to ensure that I do not burnout in the future will be effective, and that my self-imposed work pace is the problem and not my university - which would hopefully stop her threats. 

Does Reddit have any advice for me? 

tl;dr - holding an internship this summer will exacerbate mental health issues to the point of dropping out of school and/or suicidal behavior, and mother is dismissive and threatening to stop paying tuition.

So I have an internship in Natchitoches, Louisiana this summer with a large corporation and I wanted to see if there was anything in particular I should know about carrying in LA. I have a TX CHL, so I can carry there legally, but I don't know some of the details about LA.

Here are some questions:

Am I protected by state law to keep a handgun in the car in my employers parking lot? 

What kind of signage prohibits carrying, and where are official No-Go locations.

When I'm pulled over, am I required to show my CHL? (I do it anyways, but It's good to know If I am required to)

(x-post),beautifultranslation,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1dv2ij/a_family_member_is_in_a_codependent_relationship/,"Background:

My brother (19) is in quite the situation. Several months after beginning college, he began dating a girl. The relationship seemed to get pretty serious fairly quick. To date, they have been dating for about 6 months. The girl has a background of mental instability and sexual trauma that we are aware of. While they have been dating, the girl has attempted suicide, has been 51/50'd, and was reportedly raped *(I say reportedly because she refused to alert authorities and I also fear she may be claiming this to salvage a relationship that seemed to be fizzling. I feel bad for questioning her, or anyone who claims this, but it is what my gut is telling me. I hope this does not minimize sexual assault or lead others to believe that I am quick to dismiss such a serious claim).* All of this occurred within the past 2 months, but is not the first time she has experienced depression, attempted suicide, or been raped.

Soon after the girl was 51/50'd, my brother began having panic attacks and claimed he was dealing with depression. In fact, his girlfriend essentially diagnosed him (since she has the exact same issues) and convinced him he had these illnesses, for lack of a better word. She convinced him to see someone. Over the course of a month, he began seeing a psychiatrist, therapist, professional counselor, and an intern counselor. He was quickly (like in his first visit) prescribed a mood stabilizer, and anti-depressant medication, and klonopin for anxiety.
Over the course of a month, he seemed to deteriorate emotionally. He struggled to maintain his studies, had frequent anxiety attacks, and seemed more depressed than I have ever seen him.
Fast-forward a couple weeks. We find out that he has been abusing prescription drugs, has been struggling with alcohol addiction, has been possibly shop-lifting, constantly lying to friends and family, making awful choices, and has reportedly gotten engaged (though he has not told us this). He has become someone we do not recognize. We feared for his safety.

We pulled him out of school for a few days to work with him and surround him with family. We find out that his problems with addiction were more than we realized. He is unhappy with how things are and begins to see how upset his family has become. In the meantime, he continuously sneaks away to see his girlfriend and gets seriously upset when we try and get him back home. We knew he was in an unsafe place and this girl was not a person he should be around. When he is with family, he becomes more of the person we know him as; however, he seems to become someone else when he talks with or sees her. We believe that he is in an extremely unhealthy, dangerous, and codependent relationship.

After he comes home for a few days, we all come to accept that he needs a rehabilitation program. He wants to go and knows that he needs to get clean and work on himself. He checked himself into a rehab center last week.
He calls when he can. He has, on more than one occasion, requested we send him his girlfriend's phone number. We politely refuse because we are uncomfortable doing so. We want him to focus on himself and just get healthy. He gets upset when we refuse to give him what he wants. Truth is, if he wants to contact her, he will find a way. We know that -- we don't want to enable the relationship or feel pressured into doing something we are uncomfortable with.

We know that the girl is not the source of the problem. He makes his own decisions and is responsible for them. But we do feel that she manipulates him severely. Her (very recent) sexual trauma and past emotional problems lead us to believe that she is in no place ready to develop a healthy relationship. The relationship screams codependency and appears very toxic. Our greatest fear is that he will return from rehab in 3 weeks and jump right back into the relationship without having developed the mental strength and skills necessary to deal with his personal issues and issues within the relationship.

I'm not quite sure what I am looking for, but I feel that I need some outside advice. I would like to hear some opinions from others outside my family. I apologize if I skimmed over anything or did not go into enough detail.

**TL:DR** - Brother in rehab for prescription drug addiction. In a highly toxic and codependent relationship. Fear that he will jump into the relationship immediately after rehab without developing the skills and mental strength necessary to get healthy. Looking for advice."

1dukv5,1,2013-05-07,Question About Myself,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1dukv5/question_about_myself/,"So I guess this is going to be a pretty long post. 

I've just finished my first year of college at a very prestigious university. Its the place that I have always wanted to be, and I always thought about going here before I actually got in. I did fine, and I am basically satisfied with my grades, social life and related things. However, college was really, really stressful for me, much more than I expected it to be. My job is really time consuming and my schoolwork was also tough (gotta beat the standard deviation scores!). I felt like I never had any time to stop, or slow down or relax. 

Over the past year, starting in the late spring of 2012, I have had several short intervals of depression-like feeling which lasted anywhere from 1-3 days, only to go away for like a week. I would often think about how what I was doing in life was very pointless and there would be no worth in it after I died. I had ideas about suicide, but they are really only thoughts, and not real intentions. They were more like ""what if"" questions that I thought about in my mind. Sometimes I would cry at night too. I would also often think about negative things about myself.

Also, even though I have only smoked pot a few times (I tried it for the first time last fall), I often found myself wanting more of it during these phases. I like the way it makes everything feel different, and how it makes me think in radically different ways. I guess its just an easy way of escapism for me. I worry about what will happen when I have as much access as I can to it, which is probably going to happen this summer and next semester in school.

So now its the end of the year, but I don't feel accomplished at all, despite all that I have done (pretty much straight A's and a good position in a school organization). I should be happy about finishing, but I see all my peers lined up with these summer jobs and whatever, and I have nothing and no internship despite applying to some.  

I feel like my mental health isn't normal, but I also I feel like its not enough for me to go see a doctor, because usually I AM fine. I know this might scream BIPOLAR but I still don't know if its really that severe. I haven't told anyone about these feelings either. I doubt anyone knows about it because whenever I am with people I am usually ok, and I smile a lot with them. What are your thoughts?"

Grew up with a surely no confidence throughout high school. Developed eating disorder 1st yr of college. Sacked up, started eating and lifting religiously. Now have an awesome internship, gf, close circle or friends, and am happier than I've ever been. The last 2.5 years have been the best years of my life, and I attribute a lot of that to fitness.

Edit2: for those interested in my routine/diet (copied from a comment of mine)

I follow the flexible dieting protocol, where I have a set # of macronutrients (proteins, fats, carbs) that I try to hit for each day. In addition to this, I make sure I get 2 servings vegetables, and at least 1 serving fruit just for overal health/wellness. Throughout my weight gain, both my calories and macronutrients have consistently increased. I partition them at ~35-40% protein, 20-25% fat, and 40% carb.
For my routine I follow a push/pull/legs/off split. Where push= chest/shoulders/triceps legs= self explanatory lol pull= back/biceps
In terms of compound lifts, I actually only recently started squatting, before that I was just using the leg press. I've put a primary focus on incline dumbell bench as opposed to flat bench, and I'm going to learn to deadlift this summer when I move to my new gym."
1ducdc,1,2013-05-07,"[23/M] here, dating a [20/F]. My depression, gf being hesitant to open up, this stupid routine, and on top of it all, it's a fairly new relationship. Advice needed.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ducdc/23m_here_dating_a_20f_my_depression_gf_being/,"Wall of text:

1. My grandmother passed away in January and I didn't really get a chance to cope until very recently. The week prior to her death, I managed to acquire two jobs (an internship at my university and a tutoring job) so I kinda just stayed busy and kept my grieving to a minimum. This worked for me for awhile, but it came raging to the forefront a few weeks ago.

2. Met the gf in February. Things were fucking awesome. Lots of fun and general excitement. I worked very hard to get her to be with me, so of course I was pretty elated when it panned out. We are very different in personality, though. For an idea, I'm an ESFJ and she's an INFP.

3. I'm very much extroverted and social. She's definitely social as well, but not even close to the extent I am. I'm fine with that, though. We acknowledged our differences very early on, but as you'll see soon there needs to be some changes. 

4. Fell into a terrible routine. In our defense, we were both horribly busy with school (plus I had my jobs still). We made time for one another at the expense of our social lives. In hindsight, this was a horrible idea; but if we hadn't done so we would've only been seeing each other once a week so...maybe it wasn't?

5. Work and school really, really wore me down (or at least that's what I think happened). Normally I'm a outspoken and cheery dude, but I noticed some drastic changes in my behavior. I became disinterested in hanging out with people, my grades, going to class, etc. I became quiet and mopey. I slept WAY more than usual. I don't know if I was just burnt out or if I was just depressed, but it was bad. But anyway, this funk lasted for a month but finally subsided around finals week (last week).

6. During this funk, I became pretty fucking boring. I know I did. And it drove me crazy. Along with it, I'd question her on stupid things. Like, if she was snappy or being distant I'd ask her what's up whenever she was probably just tired and grumpy. I'd worry about our relationship; I'd read into what she said too much... Fuck man, I was paranoid. It's amazing she didn't ditch.

7. To add to this nonsense, I really didn't realize what was going on with me at the time. It took a friend pointing out to me that I was being shitty (mopey, sad, quiet, etc). But once I did acknowledge what was wrong with me, I made a conscious decision to fix it. It's been a little over a week into working on it, and I do feel loads better (school's over so that was a big weight lifted as well). Went and visited my family, grandma's gravesite (I actually felt closure. The day of the funeral I had to leave home to go back to my school/work combo, so I didn't get a chance to deal with it).

8. I told her about all this around a week ago. She asked if I wanted a break and I told her no, that I wanted to work through this and be with her at the same time. I told her I was sorry for letting my issues creep into our relationship, and that next time I would come to her with it. She says she understands, but is just really concerned (for reasons I totally understand).

9. My issues with her: she's been hesitant to open up with me since the beginning, yet she told me last night she wants more of a relationship. I told her the two don't exactly go hand-in-hand, that I really wanted her to come to me with concerns and really anything. Now I understand that I wasn't exactly up front with my situation, but I genuinely didn't realize it was happening other than me being a bit testy at times (rarely around her). I'm willing to be vulnerable with her and always have been, but she has really taken her time doing this. I acknowledge that everyone is different when it comes to this, but my god, it's frustrating. To boot, it seems like everything I ask is too personal for her to talk about. This makes it nearly impossible to get to know her, so of course I'm feeling a bit distant myself.

TL;DR: Fell into a funk with everything; dealt with it pretty well on a personal level; however, this funk crept into my relationship, and I feel terrible for it; girlfriend won't open up because of who-knows-what, and it's testing my patience  (we have plans to talk about this communication business next week when she visits, but we're still talking via phone); I want more communication and comfort (as does she), but I'm scared to death that I may have ruined everything. 


I just want an objective opinion and some advice. Give it to me straight, please. 

And I'm so sorry if this is a jumbled mess of a post. As you can probably tell, I'm pretty scatterbrained at the moment."

SHARE. THE KEY TERM IS SHARE. 

WHY CAN'T YOU BE HAPPY I FOUND SOMEONE I LOVE? And someone that loves me back? And actually does stuff with me that I like? I don't like Chinese dramas. I don't like shopping sprees. I don't like grocery shopping. I like looking at architecture and admiring nature and hiking and mountain climbing and playing TF2 (which, according to you, is a violent abomination though you fund my brother for his CoD games). I like drawing and analyzing the distribution of forces in strange buildings and you think all of these things are A TIME WASTE BECAUSE YOU'RE. TOO. LAZY. AND GAS. WELL WE CAN TAKE WALKS AND TALK ABOUT THINGS ||NOT|| the past. You dwell in the past like a fucking Smeagol. 

You hate on my boyfriend, who cares for me and goes out of his way to see if he can cheer me up, when all you do is put me down: you don't try hard enough (no, I shit out equations day and night), you don't try and find jobs (well it's not my fault they all happened to be unpaid internships BUT THEY'RE JOBS AND MY ENTRY LEVEL SALARY IS MORE THAN YOU AND DAD'S COMBINED). You hate on him even though dad gambled away all the money and perpetually annoys you and you don't even bash on that, but you hate on the one person who I genuinely enjoy being around?

I'm an adult now. I have to leave the nest sometime and you have to suck that up. I'll fly fucking back because I have these fancy metaphorical wings people like to talk about; I'm not a heartless fuck who'll sayonara-the-fuck-outta-here just  because she has a man. I just want to move on with my life and grow a little. Experience more than melons and the latest Chinese celebrity gossip and you hatred of every human being around you except yourself.

You can't drive an argument by talking over me. You can't assume you're right and just shoot for sarcasm right after I throw the harsh truth out. You're not bettering your points; you're making them immature. 

Stop it.

1dtwba,1,2013-05-06,A family member is in a codependent relationship and is currently seeking help for drug abuse. I fear his relationship may prevent him from getting healthy. Need advice (x-post),beautifultranslation,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1dtwba/a_family_member_is_in_a_codependent_relationship/,"Background:

My brother (19) is in quite the situation.  Several months after beginning college, he began dating a girl.  The relationship seemed to get pretty serious fairly quick.  To date, they have been dating for about 6 months.  The girl has a background of mental instability and sexual trauma that we are aware of.  While they have been dating, the girl has attempted suicide, has been 51/50'd, and was reportedly raped *(I say reportedly because she refused to alert authorities and I also fear she may be claiming this to salvage a relationship that seemed to be fizzling.  I feel bad for questioning her, or anyone who claims this, but it is what my gut is telling me.  I hope this does not minimize sexual assault or lead others to believe that I am quick to dismiss such a serious claim). * All of this occurred within the past 2 months, but is not the first time she has experienced depression, attempted suicide, or been raped.

Soon after the girl was 51/50'd, my brother began having panic attacks and claimed he was dealing with depression.  In fact, his girlfriend essentially diagnosed him (since she has the exact same issues) and convinced him he had these illnesses, for lack of a better word.  She convinced him to see someone.  Over the course of a month, he began seeing a psychiatrist, therapist, professional counselor, and an intern counselor.  He was quickly (like in his first visit) prescribed a mood stabilizer, and anti-depressant medication, and klonopin for anxiety.  

Over the course of a month, he seemed to deteriorate emotionally.  He struggled to maintain his studies, had frequent anxiety attacks, and seemed more depressed than I have ever seen him.  

Fast-forward a couple weeks.  We find out that he has been abusing prescription drugs, has been struggling with alcohol addiction, has been possibly shop-lifting, constantly lying to friends and family, making awful choices, and has reportedly gotten engaged (though he has not told us this).  He has become someone we do not recognize.  We feared for his safety.

We pulled him out of school for a few days to work with him and surround him with family.  We find out that his problems with addiction were more than we realized.  He is unhappy with how things are and begins to see how upset his family has become.  In the meantime, he continuously sneaks away to see his girlfriend and gets seriously upset when we try and get him back home.  We knew he was in an unsafe place and this girl was not a person he should be around.  When he is with family, he becomes more of the person we know him as; however, he seems to become someone else when he talks with or sees her.  We believe that he is in an extremely unhealthy, dangerous, and codependent relationship.

After he comes home for a few days, we all come to accept that he needs a rehabilitation program.  He wants to go and knows that he needs to get clean and work on himself.  He checked himself into a rehab center last week.

He calls when he can.  He has, on more than one occasion, requested we send him his girlfriend's phone number.  We politely refuse because we are uncomfortable doing so.  We want him to focus on himself and just get healthy.  He gets upset when we refuse to give him what he wants.  Truth is, if he wants to contact her, he will find a way.  We know that -- we don't want to enable the relationship or feel pressured into doing something we are uncomfortable with.


We know that the girl is not the source of the problem.  He makes his own decisions and is responsible for them.  But we do feel that she manipulates him severely.  Her (very recent) sexual trauma and past emotional problems lead us to believe that she is in no place ready to develop a healthy relationship.  The relationship screams codependency and appears very toxic.  Our greatest fear is that he will return from rehab in 3 weeks and jump right back into the relationship without having developed the mental strength and skills necessary to deal with his personal issues and issues within the relationship.

I'm not quite sure what I am looking for, but I feel that I need some outside advice.  I would like to hear some opinions from others outside my family.  I apologize if I skimmed over anything or did not go into enough detail.

Anyway, to get right into it. I've just been informed that I will have an intern position at EA Sports Tiburon this summer here in Maitland, FL and will be working directly with the Madden team. They've asked me to compile a list of things before I go in as they make the final changes to Madden 25 this summer and I thought it would be great if I gave this community a chance to voice their opinions. So, if you would kindly list some of these things for me so that I can add it to my recommendations, that would be great.


* If you could add 5 new things to Madden, what would they be?

* If you could take away 5 things from Madden, what would they be?

* What game mechanics do you like, and which ones do you dislike? 

* How important is presentation to you? (Pre-Game, Halftime, Stat updates, etc.)

* List 5 tweaks you would make to this next years Madden

* What would you change about Connected Careers to make it better for you? (Will be called Connected Franchise in Madden 25)

* What would you like to see the next-gen implement with the new Maddens? (Live stream, touch pads, social networking, etc.)

* Do any of you use the Kinect with Madden?

* Do you feel the ratings are accurate? 

* If you were to list 5 over powered things in Madden, what would they be?

* If you were to list 5 under powered things in Madden, what would they be?

I really appreciate the feedback, and hopefully a lot of this information takes some serious consideration from the upper guys at EA Sports. I'll do my best to work some influence at the position I am in. "

I'm trying to line up some prospective internship opportunities when the time comes.

Unfortunately, the companies on the eastside that I am finding myself somewhat interested in state ""interns must be enrolled in a bachelor program at a university"", which may or may not nix me out, but it seems to float on the former. Obviously, a paying internship would be ideal, but if you know of anyone who'd be willing to take on an intern without pay....I'll also buy that.

I'm a prospective chemE major. As a whole, I'm finding it somewhat hard to make connections as a CC student in eastside, since our career center is terrible, and no one seems eager to join an engineering club I'm trying to get together.

Any general advice you can give about getting an internship would be great. If you have anything specific to the title, that's even better!"

1dy85j,1,2013-05-08,"1 (22M) am still in love with my ex (21F), and I don't know how to tell her.",Throwaway_For_Love,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1dy85j/1_22m_am_still_in_love_with_my_ex_21f_and_i_dont/,"Obvious throwaway.

Normally, I don't have a fear of rejection. I've been able to deal with girls saying no when asking them to go out with me. ""Meh, there's always someone else."". In this case, I am fucking terrified.

My ex and I broke up during my senior, her junior year of high school. It wasn't on the best of terms, but it wasn't malicious. We had been together for the better part of the best two years of my young life.

She's easily the most beautiful, brilliant, well rounded, *amazing* woman that I've ever met, and is still the best thing that has ever happened to me. She was valedictorian, I had great test scores on my ACT / SAT, but was also a stoner with no motivation. She tried her hardest to motivate me, to get me ready for college, to get me off my ass. She really cared. We loved each other.

We decided it'd be best to take a break since she was studying a lot and I was, well, smoking a ton of pot and partying my senior year into the ground. We still kept in contact, and even had community college courses together. To be honest, we still had a bit of a relationship, but we had to strain ourselves to keep it as casual as we could. She came to a birthday dinner of mine with my parents, and we were on the track to getting back together, against our ""better"" judgement. We both knew I wasn't going to get into the university she was accepted to for at least a year while I finished my courses at CC. Stupidly (at least now I think it stupid), I took my former best friend's advice and cut all ties to her. I was obviously still in love with her, and her with I, but I couldn't take it knowing that we wouldn't be together for at least a year (turned out to be longer). I was immature and selfish. I felt, and still feel, like such a prick. She was trying to reconnect with me and I just blew her off so we wouldn't each be hurt.

I didn't talk to her for almost a year after that. My life fell apart. I moved out of my parents' house at 18 because my adolescent hubris wouldn't allow me to stay with them. How dare they ask me to take out the trash and be home by midnight?! I'm an adult!

I wish I could jump back in time and break my own jaw. It'd be worth the scarring.

Moved out of their house, lost my car (a brand new car they had bought for me), got a shit box of a Kia and moved in with some friends. Stopped going to college. Spent all of my money on pot and alcohol. I can't lie, it wasn't a *bad* time, but I still missed my ex (hereby now referred to as 'B', because I'm not creative enough to come up with a nickname for her that isn't one of her initials), and was going no where in life working a dead end job at a gas station.

I reconnected with her a bit, but being the brash, arrogant dicksnap I'd become within the year that we had broken up, we ended up arguing (not something that happened more than in a healthy relationship), and I didn't talk to her for a while after that. Started dating a trashy girl, moved in with my grandparents' house.

During this time, I never stopped thinking about her. I still haven't. Got a new job at a department store that wasn't quite as dismal and shitty as working graveyard at a gas station. Started school again, not bad. Still thinking about B.

Talked to her on and off, blah blah; more whiny filler about how much I miss this amazing girl I left behind. Every time we talked it was like we were still dating, but we would eventually abruptly stop again, and it was beginning to be hard to deal with. We both went through SO's like water. I was never happy in a relationship without her - I'm still not.

More time passed, my grandpa died. Grandma moved out, I moved back in with the friends I had lived with in my high school days. She came down to our hometown to visit on holiday from Uni. She invited me to come see her, which would become the first time we saw each other in person in almost two and a half years. I still had some of her stuff stored away in the attic and my closet, so I figured it was a good enough time to go see her.

I was sweating bullets. By the time I got there I had already gone through my undershirt. The butterflies came back just the same as they always did. More than anything I just wanted to see her face again.

It was awesome. We just sat in her driveway for something like three hours, staring at the sky and catching up with each other. She spoke of college life, and the boys she dated and left behind. Her parents were home and are pretty strict (see also: insane), so we cut the night short, exchanged hugs, and promised to meet up again.

A few weeks later she was down for her mom's birthday, and we saw each other again. Went shopping, had fun, but didn't do anything not related to being only friends. 

She begged me to come up and stay at her dorm, but I just couldn't do it at the time. I had no money, or time. I told her I would as soon as I could.

Again she came down (this all happened within a period of about two months) for a weekend trip with her roommates. We met up for dinner, and it was obvious that there's still something there. We both wanted to embrace and start over, but that is somewhat inappropriate in a restaurant setting with her friends one table down from us. We parted again, and again she asked desperately for me to come up and see her, and even to hurry and finish college so I could go back to university. 

I couldn't. I wanted nothing more but to drop my life and go back to her, but it just wasn't possible. I had bills, and a job, and a life that I couldn't just drop and leave.

Fast forward to about a month ago. I've moved, not far, but definitely away into the city. I have a decent desk job and am finishing college. 

By now, we've both found new SO's (again), and the school year is ending. I told her I could drop by and see her if she wanted while I was up further north to visit a friend, but she was busy with finals and has an internship out of state for the summer, but that she'd be back in the fall. Before she leaves, though, she's coming back to our hometown (and coincidentally I will also be there when she will be) to visit her family. 

Her current boyfriend lives where the internship is (long distance relationship), but recently more than ever I've been dying to tell her how I feel.

I don't want her to go back to her boyfriend and forget about me. I feel guilty dating someone while contemplating this entire situation, but I can't help it. It's eating me up inside and I need to tell her, but I'm entirely too scared of what may come of it. 

None of the relationships I've had since her have worked out, and it's all because I always put her in front of whomever I'm dating. It's unfair to the girls getting pushed aside, and it's unfair to me to be in a relationship that I just don't want. Four semi-serious sounding relationships have come and gone for me, and I've been apathetic towards all of them because of how much love I still have for this unbelievable girl.

So, Reddit. What should I do? I don't want her to think I'm just some obsessed ex with an infatuation - it's not overtaking my life, but I feel like a large chunk of me is missing without her. I think she feels the same way, but I really can't tell, especially with her having a boyfriend and not being able to talk to her very often due to our busy schedules. 

I feel horrible telling her all of this now, but I always thought I'd just get over it like every other relationship I've had. I definitely haven't. It's still eating me up inside. 

It's so rude of me to bring this up while we're both dating people, I know. Has anyone else gone through something like this? What would you do in my situation? Tell her now so that she has the summer to dwell on it, or take a chance and wait until she gets back home to let her know?

**TL;DR:** The love of my life is still within reach, and I don't know how to tell her how I feel because I'm unsure of how she'll react to it.

I wasn't sure if this counts as 'relationship' advice, because right now we're not technically dating, but I still think of what we have as somewhat of a relationship. 

If this is inapplicable to the subreddit, or borders on being a rant, I really am sorry, guys. I'm just lost and looking for some guidance from someone other than my manly roommates.

Thank you in advance."

Whenever I try to log in to the RuneScape website at work (Yes, I'm that pathetic, but I don't have time to play otherwise), I get redirected and it comes up with an SSL Connection Error.

This applies to both the main RuneScape site as well as the Old School site. I can't log in to the forums to post, log in to edit my account, nor vote in any polls. I can play the game just fine (excluding the betas, due to the fact that you need to log in to the secure site BEFORE accessing the game), and there are no websites blocked at work. I work in the IT Department as an intern, and I have the ability (and permission) to change anything necessary on my personal computer to get it fixed. I narrowed down that it's not a router/domain issue by using a different computer on the same domain and it was able to connect fine. 

It doesn't do this on any other site (that I've seen), and I did some research on it but didn't get very far: most just told me to make sure SSL 2.0 and TLS 1.2 are checked under Internet Options, which they are. I've tried different combinations of these two settings as well, though I'll change them again if anyone thinks a certain combination would work best. 

For reference, in Chrome I get the message:
SSL connection error
Error 107 (net::ERR_SSL_PROTOCOL_ERROR): SSL protocol error.

In Mozilla Firefox, the error shows:
Secure Connection Failed
SSL received a record that exceeded the maximum permissible length.
(Error code: ssl_error_rx_record_too_long)

And IE just says it can't display the webpage... Fricken Microsoft...

Anyway any help would be appreciated, if I can't get it fixed it's no big deal, just wouldn't mind playing the RS3 Beta when there's nothing to do here at work. Thanks for taking the time to read the novel."

I am about to end my first year in college and I am not stressed about finals at all (I never get stressed about any exams or assignments.) Many years ago, when I was a freshman in high school I suffered from what I could only describe as depression that lasted 8 months - year and finally went away, I can't even remember why or when, but its just gone. 

Just a few days ago, I suddenly began to feel depressed again, but for no real reason. I just feel really tired, and I have no motivation to do anything. I have an internship at a really cool company starting in a couple weeks, and I don't even feel excited at all. I can feel like its slowly getting worse. I woke up this morning, sat up and just didn't even want to move for like ten minutes as the feeling slowly set back in. My head has just felt really, odd, lately. 

Yesterday evening, all of a sudden, I mean like within seconds, I suddenly felt fine. Like great, the happiness slowly crept back into me and I almost felt like crying in relief. As night came though, and I laid in bed, it slowly crept back, and I went to sleep hoping it would be gone. And it didn't.

I'm only 19 and if this is depression, I don't want it to spiral out of control like it did those years ago. I want to feel excited and happy about things again.

1dxul1,178,2013-05-08,My experiences with running a Minecraft Server on an IBM Mainframe.,Bedeone,Minecraft,https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/1dxul1/my_experiences_with_running_a_minecraft_server_on/,"Ok so I don't know how long this post will end up being, and I hope I can keep the subjects I want to discuss contiguous. Feel free to skip the somewhat technical parts.


*****
###Background information
*****

I'm a college student completing his last semester towards an Applied Computer Science bachelor's degree, ""majoring"" (for lack of a better analogy to the system in my country) in Mainframes. During this last semester I'm required to run an internship which I have, of course, chosen to do with a company that employs a Mainframe. In my case a bank whose name I will not disclose.

I finished the assignment for this internship halfway through the semester, leaving me with some spare time. And even though I only start up Minecraft sporadically to check up on Westeroscraft's progress, I had this crazy idea to run a Minecraft server on our IBM Mainframe. 


*****
###How to do it
*****

I managed to get it running in one afternoon, so I did not encounter too many problems but here they are anyways.

z/OS doesn't have a web browser, so I had to FTP-put the .jar file on to the Mainframe. I didn't expect it to run off the bat so I just followed the Minecraft Server Wiki step by step guide (I had only ever run a Minecraft Server under Windows) to see what I would bump in to. Java -version gave me an error that the JVM couldn't be started. Turns out the problem was that [my user didn't have a large enough address space](http://i.imgur.com/GVzHM7F.png) when I logged on.
When you log on to an IBM Mainframe, you are assigned an address space, or room to work in. This is comparable to the RAM you are provided with when you log in to Linux or Windows. Except the address space is virtual. Your LPAR can have 10 Gigabytes of RAM physically allocated to it yet you can have a couple hundred virtual Gigabytes being used by running tasks and users. You'd be stupid not to since the resources on a Mainframe are so fast you could never hope to saturate them with a 1:1 virtual:real ratio.

So back on topic; I had my address space enlarged. Turns out [company standards dictate the maximum you get per user is 8 megabytes](http://i.imgur.com/Lxlwi2J.png), which was enough to start a JVM to run java -version, but hardly enough to start a Minecraft Server. The default value was much less as to save space when people that don’t need large address spaces log on. This was why java –version didn’t work. [I bypassed the 8 Mb policy](http://i.imgur.com/d1VbeQt.png) by issueing a request for alteration and I now had [2 Gigabytes of address space](http://i.imgur.com/iUN41NX.png) to work with, quite comfortable I'd say.
 
So I was able to [start the Minecraft server](http://i.imgur.com/VgvD0zj.png) with the same terminal command you’d use on your Ubuntu or Fedora box. It created the map and was (hopefully) listening for connections. It wasn't throwing any errors so it appeared that the TCP/IP libraries (which I feared for the most) translated over flawlessly.

Next problem was not Mainframe related, but rather Bank related. When I fired up the Minecraft client on my workstation and tried to log in, I was unsurprisingly faced with a time out because the port, when trying to move data outside, was blocked, making it unable to reach the login server. No problem, I just went in to offline mode after copying my %appdata%/.minecraft folder from my home machine to my workstation. I added the DNS name of the LPAR on which the server was running to my server list and behold, it existed. When I tried to connect however, I received a timeout after 20 seconds. I could see on my terminal that I tried to connect but timed out. As I mentioned before, I've only sporadically ran Minecraft Servers in the past for a handful of friends on a home machine under Windows, so I'm not very familiar with the intricacies that come with Minecraft servers. It turns out that the Minecraft client authenticates itself to Mojang servers so that unique things such as names can't be forged (or anyone could log in with a name that is present on the administrator list). This however is not possible for me to do considering the Bank's network doesn't allow traffic to the outside over most ports. So I had to change the server.properties file, which the server had created, to run the server in unauthenticated mode. When I tried to edit it however, [it was all gibberish](http://i.imgur.com/STXAIJV.png)!

Something you might not be aware of is that Mainframes don't use ASCII or Unicode character sets, but EBCDIC, also known as the best way to encrypt data (that's a joke by the way, you’re pretty OG if you get it). The Minecraft server was writing the file in ASCII but the Mainframe can't read it (well it does, but the MC server writes “a” to disk as 0x61 and the Mainframe reads it as “/”). So I had to FTP-get it off of the Mainframe on to my ASCII-capable workstation, edit it, and FTP-put it back on. In binary mode mind you, because the Mainframe tries to convert to EBCDIC whenever you send files to it.
So now when I start up the server it's in unauthenticated mode.

[And that's all](http://i.imgur.com/J4SyXdc.png), I was able to [connect to the server with no problems.](http://i.imgur.com/KaBjfdz.png) I know the pictures could easily be forged, but I couldn't think of a fool proof way to prove this thing is running on a Mainframe without disclosing what company I interned at. So I hope that the level of detail that I'm going in to is enough to convince you.

The only sad part is that our workstations only have 3 Gigs of RAM and no GPU, so the frame rate is abysmal. As a result it's not possible to check the performance of the Minecraft server with the client itself. If you know of a way to test server performance without the need of a client that renders frames, please tell me.

###Our system
*****

For the sake of this post I'll mention what resources the server has at its disposal;
Our system consists of two z196 machines running 15 General Purpose CPs (Mainframe jargon for CPU) and 1 zIIP (CPU built specifically to run DB2, XML and Java workloads) each. These two machines run in what is called a Parallel Sysplex. [Feel free to read the wiki page about that](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Parallel_Sysplex), it's one of the concepts that define the Mainframe and allow it to be as reliable as it is. Each machine also has 330 physical gigabytes of RAM.

All the LPARs started on our system allocate 30 logical CPs combined. Yes, even CPUs are virtual on a Mainframe. These things are so fast you need to double (or more)-load them to make them cost efficient and not run idle too much. These CPs are quad cores that run at 5.2Ghz, watercooling optional. But they're so specialized that you can't really compare them to consumer CPUs. Your and my CPU is a jack of all trades while the IBM CPs are specifically trained workhorses. The four different levels of CPU cache are stupid fast. And while 5.2Ghz might not sound that fast, it is magnitudes faster than consumer CPUs if you're running the right workloads on them.
Just to give you an idea, our systems handle about 40 million transactions (don't think money transactions, read up on [transaction systems](https://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/zos/basics/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.zos.zmidtrmg/zmiddle_8.htm)) every day. Two years ago at 20 million transactions a day this meant peaks of 1500 transactions a second. The average execution time of each transaction was 0.03 seconds. I don’t know how many transactions a second we peak at nowadays.

The LPAR on which I started the Minecraft server was one of two LPARs used to convey tests before new things are implemented on to developer, audit and production LPARs. For this reason they're the weakest of the LPARs as to not impact production system throughput. What this comes down to is that the LPAR on which the server ran was allocated 2 Logical CPs and 6 Gigabytes of RAM (it usually runs on 3 Gigabytes, it’s running 6 temporarily for tests concerning my assignment). Because of how many CPs are allocated to the other LPARs, this means that it was able to take up a maximum of 6% of all the CP power available on the Mainframe. The memory doesn’t matter much because the address space I reserved is virtual. I could have reserved 12 logical gigabytes and the Minecraft server wouldn’t have noticed because the, at that point inevitable, paging is so fast on a Mainframe.
Interesting note; the two production LPARs that handle transactions generated by things like eBanking services have about 21 Gigabytes each at their disposal. 21 Gigabytes goes a long way on a Mainframe running z/OS compared to some datacenters that need silly amounts of resources to keep things running.

I'm really wondering what kind of a system Westeroscraft is using. They can always migrate to mainframe, it'll only cost you a million to get started. Or two million if you want stupid amounts of assured uptime. Comes with DDoS protection. I doubt a Kickstarter would suffice though. Then again I’m not even sure if Westeroscraft is the heaviest server online at the moment. They’re the biggest one I know of anyways. I wonder what hardware/setup they use.

###Conclusion
*****

So this concludes my disquisition. I’m quite happy that I’ve successfully managed to start a Minecraft server on a Mainframe. It’s something that I wanted to at least try ever since I learned that IBM Mainframes can handle Java workloads. Not to mention it’s a great way to fill a slow Friday afternoon.

What makes me content is that I've managed to connect a relatively new concept with what is perceived by the general IT-initiated public as an old concept. I hope that those who read my post will understand that the Mainframe is no longer the concoction of boxes in an engineer-filled room. It's still a valid way of providing IT services. And not because of the need to retain legacy, but because the Mainframe is still very economically viable. It just happens to be so that the workloads in which Mainframes are specialized happen to be the workloads generated by institutes that are often out of the public eye.

When I went home Friday I withdrew some money from an ATM at one of the bank branches of the bank that I'm doing my internship with. It was the weirdest thing to realize that just hours ago I had worked on the same machine that was now processing my request.

I’ve also Googled a bit and I’m pretty sure that I’m the first person ever to (successfully) run a Minecraft server on a Mainframe. Or at the very least publish it. I’m willing to bet that it’s the most powerful hardware, and operating system too really, that a Minecraft server has ever run on.

If you read this far down I'd gather that you might be wondering if you can connect to the server and check it out for yourself. I'm sorry that due to bank policy, I'm going to have to disappoint you. The Mainframe doesn't allow connections outside of the Bank's network. To rub salt in the wound, we have a 100Mbps up and 100Mbps down connection for our workstations only, for the Mainframe itself it's likely way more. Our Mainframe would truly make a sick Minecraft server.

I'm genuinely surprised that I managed to write some 3000 words about this subject. Gives me somewhat of a reassuring feeling about the thesis I'm supposed to be writing right now. Sorry about the wall of text, I couldn't help myself I hope you enjoyed it.

**EDIT**;

Can we have a Mainframe flair for submissions? ;)

My life is in complete shambles finanacially, physically, and I don't know what to do. I've tried so many different options that I don't feel like I have any viable ones left.

I'm married with two boys (and a girl from a previous relationship that I have every other weekend). My kids are the best in the world. They have amazing grades (both are in middle school) and my oldest son is already planning on college is getting honors and taking High School classes. He wants to be a doctor. My wife is currently in school for medical assisting and is starting her last semester next week before her internship in the fall. That, is where the good stops for me.


I've dealt with depression my whole life. Since I was a teenager. I have a high school diploma but I'm stuck at a dead end job being garnished. My bring home each week is never more than $217. Never. I've tried so many times to get 2nd jobs. I've tried balancing At Home kinda stuff, but they never pan out the way they say they will. I've turned my resume in to over 70 employers in the past 30 days alone and followed up with them all until last week, when my phones were turned off because I can no longer pay the bill, and I owe another Redditor $150 that he loaned me a month ago and I can't pay it back...


My wife has tried getting a job and balancing with her school but shes there for 12-14 hours a day and it's unfair to ask her to get a second job on top of doing at home stuff as well. I feel like a failure. I've prayed for deliverance from this, I've got there and tried so many times to make something happen. I had to stay home from work yesterday because I didnt have the gas to get to work. I'm tired of not being able to give my son a $1 for drink or a snack at school and us having to get my mother in law to help because we cant afford to buy food. The state gives us Food Stamps but they only get us through about 2 1/2 weeks. 


I don't know what I'm posting here for. I'm just mentally drained, depressed and ready for it to be over. I need help. I've tried everything. "
1dx6ci,0,2013-05-08,Early life rejection and wasted effort,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1dx6ci/early_life_rejection_and_wasted_effort/,"I'll begin by saying that I was raised a special way. When I was a child I was put into a gifted kid's program and I've been in honors and AP courses ever since.

I couldn't wait to grow up because I had so much in store for my life. All everybody could see was how successful I was going to be when I grew up because I was smart and talented.

Well, not genius level, but common sense, and still fairly smart. Especially good at maths.

Growing up, I spent a lot of time on the computer. I ended up learning a lot HTML when I was 10, and programmed my first games when I was 11. I have never stopped using the computer since, and it has taken me seven years to realize that I wanted to do computer science when I grew up...


And everything felt wonderful for while. Until every organization started telling me I wasn't good enough for anything I wanted to do. I had so many dreams until all of this happened within one month.

I was denied from a math summer camp. I'm a 4.0 unweighted and two years ahead in math, future software engineer, rank 1 out of over 300 students. AP classes in calculus, compsci, physics. I thought it was because I wasn't poor enough but someone richer than me at school was chosen, and not me. All I can hope was that I was overqualified because I wasn't even waitlisted.

Then I wasn't chosen for this position about managing communications within a division of an organization. It didn't even matter if I qualified. Just mess up on an interview and life is unfair. I grew up making websites, and nothing was really going right. 

Lastly, I was rejected from a microsoft high school internship. I guess this kind of blew all my hopes and dreams away. It literally made my whole life feel USELESS because I obviously can't get into anything I apply for. I did more computer things than I listed, but even people with less programming experience were chosen and I'm just feeling like my life is a big pile of unfairness and everything sad.

All of this has made me so depressed. I started crying every day and thinking about ways to give myself a concussion so I can lose IQ and become more social-able. Obviously, that's a shitty idea, and then I realized I'm not thinking normal anymore.

My mother doesn't take my seriously because I'M JUST A TEENAGER. So that's right. I'm sixteen and I grew up being told that I was special and now I don't feel special anymore and it sucks. I can't deal with it by myself. 

I want my hard work to pay off. 
I want all of this to be worth it. 
I don't want to wait for success. 
I want to be happy now. 

My 4.0, AP courses, class rank. It's all useless. It's meaningless. Nobody seems to care about that anymore. Nobody even cares that I had so much passion for CS but now.... Now I feel ready to stop trying. "

As I have people I know graduating, I realize how much time my depression has taken from me. 

How unfortunately, I lack the things to be where I want to be.

And how I let fear pin me down and feed off me.

I’m trying 23 this year.

Twenty-fucking-three.

And I go on tumblr and see these awesome black alternative girls and I get sad, because I don’t have the money for nice clothes.

I have money to barely feed myself.

Truth is, I wear about the same set of jeans and shirts every week. I’m not sure if people have noticed, but it makes me feel so bad when I open my closet and realize I only have like 3 choices in jeans and maybe 7 in shirts.

Truth is, I only have two bras I wear interchangeably and they don’t even fit me properly.

Truth is, I’ve been splitting my paychecks in half, and putting it in a savings account.

Because when I somehow eventually get my license (if I ever), I can buy myself a car.

I feel bad for being jealous that everyone around me didn't have to work for one. Family members brought it for them, or passed it down.

But God, that independence… 

That will open so many doors for me.

Monday as I walk to Food Lion and back in the rain, three bags in one hand, trying to hold an umbrella, a sad image.

But that is my life. 

Everyone is getting or has internships in shit they want to do.

Due to no car, I can’t do that. 

I can’t find another possible high paying job somewhere else.

What am I doing with my life?

It’s been almost a week of break. I went to the movies once, which was nice. But so far it’s been me sitting inside as usual.

I can’t be like, “LET’S GO SOMEWHERE.” Because, it’s not up to me. 

I’m just grateful when people put up with giving me rides.

And now I just fucked up this past semester and may have to drop my english major.

And I just think, “Damn, why am I such a goddamn loser?”

Legit.

I wear the same clothes.

I may get teased that I take too long to get dressed when going out, but it’s because I never get that chance to try and make myself feel pretty.

I sit in the same damn place.

I do the same thing.

These 18-20 year girls on tumblr are living the life I want and I’m almost 23.

And I’m paranoid of losing time.

I’m awkward with people.

My body is all sorts of fucked up. Who the fuck even gets thick hair on their stomach?!

I am disgusting. :|

I can pop my back now, and when I stretch I crack.

My back hurts.

I am literally aging faster than I want to.

I always imagined myself by now being confident and a badass.

Who has awesome grades, which surprises people because she’s goth with piercings, but really, she’s a nice person.

Who doesn’t fucking let guys take advantage of her feelings and then cry cry cry. :|

And then on weekends she goes clubbing, or bowling, or a movie.

Who is comfortable with her money and doesn’t starve.

It sucks when I want to go get McDonalds or something because I’m hungry. But I can’t.

So I sit there.

I literally just am like, “Okay. Well…this sucks.”

Maybe I’m being whiny because I’m on my period.

I’m entering my senior year, and guess what?!

I am the same if not worse than when I entered.

Nope.

Nope.

Well…I’ma go cry now. I wish I had some icecream or something.

Stupid period."

1dwpuo,67,2013-05-07,Was not expecting that at my 32 week appointment..,MrsEllimistX,BabyBumps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/1dwpuo/was_not_expecting_that_at_my_32_week_appointment/,"So I went in for my 32 week appointment with my midwives tonight. I asked my mom to go with me, since my husband had to work late tonight. When my mom asked me how long it would be, I told her maybe a half an hour - they'd ask me the routine questions, get my weight, BP, use the Doppler on my baby, and that should be it. 

Wrong.

During the questions, I told the midwife I was still having my 2-4 BH per hour, which has been normal for me since about 20 weeks. I laughed as I told her that I found it funny that they give us all these PSAs and brochures and pamphlets and I get emails from The Bump and WTEWYE about all the signs and symptoms of preterm labour, and that you should call your care provider *immediately* if you're experiencing any of them - and it seemed I had them all. She didn't laugh. When I told her that Arya has dropped three times since Wednesday only to rise again each time, and that I could feel her pushing against me when I put my hand down on my crotch, she got slightly concerned. She suggested a cervical check. 

She inserted her fingers and I grimaced and yelped s bit, as any kind of penetration has been excruciatingly painful for me since about week 10 (I explained that to her). Turns out I'm fingertip dilated, about 30% effaced, and very soft. She also decided to do an exam and swab for bacterial vaginosis after I told her how painful it was when even just her two fingers were inserted. Positive.

So it seems that I've had an infection since at least week 10, which has most likely been causing my crazy amounts of contractions, severe back pain, excruciating pain during sex, and is causing me to dilate/efface prematurely. I've been prescribed something for it and am going to pick it up in the morning.

I also got lectured by three midwives and two interns about how I need to call them when I'm having issues. I told them that I don't want to be the woman who calls every time she feels a little funny or has a silly question every five minutes. They got upset with me and said that's what they're there for, and they want me to be well and they want to know what's going on.

They also told me that I will be on weekly appointments now to monitor my cervix and make sure it doesn't change anymore. They said they're not super concerned about it, but that everyone needs to be on alert. 

On the one hand, I'm really happy that we found this out. Within 48 hours I should have relief from most, if not all, of my symptoms. What a relief. Also, in all my worrying about being a baby, it's nice to know that my symptoms ARE abnormal, and that I SHOULDN'T be going through all of this.

So here's my PSA: don't try to stick it out! Call your doctor or midwife if you think something is wrong, and don't let your pride get in the way of your health or your baby's health. Also, for the ladies who are experiencing horrible pain during sex, it might be an infection! Get checked! You might find relief, and won't need to suffer for 22 weeks like I have!

TLDR: Turns out I'm dilating/effacing prematurely. It's my fault for preferring my pride over calling my midwives with my preterm labor symptoms. All should be well, but I'm on weekly appointments just to be sure. "

I'm a mechanical engineer recently graduated from a university that taught drafting for engineers using SolidWorks.  During my internships, I stayed on board with a company that using Pro/Engineer Wildfire 4.  I used it a little bit, just for measuring parts.

I've now graduated (yay!) and I'm working at another company, that also uses Pro/E Wildfire 4.  Now I'm doing some design work, and getting... ""introduced"" to everything Pro/E needs to throw at you for you to create complete parts, drawings, and assemblies.  Now that I've learned it a good bit, I want to say that Pro/E SUCKS.  The user interface is clunky, bloated, and nonintuitive, errors offer little explanation, and all the implementation details seem to lack polish, and it is generally frustrating to use!

Comparing this to SolidWorks, for example, is almost not even a fair comparison in my opinion.  The non-terrible user experience in SolidWorks probably yields double the real-world productivity compared to the same task being performed in Pro/E.  I've been told by some of the older guys at my company that Pro/E isn't that bad- but I'm inclined to believe that they only stick to that opinion because they've molded their perceptions to accommodate it after using it for years.  I've also been told that the additional powerful features Pro/E has make up for the differences- but I don't see them being important for our company, where the geometric details of our manufactured products are not too terribly complicated.

I know that Creo has taken over as the replacement for Pro/E, but I think this is still a relevant question, given Pro/E's still-large use in industry. 

So guys, what do you think of Pro/E?"

After the first week, I put up a calendar counting down the days until I could go home. It seemed like each day was a month long and I remember telling myself ""5 more hours, 4 more hours"" etc until I could get home. I had an awful 2-hour commute one-way to/from work every day. I stayed in my room a lot watching TV shows on my computer and eating. I think I might have been depressed. 

The last night I was there, a guy somewhat assaulted me in a club (I was very inebriated, he led me to a corner despite my protests and tried to get in my pants [thank everything I was wearing high waisted tights under my skirt]) and that didn't really even phase me at the time... looking back, it was actually quite a terrible experience that I didn't take seriously. When I got back to the US, I had never been happier to be an American and return to the country I sometimes scorned.

I got home and told everyone I had the summer of my life. I lie my ass off every time I'm asked about it. I spent a ton of money on this ""opportunity"" and I feel like I squandered it by being pathetic.

I'm looking for a friend, as the title of this post shows. I'm pretty lonely most of the time, and I'm looking for somebody to help me pass the time. After getting out of a pretty abusive relationship that lasted the majority of my high school ""life"", I'm left with no friends, and nobody to talk to.

About me: I'm a 19 year old guy, who is introverted. That being said, it's not easy for me to make friends. I'm looking for somebody who I can relate to, and have intellectual conversations with. I want to hear about your day, but that doesn't necessarily mean that I want to tell you about mine. I enjoy reading SciFI, Fantasy, Non-fiction, and many other genres. Reading is one of my biggest past times, and I easily become addicted to book series, along with all the lore related. I'm an apathetic atheist, and don't want to be badgered with religious beliefs. I'm currently going to university, studying CompSci, and I have 3 internships a week. 

What I'm looking for: A beautiful personality. Somebody to help my day go along via text/email. I want a friend who can make me happy, and somebody who will take her time and get to know the true me. I may be rigid when we first meet, but I warm up quickly to people, and am very loyal to those who actually respect and understand me. All races, ages, and shapes are welcome. I prefer to talk to older females, because they're more mature than my current shitty generation. (I'm not specifically looking for a relationship, but if one forms after a long amount of time, so be it. I will let you know if I'm interested.)

What I'm not looking for: Somebody who will stop talking to me after a day. (This makes me very sad, and hurts me.) I'm not looking for a bitch. (You know if you are one.) I'm not looking for a fwb. I'm not looking for somebody who I can sext.

Now I realize there are a thousand different departments and dozens of locations, but I'm talking about the company in general. The position I'm looking at is in IT and is located at the data center. My mother is an L&amp;D nurse downtown, and my father is on a first name basis with all of the cardiologists... and their opinion is that employees aren't shown very much respect.

I made the *mistake* of getting a girl pregnant around two years ago. My son is now 16 months old. I had been dating his mom for the past year.

In this year, she's cheated on me. I've paid her child support even though we were dating and I've been in his life. I do not and have not been living with her. I make okay money, 38k before taxes. I was giving her $500 a month (What a fool..).

I've finally had it with the lies, the bullshit, the greed, the selfishness. I have absolutely no custodial rights to my Son. She refuses to put me on the birth certificate. I have met with an attorney, but I'm not entirely sure I like the outlook.

I would prefer joint custody of my son. I have no problem paying child support. He's mine, I love him. I've played by their rules for about a year (not taking him out of town, not staying at my home).

Her and her mom have a history of domestic violence. I'm not sure if this would make a difference in court. Basically, I can keep doing what I'm doing (being glued to their house to see him), paying $500 a month and having nearly no rights.. or I can pay my attorney and see my son every other weekend.

I currently see him thurs night, fri night, all day saturday and all day sunday.

I own my home. I do not do drugs. I do smoke, horrible habit. I don't want to fuck with this girls life, but she's fucking with mine. 

One more detail, she's an intern at the local PD and she's friends with many of the cops. Around 2 weeks ago we had a fight, verbal over the phone. I told her to leave me alone. At this point she had a key to my home. I refused to answer her calls. She said she was coming to my house.

I told her not to, I then barricaded the door so she couldn't come in. She's fairly small (around 100lbs) so I didn't think she could get in. Wrong. She got in, got in my face. She attempted to kiss me. I ran out the door and took off as fast as I could. 

Remember when I said she had cheated? I caught her at a cops house on 4/21/13. We shared a cell phone plan, I did a search on his number. 2000 texts in a month. 

I stayed away from my house for around 2 hours. I finally go home. I find the back door wide open, the thermostat to the furnace was set as high as possible. It was around 2:00am. Great, there's a knock on the door.

It's the fucking police. Guess who it is? It's the cop who she's been texting/hanging out with. They ask me some questions, she claimed I spit in her face. They ask if she had hit me etc, I told them no. They looked for marks, they found a scratch. Nobody was arrested.

He had a partner with him. I have a recording of her coming into my house (Mostly audio) you can hear the door being kicked. 

I also have a recording of her knocking for 10+ minutes. I have a recording of the police as well. 

This seems very rambly, I may have missed some details. I'll go through it when I'm not at work and correct any errors.

TL;DR kids mom has full custody of our son, I was paying child support (it's not court ordered) but I've recently stopped. She went crazy."

I'm a recent college grad (sort of) and I'm looking to get an iPad before I go off to my music therapy internship for a few reasons. Primarily, I'd like it to have a more portable device that I can transport things like songbooks, etc so I don't have to carry around giant books and binders full of music. Second, I like the idea of being able to pull up music during a music therapy session if a client requests it. Third, I think it would be a nice, portable way to be able to do documentation right after sessions.

That being said, I need help. I know the iPad 4 has been out for a while, and the iPad 5 is due to come out... soonish? I was wondering if you guys thought it would be better to hold out and get the iPad 5 (not being able to guarantee that I'd have it before I moved to the middle of nowhere for my internship) or if I should go for the iPad 4 because it'll be a little less expensive, but it'll still run great.

Thanks for your help!"

Ok so this is a throwaway for obvious reasons. Part of my shilling program is completing 600 hours on /r/canada. My program is a ""how to win friends and influence people"" course. I am interning with a major Canadian Political Cparty and frankly i am pissed. I am an unpaid intern doing work that is pretty much the exact same thing that people are being paid for. I work in a high production computer lab processing large amounts of leftist bullshit.

This company runs interns year round and has about 15 in my lab. We make up a large percentage of their labor. Personally i don't understand how this is not illegal. They have pretty much converted 15 potential paid jobs into free labor and we are talking about a party that probably makes billions.

Now i go in every day happy and do my work because i actually had to pay this party the maximum of $1100 to shill for fucking free. I don't have a choice, but to complete this if I wish to ever dine at the same table as Dear Leader.

What are your opinion on these unpaid internships. I think they should be banned or companies forced to pay shill interns at least minimum wage. What about you guys? Is this an issue we can get /r/Metacanada to rally behind?

Personally i plan on meeting with my MP about this. I have also contacted another MP who i know about this issue and we have some sympathetic ears.

1dzr1u,1,2013-05-09,I'm not sure the path I'm taking in college will be a path I'll enjoy for the rest of my life.,confessionyguy,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1dzr1u/im_not_sure_the_path_im_taking_in_college_will_be/,"I've switched majors a few times. I entered college as pre-med biology. My reasoning was thin and immature: I have many older siblings in all different fields, doctor isn't one of them; I enjoy the show scrubs; I like helping people; I did well and enjoyed Biology in high school.

However, I was stressed about the work and dedication involved in that major as well as the career after it. I told myself that maybe I wouldn't be able to deal with failing to cure people. Or that 80+ work weeks weren't worth it. I decided to change majors.

I was taking a math class and because I was enjoying the topic and doing well in the course I thought that maybe I could become a teacher of math, high school level. I liked my Calculus teacher;  I really enjoy teaching things to people; I like that math just has a solution, unlike other less tangible topics. I tried being a Mathematics major, even planning out my course schedule for the rest of college. Then, taking Calc III and Linear Alg at once (probably poor decision), I realized I didn't like math *that* much. I changed majors.

I like computers and video games. I was taking a intro to java course. I thought, with my joy of 'tinkering' with programs and game emulators, I might enjoy programming for a living. Progamming courses are time-consuming. With my ADD assignments take my 12 or more hours that take friends 2 to 4. I have a paid internship in computer science, and a degree from my school would really pull me through.

 But sometimes I start to think about the life of a programmer, and maybe I was better off a pre-med, or maybe I should try being a teacher again. But it's too late. This school is expensive. I have a very generous grant, but I feel like I'm squandering it with my indecision and my inability to do well in classes. I'm silently stressing myself out but barely voice it to others. I don't know when my grant will run out, and I'm afraid I might not even pass this semester. My school is hard, but are other schools going to be any different honestly? Calc is Calc, programming is programming.

I enjoyed just pushing carts at a store while in high school. Now working in an office setting makes me worry about the fact that I finish my tasks too quickly and I really shouldn't have as many hours as I ought to. Or I waste too much time at work, perhaps in the real world my employer will find that I don't output enough code. What do I do then? Stress upon stress upon stress."
1dzpoh,5,2013-05-09,I feel unworthy of asking my Ivy League LD-FWB to be with me.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1dzpoh/i_feel_unworthy_of_asking_my_ivy_league_ldfwb_to/,"I (22F) met this guy (26M) [let's call him Ryan] spring of 2010. We dated a few times right before I went away on a summer trip and he left to start business school at an Ivy-league (relevant later on) school on the other side of the country. 



I assumed that would be the end of it. An awesome summer fling. But no. Our undergrad college is in his hometown. Turns out, whenever he would come home for the holidays, we saw each other. We decided to be FWB, which we defined as: actually friends, sexually monogamous, and still requires a break up. 



When we met, I was a virgin. I was pretty close to having PIV sex with a previous bf, but other issues made me not trust him enough to take that final leap. It was not the case with Ryan. He was always very straight-forward about how he really liked me, but it wouldn't be fair for us to be anything more when he's away. And his actions reflect that. I really trust him. We are also very sexually compatible and like to explore the same things. We eventually went ""all the way"" about 10 months into it. My first time was wonderful, with someone I really cared about and trusted.

At some point, about a year after it all began, I asked him if distance wasn't a factor, would he see us together, or would he want to at all. I told him I have realized I do want an actual partner-in-crime share-our-darkest thoughts type of relationship, and I needed to know if that could be possible with him if distance wasn't a factor. He wouldn't give me a straight ""yes"" or ""no"". 

His answer was that there was no point in thinking about it because he's in the east coast and I'm in the west coast, and when we both graduate (me from undergrad, him from business school), we could still be far away depending on where our jobs take us. He doesn't want me to ""wait for him"" because he might not come back to his hometown if a better job opportunity arose somewhere else. And he doesn't want to have a serious relationship while apart (which, I agree with him on that part).


Last December (2012), he initiated a talk as he drove me to the airport, after I had mentioned that we've known each other for over a year. He wanted to make sure that I know he's not looking for a serious relationship. Right now his mind is in his career and nothing at all. He's not even thinking about relationships AT ALL. I took his word for it, but I'm also afraid this was a kind way of saying, ""I don't want a relationship *with you*. He said that both of us are, in a sense, using each other. He said it was hard for him to have this conversation, but he felt like he needed to have it bc it has happened to him in the past, where he has similar situations with girls, and they wouldn't move on. He didn't want to, but he cut them off 100% so they could move on. He likes me, and wants me to stay in his life. I will admit, I was offended that he thought he would ever be a better judge of what is best for a partner than the parter herself. I told him if he ever wants to end it, to end it because he's bored, found someone else, or whatever... not ""for my sake"". That's very condescending. I told him I'd worry about myself and my ""moving on"". I also told him I didn't want a serious relationship, bc I am only 22. But after thinking about it on the plane ride, I realized we both could've meant very different things by ""serious relationship"". When I say I wasn't looking for a serious relationship, I meant that am not assessing boyfriends for the potential to spend our lives together. But I do want **A** relationship. 

Since I got those answers, I have made an active effort to date. Truth be told, I haven't been on more than 4 dates since then, all of which were first dates that never progressed. It's just that the number of guys I find attractive enough to flirt with is significantly less than when he wasn't in the picture. Most of the time, when I want to feel close/wanted/horny or anything else that might lead to me reaching out to other people, I direct that to Ryan. I text/chat/skype/snapchat/whatever him, and I'm happy just to talk to him from far away. And I'm always happy when he does the same. 

My reasoning is that: if Ryan is just upping my standards for potential dates, while giving me a safe and comfortable sexual outlet with someone I care and trust, it's OK. I'm keeping my options open for that someone that might give me everything I need.

And I don't know if that's unrealistic. 

He called me today after his final exam. He is officially graduated and coming back to his hometown, where now I am living. I can't help to feel inferior and unworthy of being with someone like him. Although we both went to a very good school in CA, he's the one that graduated with all kinds of honors, active in student government, went on to a top-tier grad school, and now is about to start a Director-level position at a VERY large company (known all over the world) in August. Whereas here I am, first yeah after graduation, with a GPA that wouldn't get me into any decent grad school, unemployed after I quit a sales job I hated, no employment prospects that could have anything to do with my science degree, and getting a little too excited for a couple of tutoring gigs I've gotten this week. 

It hurts me that he's never seriously asked me to visit him at school. He's said things like ""get over here now"" and things like that, but never actual plans with dates or details. And while I moved away from his hometown for that sales job, he did see me when he would fly over for interviews to this new city, it was never just to see me. Although I did come visit him (I asked him if I could visit) in NY for his summer internship. I don't feel like he's made an equivalent gesture: the flying out to see me.

Now that he's graduated, I found out today he will be traveling around the world with his business school friends and his brother. He had all summer, no school to worry about, and we haven't seen each other since January, and he didn't even bother to schedule a trip to LA to see me. That, to me, says a lot of how much he misses me/wants to see me. His parents still support him, he's made tens of thousands in between undergrad and grad school. I am unemployed, and my parents don't support me financially anymore. He is the one with access to make our meeting happen. 

I also don't feel worthy of mentioning how his actions make me feel right now because he's post-finals but before his graduation ceremony. I don't want him to be thinking about how he failed while he should be the happiest about his achievement, and looking forward to his big trip.

I will also admit I'm scared he will sleep with someone on that summer-long trip. I don't see why he, as a single guy backpacking throughout the world, drinking and partying, would not. I have no reason to believe he's slept with someone else yet, but if he did, it would be very hard for me to find out anyways.

Rationally, I would do that same things he's doing. I put myself in his shoes and I hate what I think of myself. I would be embarrassed to bring someone like me to meet his friends at a school like his. I would feel like I'm lowering my standards, so I'd keep someone like her around for the fun, no strings-attached sex. But I'd also be a nice-enough guy to let her know that that's all I want, and I don't want her holding back because of me.

Am I holding myself back from finding a fulfilling relationship? Why can't I appreciate what I do have instead of wondering what might be? 
I want to be able to tell him how I feel ( that I do like him, I want to be with him, and that I feel inadequate next to him) and be able to handle rejection and end the ""relationship"" with Ryan 100%. I don't know if this imbalance of power is just one of the reasons we're not a good fit, and it would just be best for both of us to find someone else. But I am so happy just hearing from him, and the days when we ARE together, these worries just fade away. Do they really fade away? Or am I just captured in the reuniting bliss, but we're never together long enough to fade and for the real issues to arise? Am I just projecting the my insecurities on to someone, or am I actually harming myself by staying in this ""relationship/situation""? Will it seem like I was indeed waiting for him if, once we both live in the same city, I spill my feelings for him in a ""now we can be together"" kind of show?

1dzln0,1,2013-05-09,Questions about therapy and SSRI's...,[deleted],OCD,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/1dzln0/questions_about_therapy_and_ssris/,"Okay, so I was diagnosed with OCD not long ago, although I feel like I've had it for the majority of my life. These past five months became unbearable to the point where I was driven to depression. 

Without going deep into the specific contents of my OCD, (mainly checking and ""pure O"" type stuff) it all got to the point to where I couldn't bring myself to get out of bed in the mornings, and I had severe insomnia at night. Since I've sought help and been diagnosed with OCD, I've been better able to cope and actually live my life better, but it's definitely still a work in progress. Like everyone, I have my good days, bad days, and horrible-awful-unbearable days.

Anyways, I had to discontinue therapy (it was through student counseling services) because I'm going home for the summer, then traveling a lot for an internship. I'll be in the same place for about 6 weeks in between moving around to other areas. Is it worth it to look into therapy in the city I'll be in this summer? How much can I get accomplished in 6 weeks? Or should I just wait to continue therapy in the fall? Both my psychologist and psychiatrist didn't seem to think it was necessary for me to find someone over the summer, but if it can keep the ball rolling in recovery, I'd like to.

I'm starting Zoloft tomorrow, and I'm really really really hoping it takes the edge off of my racing thoughts and will help lift this depression. Especially because the job I have will likely be stressful and may trigger a lot of my symptoms. Any good stories about Zoloft to give me hope?

TL;DR
Can I get much out of therapy if I can only see someone for six weeks?
Any good stories about how Zoloft/other SSRI's helped you or someone you know?"

Should i try to postpone my dinner until LATE (like 10pm) as a post-workout meal or just drink my protein shake post workout?  Do any of you guys doe this and what do you eat for your post-workout meals if its after dinner/your last ""big"" meal? 


Info about me for those that care:

* 21/M/150lbs/5'7""
* Currently in the end phases of my cut @ ~13% BF
* Lift 3-4 times/week (almost always 4) doing a strength program (low volume, high intensity) + raquet ball and/or running (2-4 times/week)
* Squat 5RM: 305 lbs
* Bench 5RM: 205 lbs
* DL 5RM: 325 lbs

My roommate found the wallet on a sidewalk after drunk-biking around the White House one night. He sent the girl, Min-Young, a Facebook message, but she didn’t reply for a week. 

Today, I decided to Google her home address from her driver’s license. Nothing came up, except real estate and a church newsletter stating a different name, ‘choong-han’ for that same address, all written in Korean. The church said they didn’t know a ‘Min-Young’, so I asked if that was her mom or dad. They remembered, said yes and gave me her dad’s phone number. 

I called and her mom answered, took down my name, number and was skeptical on how I knew how to speak Korean (I'm Filipino and studied abroad in Seoul). Then she called her daughter. Min-Young called me just a minute afterwards and she came to pick it up. She said her mom thought I was a scammer because she didn’t know how I knew all this information. hahaha. 

What a great way to end my internship here in DC as a journalist and put those skills to use.

As for my skills currently, I am an intermediate programmer. I developed a stong logical foundation through BASIC and I am quite comfortable with Java and C. I also know a bit of CSS and HTML, at least enough to make an amateur looking website simply with code. 

What I would be doing in my internship would be helping with administrative processes.  Mainly checking on the server and processor stacks in their computer rooms. He also mentioned working with servers, however, I am not sure if that has any correlation with bash.

I just have no idea where to start and any help would be greatly appreciated. "
1e3eg3,0,2013-05-10,"I just finished finals, It's been over nine months since my last workout. Here's my Journey so far. I need to drop the 20lbs or so I gained. This is the third weight loss segment of my life. I want to do it right this time. Also, I have potential kidney issues. Help?",Fatalfable,Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1e3eg3/i_just_finished_finals_its_been_over_nine_months/,"Thanks for helping me out guys. I am going to give a lot of background. I want you guys to know my history and where I am coming from as it might help. If you could care less about my past just skip to the ""Now"" Section.

 Here are the 3 phases:

**Phase 1**

I'm sure like many of you out there, we were bullied. This was the catalyst to my life in exercise and fitness. I learned everything on my own (well, the internet). I started out in 9th grade as 5'5 and 190lbs. I never really improved my diet at first, I just started exercising. I lost my first 30 with Dance Dance Revolution. I reached a plateau and learned about dieting. I also picked up the gym. Some food choices and terrible form later I dropped another 15 lbs. I plateau'd until the end of junior year of highschool. Me and my friends picked up longboarding and thats all we would do. I mainly lost it due to malnutrition of skating the streets of NYC all day and only eating a slice of pizza and an arizona. Right before I left for a summer music program I was about 135lbs and 5'7. I also had a starvation period during this time where I was deliberately trying to become anorexic running 5 or 6 miles a day and trying not to eat for 2 days followed by a binge eat. 

During the summer program I gained about 18 lbs (Regardless of maintaining my weight lifting at the local gym). I started thinking I was gaining muscle and kept on eating more and putting on more lbs. By December of that year I had bumped back to the 160s. 

**Phase 2**:

I freaked out, went hard on my research and tried changing all of my food choices again. I started eating egg whites, sweet potato, chickens, salmons, cutting out some junk food. My portions weren't the greatest and I still wasn't counting calories well. I started running to school and back home and lost about 15 lbs by the summertime (I still maintained gym workouts).  I tried picking up insanity but I could never stick it out. 

Towards the end of the summer I had dropped to 148 and met up with a polish bodybuilder. This is where everything changed. He taught me about how to correctly count calories, manage my macro nutrients, change food choices, and introduced me to the world of park workouts. I started learning slowly and we exchanged emails for a while. My real turning point with diet was when I asked him if I could have honey in my oatmeal and he said ""Stop being a little bitch and only eat what you need. Do you need honey?"". In my first week of eating 6 times a day, managing everything, doing my park muscle workouts followed by an hour of low intensity power walking, and skating all week long, I lost about 8 lbs in that one week after plateauing for months. I lost 2 lbs each week for the three weeks following and stopped there. 

I continued running, doing sessions of insanity here and there as college started but it was a struggle to maintain. During the month I had between fall and spring semesters I started insanity. I ate 6 times a day. My entire diet consisted of chicken, sweet potato, peanut butter, whole wheat/grain bread, greek yogurt, kashi cereal, fruits, and brown rice. That's it. I was extremely determined and nothing was going to stop me. I was sleeping only three hours a night because of school work, and often work still do my workout day If I pulled an all nighter. I almost finished the program but with two weeks left I got very very sick with the flu for 2 weeks and completely through me off my game. I vowed to myself after this I wouldn't go back to a gym. I loved it and gained about 6 lbs while losing fat. I simply maintained until the end of the semester. 

**Phase 3** :

By May (of 2012 at this point) I started working out at the park again. I was beginning to fulfill a long time fitness dream of doing a full perfect form wide arm pull-up. My workout plan was a two day split of pyramid workouts. 

Day 1:
pullupx1, Pushupx10, pullupx2, pullupx10 etc. to 5 reps then back down.

Up until I could do full pullups I would jump up, hold 10 seconds, and slowly come down. That would be 1 rep. 

Run for 30-50 minutes. Towards the end of workout find hill and sprint up max speed and walk back down 6 times. 

Day 2: 

Same pyramid idea with dips &amp; whatever this is (http://www.bodyrock.tv/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/ReversePushUp11.jpg) which worked on my biceps and back.

I also did 50 squats each leg x2

Same cardio.

1 day rest and repeat.(Sometimes no rest. I'll keep looping these two days)

Diet was the same as during insanity time and usually had my calories at around 2000-2300 a day. 

I had significant gains in muscle. By August I was in love with my new found strength and was like a monkey. Anything I could hang off of I would do so and if I could I would do pull ups. I was able to do 6 slow and controlled pullups by doing this workout.

The first week of August I had to fill in at my friend's job for the following 5 weeks. There, I worked 3 days a week for 36 hours. 3 to 3 as a barback. This was a really tough job that required a lot of heavy lifting, and running around the building. You also got no chance to eat except for the customers left overs when cleaning up their bar food in the kitchen. By the time you got home you were usually too tired to even eat. 

At the end of those five weeks I dropped 15 lbs from muscle loss, fat loss, and from being malnourished. 

School starts a few days later and it soon gets rough. I can't do schoolwork at home so I decide to solve my procrastination issues by sleeping at 6 or 7 pm and getting up at two in the morning. Get to school at 3am'ish and stay there until 5:30pm when I would drive home. No exercise was done and diet was thrown away as there are no local options. Winter break I began drinking a significant amount of alcohol. I got depressed. School started again and the shenanigans continued. While I wasnt getting there at 3am anymore I was still in school for 12 hours a day and later on in the week I had to put in internship hours plus homework. I began drinking basically every weekend to the point where I drank 500-750ml each time I drank. Some weekends going to 2 liters.

Did I also mention that my diet for this time has been mcdonalds, burritos, and pizza? (In my school this is all I have available)

**Now**: 

Now, half way through college, 25lbs heavier, deciding to quit drinking all together before it becomes a problem, I am happy, motivated and ready to get started.

Info:

Age:19

Height: 5'7/5'8 

Weight:160

How often do I exercise?: 0 days a week

Diet:Terrible compared to my old standards. I took out the terrible things but It still isn't a ""bodybuilder diet"". I am completely comfortable drastically changing my diet as long as I have a plan. (How many calories per meal, what are in these meals, when to eat these meals and why) 


**What I want**: 

Lose these 25lbs of fat I gained. Have muscle strength gains. I don't want to say I can bench press 300lbs. I want to say, ""I can do a hand stand, I can do 20 pullups, I can do 100 pushups, I have a 6 pack"". 

Goals for summer:

I. Drop 20-25 lbs of fat

II. Reach 10 Wide arm, slow and controlled Pullups

III. 70 push ups straight

IV.  7 minute mile runs for a 10k



**What I want from /r/Fitness**: 

I. Help me establish a workout plan that targets the major muscle groups of my body that can be done at a park? 

II. Help me establish a diet that will supplement my workouts and allow my to lose fat in a quick and healthy fashion. 

III. Help me figure out how to maintain some of my fitness level and at least not gain any weight when I go back to school. I'm absolutely sick of losing weight and building my fitness level over and over again. 



**Considerations &amp; Kidney issues**:

I had cancer as a child and had a kidney removed as well as parts of several other organs. Ever since my creatinine NOT creatine levels have been very high. This is can be worsened via large amounts of protein. I am recommended not to push it more than 70 grams a day. If my levels go to high, my kidney can become so overworked, it will fail and I will need dialysis. If I can keep it under 70 that would be great.

My park has monkey bars, pullup bar, and longbars for dips. There is also a pole attached to this area that can be used simply for climbing.



Thank you so much if you have gotten this far. It really means so much to me if you can help out. I'm a classical guitarist and music therapist in training, if I can somehow repay using my skills I would be more than glad.

Gaming? Photoshop? Web browsing? etc. If you need a Workstation, be specific on the programs you'll be using.

It's going to primarily be for gaming. It's a present for a friend who has been using an old laptop that I gave him two years ago (which was only ever midrange, and was 2 years old when I gave it to him). 

&gt;What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?

$500

&gt;When do you plan on building/buying the PC? (note: if you're planning on buying more than 2 weeks from now, it's very much recommended you wait and come back then, to ensure you get the most recent and accurate price data)

I plan on doing the build over the summer, since I got a sweet internship that's paying well. I understand that the prices will fluctuate, but I want to get a good idea of what to look for.

&gt;What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? ""Everything"" is not specific enough. Just the tower? Operating System? Keyboard, mouse, monitor, speakers/headset, WiFi adapter, etc?

We can make do without most of the accessories since he has some from his even more ancient pcs, but I'd like to include a monitor that isn't a shitty crt.

&gt;Which country will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in the US, are you near a Microcenter store?

I will be purchasing in Austin, TX and to be perfectly honest I have no idea as I don't currently live there.

&gt;If reusing any parts, what parts will you be reusing? Please be especially specific about the power supply. List make and model. If you have a monitor, list the size/resolution.

Like I said, he has a keyboard and mouse. They're really shitty, but they'll do.

&gt;Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line?

Doubtful. Maybe way down the line, but somehow I doubt the form factor will allow for much

&gt;If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, please list them. Examples might include rear and/or front-panel USB 3.0, a RAID setup, etc.

I want it to be small and durable, so that he can move it around. So mATX probably

&gt;Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes, what OS? Is it 32bit or 64bit?

Yes, I am absolutely swimming in legit Windows licenses, and worst-case scenario the license on his current laptop will transfer. I have both 32 and 64 bit licenses.

&gt;Extra info or specifics:

I really don't know anything about AMD (I'm more of an Intel+Nvidia guy), and I have a strong feeling that that's the way this build is going to have to go. However I would like to note that I want this PC to last as long as possible since I doubt he will have the money to upgrade.

Finally, as prices are bound to fluctuate, I'm fine with the build going a bit over budget."

It poured yesterday and then rained a little bit consistently throughout the day until about 18 hours ago. There was visible moisture coming up from under some of the paint that was chipping up when I blew pine needles with a leaf blower

The stain itself says that you're supposed to not use it if rain is expected within 24-36 hours. It's supposed to rain (per weather channel 40-60%) 10 hours after this post goes up and continue for at least the next 12 hours after

He wants us to stain it 2 hours from this post going up and is a very stubborn man. Is there any way I'll be able to convince him otherwise? I'd like to know how much damage this can potentially do to the deck so I can attempt to convince him to put this off. 

I have a ton of time off now (didn't get an internship for the summer like I wanted and don't otherwise work too many hours) but he doesn't trust me to do it on my own. 

I'd just like some advice on what exactly this is going to do and how bad of an idea it exactly is.

Edit: I'd just like to add that we're using the solid color stain on a non stripped deck other than where it has been peeling "

I'm 18, and in college. Currently in NYC for an internship this summer. I'm okay when it comes to game in college, it's *way* easier than when you don't know anyone.

So I'm in NY, and I don't know anyone. Literally not a single person, which kicks ass because I'm forced to be social.

Started an under-21 GothamSeddit groupme, and went out with some of the guys from there last night.

**FR:**

I knew I had to approach, and kick this AA but it wasn't until last night that I finally approached. We went to an NYU bar that doesn't ID, and the guy I was with was killing it. He was mad social, ridiculously good at talking to girls, and I was like standing there thinking I don't know anyone.

So I opened a set of two girls - they weren't that cute but I really just needed to get out of my head. Turns out they were both PhD students, and they had some pretty cool stories to tell. I felt like it really ended up being interview-ish, and that made it kind of awkward. Still, I think I held conversation with them pretty well, but exiting the set was a little hard. I got a phone call, so I just left after that. Any tips on how to exit a set better?

After that, I opened a girl with her friend (""Is this seat taken? No. Great, hey I'm Vulkreem""). She was pretty cool and we talked for a bit and I had her laughing a bit. After I left, the guy I was with introduced me to his set, and I was **awkward**. It looks like I'm a lot better with sets I open myself - how do I fix this?

After that we left the bar, and walked around a bit. Everything was pretty dead and another guy from the GroupMe came. We walked to Union Square (this was around 2am), and it was dead so we decided to head back. I was feeling kinda shitty, because I hadn't really had much success all night. I'd opened sets on my own which was pretty cool for me, but I was still pretty awkward.

I got to the subway station, and it kicked ass. A cute girl sat next to me and I opened her (I literally wouldn't have done this yesterday). We started talking, and another girl comes and sits next to me. The original girl leaves once her train comes, and the girl next to me opens by saying ""Did I hear you're Australian?!"". 

We get along really well, she was a little tipsy but mad friendly and I definitely ramped up the kino. I'm annoyed that I didn't kiss her, because there were so many damn opportunities. She tells me she's living in Brooklyn and that I should crash, but I tell her I have work tomorrow so I can't, and I tell her to crash at mine. She agrees, and I'm thrown off. Definitely didn't expect that.

I'm trying to work out logistics, and I realize I need to get up at 7 in the morning for work. I mention that and she decides not to come back with me because she doesn't want to be kicked out at 7. I didn't push for it (should I have?) because I felt like it'd be a hassle.

She also opens another girl who's sitting next to her and we all start talking. I'm super in-state, not in my head at all, and girl #2 asks how me and girl #1 met. I had my arm around her so she's surprised we met 10 minutes ago :)

Their train comes, they leave, and then mine comes so I leave.

/FR

**Sticking points:**

* I can't tease for shit, and I'm generally not very funny.
* Kino, kino, kino. If I don't kino when I first say hi, it's generally pretty hard for me to just start
* How do I not be in my head so much?"

##Stats:

&gt;A/S/L and do you love where you live?
&gt;&gt;30-Something, New Englander. Life is good up here, if you're into mountains, good food and craft beer.

&gt;Relationship Status?
&gt;&gt;Legally binding.

##Favorites:

&gt;Cats or Dogs?
&gt;&gt;Growing up, we had a coon hound and a siamese cat. After those two moved on, we had a chocolate lab and a beagle, and then two more cats, and then we raised two of the cats those other two made...

&gt;&gt;Cats are fine, but I'm a dog person. We have a 3 year old [mutt shepherd pound puppy](http://i.imgur.com/hKdy3uc.jpg). People who don't enjoy dogs concern me. 

&gt;Favorite beverage?
&gt;&gt;I live on coffee, water, beer, and wine. And vodka. Give me the hoppiest IPA you can find and I'm happy. [Heady Topper](http://i.imgur.com/G2f701x.jpg), as a Vermonter I'm proud to see we managed to take over the #1 spot on BeerAdvocate.com's top 250 not too long ago.

&gt;Food?
&gt;&gt;The Reuben is the one true sandwich. 

&gt;Favorite movies/tv shows?
&gt;&gt;*True Romance* would have to be my all-time favorite film. Quentin Tarantino writes a better screenplay than anyone out there, not enough people appreciate this film. [Christopher Walken interrogating Dennis Hopper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3yon2GyoiM) is one of the greatest scenes in cinematic history. 

&gt;&gt;Honorable mention to: *The Jerk, Run Ronnie Run, Raising Arizona, Scorsese, Christopher Guest, and Woody Allen.*

&gt;&gt;For TV I grew up on Seinfeld, the Simpsons, X-Files and Northern Exposure. Then, The Sopranos, The Wire, Fringe, and Curb Your Enthusiasm. Currently, Shameless, Game of Thrones, Parks &amp; Rec, and House of Lies. And Jeopardy every night.

&gt;Music?
&gt;&gt;I’m a degenerate Phish fan. But Primus, Sublime, Hendrix, Pantera, Grateful Dead, The Clash, NoFX, Bad Religion, John Lee Hooker...just about anything but that country twang.

&gt;Books?
&gt;&gt;*The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy* series is probably the top of my list. I found an old beat-to-hell paperback copy of *The Restaurant at the End of the Universe* in a Ground Round parking lot when I was about 10, and I re-read them all every few years. Many years later, after a fellow redditor said 'No please don't', I created [r/vogonpoetrycircle](http://www.reddit.com/r/vogonpoetrycircle).

&gt;&gt;But Kurt Vonnegut is the best writer out there. Dry sardonic humor, and most everything he said was simply put and vaguely profound. Everyone should probably read everything he's written. 
I also have a weakness for [Stephen King](http://i.imgur.com/gTYC1m8.jpg?1). Growing up, me and my dad would read every King novel that we could get our hands on. 

&gt;&gt;And Hunter S. Thompson, Cormac McCarthy, Chuck Palahniuk, Mark Twain, Isaac Asimov, and Michael Crichton. Also others.

&gt;Games?
&gt;&gt;I've lost my gaming mojo over the last few years, I grew up obsessing over anything Tim Schafer; mostly Grim Fandango, Day of the Tentacle, and Monkey Island II.

&gt;&gt;I've spent years of my life at the poker table, and play some rummy, cribbage, and Risk. And as much disc golf as I can manage.

&gt;What is your favorite word or expression?
&gt;&gt;“Hey”. I use it constantly to acknowledge, without engaging, random people throughout my life.

##Miscellanea:

&gt;What makes you laugh?
&gt;&gt;Dry wit and jokes with some depth. Good humor should make a good point by taking something we overlook and exaggerating it to the point of absurdity.

&gt;What is your biggest pet peeve?
&gt;&gt;People. Specifically:
&gt;&gt;* When they don't pay attention during a movie.
&gt;&gt;* When I'm reading and they're doing something around me.
&gt;&gt;* When they leave **00:01** on the microwave.
&gt;&gt;* When they forget to remind me about something I specifically asked them to remind me of.
&gt;&gt;* When they wear looney tunes T-shirts in public.

&gt;What was the best thing about the last year?
&gt;&gt;Finally getting my parents to Fenway Park was pretty nice. 

&gt;What are you looking forward to in the year ahead?
&gt;&gt;Same thing I look forward to every year. A week of camping with some friends for the 4th of July, out on an island just off the coast. It's my only good excuse to bust out [my America shorts.](http://i.imgur.com/xPuJE6m.jpg)

&gt;If you were granted one do-over, what would it be?
&gt;&gt;I'd have done some internships during college. Graduating with no experience makes it tough to claw your way up the resume pile when you're up against people who have actually done the job already. 

&gt;A butterfly flaps its wings... what small thing have you done or said that lead to something disproportionately larger?
&gt;&gt;My old college no longer allows students to use rocks or cinder blocks as doorstops in the dorms, because I was a moron. Which I assume has saved countless lives since implemented.

&gt;All things considered what is the most important thing in the world to you?
&gt;&gt;Being good to good people and letting the rest be.

##Concerning reddit:

&gt;What is the origin or meaning of your user name?
&gt;&gt;Kurt Vonnegut’s alter ego Kilgore Trout, and my old baseball jersey number.

&gt;Total number of reddit identities you’ve had?
&gt;&gt;I’ve had lots of one night stands, two semi-regulars, but mostly just this one.

&gt;What is your favorite part of reddit?
&gt;&gt;The community. Some of you people are really good people. And there's someone around every corner that can teach you way too much about any random thing you'd ever like to know, if you look in the right places.

&gt;What do you do when you’re not on reddit?
&gt;&gt;My usual routine on a day off is grabbing a coffee, heading to the dog park, wandering over to the used book store, and then finding a deck to drink a pint and enjoy a meal of food. 

&gt;&gt;Other than that, I play some disc golf, read, go hiking, watch baseball or listen to it on the radio.

&gt;What subreddits, if any, do you moderate.   What about those communities do you like?   
&gt;&gt;[r/fantasybaseball](http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasybaseball), [r/vogonpoetrycircle](http://www.reddit.com/r/vogonpoetrycircle), [r/politics](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/)

&gt;&gt;I took over r/fantasybaseball a few years ago, and it’s grown from 50 to 6,000 pretty quickly, and I’m just starting to draw in some regular writers and “baseball experts” to do some random IAmA style things. And I’m a fantasy baseball addict, so they may not realize it but really I’m just using them to feed me good info all day long.

&gt;&gt;r/politics is tedious business, but I do enjoy a good heated political discussion, and the modmail’s entertaining enough to make it all worthwhile.

&gt;Do you think reddit has changed in the last year or so?
&gt;&gt;Yes it’s very busy.

&gt;If so, do you think it’s been for the better?
&gt;&gt;I'm sure pros probably outweigh the cons.

##Final Question:

&gt;Is there anything you'd like to plug/promote/advocate?

1e23tx,0,2013-05-10,I just need to talk about how I have been feeling the past few years.,username1523,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1e23tx/i_just_need_to_talk_about_how_i_have_been_feeling/,"Well, I really need to type out how I have been feeling recently because I don't feel comfortable actually talking to anyone about this.  This is going to be really long so read whatever you want, I'm doing this for myself mostly.

I guess I'll start with a little information about myself.  I'm going to avoid as much detail as possible.  I am a female in my very early 20's and am nearly done with school at a four year state university.  My major is in a difficult engineering field.  I think that I have had a very normal middle class upbringing.  My scholarships pay for my college tuition.

In middle school I felt like I had a lot of friends and loved hanging out with them all the time.  Sometime in early high school I stopped having so many friends.  I felt awkward around people and never knew what to say in any situation.  I was very quiet.  I still had a few good friends and quite a few people that I talked with occasionally from the one musical extra curricular activity I participated in.  

Around this time I got really into a certain mmorpg video game and spent most days playing it when I got home from school.  I would frequently decline invitations from my friends and family to do things because I thought it would be more fun to stay home and play the video game.  This attitude persisted through sophomore and junior year of high school.  I had two boyfriends over this time, for about a few weeks each.  It started the same with both of them.  I randomly decided that I liked them, flirted with them until they asked me to date them, and then I basically did nothing with them and wanted nothing to do with them.  One of them broke up with me, and I broke up with the other one.  I basically felt nothing about those relationships, or ending them.

Senior year of high school I for some reason become interested in my friends again and hung out with them frequently.  I pretty much quit the video game for the year.  I also become interested in a guy that we will call Jack that was my year in school.  I flirted with him for a semester until he asked me out and we began dating.  I liked this guy a lot and was very excited about our relationship.  I couldn't believe that he was interested in me as I thought I was kind of a loser and had no chance with him.  

Fast forward to the next Fall, when I began college.  I was still in a relationship with Jack and we went to the same state university where a lot of people from our high school went to college.  I guess I was under the impression that college was supposed to be full of friends and fun, and I think I was disappointed that that was not my experience.  I was not in a sorority or anything like that, and neither was Jack.  I signed up for a women in engineering camp type thing for a few days before classes started to try and meet new people, and I really tried, but it was mostly awkward and I didn't make any friends that I kept in contact with.  I was rooming with two friends from high school in the dorms.   I was resentful of their college experience, as they both seemed to be making a lot of friends and always had events to go to or friends to hang out and drink with while I felt alone except for them and Jack. 

My relationship with those two friends slowly got worse.  I would frequently lash out and make fun of their classes or their majors, as I was an arrogant engineering major and thought their majors and classes were easy and useless.  I couldn't stand listening to them complain about how hard their communications class was.  For unrelated reasons I am no longer friends at all with one of them.  The other one and I are still very good friends and still live together.

This whole time I was spending way too much time with Jack because I felt like I had no one else.  We had one big fight freshman year because one of my roommates called me out for having him over too much, and then he blew me off the next day for dinner with my parents, and things spiraled downhill, but we got over it and never broke up.  I was basically resentful of anyone who had friends and went out ad had a good time doing anything.  

Sophomore year was a really bad time.  My classes got harder and more specific and I had no friends in them.  I wanted to go to major-specific events, but I didn't want to go alone so I stayed home.  I had still basically not made any new friends in college at all. I started working in a professor's research lab, doing menial work and actually somewhat enjoyed the company of my coworkers but never did anything with them outside of lab.  

I was taking the maximum allowed number of hours the second semester and was very stressed, and typically did not want to engage in any sexual behavior with Jack and snapped at him frequently.  I was making the best possible GPA this whole time which I think put a lot of pressure on me to continue getting A's.  I felt like it was really the only thing I had going for me and if I made a B I would be a mediocre loser without any friends.  I kept telling Jack that I was sorry for how I was treating him and that it would be better when I was no longer stressed.  I cried frequently.  I actually won the only award from my department given to sophomores that year.  That summer was not a very good time either.  I took one very stressful summer class, but after that was over in June I was extremely bored all the time.  I hung out with Jack a lot but that usually consisted of us both being bored together.  I wasn't really excited to see him anymore.

My junior year started and I applied to be one of the dozen tutors for my department that has office hours and plans events for sophomores and was accepted.  At this point some people in my class did actually know who I was since word had gotten around I guess that I did really well on the tests.  I had made two kind of new friends in my summer class because they were friends with one person that I knew from high school.  I was still really bitter about my college experience being pretty much worthless in terms of having any fun, and I knew that was probably my fault but didn't know what to do about it.

Jack had turned 21 so we could at least drink when we wanted to, which I saw as a good thing because we had had limited access to alcohol before.  We didn't drink much at all though.  I did get to know some of the other tutors but didn't get their numbers or do anything with them outside of events.  I still kind of dreaded going to the events and socializing.  

I actually made one friend that I had most of my classes with, but only because she is really friendly and pretty much forced her friendship upon me (which was a good thing).  I was starting to cheer up at this point as I had about three new friends in my classes, but still felt like it was pretty pitiful that they were my only friends as we were not close and they had plenty of other friends.  My relationship with Jack was okay.  I tutored someone privately that I ended up liking a lot.  We got along really well but haven't really hung out as he's a guy and I didn't really feel comfortable with that.

The last semester was actually not bad, although it was really rough grade and stress-wise.  I think I still got all A's.  I started being included in a group of people in my major basically through constant proximity since we all had the same schedule.  I went to a party with them recently and felt pretty awkward, but then went to the bars with a couple of them and had a decent time.  

I don't know what I think about Jack anymore though.  It's been eating away at me for a while that I don't know if I still want to be with him.  I feel like he constantly disagrees with me and I don't feel loved or supported, even though I see him trying and doing things for me all the time.  I don't feel like he is ever really interested in things I tell him or my stories.  I feel like we never do anything fun.  But I also think that might be me never thinking anything is fun or me not wanting to do things that could be fun.

I don't know if I could break up with him though.  I should still be attracted to him because nothing has changed but I am never really interested in sexual things and occasionally give in just so he doesn't complain or think I don't like him.  There's nothing wrong with him.  He does so much for me, but he doesn't tell me he loves me and I don't know... compared to how excited I used to be about him I don't know how to feel anymore. He makes me angry a lot when I try to talk to him about my feelings.  I tell him that I'm just not happy with my life and he doesn't understand.   He gets very sad and won't talk about it if I try to address problems in our relationship. 

What's bothering me is that I don't know why I can't feel happy.  I don't know what's going on.  I don't really feel strong emotions about anything.  My one new friend always tries to talk to me about her boy issues and I don't feel like I can relate at all, I try to give encouragement but I feel emotionally shut down.  I really love my family but I just don't feel like talking about myself at all when my mom calls and asks how things are going.  I usually give a few word answers and feel terrible about it because I'm not even interested in talking.

I am about to move for an internship over the summer and will be alone in my own apartment.  It should be really exciting but I don't even feel like I want to do it.  I don't want to deal with meeting new people.  The bad thing is I don't even feel that sad about being away from Jack all summer.  I've never been with anyone except him and I don't know how I feel about that.  I wish I could try being with someone else without hurting him or losing him in case it's the best I'll find.  Not that I even think I could find someone else at all.

I don't know... I think I have low self esteem.  I feel very unattractive all the time even though I know I'm not that bad.  It doesn't help that one of my only new friends (that's a guy) complains that there are no good looking girls in our major and how he never meets any attractive girls, etc, and he complains about this to me.  So I don't know if he's including me in that or what but it's a little sad.  I feel like if I did break up with Jack I would just be completely alone, I would be people's acquaintance third wheel type friend.  I don't really feel like anyone else would date me.  The best I've felt recently was when I was at a somewhat friend's house and their mom told me I was too attractive to be in my field.  I get a compliment like this every once in a while and it's usually the highlight of my month.  I used to post pictures of myself on the forums of my mmorpg guild because it made me feel better that people on the internet would compliment me.  I'm pretty embarrassed by this now.

I still feel like the only thing I have going for me is my grades.  I worry that I should be trying to go to grad school or something, but I also don't even want to deal with trying to apply and pick one and all that.  I have no idea why I picked my major, I feel like it's just something that happened.  I'm not that interested in it, but there's not really anything else that I like better.  I have practically no hobbies and don't even know where to begin as nothing sounds enjoyable.  I spent pretty much every day the last semester doing homework and studying or hanging out with Jack.  I don't know what I want to do with my life but I know that at the moment I'm not very happy, and I don't know what I can do to improve that.  

Now I have an overwhelming urge to edit this as it's long and probably doesn't say what I want to say but I'll just post anyway.  "

But oh well, I'll try to keep it informative enough to just give myself away, and short enough to miss a lot of information.

It starts with this girl. I've known her for a few years since she's been in my major, and in the past two semesters I've worked more closely with her in classes. Attraction developed, she was with a guy in a long-distance deal, but I pulled the nervous gunman card and expressed my interest while she was still with him. She said she was surprised, I hid it well. Then told me she was glad I finally let her know.

About a month later, she's broken up with the guy after they both agree it's for the best. It takes me two weeks after this to finally ask her to go out with me, and even though she's not available that Friday, she said she'd ""really like to some time"" and the smiley faces &amp; exclamation marks started showing up in texts.

So for the next week or so we kept on throwing ideas out there. Either one of us was working, or out of town, but it was raincheck after raincheck. Following a few beers one night, I invited her to come out to a bonfire and do some stargazing with me. She was passed out but responded the next day, disappointed that she didn't get my text. She hadn't been to a fire in a year (city folk...) and never really stargazed, or saw a meteor.

Finally I had enough beer one night to bare my inner manchild, and I texted her some really sappy, dripping-with-desperation stuff about what it's like for me when she lets her hair down, and something about wanting to hold her hand... She responded with ""I'm really blushing right now,"" told me that she wasn't good at this kind of stuff (what?), and then I took that opportunity to ask her if she wanted to grab a late breakfast after our final the following day. She said that sounded good, smiley face, hooray.

I should take this time to mention that we are now both aware of the fact that at the end of this semester, she is graduating and moving back home, while I am heading the opposite direction for an internship. So not many opportunities to see each other due to night jobs. I am actually writing this from said internship location, and the convenient time to see her is over. It will easily be a month before I even have an opportunity, and according to her summer plans she will be busy with family, and possibly getting a call back on a job that will seal the long-distance deal.

Anyhow, the ""date"" was OK. Since it was my first I didn't rightly know how to get to know someone on such short terms, so I asked her about her career plans, aspirations, etc. Nothing very personal, not even flirty. It went well, she said she wants to hang out more, and she alluded to coming back down to the college town over summer (where I will be finishing my degree) to have some local fun. I didn't immediately recognize this as her desire to come back and spend time with me, so I just kinda let that subtle invitation pass unnoticed.

The date ended with a very awkward goodbye, as we both drove to meet at the restaurant, and I had no idea how to leave without just saying ""Well, I guess I should go."" She acknowledged it with a kind of ""oh..."" face and a few words, but I walked off much too quickly and I feel like I didn't quite communicate that I was having a good time. In retrospect it seems like I kinda ran from the place.

What am I even doing? I don't know, and any advice at all is appreciated. I wish I had more clear-cut questions, but I've decided to text her less. She told me to send her pics of the stuff I'm doing at this internship, so I may wait a handful of days and then send her a picture or two...

Suggestions? Questions? I'm all ears... TL;DR:

&gt; went on first ever date, it was odd for me but she was okay with it, &amp; seems interested. distance is now the only big factor. what do i do; regarding staying in touch, etc?"
1e1s0k,1,2013-05-09,I [25/m] find my gf [23/f] a little too impulsive and adventurous. Don't know how to sort this out.,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1e1s0k/i_25m_find_my_gf_23f_a_little_too_impulsive_and/,"I'll preface my post by saying this: Although we're in an LDR, we meet frequently and it's all going better than expected. I don't have any major complaints. I also have no intention to part ways with her. 

However, here goes:
My gf always had a very restrictive childhood because of her conservative and over protective parents. As a result she has always fancied a more happening/adventurous lifestyle that includes travel, sports and so many more things. I've consciously tried to be as supportive as I can, towards this. Thanks to the distance, she has been doing things all by herself or with friends for the last couple of weeks and months. 

Now that she is pursuing her internship, she has a bit of financial independence and time on her hands. She has been treating these two months as a letting-herself-go and having-fun period. I'm with her on this but I find some (very few) of the things she wants to do a little too impulsive and immature. 

For eg: 

1. She wants to go check out the most unsafe area in her city because she's curious. I ask her to reconsider since I'm concerned for her safety but she overlooks it all and says she'll be ok. 
1. She doesn't usually drink but she has jumped at every opportunity to go out drinking and gotten really tipsy. To a point where someone has to escort her all the way back home.


I feel helpless. I'm don't like imposing my ideas or opinions on her but I really hope she respects my requests. She has been pretty dismissive about the seriousness of some of my concerns. (If she by any chance reads this, she'll tell me I'm thinking/worrying too much). Please note that I'm from a country which is known to be terribly unsafe for women and that's where my concern/fear stems from. 

I am on the verge of starting my own business and that has been very taxing. After 15 grueling hours at work, it gets to a point where I don't feel like trying to convince her any more, but that constant fear seems unnecessary and gets really annoying.

How do I get around this?

**REALLY Long Story**

My anxiety issues first really appeared junior/senior year of high school - pretty much during the whole college application process. I just found myself getting really nervous about the prospect of college and my grades. So, I stayed home a lot. Which led to me failing a Biology class. Which made my fears even worse.

I ended up fine, graduating on time and being accepted into my first choice. I figured that the jitters I was having were part of your typical high school experience. Except, they never left. 

I went to a college out-of-state, 8 hours away. I experienced some homesickness (thinking about mom would make me well up) but I adapted well enough, made some friends, went to parties and joined some clubs. I thought everything was fine. Then I started having my doubts.

My school was very small and the degree program was very focused - you pretty much needed to declare your major freshman year to graduate on time. I was going to study zoo keeping. One of my friends, however, broke down the math one night. She was trying to justify why she was transferring out. I don't think she realized what she was doing. As I nodded and agreed with her, I felt that redhot feeling of doubt in my stomach again. She rambled on about how much it would cost to attend our school, our prospected salary, how much debt we would have to pay off... I got scared, started having near-nightly panic attacks about my future. I hid it well (I always hide it, I'm a very good faker) but I became more withdrawn, stopped hanging out with my friends. At the end of the year, I transfered out.

I thought I was being too rash with my decisions. So I got a job at a vet's office, taking a year off to decided what I wanted to do. Of course, it turned out to be one of the most stressful jobs ever. My manager, though I don't think she meant to be mean, was a nitpicker. Everyday when I left for home I knew there was something that I missed, that I would probably get lectured the next day. The Doctor was a dick. Since the turnover rate was high, we were short staffed most of the time. I was originally hired to work the kennel. I ended up being promoted to a tech. I had no experience in this field but I was running tests, holding dogs, learning to take blood. I was stressed all the time. I cried in my car during lunch all the time.l This was almost everyday for the next year.

I fantasied often about plowing my car into a tree on the way to work, just to get away from the stress. At home I was probably a monster, I was always snapping at my family and constantly on edge. You know those chills you get when you get really scared or nervous? I had those everyday.

Last year I got accepted in a nearby college that my friends attended. I was able to quit my job. For the first year I lived in a house of six people and had a blast. I originally entered thinking I was going to pursue an English degree but, again, I became concerned about the future. So I transferred into the business school. 

I don't why I did it. It was horrible. I tried being attentive but I found myself feeling over my head. I don't know why, I knew the material but I became lackluster. I didn't have any energy to get out of bed. I missed a lot of classes. My grades suffered. I started getting those nervous jitters again, school was constantly on my mind but still, I found myself chained to my bed, looking at my clock knowing that I was missing classes. I was both terrified and uncaring. I ended up being placed on academic probation and had a nervous breakdown in my car, scared I was going to flunk out of college. Called my mom, cried about my problems. I also - get this - lied to her and told her I was talking with a counselor. I wanted her to think I was getting help, I didn't want to worry her. The closest I got to actually seeking help was a voicemail I left for the school's therapist, asking to schedule a time to meet with him. I never heard back, so I never pursued it.

I got some of my shit together this year, worked hard and got taken off academic probation. Found a major I really enjoyed (despite the fact my job outlook is still poor), found a new hobby (photography), got an internship at my local paper, a column in my school's newspaper. I even applied to become an editor at my school's newspaper and I have a good feeling I got it.

Everything is going pretty good, right? 

Nope.

These anxiety fears are now constant, no matter how good or bad I'm doing it's always there. Money, grades, my future, finals - I feel like I'm always tiptoeing around, that I'm about to breakdown again even though I can't pinpoint a reason why. It's like I'm waiting for something to happen. 

My parents went out of country to attend a wedding, I was left to watch my siblings. We were left $600. There's less then $100 and I don't know where it all went. I have rent due in a couple hours, $400. I have $10 in my bank account. My mother already said not to worry about it, but I am. I had a panic attack. Those thoughts of just... being dead are still rampant. 

Then Allie, of Hyperbole and a Half, came back and discussed her battle with depression. I realized that a lot of what she was dealing with was what I have been constantly battling for the last three years. She wrote something along of lines of wanting to be dead but not actually wanting to kill herself and it was so close to home that it scared me.

I'm just tired guys. I just want to wake up one day and be normal. I'm sick of being sad or nervous all the time, it's really starting to wear on my... well, nerves. I want to stop having this thoughts of just... being dead. I want to stop being mean to everyone around me. So that's why I'm finally asking - where the hell do I start?"

Glad this sub exists!",[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1e1foz/not_even_looking_for_people_to_read_this_just/,"It's really frustrating. He doesnt do much around the house, and it kind of hurts my feelings, really. All of the advice on Reddit is ""talk to him, tell him how you feel"". Welp, I have, a ton of times, and nothing really changes. Instead of getting angry about it, I actually get hurt. I want him to want to help me out, ya know? 

We split up the chores when we first moved in together, but there's never been one week in the almost full year weve been living together that he has done them without 1) me asking, 2) doing a half ass job. One of his chores is to take the trash and recycling out, but he will wait until they're literally overflowing and smelling. It's so overflowing that we have to put recycling items next to it, we cant even fit it inside. Still, he doesnt even take it out. Before we moved two weeks ago we had a big back porch and he would just take the bag out of the trash can and put it on the porch. One time I counted and there were 7 bags back there. He was too lazy to bring them to the dumpster. I think he thinks it's normal, but Ive never had a boyfriend be so disrepectful or just plain disgusting with that. When I tell my friends or have them over they are grossed out, too. I know I'm not the crazy one. 

I should also mention that his only chore was to take out the trash and recycling. I clean the house, do all of our laundry, take care of the cats solely, and only recently (1 week ago) asked him if we could switch off with scooping the yard (we have two dogs) and the dishwasher). I do all the vet appointments. If there is something wrong with the house I set up and meet with the plumber, etc. I handle all of the bills. His dishes are constantly piling up in the sink and smelling, even when we have a dishwasher 1 foot away. His dishes pile up so high that sometimes I cant even refill our Brita and have had to use the bathroom sink on a number of occasions - and just to even wash my hands sometimes.

He complains that he's busy. He works as an engineer, and does work hard. I dont mean to make it a contest, but I hate that excuse.  He works full time and volunteers for 1 organization. I work full time at a non-profit, volunteer full time for two organizations, am in grad school full time, AND just started an 8 hour a week internship. It's really, really, really hard to take it all on.

We have two dogs and he doesnt do anything for them besides walk ONE of them in the morning. He doesnt take them to the park, doesnt spend time with them. When he gets home from work he just lays on the bed. I'll get home and ask ""have the dogs been fed?"" ""no"" ""have they been let out"" ""no, I JUST got home"". Well, they're living creatures, man. Theyre youre responsibility. 

He adopted a dog last February before we moved in together that ended up tragically passing away a few months later. For the first few months he would walk her everyday, 5 miles a day. Why wont he do that with our dogs (1 was mine before, and 1 we adopted together)? It's like the second we moved in together he lost all of his responsibility traits. He used to come home every lunch break to let his dog out. He's never done that once with ours. Not once. He knows I will take care of them and obviously not let anything happen to them, so it's like he just sits back and lets me handle it. They're two big lab-mixes. Theyre sweet hearts, but a ton of work. I guess I should have saw it coming, because before we moved in together I was the one who ended up taking care of his dog at his apartment. I would go over on my lunch break and let her out for him. Towards the end, I saw her more than he did.

I am so drained with work, volunteerships, internships, taking care of our pets, AND trying to be a good girlfriend. I just broke down and cried the other day in the shower from exhaustion. I am also a damn good girlfriend. Being on Reddit has made me realize how good of a girlfriend I am. It's also made me realize that he's kind of... shitty. I cant believe some of the stuff guys on here do for their girlfriends. I dont need an award, but I would love a ""thanks"" every once in a while. Some recognition, ya know? I literally dont ask for anything. I split everything financially, I'm not clingy, I have sex with him WHENEVER he wants and give him head 4 - 5 times a week without ever asking to cum on my own. It's been weeks since Ive cum, but I dont complain or say anything. I'll just take care of myself on my own time.

On top of it he kind of puts me down a lot. He's made it clear on more than one occasion that he thinks his work is more important than mine (I work with animals in the nonprofit world) or that hes busier. Tells me I cant do certain things, ""youll screw it up"", micromanages when I am taking a project on on my own. It really fucking hurts.

I volunteer as a rape crisis hotline advocate, and I'm also a ""survivor"" myself. Never once has he asked me how I'm going or how it's affecting me. We also have a huge issue going on at my organization right now that is affecting the dogs at work. Staff is so upset that people just break down crying in the halls. HR had counselors come in for us to talk to. He never asked me how I was handling it, updates, or if I was okay. Again, not looking for attention, but even a quick ""you doing okay?"" would mean the world to me.

With all that being said, I think this frustrates me the most because he is genuinely a good guy. He is truly one of those ""nice guys"" girls talk about. I really did luck out in terms of having someone that is trustworthy. I would literally trust him in a room full of naked girls and not blink. He does love me, and a lot, in his own fucked up way, though he doesnt really show it with his actions. He's just lazy, and thats what is so frustrating. Besides that, he's as perfect as you can get, so I guess you cant get everything you want, right? I would rather have a good relationship with someone who is a slob than a bad relationship with someone who empties the dishwasher regularly."

That's the bottom of the barrel, it puts one in jeopardy of being labelled..


I apologize to A2 reddit, but maybe someone on here can think a little and knows of a resource, don't want to be labelled a kook, I mentioned I had a closed head injury a long time ago, that seemed to throw the UM intern I spoke with.
Funny if you look on their website they state how they work with underserved populations and Cognitive Behavior Therapy anyway it appears to be right up my alley, but they won't take me and sure refunded my $40 within 2 days by mail, I swear! ( $40 was for taking the initial test on a laptop)


Med Rehab bldg 4 Briarwood has a Doctor but , another Doctor- Thomas Joseph Higgins formerly of Bldg 4 but currently in the penitentiary for molesting patients (Look it up on OTIS), was located in the adjoining office a few years back..
MY girlfriend was one of the patients who was victimized.  This Doctor currently there,from what I've been told by my GF was in such close proximity to the criminal Doctor that he had to have known stuff was going on but did nothing to help those women.
So I won't be utilizing him!



The Depression Center up on Plymouth Rd, asked me on the phone,actually bellowed into the phone :if I was bipolar or schizophrenic,( How professional!), I don't believe I am either, I don't see things or hear voices either. 
Sorry for the long ass post.

And yes My  UM Doctor did make me a referral and they (UM Washington Street) still declined to continue to see me."
1e5h4o,1,2013-05-11,The only day I didn't mind staying 45 minutes after closing,[deleted],TalesFromThePharmacy,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromThePharmacy/comments/1e5h4o/the_only_day_i_didnt_mind_staying_45_minutes/,"*This story is an old one for me, back when I was just a wee Pharmacy student intern at the local town Pharmacy/grocery store. One of my Pharmacists (Let's call her M) was married to a doctor in town (let's call him DrM). We got scripts from him and his office all of the time.  On to the story...*

It was mid-week, and our after-work rush had just started. I was working with a Pharmacist who was not M today, let's call her Jen.  In walks this lady with two prescriptions. I quickly glance at them, Omeprazole &amp; Oxycodone, and I knew we had enough of both in stock (let's call her CII Lady, or C2L). I told her that the current wait time was around 30-40 minutes (much longer then normal for us, but when there is a rush, what can you do?), while verifying I had her information in the system. She was polite, courteous, and told me to not worry, that she would be back much later that evening to pick them up.  I thanked her, and went back to the mad scramble of filling scripts. 

After the rush, I went back to C2L's scripts, as she said she would be back later that evening.  I scanned them into the computer, and started entering them.  The oxycodone prescription popped up first on my screen. I enter it; the label prints. As the omeprazole script pops up, I do a double take. I reach over and grab the hard copies of the scripts, and look more carefully at them.  They are definitely DrM's prescription pad. No doubt there. C2L's name, drug, sig code, quantity, etc, all look like his typical semi-horrible handwriting.  

But his signature... it just looks off. 

Normally, DrM's signature reminds me of John Hancocks signature, all smooth and graceful. This signature, however, was more sharp and angled.  Thinking I was losing my mind, I dug around in a few profiles to find other examples of prescriptions from him.  None of them quite matched the scripts I had in my hands. I checked with Jen and she agreed it looked a bit funny but overall did look like a legit prescription.  She said to call the office and verify anyways.  After all, that's part of our jobs and her license on the line. 

Of course, the office is now closed. 

Knowing C2L was coming back that night, I hesitantly called Pharmacist M at home.  When she picked up, I told her I was calling with a question for her husband regarding a script and *profusely* apologized for calling them at home.  He doesn't mind and came to the phone. I asked him if he saw that particular patient that day.  He confirmed he had.  I then asked him if he wrote for a CII for her.  There was a *long* pause on the other end of the phone. He then replied with, ""No, I did not.  She asked for one, and I refused."" I thanked him, said I may be calling back later with more questions, and hung up.

Well, now. 

Never been in this position before.

I look over to Jen, who is looking at me expectantly. When I shake my head, her smile fades slightly. She reaches over to the store phone and pages overhead, ""Security to the Pharmacy at your convenience please."" We *never* page security to the Pharmacy over the intercom.  Only with our panic buttons, which I have thankfully only used once before (that's a whole other story). So Leo, our lovely off duty cop, turned security take his time coming over (who happens to be fairly good looking, totally non-relavent to the story, but anyways). While he wanders over, I start our local chain call (I am still unsure if this is a common thing in Pharmacies or not, so far all 3 stores I have worked in since have also had one) to alert the other Pharmacies in the area that there has been a fake CII Rx found coming from DrM's office and to be on guard. 

Leo arrives, giving us a funny look. Jen lets me explain to Leo what has happened, and I finish by asking him if he would like us to call the local cops for back up in case she comes back in or if he would like to handle it if she arrives (him being an off-duty cop and all, and currently our on-duty store security). He tells me to give him a few minutes, and walks quickly away.  (I found out later, he told the store directer he was clocking out, getting his gun and badge, clocking in as a cop, and going to be chilling with Pharmacy for a bit. He's a bit protective of us, can you tell?) In the meantime, I called the Walgreens across the street, found out they were in the process of also filling an Oxycodone script for C2L, and they promptly stopped filling it.

When Leo returns, he inspected the scripts, asked to see a real one to compare it too.  So I printed off an old copy from another patients profile, ripped off her name and DOB, and gave it to him, and told him about the Walgreen's Rx across the street as well. He walks over and looks at their Rx as well, and confirms that it matches my faked one. Calls DrM to confirm what I had told him. Over the next hour: not one, not two, not even three, but *Four* other Pharmacies contact DrM stating they have also received CII Rx's from him office written for C2L this evening. Knowing this was no longer just a one-faked Rx issue, and now likely an intent to distribute, other deputies were dispatched to these pharmacies for statements. Security cameras are watched. Statements are taken. DrM lives close to us, and he even came in and visually confirmed our Rx's were faked. By this time it was closing time for the Pharmacy, and C2L hadn't showed, but we were still getting reports from other Pharmacies regarding similar faked Rx's from that evening for her. Fourty-five minutes after we closed, Leo's phone rings.  He grinned at us (have I mentioned he's good looking?), and said ""We got her!""

The next morning, we got a bit more information from Leo: 9 confirmed faked Rx's for controlled substances, 3 were successfully picked up, she was caught at the last store on the other side of town, but only that third Rx on her person.  Success!

The scary part is: *if I hadn't known DrM well enough to know his handwriting and signature, I would never have known it was a fake prescription.*

**TL/DR:** Nice polite lady brings in faked prescriptions for controlled substances, we almost fill it. Cops arrest her a few hours later at another Pharmacy picking up another faked Rx. She forged a total of 9 Rx's, totaling nearly 1100 tablets of various strengths of Oxycodone. Only managed to illegally pick up 3 of them.

1e54fd,1,2013-05-11,My lawyer was a Politician...,[deleted],politics,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1e54fd/my_lawyer_was_a_politician/,"My Lawyer was a Politician…

I was recently arrested and afforded a lawyer by the State; the only problem was that he was a Politician. I had three weeks until my trial and trusted my lawyer to fight my corner. 

By mid-way through the first week I hadn’t heard from him and we hadn’t actually discussed my case or the details of my alibi. We had no meetings, no calls. I finally got through to him on the Thursday and he explained that he’d been busy networking with other lawyers and people from the legal profession – for my sake. I wasn’t entirely sure how him dining with big wigs in the legal profession really helped my case and I was concerned that maybe he was busier politicking for his own career, rather than my life - but I pushed my doubt to the bottom of my gut. After all, he is the lawyer – he must know what he’s doing.  

On the second week I got a txt that read “will run campaign 4 u, LOL, Dave”…I was confused and promptly requested to meet with him, was he mocking me? He explained that he thought LOL stood for ‘Lots of Love’ and at this moment I began to question both his sanity and intelligence – how could one be so oblivious? I asked if we could discuss my case, he placed his right hand on my shoulder and assured me that all would be ok and that he had somewhere to be and left. I began thinking about preparations for a life behind bars.
    
The final week had begun and we still hadn’t spoken about the actual facts of my case. He called me whilst he was walking between a ‘working’ brunch and a ‘working’ lunch. I pressed the matters of the facts of the case and he explained that his assistant and interns were drawing up some briefings for him now and he would read over them from his blackberry. He then began to sing…”no Whyalla  wipe-out there on my TV, no Whyalla wipe-out” – it didn’t make any sense!

The trial came and there I was, sat in the dock with no savior and no sense of redemption. The Judge asked that the defense council rise, my fear froze for a second but my hope continued, I murmured ‘please, surprise me’. 

My lawyer stood…”Members of the jury, my client is innocent…. for the Prosecution is incompetent. This Prosecutor lost his last case, he had that opportunity to put a similar defendant behind bars and failed, so you see – how could my client possibly be guilty?”. I couldn’t believe it – what the hell? Was this some Lawyer thing? Was he a genius or really this bad? I  quickly looked to the Jury to gauge their reaction -  two nodded along vehemently in complete agreement, and one shook her head - she was horrified by his argument. I didn't get it, how did they have such strong opinions based on so little? Most, however, looked confused but played along through fear of looking stupid. They were clearly wondering what it was that they weren’t getting, but in reality, there was nothing to get. You see, the stupid were, in fact, the smart.

  Once my Defense council have finished his opening speech, the Prosecution rose…To my amazement his first words were “No, members of the Jury – the defendant is guilty because  it is in fact the Defense council that is useless!” I sighed with relief, you see, the Prosecution lawyer must also have been a Politician! He continued “the Defense council’s loss to win ratio is 18.2 to 9” – I saw that nobody knew what this meant but the Jury continued to play along in order to look ‘with it’. “Objection!” shouted my defense, “he has abused the statistics, my ratio is 3 to 14!”. Numbers were just being shouted across the Courtroom, nobody knew how these numbers were thought of, nor what they stood for anymore but somehow they always proved, beyond doubt, that whoever was saying them was correct.

This continued back and forth, nobody knew what to believe or what they were talking about. All I knew was that sure as hell wasn’t about me…. In fact, I’m sat in the courtroom right now, they’ve been bickering for over an hour now and the Jury, Judge and I are bored – we’re all on our phones and that’s where I’m writing this from…

TL; DR – If you wouldn’t want your lawyer to act this way, why should we accept it from our Politicians?

I'm going to be moving into the basement apartment of my grandmas house so I don't have to pay rent and can save up some money for the move. I currently live in a town in which the median household income is like $20-24k. The town that I am moving to has a median income of $33k.

I'm basically looking at this as I have six months in which I am going to pour most of my free time into searching and applying for jobs across the country before I have to start repaying my student loans. I'm working a minimum wage ($7.25/hr) job right now in which I get tips (I'm a bellman) that I'm saving up in a literal piggy bank. I make about $300-400 (take home pay) every two weeks and I've gotten $300 in tips from 4 slow weeks of work (hospitality industry obviously picks up during summer months).

What suggestions do you have for someone who is trying to make this move from a small town life into a larger (at least 30k population) town to start my adult journey? Is there some kind of rule for how much I should save up based on where I'm wanting to go? The huge ass cities (NY/LA/Miami/etc) are pretty much out of the question. 

I read that Forbes list of the best places for college grads that suggests Dallas, TX (5.9% unemployment, $900 average apartment, $46.2k average income), Houston, TX (6% unemployment, $800 average apartment, $47.5k average income), and Denver, CO (7.4% unemployment, $970 average apartment, $50k average income).

How much can be placed in these types of lists? With those numbers, what should I try to save up before making the big move? Doing something like this, is it reasonable to sell my car to put towards the savings when I'm ready to move and just invest in a bike or scooter or something? I'm really just looking for any kind of advice. Really desperate to make this move and start making things happen for myself and my family who have always lived in this area I'm in right now.

I broke up with my boyfriend of two years immediately when I started going to a well known ""party"" school. I got into a lot of risky situations and let people take advantage of me. I joined a church group in hopes of making some lasting connections, and as soon as I dated a girl (I'm bi) the pastor made a public announcement that I would be going to hell. Everywhere I turned, the places I put my trust into backfired on me. The end of it was talking to my advisor about internship. I was an art student who was always top 2 or 3 of my class and won various awards. The school itself had purchased some of my work. When I inquired about where I would go after college, my advisor offered up that it may be a managerial position at Walmart, or something of that nature. I was so angry and lost and confused, I packed all my things and took my small amount of savings and got an apartment in Chicago with a friend of a friend. The girl I lived with became one of my best friends, we did everything together. At the end of the summer, I found out that she had ripped me off the whole time on the rent and pocketed a profit for herself, even. I had been living VERY meagerly to support my lifestyle, living on just around $10 a week. I was so hurt to find out that even she had betrayed me. 
     So in short, in a span of about two years, everyone I ever knew, loved, or trusted managed to screw me over somehow. And that brings me to where I am at and the problem I have now. I am in a way better spot now, I am going to a kick ass culinary school and have secured a summer internship at one of the world's greatest restaurants. I have an apartment in the gold coast area of Chicago. I have a fucking iPhone. All these things I never thought I could achieve, I did. Because of my distrust for people however, I spend a lot of my time alone. I over think. I try to hang out with people but when they start to do anything less than awesome, or even are slightly annoying, I distance myself totally. The last two semesters, I have hardly made any friends. I am quite content to sit by myself in my free time and avoid people. I can tell it isn't healthy for me though. I used to be quite social. Now I am introverted and I feel that I have a hard time trying to function in social settings like parties and bars that used to be very fun for me. How can I get myself out of this funk, and become more open minded about people around me? I would love to find a boyfriend or a girlfriend some day, and I know thats a big step away from how I am now, but I want to know that I could trust someone again enough to let them in.

I've had a look at Couchsurfing and Khmer24, couchsurfing looks and sounds really good from people I've met but may not be the most comfortable for trying to get some work done on occasion, and Khmer24 was promising but may give me a more 'authentic' experience or put me at a distance from other travellers.

From what I've heard from one forum, a minor in stats is not very useful because it doesn't cover enough material to be of much use and that one should major in math or CS and then get a master's degree in statistics, since so little companies hire people with just a bachelor's in statistics.

1e67ai,7,2013-05-12,Just venting.,Tua26982,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1e67ai/just_venting/,"Throwaway account. Just need to get this off my chest and unsure who to talk to. 

I got a chance to catch up with my dad today. I haven't really seen him much after my teen years and I never really cared about that, to be honest. I was already old enough that I relied on my friends more than a father figure. Sure, I had to google how to shave after accidentally nipping myself like an asshole so many times and do other things I assumed would have been taught by a father but I never thought of it. 

Today, he came and visited me at my grad school. He lives in another country and was visiting our hometown which is almost 1000k miles away from where I currently am. He attempted previously to meet me and I agreed in a heart beat. Twice, he bought tickets to come down to see me, but usually after i thought about it, I would withdraw my agreement. I'm in the midst of finals and I need to start my internship which is another 1000 Miles drive from where I'm currently located (2k from my hometown) as soon as my last exam is done. I don't even know what compelled me to agree with him when he asked to visit me. 

Nevertheless, today, he came down to see me by taking a flight down here and then taking a 2 hour bus ride to see me. The original plan was for us to just hang out for 45m during my lunch break from studying. Honestly, I didn't really care for seeing him so if he wanted to see me so bad, fine, whatever. I'll take a quick break from studying. 

But, he missed the bus and ended up just taking a cab up here, instead. I'm irritated by that point because I kind of feel bad. He's going through all this trouble for what I assumed was going to be an attempt to bond after only being in contact with me intermittently in the past 12 years. I'm a grown ass man in my mid-20s, I really don't need to have those father-son moment. I'm too old and too jaded to give a shit. I have more important things  right now to consider- my exams and work. 

But then he came up and for some reason, my mind went from ""I don't give a fuck, just don't take up too much time"" to ""OMG! My Dad's visiting me!! OH SHIT!"" Like, internally, I felt like how I felt when I was a kid trying to show my dad my new bike tricks. Instead of just grabbing coffee like I planned, I ended up dragging him into my car because I wanted to show him that I learned to drive stick recently (to which he commented "" I see you're still not good at it, but fuck it, dude can't even drive stick!). Then, I aimlessly drove around my campus and started pointing out landmarks to him (Yeah, that's my biking trail! And that building there? Yeah, I lived there last semester! Oh! Let me show you our football stadium!). 

Even after parking, I deliberately took the long way through campus to get to my favorite restaurant because I wanted to show him where my classes were. I even fucking pointed to the windows in the library that I look out of when I'm taking my study breaks (I don't even know why I pointed at that). While at the restaurant, the waitress that always serves me was there and I was tempted to introduce him to her just because I wanted to say ""this is my dad! he came to visit me!"".
Even after we finished eating and I took him to his bus stop, I insisted on waiting with him. Hell, I even sat there and showed him the stuff I was studying because I was trying to show him that I grew up from the high school kid that failed 9th grade and was repeatedly suspended from school. He was actually interested in what I was studying and was impressed by the subject matter. I'm extremely embarrassed to admit it but I felt really proud right then. 

Like, he left 10 hours ago and is probably on the plane now to go back to his home. And, I'm actually really sad that he left. I haven't felt the urge to cry in over... well, 12 years now. Nothing ever makes me sad. I'm usually very stoic when it comes to my feelings. Nothing makes me happy, nothing makes me sad. Just... neutral. But as soon as I came home, I just felt nauseous and slightly light-headed. I thought I ate something bad but then it occurred to me that I was just, well, sad. I've always hated feeling emotional because it's inconvenient. 

But here I am. It's 2AM I haven't gotten any studying done for my exam on Monday nor did I pack to leave later that night. And here I am, I'm just really sad. He gave me a hug before he left today and I didn't hug him back since.. well, I never hugged my dad before and it felt weird. But I kind of wish I did. To make up for it, I decided to accept an internship with a company in his home country that was extended to me recently as that would lead to getting a full time offer there after I complete school.   

Just.. had to get that off my chest. Thanks!

I'm 21 and male attending college, she's 19 and female, living at home and working. There's more details to the breakup in my previous posts in r/LDR, which I'll list at the bottom.

I broke things off about mid-March, I'd realized I wasn't too happy with the relationship. I felt like we were on very different levels when it came to our ambitions and motivations. It wasn't an easy choice, I still love her very much and probably will for a very long time, but it was a necessary decision. I found our recently that she's already moved on to another relationship, which I won't lie, stung slightly. It's only now I've worked up the nerve to start deleting photos, videos, and the other various post-breakup chores that come up. 

The problem I've seen arising now is that I don't know how to process all this and which step to take first... I've thought about trying to date other people, even just casually, but I can't seem to work up the nerve to even speak to a woman with anything more than a professionally polite tone. School's over for now, I'm going on an internship in June and it lasts 6 months, so I'll be home for quite awhile. I feel like a lot of old confidence issues I've had are resurfacing; self-doubt, poor self image (physically and emotionally), my sleeping pattern is screwed up... I feel like a mess again. 

I apologize if I sound like I'm whining, I'm just not sure how to handle this. Any advice you can offer would be a great help, and thanks for reading.

Since it's a PR internship, I have the impression that most of the women in the office will be dressed well, and I need to dress to impress! So far, my business casual wardrobe consists of approximately two blazers, a pencil skirt, and a dress. Would like to expand upon that.

My stats: 5'0, 112-115 pounds. Don't know my measurements, but I'm pretty sure I'm a rectangle/apple shape? Bra size is 32B. Not that curvy, which has given me problems with finding business casual in the past. I find it really hard to fill out dresses with my small bust, and my narrowish hips/small butt make finding tailored pants and skirts difficult as well. Petite sizes seem too big, but the juniors department often has ill-fitting pieces.

Here's a picture of me for reference: http://imgur.com/aGLSQZa

1e9ulb,15,2013-05-13,I believe Strong AI will lead to an Intelligence Explosion that changes our entire civilization. CMV.,DanyalEscaped,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e9ulb/i_believe_strong_ai_will_lead_to_an_intelligence/,"Computers are already 'better' than us in many aspects. Wikipedia can store more knowledge than your brain. Computers can calculate way quicker than you do. Google Maps can find the quickest route way faster than you do. 

But we, humans, certainly have our strengths. We are amazing in pattern recognition, for example. But if we can 'give' those 'last human-only skills' to computers, they will quickly become much more 'intelligent' than normal human brains. 

&gt;How could an AI surpass human abilities? Let us count the ways...

&gt;* Speed. Our axons carry signals at seventy-five meters per second or slower. A machine can pass signals along about four million times more quickly.


&gt;* Computational resources. The brain’s size and neuron count are constrained by skull size, metabolism, and other factors. AIs could be built on the scale of buildings or cities or larger. When we can make circuits no smaller, we can just add more of them.

&gt;* Introspective access/editability. We humans have almost no introspective access to our cognitive algorithms, and cannot easily edit and improve them. Machines can already do this (see EURISKO and metaheuristics). A limited hack like the method of loci greatly improves human memory; machines can do this kind of thing in spades.

&gt;* Serial depth. The human brain can’t rapidly perform any computation that requires more than one hundred sequential steps; thus, it relies on massively parallel computation.2 More is possible when both parallel and deep serial computations can be performed.

&gt;Consider how far machines have surpassed our abilities at arithmetic, or how far they will surpass our abilities at chess or driving in another twenty years. There is no reason in principle why machines could not surpass our abilities at technology design or general reasoning by a similar margin. The human level is a minor pit stop on the way to the highest level of intelligence allowed by physics, and [there is plenty of room above us.](http://intelligenceexplosion.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/scale_of_intelligence.png)

&gt;http://intelligenceexplosion.com/2011/plenty-of-room-above-us/

We humans have to study and train for years before we can enter a profession. At this moment, we cannot 'copy' the training a surgeon has received from his brain and paste it in the brain of another human. We still have to use lectures and books and internships, but these are completely inefficient compared to 'copy-paste'. 

In the past, monks had to manually write new Bibles, making Bibles very expensive and rare, just like all other books. Nowadays, we can copy-paste the Bible within a second. They are now available for free on the internet. This is some kind of 'information explosion', and I think the same will happen to intelligence. When we 'decode' intelligence by simulating one brain, we can easily copy it to other (super)computers. It will be able to combine the best traits of computers and humans and it can spread rapidly.

I'm doing some intern work at a company and they've asked me to play around with a database with some data on the companies supply, stock, orders and customers. The database basically has 10 fields on it in 3 different tables:

tblCUSTOMER

Customer D.O.B - Customer Address - Customer Forename - Customer Lastname - Branch

tblOrder

Order ID - Order Desc - Number Ordered

tblProduct

Product ID - Product Desc

However, for the particular function specification I'm working to, the customer table calls for an additional field, Customer ID. The company is very specific on this customer ID it's got to be generated as follows, first letter is the first letter of the customer first name, 2nd letter is the 1st letter of the customers forename, then a string of numbers after this starting at 0000
So, a customer ID will be generated for each new customer added. For example if there was a customer named ""Tom Cruise"" and he was the 2541'st customer, his Customer ID would look as follows: TC2541. However, I'm having trouble generating this customer ID.
I've exhausted all knowledge of Access and I'm really having a hard time with this particular part of the database. I really would appreciate anyone's help with it. If you need more information about the database please just ask."

She was a bitch but I was blinded by the false sense of love I felt for and received from her. After we broke up, I was heartbroken but eventually I realized that despite having treated her like a princess I wasn't treated well in return. This helped me move on from her but I was constantly in search of that feeling of love I felt for another. 

On top of all that, I am in my junior year of college and in an athletic training program. Early morning classes that are followed by leaving my campus and travel to other colleges to work in their athletic training rooms. Basically, I have almost no time to go out to put myself out there to meet new people because I feel tired as hell whenever I get back from my internship. 

Now let me give you a little background on what's going on now... I am really close to my cousin (He's not the one I'm in love with, don't worry) (Let’s call him Dan). Dan and I are really the best of friends and have been since we were little. Family holidays consisted of us just having a good time. Fast forward a few years and we both attend and live at the same college. Things have never been better. We ate together, we went on stupid adventures, and we played video games all night. Family holidays consisted of us just having a good time. To top it off, when I joined a fraternity, Dan was the first in line to join the following semester. 

Last semester: Dan had been dating this sorority girl (9/10) (Let’s call her Sara) for about a year and broke up with her because he didn't feel like they were meant to be. They go their separate ways and still are friendly with each other, but I remain close to her and visit her at work frequently. About 2 months later, he starts dating another girl in that same sorority. Things had a rocky beginning but have been going strong ever since. 

This semester: I was just coming off of another failed short term relationship and was feeling pretty down about it. The girl was nice but I didn't see the relationship going anywhere. About 2 month into the semester, I visited my Sara at work. We start talking about how much relationships have been going poorly for both of us and I try to make a joke by saying, ""You could've had this"" while pointing at myself. Cheesy, yes, I know. To my shock Sara replied with ""What says I can't?"" My jaw drops and was speechless, but somehow I get the words out to make plans with her to hang out that Friday night. Friday night comes we watch a movie and it leads to making out for a bit. At one point she grabs my dick over my pants and stops everything going on. She pretty much tells me she wanted sex but not that night. The very next night, she comes over and I had hands down the best sex I have ever had in my life. This happens for the next two weeks and I enjoy every minute of it. But as awesome as it was, I felt terrible because this was my cousin’s ex girlfriend. Spring break comes up and I hang out with her, take her on a simple date, and watch a movie back at my home. The date goes fantastically. Being spring break, I decided that this was a time to tell Dan that I have been seeing his Sara. He says he didn’t feel comfortable with it asks for it to end. I complied with him and had all intensions of ending it but I just couldn’t do it and since that point we haven’t seen each other as much and we aren’t as close as we used to be. 

Sara and I continued to see each other and spend the night in each other’s rooms. We would talk about everything and nothing all at the same time. I treated her the best I could and she reciprocated by treating me the best she could. Then Sara had dropped it on me that she has started to like me. At first I wasn’t ok with it but then I realized I had grown to actually like her. As much as I really enjoyed it, I knew I couldn’t continue doing this. Recently, I actually got the balls to put things on hold with her. It felt like I was breaking up with her and it hurt so bad and she was tearing up when I left her. I told her I’d always just be a text message away. The next couple days I felt like dirt and I genuinely missed her. Somehow we end up hanging out again in my room and I enjoyed every second I spent with her. 

To sum it all up, I really do think I am in love Sara, but I really don’t know what to do about it. Do I keep it inside and just eventually find someone else or go for it and ask her to be my girlfriend?"

I don't have a problem with women in terms of sleeping with them. That's an issue that I solved a long time ago.

When I was 18, I met this girl and she never agreed to be my girlfriend (I don't blame her now, I fully understand why she didn't want to date me. I was a boy..mentally)

We were very good friends before we started sleeping  but fought a lot when we started sleeping together..mostly because of me. As much as I hate to admit it now, it was because of me. I was a clingy guy desperate to get her to commit to me.

I never could...it took me about 1.5 years to stop thinking about her on a daily basis (it was a rough time for me) but I eventually stopped...during the entire process, I made an effort to meet girls...I forgive the first 2-3 for sleeping with them while thinking about another girl.


Time has passed, I am older and I have seen and talked to her. I have no anger or feelings towards her anymore. It's just some girl that I used to know. Which I am very happy about. Believe me. Very happy.

It's very hard to try to live a normal life while you think of someone else that has left you.


I can't seem to date girls normally, I have this constant fear that I'll go back to feeling like that...I have certainly learned to deal with emotional stuff better and it won't take me a year and a half...but I don't want feel like someone has so much power to hurt me that way again.

 I have an issue dating girls, I can't let them get close to me at all. I am scared that they'll hurt my feelings or emotionally abuse me.


I have trust issues with girls and as soon as a girl shows/does anything similar to what this girl ever did to me that I didn't like...I just lose interest. Even if it's nothing bad.

**tl;dr** I don't trust girls at all and I have become a border line nazi when it comes to the girls that I am seeing...one little thing and I get scared and just ""fuck it"" everything and emotionally detach myself from her..really fast.

I got through 11 days before finding that all the time at my desk preparing for final exams and wanting to think about anything other than final exams just led me back to PMO.  Now I plan on using the summer to develop momentum for those routines that will take me into the next school year.  Besides the 90 day challenge, I'm starting small:

**1. [The Lifehacker workout.](http://lifehacker.com/tag/the-lifehacker-workout)**  Three days a week of full body exercise.  Two days are 20 minutes of some form of running and 10-20 minutes of simple strength exercises that don't require any equipment.  One day is a deck of cards routine that is a fun randomizer.

The 20 minute running periods have a goal to run farther than I had the previous 20 minutes.  My previous attempts to get into a running routine have failed because I pushed myself too hard with various couch to 5k or run everyday sort of things.  I'm starting easy, run for a minute, walk for 90 seconds, repeat until 20 minutes is expired.  As the summer goes on I'll be increasing the continuing running periods, until I'm eventually at a single 20-minute run period.  This sets me up for success, as right now it is an aerobic workout for me to run just those 8 minutes out of 20, but as I increase my amount of running time, I'll be increasing my distance as well.

The 10 minutes of simple strength exercises are just sets of 5 push-ups, 10 crunches, and 15 body-weight squats.  The goal is to do as many as you can in 10 minutes.  Proper push-ups are hard, I could only do two sets before I got dizzy and had to stop.  But it's okay, because I feel like it worked, and I feel like I can only go up from here.  As the weeks go on, I'll increase the number of minutes.

The deck of cards routine is a different set of four exercises.  Hearts are jumping jacks or jump rope (think heart for aerobic exercise that works your heart), and the other suits are chair dips, knee-to-elbow planks, and lunges.  You can start with however many cards you like, the goal being to work your way up to a full deck.  I'm starting from a quarter deck.

At the end of it, I have a planned break which I'll use to evaluate whether I want to continue with that workout, maybe throw in an extra day of targeted workouts that the Lifehacker workout offers as an optional workout, or maybe I'll even be in the mood for something more extreme like P90X.  Planning a break also gives me an end goal.  I'm not exercising forever, I'm exercising 36 times over the next 12 weeks.  I also created an appropriate chain at chains.cc.

**2. Rise with the morning sun.**  My sleep habits turned to total shit during the school year, and only got worse during final exams.  I want to evaluate my sleep, so I downloaded a 99 cent sleep tracking app, [Sleep Cycle](http://www.sleepcycle.com/), that monitors my movements in bed to determine the quality of my sleep.  The app also monitors when I'm in my lightest sleep as the moment to determine whether to sound an alarm clock within a 30 minute window, on the theory that the lighter your sleep when woken, the more pleasant it is to wake up for the day.

I'm also getting to sleep earlier, because my window shades are not blackout shades, and my best rest will come in the darkness.  Rising with the Sun also helps me accomplish my exercise goals, since I know I'll beg off if I wait for after my summer internship work, or there will be varying after-work socializing that will go on.

**3. Shower &amp; shave EVERY DAY**  I set up another chain at chains.cc, because I realized that part of what would make me feel unproductive is that I wouldn't want to do anything until I showered and shaved, but then I wouldn't want to shower and shave until I had something to eat, and round-and-round I would go until half of Saturday or Sunday is gone.  I've had to turn down too many last minute social opportunities for want of a shower and a shave, and truth be told, a fap instead.  I tried cold showers during my first attempt, and while refreshing, the prospect of them was so daunting that I would revert to not showering at all.  Again, simple goals."

I have a degree in TV Production, but have been out of it for awhile as I could only get freelance work for a long time, then that slowed down and had to work in other fields. I have been a personal trainer, have worked in retail, dabbled in marketing with retail. Ultimately, I would love to do something media related, whether it be TV, radio, writing, but at this point, I'm getting pretty desperate and am not having a ton of luck finding any work. 

Most internships out there are shady or you have to be in college, which I am not. I am mostly looking for part-time right now because I am considering going back to school upgrade my skills/knowledge since things keep changing, but, if there is a good enough FT, I'd be interested as well. 

Here is what I have in the qualifications part on my resume: **Tech savvy, Mac experience, along with television production skills, with experience in pre-production, writing, production, script continuity/ supervision, and Final Cut Pro. Adobe Creative Suite, Final Cut Pro, Photoshop, Microsoft Office Suite, experience with blogging and other social media advertising and writing.**

If someone can help me find any work that you believe I am qualified for based off of my list/what I am looking for, please let me know! I'm also located in the East Bay, (Walnut Creek area) but am willing to commute if I have to, as long as it is reasonable and my commute doesn't end up costing me more than I'd make at the job! Working remotely is also fine with me, if there is a job out there that calls for it. "

1ec80c,139,2013-05-14,Flaws of Dark Souls,DarQraven,truegaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/1ec80c/flaws_of_dark_souls/,"Now, to get some things out of the way immediately: 

- Yes, it's hard, it's unforgiving and I love it. It's currently my most played game after SC2.
- Yes, I am a relative newbie to the game. I've only finished the game once and haven't gotten very far yet with an NG+ playthrough. In most singleplayer games that would qualify you as at least somewhat knowledgeable, but I realize DS is a bit of a different beast in that regard.
- I realize this game is/has been reddit's wet dream concerning skill-based game design in the recent past. I also realize I risk pissing off a large contingent of avid fans. However, I notice a serious lack of discussion about the game that doesn't justify any and all flaws as ""it's just hardcore like that. L2P.""

What I want to do in this thread is have that discussion: take an objective look at the game's pros and cons and try to be honest about what is unforgiving game design and what is sloppy and/or broken. In order to further the state of the gaming industry, it would be helpful to pinpoint exactly what can be learned from DS.

---

To start things off myself:

**Invasions**:

For a PvE player like myself, they're just stupid. You're merrily on your way, fighting some new kind of monster, barely hanging on and xXxR4ng3rKn1ght420xXx steps up and backstabs you, and you are now potentially out of X humanity and (in my most recent case) ~40.000 souls. Focus on the invader and the regular monsters will kill you. As any PvP player will tell you, the soul level limit does very little to keep fights balanced when players can make dedicated PvP characters and transfer high-level gear to them.

Of course, you can only get invaded when you are in human form. Same with summoning allies or NPCs. Risk vs reward type design, it makes sense, and this is usually how players justify this design. 
I would agree if it were not for this one thing: *You can't avoid being human quite regularly.* There is no way to kindle bonfires without that. 
When do you kindle bonfires? *When you've just arrived in an area and are having a hard time, almost by definition.*

The design choice to link activating/upgrading a save point and opening yourself up to PvP is a nonsensical one, IMO. It makes you vulnerable to other players with the sole intention of killing you at exactly the time when you are weakest. Gameplay-wise, the two have nothing to do with eachother. The only way to avoid it is go through the game with only 5 Estus flasks. For a game that prides itself on being skillbased, brutal and honest, being randomly assassinated by overleveled players is a bad fit.

**Weapon hits/collisions**:

Why is it that my uchi gets stuck on a wall when I slash more or less parallel to it, yet that Titanite Demon over there swings a huge axe through two solid walls and hits me? Don't get me wrong, it's not a huge issue or anything, but there are instances in the game where a fight is uncharacteristically hard because you are hindered by your surroundings while your opponents are not. This is pretty much the sole reason I stopped using greatswords - it is simply too common to get into areas where you can't even swing them properly. Getting hit by a dagger through a massive column is not good game design no matter how you spin it, and it seems more like an oversight or laziness on the developer's part than anything that can be justified as a conscious design choice.

There are other instances where the weapon hit detection is a bit dodgy. Getting hit by the slow-moving blunt rear-end of a spear, for example, and taking full stab damage. Or enemies adjusting their flight path or facing in mid-air to compensate for your movement.

If this were the first game in the series I would be understanding of these errors. However, it isn't. I never played Demon's Souls, but I'm assuming it was the same in that game? If this is a conscious decision, what could possibly justify it? I am at a loss.

**Blighttown**

This area isn't actually all that difficult combat wise. It's just bloody annoying. The level design has you walking across all kinds of rickety structures, often with strange geometry sticking out or holes in the surfaces. I think the moving bridge takes the cake: standing still at certain spots while it's moving will slide you off the side due to weird bounding boxes. Now, when you put enemies in an area like this that are capable of bumping you into a chasm even if you block their attack, you're just messing with players. You're more or less forcing a bunch of random deaths caused by unpredictable/unavoidable knockbacks (depending on player build and loadout. For a shield+sword player, or heavy armor player this is hell. Dodge-based characters will have a hard time as well, but at least it's in their own hands whether they dodge off a bridge or not.)

Then there's the fact that you *will* get poisoned going through the swamp no matter how high your poison resistance is and there is no merchant in the area. In order to get through Quelaag, I had to get back out of the Swamp, back up to Undead Burg, buy a ton of moss clumps and get back in. Complete time sink for very little (if any) gain in gameplay quality.
Also, toxic blowdarts with laser guidance.

So, what are your thoughts? Feel free to attack any of my points above as long as your main argument is not ""learn to play"". If I was just bothered by the game being difficult I would not be going through a second playthrough now.

**TL;DR: If you had to explain some of Dark Soul's oddities and were forbidden to use ""it's unforgiving"" as an argument, what would you say? What are some of the weakest points of the game, overlooked or not?**

---




*Edit, Two more additions. Thanks for the discussion so far!*

**The design of the primordial serpents**
I realize this one is a bit more of a subjective thing, but what the hell. Serpents with human teeth? A skull that more or less protrudes out the side of their body? I'm not sure if the intention was to make these look goofy as fuck, but that's what they managed. For a game with otherwise amazing art direction, I'm not sure which intern got tasked with designing these.

**Unreliable triggers**
In a game where experimentation and trial-and-error is encouraged so much, I feel special attention should be given to the scripting of game events and sequences. Currently, there are quite a few opportunities for players to irreversibly screw themselves by missing, glitching or otherwise triggering an event ""wrong"". 
Examples: 

- Fall down Frampt's pit before talking to him and place the Lordvessel? Both Frampt and Kaathe will now assume you picked the other one, and neither will be accessible for the rest of the game (even though the player is probably not even aware of Kaathe at this point in the game).
- Siegmeyer can get glitched and not show up in Anor Londo, even if you saved him in Sen's. You are required to go back to Sen's, redirect the boulder machine, then talk to Siegmeyer again and he will possibly be fixed. I've heard mixed reports about whether this actually works. Already beat O&amp;S? Byebye Siegmeyer storyline.
- Being able to kill Gwynevere in Anor Londo without triggering the results, simply by using a ranged weapon outside of her room. (Not sure if this one still works, but it used to.)

**Controls oddities**
You almost never use a ranged weapon when you are in lock-on range. So, you're mostly going to be using the zoomed-in mode. Why, then, do you need to explicitly exit this zoom mode before you can swap your weapon to a different one? Dodge doesn't work, running doesn't work, estus doesn't work, nothing works. Only LB1 and RB1. See an enemy coming up to attack and want to get your shield out and block? LB1, d-pad away from bow, LB1. A bit weird.

Same thing for the in-game menu. It's not particularly handy to block off your estus, run and roll buttons as long as you have the UI open. I like how it doesn't pause the game, but then you should also execute the concept fully and be able to completely control your character with the menu open. This half-way approach isn't very good."
1ec7vp,5,2013-05-14,I haven't come clean about the last ten years of my life to ANYONE.,ireviewfanfiction,confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1ec7vp/i_havent_come_clean_about_the_last_ten_years_of/,"Hoo boy. Buckle up, because this is a LONG story. (ALSO ALL NAMES HAVE BEEN CHANGED)

I recognize that this may not be important/interesting to anyone, and I don't want to lead you down the wrong path and make you think this story is about truly horrible things (SPOILER: I didn't get into drugs, I haven't been sexually abused, I haven't intentionally or seriously hurt or sexually abused anyone else, etc. and so forth). But because of how long this story is, and because of how much of it I haven't explained, in context, to anyone (not even my wife), I feel as though putting this out there will be healing in some way.

It started right around ten years ago, when I was a junior in high school. I was a stereotypical nerd. I had thick glasses, wore clothes that didn't fit me, had a crush on a popular girl who didn't reciprocate (though we did become platonic friends), and had friends who really were only friends to use me as the butt of their jokes. By the beginning of my junior year, I had cut off all contact with pretty much everyone and spent most of my time on Ye Olde Internet, writing a lot, and making online friends in various writing communities.

Then, I met Stephanie. Stephanie was nice, pretty, had big boobs (important to a 17-year-old boy!), and liked me. She was dating someone at the time, but soon broke it off with him as we became better friends. Stephanie, her friend Mikki, my friend Harry, and I all hung out for the majority of my senior year. Stephanie and I were wary about dating because I'd be heading to college a year ahead of her, and I planned to do so about 8 hours out of state. But before that summer, we decided to give it a go.

When I first met Stephanie, her and Mikki gave me what I can only describe as a makeover. Gone were the ill-fitting clothes and in were more fashionable, trendy clothes. The glasses were replaced by contacts. The haircut was now stylish instead of ridiculous. It was like a gender-reversal She's All That. It was cool, though, because for the first time in my life I felt like someone physically desirable. 

That senior year featured more flirting than I had ever experienced before in my life. And all that writing I had been doing had adjusted my brain so I actually understood how to talk to people (and flirt back!). Still, the flirting was a little awkward, mostly because these girls knew me as that kid who didn't talk to anyone just a year ago and I felt a bit like I was putting on an act trying to be a suave guy.

Still, for someone who had been ignored for so long, the attention went to my head. My flirting going over the line to Stephanie's annoyance (and eventual hurt) would become a theme in our relationship. Tori would be the first in this regard.

Stephanie, Tori and I met because we all worked at a restaurant the summer before my freshman year at college. Tori, it must be said, was EASY. She had slept with a bunch of people, cycled through boyfriends and boytoys at an alarming rate, and fooled around with more. She wasn't stunningly attractive, just thin and not ugly and promiscuous, which to most guys is close enough. And she liked me right away and wanted to sleep with me.

And so I did. Before going to pick up Stephanie from work one evening, Tori decided she wanted to de-virginize me (Stephanie and I hadn't gone all the way yet). I let her.

NSFW BIT HERE: Stephanie and I had fooled around a bit, oral sex and hand stuff, etc. I had also sometimes ""slipped it in"", though it never went further than that. What I discovered through that, though, is that Stephanie was TIGHT. Like, ""It is realllly difficult to get more than one finger in her"" tight. Tori was THE EXACT OPPOSITE. I put on a condom, and honestly got NOWHERE even 20 minutes in.

Short, SFW version: My first time resulted in me not finishing.

Afterward, I felt stupid and sleazy and dumb. I ended my friendship with Tori and eventually Stephanie and I stated sleeping together. It was really good. And because our relationship was growing in such a way, we decided to try to make it work long-distance while I was at college.

PEOPLE OF REDDIT: THIS IS ALWAYS A DUMB DECISION. Long-distance relationships are well-meaning and emotionally fulfilling, but they are unnecessarily painful, wildly difficult to navigate, and more trouble than they're worth. Also you don't get to have sex as often as you'd like, which sounds shallow, sure, but sex is important even if we don't want to admit it! And the problem is less that you can't have it, but that you can't have the intimacy that sex provides with your partner when you're going through a rough, disconnected time. All our sex felt perfunctory while I was away at college, like it was something we had to do on the weekends she was around, not like it was a healthy part of our relationship.

That first year I was at college doomed our relationship, but we wouldn't know it for YEARS.

I didn't sleep with anyone else, I want to make that clear. But like I said, I had been a nerd for years. The opposite sex didn't look at me ""like that."" But suddenly I was at college and I could play guitar (as much as I didn't want to be THAT GUY I was admittedly sometimes THAT GUY) and I could make girls laugh and I wasn't a douchebag. My first week I made out with four girls. Throughout the rest of the year, I probably made out with at least one more a month. I hit on a lot more than that.

What I realize, looking back, is how blatantly my actions (even now) have been influenced by the DESPERATE need for attention from the opposite sex. I went 16 years being completely ignored as a sexual entity, and once I got it I became kind of addicted to it. I'm less a sex addict and more addicted to the idea of being the object of someone's infatuations. This, more than the idea that I didn't want to cheat, led to me not sleeping with the girls I made out with.

This desire also led to a weird thing: I created a blog under an alias and posted a lot of BS pseudo-intellectual/pseudo-poetic shit with the EXPRESS PURPOSE of pulling a Catfish on some girl(s). This is HORRIBLE BEHAVIOR and I am ASHAMED. But, what weirdly came out of it, was a really and GENUINELY close connection with a girl that went from posting on each other's ""walls"" to IMing to calling almost daily. I was conducting an emotional affair with this girl.

Stephanie snuck into my e-mail one day and found out.

Stephanie had trust issues, and me being so far away and going out to parties and blah blah blah, only amplified them. So she snuck into my e-mail to see what was going on and found my collaborations with this girl. To be clear, I hadn't said anything incriminating (There were no OH I LUV U BUT messages, just personal stuff exchanged), but I was hiding my relationship with a person from Stephanie and she reacted. Of course she did.

This established a pattern for the next two years. I would crush on someone else, create a friendship with them, fortify that friendship with discrete messages and flirting that could be construed as harmless but probably wasn't, Stephanie would find out, we would have an argument, I would apologize and we would be fine. It wasn't even just women I had (and still have) a habit of telling white lies to avoid conversations (example: If Stephanie would ask if I had washed the dishes, I would say I had even if I hadn't and then just make sure to do them before she got home). Sometimes I would get caught in these, and the argument/make-up cycle would begin again.

That makes our relationship sound terrible; it wasn't. We got along very well, we had similar senses of humor, aside from a few months her freshman year (she ended up coming to the same college as me), she wasn't super controlling or unreasonable, we had good sex, we helped each other through rough times. When we moved in together in early 2007, we had settled into a good pattern and I really put a curb to my flirtations.

Then I got a crush on her younger sister.

Seventeen at the time, Sarah was model-beautiful (I mean that literally, she was randomly approached to model on a consistent basis), had an amazing body, was quick as a whip and clever as a fox (two things Stephanie wasn't), and was more interested in the things I too was interested in.

Obviously, this crush was stupid and could not be acted upon, so I didn't. But the crush didn't go away. For two years, I harbored this secret and didn't tell anyone. However, attractions like that manifest themselves and Stephanie kind of sort of knew that I found her sister attractive. As someone who didn't have the greatest self-esteem, Stephanie was jealous of her younger sister, but only in an idle way as they were great friends.

Finally, I decided I had to tell Sarah. She was 19 and I was 23 at the time. It was an uncomfortable, but not hostile situation and getting it off my chest helped me to get over the feeling rather quickly.

A few months later, I moved from my college town to a big city, having received an internship at my dream job. While I was down there, Stephanie and I spoke every day, but the distance was again problematic (DON'T DO LTRS, REDDIT. IF THERE IS ANY LESSON IN ALL OF THIS, IT IS DON'T DO LTRS). She was still in school, and would be for a year, and because of that Stephanie and I decided to take a break.

It wasn't a REAL break, though. It was more ""I still love you and I want just you but I don't know I'm confused"" from Stephanie and ""I love you too, and I don't understand this but I don't want you to be miserable pining after me in this situation"" from me. And, yes, I'll admit I was excited by the idea of being single in a big city, even if just for a short while.

I didn't sleep with anyone else, but I made out with a few people and tried to score dates and not get evicted and work my dream job (they offered me a position shortly after my internship) for very little money and just in general figure things out. After a couple months, Stephanie decided that she didn't want to be on a break anymore and a month later I was fired during some downsizing and had to move out of the big city and back in with Stephanie.

A month after that, Stephanie snuck into my e-mail and found out I had had a crush on her sister.

This was devastating to her, and really was a culmination of every problem in our relationship: Her trust issues and my issues with white lies and flirtation being the most obvious. We had a long argument and discussion where we almost broke up and then didn't.

And then, everything was great. I thought, genuinely, that we were over the hump and it would be smooth sailing to careers, marriage, and kids at that point. We'd been together six years. It seemed like the logical progression. You could read into why I didn't ask her as being indicative of doubts in the relationship or whatever, but it was honestly not that. I expected that we'd get married, I just wanted to propose ""right"" with a nice ring and a unique method. I also wanted to get settled, so that the wedding would be the only thing we had to worry about. I went about all of this very practically.

We moved after she graduated and got a job in a different city. I found a ""career"" type job. One of the first people I met was Jake, a friend of Stephanie's from her new job. We went over to his house to watch the first NFL game of the season and hung out with Jake's wife and their two kids. Soon, we found a venue for getting married and we even decided, in our heads, what the date would be. We started looking at rings.

Then, kind of apropos nothing that I could tell, we started getting into fights, and Stephanie started asking questions about the reasons we were together. She started freaking out about being only with me and started talking about taking a break. I was confused, but in my mind this was the same kind of ""break"" she wanted when I was in Chicago: some time to get her head back on straight and then we'd move on.

She kept talking about it, and I went out of town to hang out with some college friends on my birthday-- Stephanie had to work. I ran into one of Stephanie's good friends from school, and a couple of her acquaintances with whom I had become friendly but she wasn't exactly friends with. I told them what was going on, mostly because I wanted pity from pretty women.

The next week, Stephanie found out. She insisted, to my confusion but supplication, that I move out. I did so, bitter about us having this argument about something so stupid, unsure with how to proceed, just sort of aimless. My work performance suffered, and I was pretty depressed. But, and I actually enjoyed this part of things, I was suddenly freed up to connect with friends of mine that I hadn't spoken to in years. Specifically, female friends with whom I had only a platonic relationship, but Stephanie was still jealous of and didn't want me hanging out with. I took these opportunities with the thought that, once back together, I would be able to re-negotiate the terms of our relationship in my favor.

But that didn't happen. We talked once in a rare while to deal with ""business"" type things: ""This is mine, I'm going to pick it up,"" ""We need to get the cable bill out of my name."" These would all end up with her crying and me waiting for her to ask for me back, her not doing it, and me being confused and too proud to do it myself.

After a few months of this, she called me over and told me that she had broken up with me to begin an affair with Jake. They had been planning it for a month before I had been kicked out and started immediately getting together. She told me because she was ending it with him and maybe wanted to get back together.

I helped her feel better (Why? I don't know. I don't like to be mean, I guess?) and told her I'd think about it and get back to her tomorrow. I talked with friends and told her we couldn't until she got the situation with Jack-- who she was still working with-- resolved. She agreed. I didn't hear back from her for a month.

When she called again she told me that she had gotten back with Jake again, but this time she was really ending it. I told her okay. We hung out maybe once because I was lonely and hadn't met anyone and wanted to feel attached to someone again. I think through all of this I was more hurt by the idea that ANYONE didn't love me most more than the idea that STEPHANIE didn't love me most, but when you're that depressed you can't make those distinctions.

A month later, her brother died. This was really messed up and difficult, of course, and I said I'd be there for the funeral, as I had gone to school with her brother and been semi-friends with him. What I didn't expect was for Jake to be there, too. But he was, and I was livid, but held it together. As much as I wanted to, I couldn't make a scene.

A week later, Stephanie called me, saying that THIS TIME FOR REAL she had broken it off with Jake. They weren't getting back together. I told her how upset I was, how messed up it was of her to do that when she knew I'd be there given our ongoing situation, how stupid she was for cheating on me. She insisted she hadn't cheated. I told her that not breaking up with someone, telling them you still want to be with them, and still sleeping with someone else was the definition of cheating. She cried, I hung up. I then proceeded to go out and sleep with someone else for the first time.

As much as all my interactions with Stephanie were difficult and heart-throbbing and upsetting, when I was able to get away from the situation, I was still me. I was still flirtatious (more so, being single) and still loved to get attention from girls. This wasn't affecting every aspect of my life because I keep things so compartmentalized. This compartmentalization is also why I've never told this story FULLY to anyone. So I went out and I slept with someone, and then I went and slept with another person. 

NSFW ASIDE: Both girls were one-night stands and with both girls I had trouble finishing. Like I said, Stephanie was ridiculously tight so having sex with other girls, while enjoyable, was not the same struggle to last more than ten minutes that having sex with Stephanie was. The first one-night stand and I have sex for about two hours (not all at once, but yeah), and with the second girl I lose my erection entirely and can't finish.

Stephanie kept contacting me, about once a week, asking to hang out. She found out about the sex and was actually kind of happy. I think that she thought of it as a sort of ""getting even"" for us and that I would get over her cheating and not have the simmering anger underneath the surface whenever I would hang out with her. She called me up late one night and wanted to come over to my house. I waffled, and then relented. We ended up having sex.

Afterward, I felt confused about the whole thing. I talked with her about it and she told me she didn't want to get back together with me. I said that seeing her and being with her sexually was difficult emotionally for me, which she insisted she couldn't understand. We fell into a pattern where she would call me after a bad day, crying or upset or anxious, and I would either come over to her house or she would come over to mine and we would have sex.

After about a month of this, I was at a bar with my friends when a beautiful girl came in and sat down alone. I decided to talk to her, we strike up a conversation, really get along, and at the end of the night we kiss. A few days later, we went out and decided we wanted to start dating, and have sex. I told her that night that I still had contact with my ex, obviously leaving out the part about still having sex. I also told Ellen, the new girl, that the primary reason I was still in contact with her was because we were still on the same cell phone plan (which was true, but not the primary reason). Ellen said she was fine with that and was glad that I was open about it.

I told Stephanie the next day that I'd met someone and that because of that we couldn't have sex anymore. Stephanie flipped. She didn't scream at more or throw anything, but simply badgered me relentlessly that I shouldn't be dating someone else exclusively, or if I was going to, that Stephanie and I should still be able to have sex. I was forceful and said that we couldn't.

Almost immediately, Ellen pulled away from me. It was a combination of finding out about the ex and just being a closed person. She was also younger (22 to my then 26) and wasn't really able to express herself in a way that would have allowed us to work through any issues. We went on a few more dates, but it was awkward, and between those dates I ended up sleeping with Stephanie once more (without telling Ellen).

Still pining after Ellen, still upset with myself about being unable to drop Stephanie, I went to a wedding as the platonic date of one of my friends. While I was there I met Hannah, who was there with a date, and also happened to be an old friend of the girl who I had come to the wedding with. Hannah and I talked, but I didn't feel like we really hit it off, merely that she was a fun person to flirt with even despite the (oblivious) boyfriend. I didn't even give her my number, not thinking that anything would come of it.

A few days latter, Hannah contacted me on Facebook and we started hanging out. I told her about the things that had happened with my ex, and that I had to get off of the cell phone contract with her, and what had happened with Jake.  Hannah and I started fooling around, then having sex, then dating. We got along extremely well, and both of us had been through near-marriage relationships that ended by being cheated on. We both fell in love incredibly quick.

Stephanie was still texting me, but I held off her advances, and finally (FINALLY) got her into the cell phone store to get off of her cell phone plane. The next day Stephanie texted me, saying something like ""I just want to end it all."" I thought this was a suicide text, and immediately called her. It wasn't, I had misinterpreted. 

That text was the last straw, I talked with Hannah and I talked with my therapist, and told them both that I felt like the best way for me to get closure would be to tell Stephanie that I was blocking her number, that she had hurt me too much, and that I had found someone who made me happy and wanted to be with just her. She sent me back some rage texts before I blocked her number, and I moved on.

It may seem fast, but within a few months I knew something that I had never felt with Stephanie: I never wanted to look at another woman aside from Hannah. Flirting with anyone else held no value for me. The addiction I had always struggled with, fighting for affection from the opposite sex, wasn't cured but its edge was certainly curbed. I proposed about three months into our relationship. A few days later, we found out-- to our joy-- that Hannah was pregnant. Hannah and I have now been married for two months, and our child is due in August.

NSFW ASIDE: Hannah prefers me to be the aggressor in bed (and I mean AGGRESSOR in all caps). She's very specific about what she wants, and isn't afraid to be vocal if she isn't enjoying something. This was new to me on all counts, and there were times when sexually we weren't on the same page and I felt inadequate. It was at these times when I would fantasize about Stephanie sexually, with whom I had established a pattern of mutual orgasm and satisfaction. Now Hannah and I are on the same page, and we have amazing sex. She loves to do it multiple times a day, and lets me do pretty much anything I want to her. Her ass, it must be added, is amazing. But she is such a DIFFERENT lover than Stephanie, that sometimes I daydream about her.

I wouldn't be thinking about Stephanie at all, though, if it weren't for what happened before my bachelor party. My best friend had come up for the event; we hadn't seen each other in years and he was going to be my best man. His wife was still friends with Stephanie and he told me, shortly before my party, that Stephanie was pregnant with Jake's kid. It took me by surprise, and it makes me more angry than I have any right to be that, by my math, she got pregnant by Jake within weeks of that ""I just want to end it all"" text. 

I think he's scummy for cheating on and leaving his wife and kids and impregnating someone almost a decade his junior. I think he's scummy for having met me and still going after my then-girlfriend. I think she's scummy for not talking to me about why she really wanted to kick me out. I think she's scummy for using me for comfort (physical and emotional) between her spats with Jake and then jumping right back to them when I reneged on that comfort.

But mostly, I'm selfish enough and addicted to female affection enough that I'm most hurt by the fact that she isn't still crying to herself that I won't talk to her anymore, and that she decided some guy who would leave his wife and kids is a better partner than me. 

It shouldn't matter, I'm absolutely in love with Hannah and I am so excited for our child to come into this world. I have good friends, I have a good job, and in general things are going well for me. But for some fucked up reason, it does matter that Stephanie isn't crumbled in a heap because of me. Sometimes I feel as though I should have been an asshole, told her family (who still don't know the details of Jake's life when he met Stephanie) the horrible details of what she did to me, plastered it onto her Facebook wall so her friends could see, and just in general burn her. Sometimes I wish I could still have sex with her. Sometimes I wish I could punch her in the face.

I can't say that I'm glad that it ended. I still sometimes feel frustrated and lost in all of it. I feel as though if Stephanie hadn't cheated and we'd had our wedding that I'd been in a similar place to where I am now, with a similar level of happiness, so I can't say this was ""for the better."" 

But I'm happy now because I've found a wonderful person who makes me happy and makes me feel in love and loved every day. I've learned from my mistakes, and I treat Hannah better in those small ways than how I treated Stephanie-- doing little things for her even when she hasn't asked for anything, putting her happiness above my own.

There are no answers here, no advice that I'm looking for (though I'll take any if you have it), no assuredness I've received from my experience or that I'm looking to receive from posting this. I just needed to get it all down on paper and look at it, to see what's happened without frills or rose-colored glasses.

Thanks for listening.

**TL;DR: After 7 years, my gf left me for a married coworker who had kids. Then left him and slept with me. Then I found my wife and felt good. Then I found out my ex got pregnant from the married coworker and felt bad.**"

Story:

Over the summer I've been working a co-op job for my university education (basically an internship, but paid well). Since the job is in the middle of nowhere (Northern Alberta oilsands), I stay in a camp; what a glorious experience it is. There is a fully equipped gym right down the hall, and as much of the type of food that a professional bodybuilder would eat as I want; food already prepared for me.

I counted it today, and on an average day I'll eat about 4000 calories (340g of protein) from egg whites, cottage cheese, tuna, greens, fruit, meat, meat, and more meat, etc. For reference, I'm 5'10"" and 190-195lbs. I also brought some creatine up here; one scoop before and one scoop after a workout. The funny thing is that I don't even work out as hard as I usually do due to exhaustion from 12-hour work days. 1 - 1.5 hour workouts max.

I thought it was pretty fucking crazy for me to gain that fast, as I've never been one to make huge gains in short times.

So I am a college student, about a year from graduating. I just started an internship yesterday and went with business casual (slacks and a button down with dress shoes, pretty much all I had). However they told me right away that business casual wasn't necessarily required, but they don't want tennis shoes either. So the best I got from them was something between casual and business casual. (That's definitely what the women were wearing, some had jeans but it was still nice enough.) Any ideas on what that would be?? 

I tried looking at the other men for examples, but this company has 54 employees, 51 of which are women. Plus, the three guys were all in IT wearing jeans and tennis shoes.

Any ideas? Should I just stick with business casual? As an intern I figured it might not hurt to try and dress a little better in hopes of getting a job offer at the end."
1ebp2p,545,2013-05-14,League of Legends Facts: Season 1,SnickyMcNibits,leagueoflegends,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1ebp2p/league_of_legends_facts_season_1/,"Previous Episode http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1dwod8/league_of_legends_facts_the_original_40_champions/

Hey all, after the success of my first post about the original 40 Champions I decided to continue the series. In this episode we'll look at the time period between launch and the end of the first competitive season, running from October 2009 to August 2011, nearly two years!

Because of the sheer amount of stuff I could talk about in that time, I'm limiting what this post covers; Nothing about bugs, champion balance or the high-end competitive scene. Removed content, such as a number of infamous items, will be covered in a separate installment.

And yes, I'm going to forget a few things. Please comment (nicely) if there's any interesting facts I left out!

----------------------
**Champions released during Pre-Season 1 and Season 1 (In order):**

(I'm not counting the original 40 champs - that post is linked at the top.)

(Pre-Season) Udyr, Nidalee, Poppy, Gragas, Pantheon, Mordekaiser, Ezreal, Shen, Kennen, Garen, Akali, Malzahar, Olaf, Kog'Maw

(Season 1) Xin Zhao, Vladimir, Galio, Urgot, Miss Fortune, Sona, Swain, Lux, LeBlanc, Irelia, Trundle, Cassiopeia, Caitlyn, Renekton, Karma, Maokai, Jarvan IV, Nocturne, Lee Sin, Brand, Rumble, Vayne, Orianna, Yorick, Leona, Wukong, Skarner, Talon


If they were organized according to their current positions in the SR metagame, it would look like this:

*Top:* Nidalee, Poppy, Pantheon, Mordekaiser, Shen, Garen, Akali, Olaf, Vladimir, Irelia, Renekton, Yorick, Wukong, Talon

*Jungle:* Udyr, Xin Zhao, Trundle, Maokai, Jarvan IV, Nocturne, Lee Sin, Skarner

*AP Mid:* Gragas, Kennen, Malzahar, Galio, Swain, Lux, LeBlanc, Cassiopeia, Karma, Brand, Orianna

*ADC:* Ezreal, Kog'Maw, Urgot, Miss Fortune, Caitlyn, Vayne

*Support:* Sona, Leona


And yes, I know certain champs like Kennen could go in other roles. Bite me.

----------------------

**Champion Pricing**

Poppy was released at the price of 1350 IP. She is the first and last champion to be released post-launch at that price point.

The vast majority of champions released during the game's first year were priced at 3150 IP. The last champion to be released at that pricepoint was Karma, at the very beginning of 2011. Since then, champions have either been released at 4800 or 6300 IP (Until recently when they became more expensive during their first week, though I would still consider them being released at 6k).

Only four champions have been released at the 4800 IP price point - Trundle, Jarvan IV, Orianna and Rumble.

----------------------

**Champion Trivia**

Nidalee is the only champion to have ever had an ability's cooldown reduction artificially throttled. Pounce (Cougar form's W) with enough CDR was deemed too powerful as it allowed her a huge amount of mobility and made her almost uncatchable. As such, Pounce was changed so that it was no longer affected by CDR. This change has since been reverted.

Ezreal's launch was... poorly received to put it mildly. He had a high learning curve and as such was perceived as being extremely weak - coupled with him being the first post-release champion priced at 6300 IP, his introduction into league caused a huge outcry from people who purchased him and felt they had wasted a huge chunk of IP/RP. This prompted Phreak (at that time an intern at Riot) to release the very first Champion Spotlight, detailing builds and strategies for Ezreal to show people what he was capable of - even scoring a kill on the mythical Jesse Perring.

Ironically, the current Ezreal is considered a strong pick, even though he's arguably weaker in almost every way to the launch Ezreal that caused so much backlash. Tier Lists FTW.

The first champion to have an auto-attack reset ability was Garen with his (Q)Decisive Strike. Before him, similar champion abilities such as Nasus' (Q)Siphoning Strike would simply apply on their next auto-attack, but Decisive Strike came out immediately once activated. It's still unclear if this aspect was intended behavior as it was removed and re-added several times in subsequent patches. The feel of Decisive Strike received a lot of positive feedback from Garen players, so Riot decided to add auto-attack resets to other similar abilities.

The first champion to be hotfixed for being overpowered was also the first champion released after launch: Udyr. After being in a rather mediocre state for a few months, Riot gave him a round of buffs but WAY overshot it. (Thanks to /u/2th for the correction!)

LeBlanc receives the dubious honors of being the first champion in the league launched in a state of such OPness that they hotfixed her a mere two days after her debut.

Lee Sin was also balanced with a hotfix within a week of launch, but for completely different reasons. Four days after he entered the League he was given a massive boost to all his AD ratios.

Another infamous character that had to be nerfed via a hotfix was... the minions. In March 2010 Riot had increased the late game power of minions in order to alleviate late game stalemates. However, when minions started taking down inhibitors unaided and even killing champions when in large numbers, Riot decided to tone them back a little.

----------------------

**Skins**

In addition to the annual Snowdown and Harrowing skins, there were a number of Olympics themed skins available in early 2010 to coincide with the Vancouver Winter Olympics. These include Vancouver Amumu, Team Spirit Anivia, Union Jack Fiddlesticks, The Mighty Jax, Festival Kassadin, Whistler Village Twitch, Curling Veigar and a legendary skin Ice Toboggan Corki.

In June of 2010 there were a several soccer/football themed skins available in honor of the FIFA World Cup, including All-Star Akali, Goalkeeper Blitzcrank, Striker Ezreal and Red Card Katarina.

The first several champions to be released after launch - Udyr,  Nidalee, Poppy, and Gragas - did not launch with skins. Nidalee would have a limited edition Snow Bunny Nidalee skin as part of the Snowdown Showdown shortly after her debut, and Poppy would have Noxus Poppy about a month after her release. The first champion to be released along with a skin was Pantheon, which was also the first champion/skin bundle for a new champion.

The first champions to have a combination champion/skin bundle were Teemo and Karthus, with their Phantom Karthus and Badger Teemo skins respectively. These combo packs were available for a very short time after launch.

The first skin to be retired from the store was Rusty Blitcrank, discontinued on January 17th 2010.

The first champion to receive unique splash art for their skins was Garen - All skin splashes before him were simply recolors of the basic splash art.

----------------------

**Maps**

Summoner's Rift originally had two different variations: The standard one and a winter themed one, which featured snow covered terrain and snowy particle effects. The winter version was further decorated for the Snowdown Showdown event to feature a host of Christmas-like decorations across the map. However a number of players reported performance drops on the Winter map, so it had mixed reception.

A Harrowing map was later added as a temporary alternate during October 2010, featuring spooky fog and orange/black brush, as well as a number of Halloween-like decorations. This map was so popular with the community that it later replaced the Winter version as the alternate version of Summoner's Rift.

Neither the Winter or Autumn maps are now available after the May 2012 graphical update.

A proposed map was revealed by Riot in September 2010: The Magma Chamber. Intended to be a new classic-style 5v5 map, Magma chamber was to be much bigger than Summoner's Rift and was supposed to emphasize spreading your team out to control the whole map rather than team fighting. The map also had an interesting aesthetic where half the map would be a cool, watery cave while the other half would be volcanic. After extensive playtesting, Riot decided to scrap the map for other ideas.

----------------------

**Lore**

Possibly the largest scale lore event that has or will ever take place was the Noxus vs Ionia Rematch. Hyped up for months by the Journal of Justice and Riot forum posts, it was fought on December 10th, 2010. A group of high-profile players were selected to represent each city state and selected their teams from a preselected pool of 10 champions corresponding to either side. The entire thing was done as a hardcore roleplaying event, with the casters even pretending to be Journal of Justice reporters - an example of this is when a player disconnected they said he ""was having problems with his summoner's orb"", and Roku (the team captain for the Noxus side) giving a post-game speech congratulation the Ionians on their hard won victory. The results of this battle were later made into a cannon part of the lore.

Demacia, despite being one of the biggest and most influential factions in the world of Runeterra, was totally unrepresented in the League until the release of Poppy in January 2010, who was an ambassador of the Yordles. The first true Demacian, Garen, was released in April of 2010.

An in-game news paper called the Journal of Justice was released periodically during Season 1, starting June 2010 and ending May 2011. It detailed the current events in the Runeterra universe, as detailed by a cast of fake media personalities. Besides providing updates on world events, it had a number of tabloid-like sections detailing the private life of League characters, interviews and Q&amp;A sessions with champions and a mailbag section where they'd answer player submitted lore questions. It was discontinued near the start of Season 2, as Riot stated they wanted to find a better way to convey the in-game lore.

Additionally, new champions released during season one had League Judgements written up about them. These detailed various champion's initiation ceremonies into the league, usually involving them reliving a pivotal moment in their life so that the viewing summoners could see their real motivations for joining the League. Judgements were released for all new champions up until the release of Graves, shortly after the end of Season 1. Since Graves, only Varus has received a League Judgement. Ryze also received a retroactive Judgement during Season 1.

----------------------

**Competitive Play**

It was originally intended that there would be a rotating pool of allowed champions for ranked play instead of having the entire cast available. The intent behind this was to reduce the number of champions a player would need to learn in order to be competitive and to adjust the champions available in case a particular strategy became too strong or popular. This idea has never been implemented however.

There was a battle of metagames between the North American and European server during the early stages of competitive League play. The NA style was more focused on late game team comps, where they'd place their AD carry in mid to farm up, AP carry top, have an aggressive initiator jungler and place whatever other champions they had bottom. This however led to a number of lost bottom lanes when facing against the EU style, as many times bot was just a ""throwaway"" lane where champions with little synergy or lane presence were put because they wanted them for late game. Ultimately the EU style of bruiser top, AP mid, AD/Support bot was adopted by the NA server as well and is still considered the standard team composition."
1ebmuz,3,2013-05-14,Going back for a master's degree in accounting. Need job advice.,[deleted],Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1ebmuz/going_back_for_a_masters_degree_in_accounting/,"I'll be graduating shortly with a degree in accounting from a university in the Northeastern United States. 

During my undergraduate career, I naturally applied for tons of tax internships (including Big Four stuff, plus some regional firms) and even had a few interviews, but I was a poor interviewer and nothing ever panned out properly for me. I've never gotten past the first round in most cases. Also, it didn't help that I didn't go to very many of the networking events they had on campus (my other jobs often got in the way).

Since then, I've gotten much better at interviewing and schmoozing with people, but unfortunately, these newfound skills came a bit too late in my case. 

Of course, I don't have a job related to accounting (still working a bunch of part-time retail jobs at the moment), so I decided to apply for and enroll in my university's MAcc program to get one last chance at on-campus recruiting this fall, get my thirty hours, and get a chance to sit for the CPA exam. 

Overall, my main interest is in tax, and at least for the networking events I've gone to, I've iterated this interest to a number of people. 

In the meantime, I've been applying for entry-level accounting jobs... But that hasn't been going very well, with a very low callback rate. I'm still waiting to hear back from one place (it's for an A/P position for a medium-sized software company), but I'm not very hopeful because I'm fighting at least a dozen other people for that one. 

Between now and the beginning of the fall recruiting season, what should I do? I've been thinking about reaching out to alumni from my school, setting up informational interviews with them, as my next step, in addition to applying for more entry-level jobs. How does that sound? One of my professors also recommends reaching out to recruiters as well, but I'm not sure how helpful that would be. 

**TLDR: I'm enrolling in a MAcc program in the fall, and need help figuring out my game plan towards getting a job offer in tax.**

*Addendum: If I am applying for jobs in the fall (with the Big Four et al), should I go for the winter internships, or go straight for full-time opportunities?*"
1ebmoc,1,2013-05-14,Got 700 for graduation...now what?,sexiibitch,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1ebmoc/got_700_for_graduationnow_what/,"My initial thought was to put it towards bills to get them paid off faster. That way I can use the roughly 300/mth to put in a savings account to use for when I move out into an apartment in January with my SO. (Furniture, deposit, etc) 
But I'm beginning to wonder if I should just keep making my minimum monthly payments and tuck that 700 into savings now. 
For background, I have nothing in savings now because I barely make enough a month for bills and even then I scrape by sometimes needing to borrow for food and gas. Here's what I owe:
206/month for my car, I owe 1250 on it.
40/month on a closed credit card, owe 1090, this one has the highest interest.
40/month on another closed card, owe 1890 on it
Then I have my recurring bills (80/month phone, 85/month insurance, roughly 80/month gas)
My fear is that if i put it into savings now I'll start dipping into it for gas and groceries...I hate borrowing money. Then I'll be shit out of luck for when I move out.
Any advice would be greatly appreciated, if you need more specifics, don't hesitate to ask. 

Tl;dr: pay off bills now or save now? Or something else I haven't thought of?

Edit: I need to clarify that I graduated college...not high school. I have lived on my own before and made it work, but had to take a lower paying job to complete an internship. "

2) I am not very interested in pharmaceutical research. What I would like to do is research brain/computer interfacing, for prosthetics etc. Or researching genetic engineering/gene therapy. (Not that I wouldn't take a pharma job, I just wouldn't want to do that permanently.) Does that count as Biotech, or Bioengineering?


3) I want to get an internship as soon as possible. Any tips on what researchers look for in applicants?

Previous to that I was perfectly fine for about a year because shit was going up in my life. Suddenly, everything went downhill.

I wasn't getting internship. I wasn't getting jobs. I got rejected from a job I loved. I felt isolated and alone, hating my body. To top it all off, the thing that sent me down a shithole spiral from whence I had come, was my boyfriend breaking up with me.

I'm back in the depression I was in before this whole thing. It's been a month since we've been together, but now I'm just so depressed. I met a few guys, one went back to his state, another is not talking, and the last has stopped talking to me and I don't know why.

For the past three days I've been having a consistent anxiety attack so I took a Xanax. Once it wore off I was back to panicing, but now it's more intense and I'm having major mood swings. It's impossible.

I'm just so upset and defeated. I hate who I am. I'm overweight, 21 years old, and now I'm doing poorly in every aspect of my life. I don't want to be alive right now.

Are these mood swings normal? Why can't I get over this guy? Everything seems so pointless. I'll never find another man that seems to like this fat worthless piece of shit that I am. I thought we were in love, but fuck, I feel like I was the one falling and he just watched it happen.

But you better believe, I got back on the horse and made them my bitch. I just want a freaking job that is relevant to my major. Is that too much to ask? Fuck me. 

If ya'll are wondering if I have been applying to jobs, yes I have, since early october 2012, and up to now I had 1 phone interview. I apply to small companies, big companies, but no go. I apply on the website, via indeed, everything but no fucking go. 

Sigh...

1ealq3,0,2013-05-13,For Those With Crazy Lives: You're Not Alone,OthersideGraffiti,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1ealq3/for_those_with_crazy_lives_youre_not_alone/,"The last few years of my life have been rather rough. Bear with me, my story gets a little crazy.

During high school my mother cheated on my dad, and fell into a rapid downwards spiral of suicidal depression and alcoholism my senior year. After almost losing her multiple times to suicide attempts, losing a girl I cared everything about because she couldn't deal with my problems, and doing badly in school and football I became extremely depressed. I quit going to school for a month, lost a ton of weight, and wouldn't speak to hardly anyone. Eventually I just lost it, as I am a perfectionist and couldn't handle not being able to fix all of these uncontrollable things in my life. One night, I choose to crash my car into a tree I was so frustrated. At the last moment, I decided to slow down, and despite totaling my car emerged unscathed from the incident. It was the biggest mistake of my life and am something I am so ashamed of, since I am usually a strong person.That was two years ago.

My life started getting better a couple months down the line, when I found out I got into the university of my dreams. However, still somewhat depressed, I began smoking weed all the time as a way of escape. After a particularly rough summer where my mother got arrested for striking me and no longer being on speaking terms with her, I left for the university ready to begin my new life.

My first week at my university, I rushed the best frat on campus, and was offered a bid to join. Not really thinking about what I was getting into, I gladly accepted. This was the start of nearly two years of extreme drug and alcohol abuse for me. Starting with weed, I quickly moved up to hallucinogens, pills, coke, pretty much anything I could get my hands on. I would regularly drive drunk, and would black out multiple times a week. Eventually I stopped going to class, which of course resulted in me failing one of my courses. While this was all going on I forgave my mother and rekindled a relationship with her. It was probably the only good thing I had done in a couple of years.

Five months ago, I realized that if I continued to live the way I was living, I wouldn't live to 25. I'd been seeing a therapist for months for PTSD caused by my high school experience but I was ready to make the steps I needed to live. I moved out of the frat house, cut ties with all of my drug buddies, got focused on school again, and tried my best to fix my relationships with the members of my family and my old friends who I had neglected. 

Today, I sit here typing this post as almost a new person. I've been relatively sober since I started making these changes, got on anti-depressants, and am starting to feel like life is normal for me after so many years. I've gotten great grades the last couple quarters, have started making new friends, and got a great internship for the summer.

I've come so far, and I'm remarkably normal considering all of these things that have happened to me. I'm a very nice, good looking, sociable guy, who's just made some terrible mistakes and has had bad things happen to me. Most people don't even know about any of my problems, since I don't like to talk about them and I don't act like my life is so crazy. 

So today, I decided to write this post because it is something that I would never usually do. I'm the last person to talk about my problems, even to my friends I've known my whole life. But through all of these terrible experiences, I'm thankful that I've been so fortunate to turn my life around. So I guess I want to tell people my story, so they know that there's people out there who can relate and who turned their lives around and made things good again. This is the first time I've written a honest account of my experiences.

1eev2x,1,2013-05-15,"I'm Helpless, now Hopeless....",[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1eev2x/im_helpless_now_hopeless/,"I'm posting this on Reddit, this specific subreddit, because I think I'm officially giving up on life.  Bitching on the Internet has done nothing for me, but because I know there's nowhere else to go I might as well engage in this behavior.  All the pain, all the loneliness and all the nothingness has taken its toll on me.  My enemies have won, they've finally conquered me, though it took them years they ultimately won this war of attrition.

At first I thought, “Maybe Reddit can really help me, like give me exactly what I need to fix things,” but it's pathetic of me to even think of such nonsense.  And before anyone says to me, “You have to help yourself,” I personally hope your kidneys get ripped out for even uttering such words.  I'm not a superhero, nobody is, and I've helped plenty of people throughout my life...I haven't gotten the same in return.  Nobody can make it in this world alone, and those who do sacrifice too much to be considered “persons” anymore.

Maybe it's the way I look, maybe it's my aura, maybe it's just how I am, but for whatever reason people just don't want to give me that helping hand.  Not friends, not family – nobody!  I wish someone would tell me why I don't deserve this, is it because I'm unlikeable, am I unattractive, am I stupid, do I give you a bad feeling?  Now I know this is the part when somebody thinks, “Nobody deserves anything,” yes, let's think that way, so our society turns into all of us living in selfish bubbles instead of a functional, adapting community!

As a matter of fact, I'm so against the notion of our species living in self-serving, blissful bubbles that I've sacrificed things in the hope of fixing this problem.  I once had a dream that would bring me happiness, but shit happened and I'd much rather do something greater.  The only problem is my words are empty as I've got nothing to start and nobody by my side.  I know what I want to do in my extremely long-term goal of changing the world, but I don't care anymore about taking that first step.  And honestly, why should I when this journey is so soul-sucking and lonely?

My only way to cope with things is to not think about them, to ignore them – and I'm sick of doing this.  For the past few days I've been watching these TV documentaries about famous mobsters, about how cold, calculating and efficient they are, how machine-like they are – am I going to have that kind of mentality in a few years?  No, I won't commit any crimes, but will I only care about money and power while not being capable of knowing love or affection?  Due to my coping mechanism I'm already emotionally-detached, or “dead on the inside” as I like to call it...AND IT FUCKING SUCKS!

It seems the only way for me to survive is to become more machine-like, to lose all my humanity until there's nothing there, until I don't care about anyone or the world around me long as my goal is achieved.  The only reason why I'm such a failure now is because for years I've been trying to stop my soulless conversion from happening.  Some days I wish I was truly a machine so at least I would get things done, rather than being the worthless shell-of-a-human I currently am.

Everything is pretty bad for me.  I have no job and sure as hell won't get one after being unemployed for 9 months, jobs I'm qualified for won't respond, retail places never contact me, temp agencies have been no use, part-time places won't contact me, some internships won't even contact me.  Sure, I can volunteer and maybe if I'm lucky after a few months that will turn into a job, but the world runs on money and not goodwill.  Aside from that, I'm too prideful to play this stupid game and be at the mercy of employers.  Honestly, I'd rather die broke than kiss ass for that first paycheck.  You can disagree with my attitude, but if more people thought like me instead of being ready to bend-over-backwards shit wouldn't be this bad.  

Oh, but it gets worse because I'm 28 and I still live with my parents – I'm just a loser all around!  Sorry, there's no paragraph here because that one sentence says enough.

Aside from being an unemployed loser, I'm completely unfulfilled emotionally and physically.  I know women read this subreddit, and they certainly don't want to be with someone in my shoes.  They'd much rather be with someone who's got stability and structure rather than someone with nothing.  Hell, I'm sure I'm one ugly-motherfucker, because nobody has ever said I look attractive.  But don't worry ladies, when my soul is finally gone and I truly become a machine, I'll use y'all for sex than throw you away when I'm bored – it's not because I'll hate women, it'll be because I truly won't care anymore.  

Some people here might try to give me advice, but don't bother.  Unless you can actually do something real for me, something useful (and I bet you can't because people who know me in real life sure as hell can't) your words are empty.  From now on I'm only going to bitch on the Internet until I rot or until I'm no longer human.

There is no help for me, there is no hope for me...."

But what other excel type things or any other programming type things should I brush up on before heading for day 1?

1eeokb,3,2013-05-15,It's only been a year... (reflective post inside),[deleted],self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1eeokb/its_only_been_a_year_reflective_post_inside/,"I'm abroad for part of this summer, so on my flight over, I came to thinking a lot (and am now going to blabber because I want to share). I'm surprised - I've changed so much in so little time. In the past year as a second-year at college, I've not only found out a lot about myself as a person, but I've come to embrace who I am.  

Last year when I started school, I was overly socially aware. I thought everyone was looking at me always. I was convinced that everyone was looking at me, saying negative things about me; even if I were just getting lunch from a dining hall, I believed that classmates were thinking that I was a loser with no friends. Now, I have changed. I am less socially anxious (though I still have my insecurities, though I am working on them), I’ve learned to not care about what others think as much - not just convincing myself that I don’t care, but actually not being affected by my anxiety. I've started to embrace everything about myself. I am an introverted person. My idea of fun is to sit outside and read a really good book. I've come to understand that I don't need to change that about myself. I've always over-stressed about having friends, thinking I need to be more outgoing but honestly? Not true. I have my very close friends, intro- and extroverts alike, and they are the most amazing people I have met. They push me to be a better person, do things I otherwise might not, and accept me for myself as I am. They're honestly inspiring.

I've always assumed I was just not a passionate person and so would never be really into anything. This semester, I took an anthropology class I was close to dropping due to the high level and ridiculous workload, but decided last minute to keep it. It was life changing. Not only did I find something I LOVE, but I've gained a new respect for my capabilities as a student and writer. I've never thought of myself as good at anything or able to take on a big work load, but with the extensive amount of reading and writing required for this one class, I garnered a new appreciation for my talents. 

A few months ago, I had no idea what I would be doing over the summer. All around me, classmates were getting positions in the DC area, medical centers, other amazing research opportunities. I had been eying an internship forever, yet due to my over thinking, forgot to apply until two days late (I can be a perfectionist and thus was still working on my cover letter the day I realized the application was late). Through networking, I was able to move my application to the top of the pile. And even though I was late, I got the position at an ivy league institution. I also got asked to hold another awesome internship position. I never expected things to pan out as amazing as they did.

Today, I got an email from the studies abroad office at my school informing me that I had permission to study at my dream school next spring (which they don't usually grant since I want to study at a university that does not have the same mission as my small liberal arts school). I had submitted the application in the midst of hell week, yet was determined to do it. And it all worked out.

Though I still have a long way to grow both personally and academically, I am really ecstatic about the amount of positive change that has happened in just the last year. I know a year sounds like a long time, but it really hasn’t felt that long at all. I’m still in awe over how much I’ve developed as a person, and am really excited to see what else is in store in the future.

I know this was a long post/bit of a brag but I just wanted to share. For all those struggling right now, one thing I have learned is that things work out. Things will fit together eventually, just keep pulling through. Had anyone told me last year that all this would happen, I would have laughed. Never would I have thought that I would have such amazing opportunities as I ended up getting - nor would I have thought that I would find something that I love. I am confident that things will work for you too. "

I have been in and out of college for 10 years (god sounds terrible writing that).  I've held good paying and high experience qualifying jobs throughout, management, using excel etc.  About a year ago I found out about being an actuary and got into it.  I studied on my own and passed P and am sitting for FM in August.  I am also currently in a summer internship with a large insurance company.  I am still probably 2 full years away from actually getting a Bachelors in actuarial science.  I know that passing exams and getting experience are the biggest factors that people look for.  Is it possible that with multiple exams passed, an internship, and lots of other relevant experience I could get into the career without the degree or am I looking at definitely having to wait the two more years of schooling to get going?

tl:dr - Multiple exams passed, internships and experience in field but 2 years from degree, do I have to drag it out those two years before getting a job?"

1edtkd,6,2013-05-15,Target Date Break Even ROI for Graduate Degree,loopy212,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1edtkd/target_date_break_even_roi_for_graduate_degree/,"I've been thinking about pursuing a graduate degree and am trying to evaluate the effect of such on my personal financial situation.  Please note that the following is gross of tax.

My current income is $80k base with a variable bonus component.  For the sake of the analysis, I've estimated the bonus at $5k, which is somewhat low (received a $15k bonus last year), but I'd expect to receive at least that each year.  My career is in a bit of a weird place, so I've modeled salary growth a few different ways.  I've shown flat 2% growth indefinitely (that's probably low in the short term and high in the long term) and two stage growth with 5% growth in the short term tapering off to 2% growth long term (current career has a salary ceiling).  It's highly likely that I will switch out of my current area in the next 1-2 years taking a potential pay cut (MBA notwithstanding), which I haven't modeled.

The program I am looking into is a two year, full time program with a paid internship over the summer bridging the two years; standard full-time MBA program.  I've estimated the all-in costs to be $75k per year.  Tuition runs between $55k and $65k with housing and living expenses being a variable; I came up with $75k as a somewhat conservative estimate; every school I am looking at except Boston schools will probably be below this.

Internship expected salary is $15k.  Post-graduation, the median salary of the weakest school I am applying to is ~$115k with a median $20k signing bonus; this is the baseline for all my salary projections, but there is a big upside, if I get into H/S/W it would be more like $160k base + $30k bonus.  I'm assuming no other bonuses in the out years, but post-MBA the bonus potential is much higher than my current career.  Also looked at two different scenarios, a 5% flat post-MBA salary growth and a 5% growth for 5 years declining to 2.5% after that.

For discount rate, I'm assuming 4% (7% interest rate for student loans less 3% inflation).

Based on the above outlined terms, I am looking at between 8 and 9 years to achieve break-even ROI between getting an MBA and staying in my current career.  To me, that seems like a long time to get to break even, but I'm not sure what a ""normal"" break even period is for graduate degrees.  

I feel like there is something I am missing here because basically it doesn't seem to make much sense to get my MBA from a financial perspective.  I'm hopeful there is just something I am missing here.

TL;DR What is an acceptable break even time for professional graduate degrees?"

I don't know if this is the right place to ask, but I'm in a really bad place and I need to vent. If this post doesn't belong here then downvote or please let me know where I can ask instead.

I've known this girl for 8 years now. About a year before graduating from school and going to University we started going out, having been best friends before that. I had the best 3 and a half years of my life until she broke up with me a couple of days ago. Now I'm feeling a bit scared for the future, since she was the only person I could ever talk to.

Ever since I was a kid, I've been very closed emotionally and have never opened up to anyone. When my gf first broke up with me I felt very lost and afraid, because I needed to talk to someone about this but she was the only person I had. I've never been that close to my parents, and with my close friends I just talk about stuff that interests us. She was the first one I could actually open up to and not feel afraid or embarassed; she would offer good advice and help.

The thing is I caved in and called her afterwards and she was very eager to help me get through this, and be there for me. That is a great thing about her. The problem though is she lives in a different city, and I am currently stuck living with my mum and sister doing an internship I hate, when all of my friends are at university.

I also feel I need to get some distance from her to be able to get over this healthily. I don't want to depend on her anymore, yet I have no-one I can really turn to in this moment. I'm very depressed and I'm trying very hard to be strong and look positively to the future but I keep thinking about how much has been thrown away with this relationship and it is haunting me. All of my clothes, posters in my room, belongings are either from her or in some way relate to her. There are too many memories that I can't stop clinging on to.

The breakup was very sudden and I didn't really see it coming. Can someone offer some advice or share a similar experince? It would help me immensely.


**EDIT:** Thank you all so much for your responses, I actually feel much better and more positive in my mind! I'm gonna try and minimise contact with her for a while, and go out and be pro-active!"

I still dream about you, and I cry when I think of you looking at another girl the way you looked at me, but I have to let you move on. I have to deal with the consequences of my actions.

I am almost 22 year old, male, I've been in relationships before and had some flings with different girls over the years, but never felt complete. I could never find what I was looking for, and things never worked. When I went to college, it was in a terrible city and I hated everything about it. My 3rd year in, I hit a low point of partying, and mild depression. I met a girl at work, 21, and we quickly hit it off. Things literally took off. We both said to take things slow, and we did, but at the same time everything just went so fast.

We didn't have sex until about 2 months into being exclusive, despite spending almost every night together. We grew closer and closer together, and we have undoubtedly fell in love. **We've only been together for 3 months now.** In retrospect, that isn't much time at all. We've talked about it, and we both agree **it has felt like 10 months** or so. We've talked about marriage, our future together, engagement, budgeting, everything of that nature. It seems fast, logically, but it doesn't feel fast.** I love her, she loves me**, and I've never been happier. 

**I've found the woman I want to spend the rest of my life with.** I'm the kind of guy to think long and hard about things. I hate commitment, and I hate the idea of being locked into something. But without a doubt, I want to marry her. She said if I proposed, she'd definitely say yes. Though she wants us to wait at least a year so her family would be more accepting to the idea.

**We spend every night together.** With an occasional 1 night apart due to exams or something. I've met her immediate family, and they all like me. I've met her cousins, whom she is close to. They like me. She's met my immediate family, same situation.


**What is the problem?**

**1.** We have events within the near future that will cause long separations. The closest one being a summer internship. I'll be moving 5 hours away, renting a room from one of her cousins in the city. **I won't get to see her all summer.** It is going to be painful physically and emotionally for both of us. She is seemingly confident of the situation, absolutely sure we'll power through it together. I've seen long distance relationships first hand, and I'm afraid she isn't fully aware of the situation and she will slip away from me. **I've talked to her directly about it, but she gets upset, she says ""I don't like that you don't have confidence in us."". I know we'll make it through the time, but I'm afraid it will damage the structure.** 

With that, there is a foreseeable problem in about a year where I'll graduate but she'll have another year, along with specialization schooling. It could cause another 1-4 years of separation depending on the circumstances. Due to the time between then, I'm mainly looking for advice in regards of the current summer separation.

**2.**
We are completely comfortable together now. The things we aren't fully comfortable with, we are slowly working on. I can notice us both getting more relaxed with things. However, **I still feel like it is the first date every time I see her.** I'm not sure if that is a good or bad thing. But basically, **I have that constant feeling of pressure that I need to always impress her**. As if I am still trying to win her over. I don't know why, but it is always there. **It is stressful.** Any ideas on why that is, what it is, how I can fix that, etc?



**TL;DR is in bold.**
**If there are any questions, please ask.** "
1eh4pu,6,2013-05-16,I am new to saving/investing and just landed my first well-paying full time job: please critique my plan,pf_help,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1eh4pu/i_am_new_to_savinginvesting_and_just_landed_my/,"Hello PF!  

I just completed my PhD and am about to start working.  Up until now my income has been nearly equivalent to my spending (with the exception of a brief stint with a very well-paying internship), and thus I have little experience with saving money.  I am **27 years old** and have $0 in retirement savings, an **emergency fund (checking account) of $12,000**, and (thankfully) **no debt**.

I am hoping you can lend some insight and critique my savings plan based upon the goals I have outlined below.  I sincerely appreciate your input, pf.

---Long Term Goal---

My goal (which is admittedly a moving target) is to be **semi-retired by 55**.  If I am lucky, I think I would like to switch to a light teaching schedule at a local college when I reach 55 in order to provide steady income and keep my mind active.  Until then, I expect to work in industry.

---Near-Term Goal---

I would like to get married within a couple years, and **buy a house within 3-5 years**.  I have done some initial research and think I can find a home around $150,000-$200,000 for starting a family which I will be very happy with.  I will assume for the sake of planning that we will be starting a family in 5-6 years. 

---Relevant Info---

My **base salary is $99,000** with annual bonuses that **add another 8%-12%**.  Since I have no retirement savings right now, I want to be somewhat aggressive in saving for retirement.  My plan is to contribute **6% to traditional 401k*** (company matches full up to 3%) and **use the yearly bonus to max out an IRA**.

Regarding an IRA, I apologize for my ignorance on the subject, but my knowledge of investments and retirement plans are fairly lacking (I have begun reading the investment books recommended in the FAQ, though!).  I am **not sure if the 28% tax bracket is so high that I should avoid a Roth IRA**, or if I can safely assume taxes will be higher in the future.  I also know there is a ""phase-out"" range for IRA contributions when AGI&gt;$112,000.  Since my base+bonus could fall near that range, is this something I need to account for (and if so, how?)?

---Allocation of post-tax savings---

My initial thought for **IRA allocation is 80/20 stock/bond index through Vanguard, allocating 10% to an international stock index**.

I am planning to fill out the W-4 withholding 0 allowances this year.  I know I have seen here and in investment books that this isn't so smart an idea, since I am giving an interest free loan to the government, but I would much rather Uncle Sam owe me than me owe him (at least for this first year).

That said, I am **estimating my monthly take home** (before accounting for medical insurance) **to be $5,000**.  I know I can **save at least $1,850 per month**, and balance the other 63% of take home pay between Needs and Wants.  I suspect I am overestimating my needs and wants, but since I am moving to a new state (with slightly higher cost of living) and have new expenses to worry about, I am taking a conservative approach for now.

I would like to **bolster my emergency fund up to ~$18,000**.  Right now I think savings accounts' apy are too low to warrant a transfer of my emergency fund from checking, but I will revisit this plan if savings accounts improve.

After the emergency fund, I think my focus should be on saving for a house.  If my timeline is no earlier than 3 years, I think a **money market (VMMXX) with low risk** is my best bet.  After accounting for the allocation of my bonus to max my IRA, the remainder of the annual bonus plus monthly savings should allow me to **save $24,000 per year** (to be more precise: $18,000 for this first year after accounting for the emergency fund bump, and then $24,000 annually in the future).

I should therefore be able to afford a 20% down payment on a $150,000 house plus 40% for closing costs and whatnot in two years.  I am assuming closer to 3 years before buying a house since I want to have the ability to look at homes up to $200,000 while staying within my budget.

---Closing Comments---

Okay, pf, I know I just essentially tried to outline my whole life here, but for anyone that actually read through my wall of text, I sincerely appreciate your time and any criticisms or recommendations regarding my plan.  I am new to planning for my future and want to be responsible about it.

Also, please let me know what books or resources you may recommend I focus on to enhance my financial knowledge.  So far, thanks to the FAQ sidebar, I read Suze Orman's Young, Fabulous and Broke.  I am also halfway done with the Boglehead's Guide to Investing.

[xpost from /r/insanityworkout],[deleted],loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1eh3la/to_the_girl_at_my_internship_xpost_from/,"To the girl at my internship. This is now the third summer we've been working together. We were pretty flirty the first time around when we first met, but I was committed to another girl. You didn't know it, but she broke my heart in the fall and ran off with who I thought was my best friend. I took it pretty hard and started eating the pain. It was only a few pounds at first, but it didn't get better.
It got worse.
What was just 10 pounds became 20. Which became 30. Which is now 40 pounds heavier. It may not seem like a lot to some, but I have a small frame with nowhere for the fat to spread out. A healthy varsity soccer player now can no longer even play a full intramural game because of the exhaustion.
Grades slipped along with confidence in myself and my abilities. The second summer came around and there we were again. Except this time, I didn't even have the courage to look you in the eyes or even talk to you. Ashamed at what has become of me.
I had a losing mentality. Illness plagued me. Body became weak. Along with a troubled household, the only thing that gave me comfort was food. Always there in the fridge. Mountain Dew became my best friend and helped me ignore the piling homework and the fighting.
And here is the third summer. Came by in a heartbeat. And here you are again, gorgeous as always. Unchanging. Just like me.
But I did change.
I wasn't always like this. And so I started insanity. I'm on my third week. I don't exactly see results, but I feel it. I feel like I'm working towards something again. Like I'm fighting back. Like the Boston Bruins, I'm coming back.
So to the girl at my internship. Thank you. I'm not doing this for you. Or for that matter, any girls like you. I'm doing this for me. To get back what I have lost. To get back into the confident, aspiring, happy person I used to be. I will dig deeper. I will prevail.
And you can too.
If you are reading my story, thank you. If you are in the same situation as me, just know you aren't alone. Keep at it. I will if you will.
To the girl at my internship, I'm going to talk to you again."
1eh2yx,1,2013-05-16,Was just told I have to get an implant. Help!,[deleted],Dentistry,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dentistry/comments/1eh2yx/was_just_told_i_have_to_get_an_implant_help/,"
I was just informed that I have to get an implant and have quite a few questions and concerns.

In about 2000 I busted out my 4 front teeth, resulting after years of surgeries[root canals] to 2 veneers and 2 crowns(two front teeth) well my gums around one of my crowns started receding about a year a half ago. I went to the dentist today and they did an x-ray of the tooth and saw that I have a large cavity in that tooth. He told me that inside of if is basically turning ""soft"" because the cavity eats away at the tooth. He said I don't feel it because I received a root canal. So there's my background story.

My questions are:

My dentist had said there was nothing much i could do to prevent this cavity because it was inside so who's fault was this? Should I just maybe use more mouth wash because that's the only thing that would clean maybe inside of it?

How much will this single implant cost? They were talking about fixing my other crown as well since they came out a little shorter than preferred.

I am going to a consultation with my dentist. I have read a little but about complications with surgeries and I want the best person to do it so I don't come across problems. So is a dentist out of the question? He seems very genuine and intelligent but would a oral surgeon or something else be a better idea?

What's the chances that this doesn't work in some way? I just worry because i have perfect teeth now and I don't want to be imperfect for the rest of my life.

How long do I have to wear the fake tooth? I saw you have to wear a retainer with a fake tooth on it and I am just about to graduate college and have an internship this summer where I really need to look good and I'm scared missing this tooth and my tooth possibly popping out will just kill my confidence. So how legit do the retainer teeth look, will anyone notice?

How often will I need to get new crowns?

All in all how long until i look normal again? And will I look normal?!

Thanks in advance r/Dentistry!"

**She** - insecure, daddy issues, prone to negativity and stress

**Me** - Jealous, insecure (I think?), evaluating my ability to listen and treat others well

**The reason for the breakup** - she believed I did not show her enough affection. I believed I was showing affection through support and positivity (helped her with homework, essays, internships, resumes, ambition). This led to an imbalance where we were asking for/giving different things.

After the breakup, I tried desperately to tell her that I was willing to work on everything. I tried to tell her that I was willing to get better and change because I love her. We had several serious discussions where I laid out everything I knew I did wrong, how I wanted to fix each one, and I put away all of what I believed she could do to improve the relationships, giving away my self-value and worth. Each time I was met with responses like ""I don't want you to change to love me, I just want to be loved"" and ""we're not meant to be"".

After three weeks, in the middle of my recovery from a break up, she contacts me, asking me how I am and telling me that she cried the first day she got to Egypt (internship that I helped her get) due to loneliness. I feel like I'm being strung along... getting friend zoned by an ex. I can't provide that kind of support and not be in the relationship - it's not fair to me and I need to move on. I make a mental note that the next time she seeks support from me, I would tell her that I still want to be with her, to give her support. If not, then we have to be in No Contact. 

A few days later, she reaches out again, and I tell her that. And here's where it gets really messed up for me. I find out she got really close to a friend she met while we were dating after we broke up. They saw each other 10 times in the immediate 2 weeks. I don't know how much more ""leapfrogging"" that can get. She slept with him within two weeks and Skypes with him in Egypt. I have issues with jealousy in the past. I am not a nervous, uptight, or high-strung guy, but the jealousy that came from this was absolutely *debilitating*. I couldn't breathe and couldn't think straight for three days. It made me question everything that I believed about myself - what my personality was, what my flaws were, what my worth was...

She came back 3 days after I found out, saying ""I forgive you for everything that happened in the relationship. I realize now that the positivity you gave me in the relationship is really important to me, and I want that positivity in my life."" 

**Here's where I need you, r/rels.** I love this girl and I have a desire... I have the NEED to love her and take care of her. But I just can't seem to get past the guy she jumped to IMMEDIATELY after. Thought its technically not cheating, to me it's *effectively* cheating, as I feel the same loss of trust, respect... the same absolutely gut wrenching feeling that I'm optional/replaceable, and I feel guilty for giving away my self worth even in the process. If we had done NC, it would have been fine - she's out of my life. But am I wrong to say that this feels like infidelity if she knew she still loved me, missed me, and might want to get back together with me? Am I just being irrational? Should I let this go and give it another shot?

**tl;dr I tried many times to get back together with a girl. After finding out she banged another dude, I decided to move on. Three days later she wants to get back together... but... she banged that dude...and I can't seem to get past it.**

I graduated with a degree in math, and I decided that I would teach myself computer science to get a job as a software developer. I found out that it is pretty tough to break into the industry after I didn't even get a call back on my resume for internships.

I have a general idea of what I want to do, which includes a short QA session and a project where you help me mainly by reviewing my code. This will require a small time commitment of about 5 hours or less over 4 weeks. I got accepted to go to Texas State, but I really wanted to avoid the expensive university education especially since I already taught myself. I would not mind compensating someone for their time.

I graduated with honors with bachelors degree in mathematics, and after taking several computer science courses, I learned that I have a natural intuition for software. I took free online courses from Princeton, Stanford, and MIT, and I also used any resource I could find ranging from wikipedia, textbooks, and blog posts. My experience with coding is mostly small, simple programs and reading source code for some open source projects. I am confident that I have a solid understanding of computer science, but I lack the crediblity to create software that is up to a professional level.

I was hoping to get an internship for the summer, but I did not have much luck since most employers include a requirement for being currently enrolled at a university. On a CV, internships play the role of providing references and verification of professional experience, so after thinking about it for a while, I came up with this idea. I am really excited to take all the theoretical knowledge that I have and begin applying it to the real world.

1eflqo,3,2013-05-16,19 year old confused about financial situation. How/where do I rein in the expenses?,ardeur,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1eflqo/19_year_old_confused_about_financial_situation/,"Hi, I'm having trouble analyzing my financial situation and am hoping that PF will be able to help. 


Sophomore in college. Tuition, room/board (campus housing), and a very basic cell phone are 100% paid for by scholarships and my parents.  I will graduate debt-free. I pay for all other expenses (food, textbooks, leisure activities, etc). I go to college in the city, so public transportation paid for by tuition.


**INCOME**: I've made $5-6k each summer for three years. This summer I will earn $8k+ from an internship and tutoring. I worked all throughout high school. I don't work anymore during college.  Since I've always had a lot of money to spend on frivolous things, I've developed bad spending habits. I just don't understand how much things should cost. How much do I spend on food, clothes, entertainment, travel?


According to mint, this is my total spending this year:

* Food: $1038 or $207.60/month.
* Travel: $1155 (spring break)
* Entertainment/shopping/misc: $628 or $125.60/month


So the entire sum of my spendings from January to today is $2821. Not counting spring break, I am spending $333.20 per month. Presently, I have just above $3k in my saving account. I forecast my end-of-the-year spendings to be $6500 at *most*.


 I think that I am in a very lucky financial position right now, but learning to budget would be a good skill to have by the time I graduate because I wouldn't be able to live such a frivolous lifestyle then. At the same time, I look at how much leeway I have right now and it's just so confusing to decide what to cut out. So my questions are basically:


* Can personalfinance offer any advice on how I should think or assess  my financial situation? 
* What is a normal spending plan? 
* What short-term or long-term goals should I consider? 
* What potential problems should I plan for?

Any help or advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you!"

I didn’t want to apply to university in my birth town but I did for just in case. The either the 2 university I applied in my city are both my ideal and dream school.

The past 4 years of my damn high school I dedicated as much time as I can to obtaining the best grade I in order to enter the business program in either of the 2 universities here.  I don’t have the best grades around but I’m averaging between 84-86% at the moment (at the time I applied I had around 88%.  Yea I know I don’t meet up with my damn Asian stereotypes with my grades but whatever. I had an okay extracurricular profile with some volunteering and internships. The 2 local university admission average was around 83-84% where as the other one is around a low 80%.

I got rejected officially from both of these two universities for the business program (I got into Arts in to one of them). But, I did get accepted in my first choice in my birth town.  What makes me upset is that I wasn’t good enough to enter the universities of my dream. I do not want to go back to my back to birth town and study there (it is so boring and I have no friends and hardly any real family that I can there as most of my immediate family moved here).

I’m angry how you know when people apply out of their city/province/state it is for better or more prestigious program or they want it, but the thing is that I do not want it.  I can't go into Arts since it would be useless to me (and transferring internally is quite difficult/competitive and I don’t want to risk the chance what if I get rejected again from my transfer)  and have no choice but to go back the city my family left. 

Yea I admit I live in a quite competitive city of Vancouver. But, I’m frustrated, it’s not like my grades are so low that I should go to some small College here. I’m not a smart student but I studied hard to hope for the best and during that time I gave up on a lot with friendships and doing stuff I wanted try out. These rejections show that I ain’t good enough and I find it embarrassing that I have to move back to the middle of now where to next province to me, I hate it.

Last summer I was raped and it's been extremely hard on me and made my depression much worse (its runs in my family. my dad killed himself and so did his mom). However, I didn't cut like I used to. I have not cut once this semester. I am ok.

I ended an extremely unhealthy relationship, borderline abusive, actually. It was one of the hardest things I've ever done, but I didn't go back to him and now I see how mean and horrible he is. 

I got serious about my studies and future career. I started talking to one of my profs and she wrote me an awesome letter of recommendation and invited me to a luncheon at the state house with her and 2 other students she invited. 

I got an internship in DC for 2015.

I started volunteering at an animal shelter.

I met my uncle who I haven't seen since my dads funeral a decade ago and he learned about me and we started talking.

I got the nerve to text this amazing guy I've known for 2 years, but always thought he was out of my league. Next week if our 2 month anniversary :)

And, today, I found out I made a 4.0 this semester. All A's. Through all of this.

I am so proud of myself and I just wanted to share with you ladies. Sorry if this is irrelevant, but I feel so empowered right now and like I can take on the world. I plan to keep making a 4.0 from here on out, so that I can raise my cumulative GPA from a 3.34 to as high as I can get it. I want to volunteer more places. I want to graduate with honors and apply to law school. I also plan on staying in this healthy relationship with a guy who truly loves me and would never do anything to hurt me, emotionally or physically.

1efat3,2,2013-05-15,I'm so scared,longdist21,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/1efat3/im_so_scared/,"(21/M) Just finished my Junior year of College. Met a great girl (20/F) in January, we hit it off really well. We started dating a week after we met and eventually decided to make it official around March. Just before we made it official, I got a job offer from a prestigious company in my field (Engineering). This position is set to last for 12 months, meaning I'll have to take next year off college. My position will be close to her hometown but around 170 miles away from college. I accepted the job and we talked about doing long distance and she agreed that she wanted to go through with it.

We started doing long distance about 3 weeks ago since I moved out to work and I feel very lonely. I'm so scared about the future because I feel like I've tried to do too many things way out of my comfort zone. This will be the first time in my life that I have legitimately lived on my own in a big city. I have no friends here and no support group and I won't have her here with me.

We are only a 2-3 hour drive away so I am grateful in that regard but I worry that she will be so busy in her Senior year studying (She's trying to become a Doctor so will be applying to Med School) and being around other people that she will forget about me.

I wake up every morning and I have this overwhelming anxiety where I think ""What the hell have I gotten myself into?"" Not only in regards to my relationship with her, but also this job and new life experience.

This is my first proper intern job at an engineering company and I realize how much of an incredible opportunity it is, but part of me just wants to quit immediately and get the fuck out of here so that I can spend another year in college with the girl I care about, rather than having to do long distance. I worry that things won't work out between us during my job and I'll come back to my finish my last year of college with her gone and just painful memories of what could have been. I don't want her to slip away. I don't know how to be strong.

I haven't talked to her about an end date to our long distance because I personally feel it's a little too early, but it would most likely be 2 years from now. I keep fantasizing about how short those 2 years are gonna be and how everything will be fine but then anxiety hits me and I fear for the worst.

Jesus christ I'm such a mess."

So, my case is kindda complicated to get a job.

First, I can't get a job that is not related to my major(Which is Dramatic arts) because I'm an international student on a program called OPT. (Also I only have a year to work in the US)

Second, I need to get a job or internship or apprenticeship that pays so I can live on it. 

So basically I'm looking for apprenticeship places that offers a job for a year, gives housing and pays a little so I can eat and survive. 
I live in California Davis but I'm thinking of everywhere in America.

My area is acting, singing, crew, props, set design and scenic painting.

Where would be a good place to go?
And how on earth do I look for places with housing and money?

1ejc3x,0,2013-05-17,A few quick newbie question (19M),[deleted],OkCupid,https://www.reddit.com/r/OkCupid/comments/1ejc3x/a_few_quick_newbie_question_19m/,"Hi guys, thinking about making an OKC for shits and giggles. I just got back college and my current SO/hook up buddy is across the country now. I've never done the online thing because it kind of feels 'sad' and that I might be ashamed if anyone found out I had a profile. I have a few questions though.

How discrete is OKC? Are you using your real name or do you create a username? Do jobs search through your OKC profile (I'm trying to intern at some very large companies that do background checks). I really don't want someone to start saying that I used an online dating site because that's pretty damn embarassing for people my age (which is stupid because online dating only makes it easier to meet people who are mutually attracted).

I'm 19 and I'm an attractive male, do women tend to look for only older guys? I mean I've never had a problem hitting it off with women my age but I feel like OKC is only used by older females. And from my experience, females want nothing to do with guys if they're even 12 months younger. Hell, I can't even legally drink (although i'm 21 in Arizona though.. eh ;)? How does that come off?

I've been hooking up with a girl from college for the past 6 months.. is this morally wrong? In the last month or two we've pretty much settled exclusively, but the months before I was hooking up with other girls (she hooked up here or there I believe, not frequently). I don't know what's going to happen next year with her, but I'm not ready to settle in a relationship. I'm just afraid she'll find out that I used online dating in the summer and for her to get pissed.

1ej7vk,5,2013-05-17,I hate doctors,beaniepie,BabyBumps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/1ej7vk/i_hate_doctors/,"**TL:DR** I met my OB for the first time and do not like her but apparently I'm not allowed to switch.

I just had my first appointment with the OB my family doctor referred me to on Tuesday and I was just unhappy with her. I found her to be very condescending and treating me like I was dumb and honestly, I was rather offended. She also had a med intern there, which was a surprise to me. Some people might be ok with it, but I'd rather not have an intern there and feel like a case study as she pauses every 5 mins to explain things to the intern. 

Basically, there are 11 OBs who work in that group at the hospital. You only regularly see one but could potentially have any of the 11 on the day of the birth, just whoever happens to be working that day (as in, your OB will not try to come in that day if that day is not on their regular schedule). I don't like it but fine, if that's the way it has to be. Anyway, I called my family doctor and asked to be referred to a different OB in the group but apparently they can't do that because if you've seen one already, another one won't see you. 

That's absolutely ridiculous to me. I don't want two OBs. I want a different one because I had a negative experience. I saw her one time and now I can't switch? I asked if I could be at the other hospital (thankfully I live in an area that has more than one) where it's a group of OBs and you see them all so hopefully this works out. I'm actually more ok with that. At least I get to meet them all.

Either way, I didn't want an OB at all. ALL the midwiferies were full and I'm on waiting lists for all in my area. I'm just getting really frustrated because I feel like I have no choices. Not my first, which was a midwife, not my second, which would be a great OB who is actually there on the day of the birth. I'm so not liking the idea of not having the same person who provides prenatal care not being there at the birth (which is why I wanted a midwife to begin with). I understand if they had to be away on vacation, but there would only be a small chance of that... Not a 2/11 chance, depending on their schedule. 

Why do people think Canadian healthcare is something special? So very frustrated..."
1ej2yh,9,2013-05-17,"I don't know who to turn to, am I still in an emotionally abusive relationship?",[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1ej2yh/i_dont_know_who_to_turn_to_am_i_still_in_an/,"Let me start by saying that I am at one of the lowest points in my life and I don't know what to do.  I am 22 years old and about to graduate from college and I have been with the same guy (24) on and off for almost two years.  

When I first met him, I was strong and fiercely independent.  I loved life.  I was excited to go to school every morning.  I had been working out and eating healthy.  I had the internship of my dreams.  I met this guy and he was gorgeous and he seemed like he was really interested in me.  We were both talking to other people in the beginning, but we ended up being exclusive.  Whenever we went out together, if someone hit on me, he would call get angry.  He would say that they were only looking at my boobs and that I was a slut.  He hated that I had male friends.  He never had friend girls and he started getting closer to them to make me jealous.  Eventually, I stopped talking to my best friends and he just continued.

I have caught him on several occasions talking to other girls on Facebook.  Once over Christmas break and once on my birthday telling them that he wanted to see them and that he was sorry he couldn't.  He said that he would ""make it up to them"" which he always used to say to me.  He got a DUI and I ended up driving him everywhere.  

He got mad and he hit me.  We were both drunk but I remember him pulling my hair and dragging me across the house.  Then, he bagged up my things and he threw them on the porch and I ran and hid behind a bush and I cried until he found me.  He didn't apologize, he just asked, ""Are you going to tell all your friends that I am some evil guy now?  Are we never going to talk again?""  And I told him that I wouldn't mention it again.

We were supposed to take a trip to Paris, I had bought our tickets.  His parents said that he couldn't go (his parents are a little bit crazy) and we got into big fights about it because we had talked about it for so long.  We eventually broke up.  He slept with another girl the week that we were supposed to be in Paris.  He decided to go on a boys trip to Myrtle Beach instead and he invited an old fling. 

We ended up getting back together.  I blocked his number but it didn't go through AT&amp;T for some reason and he called everyday and texted and apologized saying that he would change and that he could never be happy without him.  I broke down sobbing and took him back.  

His parents are both irrational and controlling and he manipulates them the same way that he manipulates me.  My dad is absent and my mom is emotionally and was extremely physically abusive.  He has had terrible relationships where his exes have cheated on him and had abortions.  I am no saint either.  I hit him after I found out he slept with another girl.  We have physically fought several times.  

The past few months have been different.  He graduated before me and all of his friends are gone.  We have spent practically everyday together.  He just moved for a job (hundreds of miles away) and I was trying to see him.  I know that I am being impatient and he gets angry with me when I ask when I can visit because he has to run it by his parents who do not like guests.  I freaked out and called him over and over when he was visiting his cousin because I know they drink so heavily together and I got really insecure.  He got upset because he was trying to hang out with his family that he had no seen for a while so he has not spoken to me in 3 days.  He always does this when he gets upset and when I ask him if we can have a better line of communication, he dismisses me as crazy.  He says that I am too insane to deal with and he just needs to block me out when I am acting this way.  I was hospitalized twice for overdoses last summer.  I have never been a depressed person.  I was always so happy and motivated but for the past two years, I have felt absolutely defeated.  I don't know how to explain it but sometimes, it physically hurts.  Like my chest just aches from my sadness and I would do anything to make the pain go away.  It gets to the point sometimes that every minute feels like an hour.  I can barely sleep at night, I feel so anxious.  I feel like it was my fault this time.  I shouldn't have called him 5 times when he was hanging out with his cousin.  I should have just let him have his space and now he is ignoring me for days at a time...again.  I don't know who to turn to because I was such a burden last summer on my friends and they got so worried.  I have apologized just to get it over with but he is punishing me so that I don't act this way again.  I have tried leaving him before but it is so hard.  I feel even more depressed without him.

edit: I am so tired of fighting.  I am so tired of feeling sad.  I just want everything to be okay."

Kind of a long story short but I'll give you the **tl;dr** version. Went to college for Computer Technology, got an internship in the UNIX/AIX department with very little Linux experience. Through the summer I learned a lot and worked hard so they offered me a job right out of college (hell yea) so I had to take it. Now being with the company for over a year I know a lot of the basics of a UNIX/Linux, but I've felt like I've been a little cheated. How I learned was people showing me what to do, and from there I kind of had to guess why it happened and why it worked that way, think of it as reverse  learning.  Now that I've gotten more into UNIX (it's really catching on to me) I would like to go back to the ""roots""  and start over and learn the OS from the ground up. 



So from reading/hearing a lot of cool stuff that people are doing with their raspberry pi's I think it would be a great opportunity form me to tinker around with Linux and learn a little more in depth knowledge about Linux and even about programming.



Well I just found out that Micro Center sells them, I work about 5 minutes away from one. So I'm going to jump right in and get my feet wet. I was just wondering what the most basic essentials I will need to run it, and if anyone has any good recommendations. I heard that you should buy multiple SD cards so have for different projects, I think I'm just going to start off with one for now. But I have my computer monitor and TV that I plan on working on it with. I have a mechanical light-up keyboard, should I be worried about the power consumption of it? I have two 10 feet HDMI cables laying around. Might pick up a USB flash drive for more storage. I have multiple USB power cables and wall plugs from my android phones I own.  I'm just not sure if I've over looked anything.



So if you could any advice or recommendations would be great!


Oh and I forgot to add I would like to pick everything up from Micro Center, unless there is a big price difference or better technology that I can buy somewhere else. "

article code 85230150609THG

This blog was written by Alexa Sibio, of North Caldwell, who is a staff accountant at Smolin Lupin who completed her first tax season this year. 
April 16 is a day that will live in infamy. People who are not in the accounting industry figure April 15 is a much more significant day, but I just completed my very first tax season at Smolin Lupin and, as an accountant, I can tell you April 16 feels as if I finally crossed the finish line.
During my studies at Montclair State University, I interned at Turner Construction Company in New York City over the course of three years. My internship was very exciting and I was able to learn a lot about the profession, however, I never worked a tax season at an accounting firm.Sure, I heard a lot about the challenges from my professors, but I never gave it too much thought. I am an extremely focused person who is unafraid of hard work, so I figured, ""How bad can it be?""Needless to say, I now realize I slightly underestimated the situation.
There is no point in trying to detail the long hours, fast-paced and intense environment of an accounting agency in tax season, because the only way to fully grasp it is to experience it for yourself.Still, if I had to describe it, it felt like I started a marathon in February and then in March I had to sprint uphill until mid-April.  Yet tax season wasn’t the monotonous grind of a marathon, there were surprises as well, such as the old adage ""communication is key."" It is critical to keep everyone who is involved with a particular engagement updated on the status of the job.However, communication with the client is just as important as communication within the firm. At Smolin, our policy is to keep the client happy and I do whatever it takes to meet that requirement. It sounds easy, but keeping everyone informed of what you’re doing, while everyone is sprinting uphill to complete a marathon is a real challenge, especially when juggling multiple tasks at once.   
They say it takes over your life. I suppose the moment I realized my life had been completely taken over by busy season was a rare weekend afternoon when I was relaxing at home. I picked up a tabloid figuring my brain could use a little fluff and started reading a piece on ""who wore it best."" Midway through the article, I caught myself calculating how much of a write off these dresses would be, what tax code would apply and what I needed to be careful of in their return.I conceded defeat, threw the magazine out and decided a bowl of ice cream was the best mental relaxation.Tax season is a really challenging experience. I learned a lot and contributed to Smolin Lupin’s clients and the firm as a whole. And dare I say I’m actually looking forward to next tax season. I’ll be working with a great group of colleagues, superb mentors and, perhaps, a recent graduate in their first tax season, uphill marathon sprint.

1ei3tp,0,2013-05-17,I'm not sure I [21m] should stay with my on and off girlfriend [20f],[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ei3tp/im_not_sure_i_21m_should_stay_with_my_on_and_off/,"I'm just going to call her my girlfriend to make it easier. 

We've been dating on and off since grade 11, and it's now the end of our 3rd year of university, for a total of 5 years.

As it currently stands I'm in Computer Engineering at one of the best Universities in Canada and she lives in the same town as me but is in Early Childhood Education at a different university. If you can't figure out by our problems - we're both totally unable to meet members of the opposite sex.

Our story goes like this: I met her back in grade 11 English class. She was the quiet short Brazilian girl that sat beside me. As I began to know her more, she revealed that she had a long distance relationship with some disabled guy who lived in England. It mostly seemed like she only dated him because she was lonely and I ended up convincing her to break up with him so that I could date her. 

We were sort of in different social groups, I was always somewhat popular and she was always hanging around with the quiet asian kids. My friends always told me that I should dump her because I'm too attractive for her, and that she's not good enough for me. I mostly just dated her because I was extremely depressed and I didn't really like any of my ""friends"", but I really liked her. I stopped talking to a lot of my friends in order to date her. She was extremely quiet and not very ambitious or intelligent - she ended up with high 60s in high school, whereas I ended up with high 80s.

Despite all that that we dated without issue for about 2 years until university.

During first year university I basically lost interest after I started to meet girls who were much more attractive and had more in common with me. I slowly began telling a close friend of mine that I lost interest in her, and that I had developed feelings for other girls. He, of course, told her immediately. She eventually sent me an email saying that we should break up - and I felt oddly relieved for some reason.

I ended up hanging out with a few of the girls I liked but nothing really came of it. I became extremely depressed like how it was in high school and we ended up getting back together in February of 1st year (2011) after a few tough months.

We dated without issue until 2nd year, where I became extremely bored of her again. I met another girl who I found interesting through a mutual friend. I hung out with this mutual friend (female, no feelings) and the other girl a while before deciding that I liked her. I ended up breaking up with my girlfriend, drunk, at a bar in order to date this other chick. We made out a couple times, but I never really felt the spark that I felt with my girlfriend. It sort of never worked out with that chick. I also ended up sleeping with a friend of mines ex-girlfriend (long story). I ended up getting back together with my girlfriend in May of that year and had no issues until 3rd year.

tl;dr of the shit I said above: We broke up twice after I met other girls I liked more, but it never worked out with them.

When we got back together it never was as good as it was the first time. She always seemed disappointed. She ended up revealing that she had also slept with someone else and that she now had elevated sexual standards. As it turns out I have premature ejection issues (self diagnosis, don't judge me, fuck you) and I could never sexually please her in the same way that that guy did.

We broke up again during January of this year and just got back together recently. The issue is, we only have sex about once a month now, whereas it was a lot more before.

She's currently stressed out about a co-op placement she has, and I have a summer internship at a well-known tech firm which pays well. I see her several times a week but I feel like it's just not the same as it was before.

Long story short, whenever we're together we're miserable, but when we're apart we're even more miserable. I'm just wondering if these things will stabilize or if I should just dump ship and put up with being depressed for an undetermined amount of time before I find someone else. I've tried online dating to no avail, and none of my friends know any Women who I find attractive.

**tl;dr** Broke up with my girlfriend 3 times. Still dating her. Can't seem to meet any other women. Extremely depressed when I'm single. Shyness issues. Not sure what I should do. Obvious answer is break up again, but that never worked before.

Other shit I should mention: Her family and friends hate me. She told them I'm an asshole after the 1st and 2nd time we broke up, and now they won't talk to me. She also told a lot of my friends, so as it currently stands, I have zero high school friends I currently talk to besides her."

1ehlj6,1,2013-05-16,I want to move back to Columbus and get my life back on track but I don't know if it's even a possibility now.,[deleted],Columbus,https://www.reddit.com/r/Columbus/comments/1ehlj6/i_want_to_move_back_to_columbus_and_get_my_life/,"I don't know if this is something you guys care about frankly but I just want an opinion from a few of you guys who might.

Start of my story I guess. I am 20 years old. I grew up in a decent sized town called Parkersburg, WV. Every since I was in 7th grade I've battled a growing depression starting with a teacher who told me my goal of being an Aerospace Engineer was stupid and that I should look for something closer to home. I was a straight A student... until that point. I started slacking, not caring.

When I was in high school I didn't apply myself at all. I graduated with a 2.98, not because I didn't know the material, but because I had stopped caring. By that point I'd decided I wanted to be an IT because I had fallen in love with doing computer work. I took the ACT, nooked a 28, and landed a scholarship at DeVry.

After looking things over I decided I wanted to major in Computer Engineering. My aunt helped me land a job at SIS as an intern IT and I moved to Columbus. I got an apartment through DeVry with other students (they don't have housing). All was fine, I loved my job, I loved my classes.

I lived in that apartment for about 3 months. The roommates who at first seemed pretty cool turned out to be douchebags. They would just be general douchebags and then they would drink and smoke and turn into even worse douchebags. It finally got to the point where I couldn't handle it. I called the housing rep and talked to her about it and she moved me from Pickerington to Grove City to live with a different set of students.

These guys were really cool. I hung out with them a decent amount while I was at home and typically enjoyed there company. We had that one sketchy roommate that really bugged me though. He was never home when I was and just always seemed off. First I started noticing little things missing.

The night before Christmas break I got the last $50 out of my account so I could fill up my tank and go home to be with my family. I left that money under my keyboard while I went to work. When I got home from work that money was gone. The other 2 roommates had already left the weekend before that to be with their family and he was gone. I knew he had taken it. I had a friend drive all the way from the outskirts of Hilliard to give me gas so I could go back to WV to be with my family for Christmas.

Upon returning home after Christmas break I found that my laptop was gone. He had come home and taken a $1,200 laptop and ran off with it. I was furious. I packed all my shit and moved it to my cousins house over night whom I'd called as soon as I got home and found that. I called the next morning to tell the housing person that I was giving up and I was leaving their services. I spent all my extra money to break the lease and got out.

While this was happening in that apartment I was starting into programming classes. I decided that I hated programming with a passion and I wanted to just switch to an IT or Cisco program because that's what I enjoyed. Well DeVry didn't offer what I wanted so after finding out I had to ditch that apartment as well I decided that I would just find a different school to go to.

I was advised that Strayer University was a good school. I went and talked to them and everything seemed cool. I got classes scheduled and got to work taking only online classes that semester. Well I started getting calls from Strayer wanting me to pay so much money right then for this loan and what not. They continued to dick around with me and I knew I needed out before they ate all my money. I'm still getting calls from them trying to collect money that I shouldn't owe because of deferment.

At this point I gave up. I'd been living with my cousins for 6 months and had tried my hardest to find another place to live. I still had my job, which I loved and payed well. I was having no luck finding another place to live and I just finally decided I needed to move back home, go to WVUP (a branch off of WVU) and live around my old friends and family.

Bad idea. All of my good old friends are gone. The few that are still here never want to do anything anymore. My family has helped me out financially some when I need it but overall has just been driving me up the walls. They hound me constantly about not having a job. I've been applying literally everywhere. I either never get a reply or they refuse to work around a school schedule. I'm not happy. I've gotten myself into a slump where I don't have money and I can't do anything about it. I've had my phone shut off for several months and I recently shut off my internet.

I had a roommate for 2 months. She bailed on me a month ago without paying me the rent that she owed me from the month before (which her dad finally gave me a couple days ago) and without a notice. I was stuck, I only had the money planned out for half until my next set of student loans and the rest had been used doing things with my girlfriend.

I now realize that I made the worst decision in my life. I moved back home where I felt like I would feel comfortable and I let myself get to comfortable. I let my parents help me out here and there and lost all the motive that I had when I lived away and was completely fending for myself. I left a great job and all my great opportunities back in Columbus. I left the good friends that I had met and grown very fond of when I'd lived there.

At this point I realize that I should have probably just switched to OSU and stayed working at my old job. I left on very good terms and believe that I would have a high possibility of getting back on there. If not I feel as though I would be able to find something before I moved back up there because there are so many more job opportunities in the area. I need to be back to where I am forcing myself to hold a budget and I am fending for myself.

The major problem I have left is money... I have nothing. I have $15 and an empty gas tank. I have 2 months left on my lease and I owe my mother $165 for the utilities I couldn't pay this month. Even if I decided to do all this and I got a job lined up and classes scheduled I would be screwed trying to find a place to live. I don't have money for a deposit and I don't have money to pay out my lease here. 

So basically what I'm saying here is I don't know what to do. This isn't a plea for help, this isn't me begging for a couch to piggyback on, this isn't me trying to get a load off my chest (even though it kinda is helping xD). This is just me trying to get an opinion from some people who live in the area and are fairly well educated (I mean... it is Reddit) and have been through more than me.

TL:DR - I had shit luck with roommates here and there. I'm not happy with the direction I'm heading right now and I want to get back on a forward direction. I'm poor and I'm not sure if there is a way I can make this a reality. What should I do?"
1ehhss,0,2013-05-16,At the end of my rope,ThrowawayAccnt42,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1ehhss/at_the_end_of_my_rope/,"I'm not counting on hearing any responses that'll really help me at this point, but I'm at least hoping getting this off my chest will help a little.

I'm a 24 year old male, living in Chicago.  I've never had a job, I never went to college, I've never dated in my life or even been kissed on the cheek, and hell **I don't even know how to drive (which I'm so humiliated about, it kills me.  I lie to everyone that I have one, and I've cut off friendships for fear of them finding out).**  I'm stuck in a rut, and every day I'm more convinced that I'll never get out of it, and that my future holds nothing good.  I've been totally depressed for 10 years now, and I don't know where to even begin getting my life in order.  I've been plagued with horrible, horrible sleep problems for at least 20 years also, and I think that might be a major cause of it.

I spent several years after high school pursuing a career in Audio Engineering.  I realize now I was very half-hearted about it and didn't do ANYWHERE NEAR as much as I should have, due to depression and no motivation for the last 10 years.  But it wasn't until after about 3 years of self-studying that I started emailing audio school graduates and studios and everyone I could for advice or even an internship, that I had a big wake-up call and learned how absurdly lucky you have to be to ever have a stable job in that field nowadays, even if you're extremely talented, which I'm not.  **So I wasted a few years and am left with 100% unmarketable skills.**

I think half the reason I pursued that career in the first place is because I dread that daily question of ""So what do you do?"" to the point I get sick to my stomach.  I just wanted to live my life with something cool I could answer with, and what better than a field that combines technology with creativity, two things I've always been good with.  But now I'm to the point where I put off even getting a haircut, or cancel dentist appointments, anything I can to to avoid that god damn small talk question I get asked every time I leave my house.  I just never know what to say, aside from ""Nothing."" and it kills me.  **[[If anything, I'm hoping someone can atleast give me a little advice as to how to answer this question.  I know it sounds stupid, but it makes me feel like I've been punched in the stomach every someone asks.  And it's the first thing everyone always asks.]]**

I haven't had a social life in years.  **My last and best friend actually got me a job at a museum a few years ago, and we were going to carpool, but just before I was going to start, she was killed in a car accident.**  She'd planned to introduce me to all her friends there, but after that I just couldn't face meeting them with her gone, so I turned down the job.  I haven't really had a friend, or applied to a job since.

**I live in a disaster of a hoarder house, I don't even have my own room, I sleep on a couch now.**  My mom got a hoarding problem after she was given 2 years to live from cancer (which she made a full recovery from, though we still live in fear), and sold all her things and antique book collection only to regret it.  Now with my mom living with my grandparents (because of their failing health) and my dad always working and being a raging alcoholic when he's home, I'm trapped in this disaster of a house most people wouldn't even find livable.  I've spent the last few years just on my computer for almost every waking hour, trying to distract myself with movies, games and more recently books, in this crowded hoarder room so packed with stuff you can't even see the walls.  **I have anxiety fits when I'm trying to sleep, just over paranoia of my PC crashing one day (which i know is inevitable), and how much of a nightmare that would be to fix, as I'd have nothing left to do, and not even anywhere to sit aside from at the computer desk.**  Simply getting a single blue screen is enough to make me throw up with worry, and it takes a few days of no problems for me to relax again.

I've seen doctors, but they didn't help, at best.  **One increased my Zoloft prescription again and again, and finally told me to stop taking it entirely.**  I went through such bad withdrawal that I ended up in a hospital after a suicide attempt.  I see now he was a horrible doctor (and I've seen other bad doctors since then), and I don't even know where to begin looking for a good doctor, or even what kind of doctor to see.  A shrink, a psychiatrist, a psychologist, a sleep specialist?  I lose my health insurance in 4 months anyway though, so I suppose it doesn't matter.  I've been so depressed for so long, I feel like it's a permanent part of my personality and my way of thinking.

I'm not suicidal, but I can't help but think it's inevitable I reach that point.  This can't last forever, and I don't see light at the end of the tunnel.  Though I am plagued with awful, suicidal dreams about twice a week, that just kill me.  I've started drinking excessively the last few months, and smoking pot the last few weeks just to be able to get to sleep before sunrise, which I can rarely manage even on 48-hours awake.  **I couldn't even get myself out of bed to get my mom a mother's day card**, who I'm very close to but only see once a week at best.  She's probably more stressed and depressed than I am, having to take care of her dying parents every day, and I think she's starting to crack.

I constantly worry myself sick over so many things, that I couldn't even begin to list here.  **Even if I could find a job right now, and had a way of transportation, I don't think I could handle even part time.  And at this point, I just can't see myself ever enjoying life enough to work hard at it.**  I have no one to turn to, and I just don't know what to do.  Doctors didn't work out for me whatsoever.  My life is going so by so fast, and I can hardly stomach the idea of growing old, not to mention wasting my entire youth.  I'm taking such bad care of my health now, and part of the reason is because I really don't want to live past 60.  I don't think I could handle it.  I'm not suicidal, don't get me wrong, but I feel like my parents are the only thing I have left, and I'm just waiting for a time when even they're gone so I can end it.  

Nearly every single day, something bad happens, and I have yet another worry added to the pile.  Failing health in the family, the house falling apart.  **Electrical and cable problems, but the house is such a mess technicians can't get to the walls.**  There's so much more I wanted to mention, but I could easily triple this post, so I'm gonna stop here...  I just don't know... how to even begin making things a little better... I'm lost, and I feel like the only person in the world this pathetic. =[

**tl;dr: I'm 24, no college education, never had a job or a girlfriend, don't know how to drive, live in a hoarder house with an alcoholic father, I have no bedroom and sleep on a couch, have no friends and nowhere to go, so I spent all my waking hours on my computer in a crowded hoarder room, trying to distract myself.  Doctors and medication made me worse, I'm about to lose my insurance anyway.  I'm plagued with suicidal dreams on the rare times I can sleep.  Developing an alcohol and marijuana habit.  Family members are dying, the house is falling apart, I have no future, no plan, no hopes.**

Edit: Feel free to ask me anything.  I don't expect any replies to help, but I actually enjoy answering questions."

I'm working a 10-8 (like 9-5, but a little worse...) and I don't have much time off to go anywhere. My only travel experiences so far have been 3 months in Italy for an internship during school, and two visits to small towns in Mexico (in Guanajuato and Puebla).

I have minimal student loans, only $8,000 left. Other expenses are rent, phone, and car ($16,000). With my budget, I've been saving $500 a month while paying off all my loans and debts.

My one and only goal is to pay everything off, save up a bit of money, and travel. I live frugally, and I don't have many possessions, and I'm even less attached to the ones I have (except musical instruments).

I want to travel, but I don't know anyone who does. Debt and loans are a CONSTANT daily thought in my mind. I don't want to go anywhere or do anything until they're paid off and I'm 100% free. Except for small trips, hiking, camping, little road trips, which I do when I can.

So I'm wondering about all of you...are you traveling with debt? Is it something you do when you have free time, then go back home and get a job? Am I going about this the right way? I want to live and experience life to the fullest, but I don't want anything weighing me down.

Translated using google translator.

An internal battle has shaken Labour and Social Services. It began with a missing handshake and ended with a written warning and damages of 30,000 kronor.

A trainee, directed by People's University, offered an internship in the integration unit. He came to visit to see the work and health of the employees.

But the visit was not developed as expected. When the female supervisor would welcome health intern, he refused to take her in hand. He referred to their religious beliefs that forbid him to take women in hand without having to wash up afterwards.

The female supervisor then announced the intern that he, in order to work at the workplace, must be able to take all the people in place. Possibility of subsequent hand washing is, so it should not be a problem, she said.

The trainee could not accept the decision and the Equality Ombudsman was connected. But before a notification could be established paid Trollhättan city paid 30 000 in damages. The female supervisor was awarded a written warning for violating the Trollhättans urban diversity.

Administration Said Niklund never hesitated before measures.

- The applicant explained that his religion forbade him to foreign women in hand. Based on the correct position, a person adversely affected by their religion entitled to damages. We made a mistake and took responsibility and the person received compensation.

Said Niklund refers to Trollhättan urban Equality and Diversity Plan, which was introduced at the beginning of the year.

- Indirect discrimination may be perceived as neutral but disadvantageous groups in practice, if one condition, he says, and points out that the trainees were disadvantaged because of their religion.

- He would get the internship provided that he takes women in hand. This was conditional internship placement.

Unable situation is solved in a different way than the warning to the supervisor and a large compensation?

- We had a dialogue with the trainee to repair the damage, for example with another internship. But the damage was already done.

One who does not think the issue is that simple is Lennart Andersson, former chairman of the Municipal Trollhättan. The last case before retiring was the missing handshake.

- I've never seen anything like it, he says and continues.

- One must ask the question of who has been wronged. In this case, it was not just the man but also the woman.

From the union's side tried to get the employer to not hand out a warning. The hearing ended in disagreement but Lennart Andersson thinking on.

- There are many questions. What is required to be available for work? Can you refuse to do certain things, and if so what?

Henrik Larsson, MWU new chairman, explains that the warning to the female supervisor does not have to mean anything.

- The employer may distribute a written warning although we are protesting. The burden of proof is not great. However, if the employer wants to proceed with other steps, then weigh the burden heavier.

The problems of integration unit now becomes the subject of a safety investigation.

- It has been created such anxiety in the working group to the senior safety has been switched on, says Henrik Larsson.

I am a recent college grad (2 weeks ago! Whoo!) that has moved back home to Tulsa to attend the OSU-Tulsa campus for graduate school. 

These student loans aren't going to pay themselves back, so I am looking for a full/part time position, preferably in the metro Tulsa area. I've been using the traditional newspaper and craigslist routes, but i figured it wouldn't hurt to reddit network a little bit!

I have substantial experience in receptionist/clerical work, having done both for the past two years in work study positions at my university. I'd love to do more work in this area but I am open to other opportunities in any other areas you might be aware of.

I'm courteous, professional, and extremely technology proficient. I did well in school (graduated magna cum laude) and have done both retail sales and non-profit internships to round out my professional background. 

I can offer receptionist work, data entry, knowledge of Microsoft Office Suite, filing, multi-line phone use, and any other kind of office work that might be needed. If it's not something I know how to do already, I will be eager to learn. 

I'd be happy to supply you with my resume upon request. If you know of any opportunities I could look into, I would be very appreciative.

I'm living at home while taking time off from college, and I got a job at a restaurant for the months that I'm home because I love cooking and I figured it would be something better to do than sitting on my ass all day feeling sorry for myself.  It's been a rough two months, but I think I've been getting a lot better.  

My boss has said the restaurant (a relatively new one) hasn't been doing so well lately, and everyone's hours have been getting cut.  I'm the low guy on the totem pole and probably one of the least competent, so I've gone from 35-40 hours a week to a bit over 20.  This is not a huge deal for me, since my paychecks are just going into my spending money and savings, and I'm fortunate enough to have my folks still supporting and feeding me and such.  For other people, though, I imagine the cut hours mean a lot more.

Yesterday was a crazy day at the restaurant.  One of the relatively new people got fired during the shift (he just really wasn't cutting it), and towards the end of the shift, one of the line cooks went batshit over something and flipped out/ragequitted (for the night at least, since it was at the end of the night). 

After all this, it really dawned on me that I'm carrying a good deal of responsibility on my shoulders.  I'm working alongside people whose paychecks go to actually putting food on the table, and I'm taking up a share of a limited number of man-hours which the restaurant can employ.  The thing is, I'm pretty sure I can get a job with better money doing work more often associated with people my age (being the 'intern' at an office).  I'm currently battling depression, however, and I think that sitting at a desk brooding all day wouldn't be good for me.

I don't feel like I'm a waste of man-hours, and I'm not a big detriment to the kitchen (if I was either of these things, I'm pretty sure my boss would have let me go by now).  Moreover, I'm pretty sure I'm making less than my co-workers (and rightfully so), so my hours cost the restaurant less than everyone else's.  But I feel a bit guilty about holding this job in this economy and while the other folks in the kitchen actually have their paychecks going to feeding, clothing, and housing people.


I know I don't belong in this industry long-term, and I don't intend to be here long-term.  I'm a good cook and I do my best as a worker, but I know that I won't be happy working my ass off like this for years to come.  I'm just trying to do my best until the time comes for me to go back to school.  But I'm wondering if it would make things a lot easier in the restaurant for me to go work at an internship like the rest of my friends are instead of having a job with consequence and where my co-workers' paychecks actually mean something.

Would I make things easier if I were to quit and work somewhere else?  Am I just exhaggerating things and making too big a deal out of there being poor job security in the industry?  Am I doing the wrong thing by being here in the first place when I don't intend to stick around long-term?"

It was the happiest week of my life, so yeah, I'm a happy girl and I'm ready to gift because..... I'm going to England to visit him before the year is over! I've never been and am so excited, so I expect to make another contest when the date is closer asking you guys to let me know what places to visit!

Now enough of me jabbering and on to the contest! I start my job back here in two weeks, and with gas prices and car insurance and everything in between, I need some tips on how to save an ample amount of money  (per month, weekly, in general) for this trip to see him! I've checked the ""FRUGAL"" subreddit and haven't seen very good tips so I'm turning to you lovelies on here! Please link me something that is $5 (including shipping, I'm sorry I'm poor) and I will gift by MONDAY MAY 20th in the late morning/afternoon PST. I will choose the most helpful and doable/realistic tip in my opinion! Thanks in advance for your help :D

Also, have any of you been in a LD relationship? If so, has it turned out for the good? I'd love to hear some stories as I sometimes feel alone when my friends have their boyfriends here and I don't. Have a wonderful evening! xx"

I'm moving this week for a great summer internship (can provide proof) but I'm a little short on cash to cover all of my moving expenses. I'm currently waiting on some big transactions to post to my bank account that would give me the money I need, but I'm just looking to make sure I'll definitely have the money. I'm flying out on thursday, but rent on my current place is due on the first.

I have a loan I took out and paid back for the same amount last year, and I think 3 loans that I've granted to others that have been paid back as well.

I'm willing to give whatever proof necessary, there's also a fairly good chance I'll be able to pay back this loan early.

1epq2a,1,2013-05-20,Junior Year,YourDrillSergeant,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1epq2a/junior_year/,"I just finished my junior year of college for a degree in Computer Science at a pretty tough university and I just needed to get something out there.

I've been pretty insecure of my intelligence ever since elementary school. My teacher used to call me a dunce (this was in a different country where it was acceptable for teachers to emotionally and physically punish underachieving students) and I've never had any confidence in my own abilities. Because of this, I became extremely introverted, somehow finishing high school (in the US) without ever making a single friend.

Now, I actually did fairly well in high school and got into an Ivy League school, but my insecurities stayed with me (in part because some of my high school teachers told me that I would never amount to anything) now blossoming into not just issues with my intelligence, but also with my appearance. I did poorly both socially and academically my first year at college, barely making a 2.9 GPA even though I pretty much just locked myself in the library all the time, and ending the year without any support or friends and severe social anxiety. At the time, I realized that any chance I had of getting into graduate school was probably dashed. During the first month of summer that year, I slipped into really deep depression; the suicide of a close friend nearly had me at a tipping point, and one night, while my friends were out without me, I seriously considered ending it right there and then. I made myself sleep on it, and I finally decided against it the following morning.

I began pulling through at the beginning of my sophomore year. I used to be very overweight, but I started working out that semester and shed close to 40lb to date (but more importantly, I got over the fear of going to the gym and being judged). I finally got a roommate, and we became extremely close friends; he helped me get over most of my social anxiety and make new friends, and I actually became quite happy. Without the constant anxiety, it became easy to focus on classes, and I pulled my GPA up to a 3.4. Still not great, as I couldn't even find a summer internship (I still had to use the freshman GPA when applying in the fall), but things are finally starting to look up.

Over the summer of my sophomore year, I promised myself that I would put all of my energy into getting as high a grade as possible the following year, and I'm proud to say that I have pulled through.

I have just earned a 4.3 (equivalent to an A+) on all of my classes this past semester (and about a 4.2 average for the entire year) which pulled my GPA up to a 3.75 (equivalent to an A-). Not only that, I also took the hardest courses offered here including a few graduate level courses. Two of my professors have now asked me to be their research assistant and I've been asked to TA two classes next semester. I even got several job offers and I finally have a shot at grad school! For the first time in my life, I actually feel accomplished.

Unfortunately, this did take a toll on my social life. I do feel like that I have regressed a little bit. In order to juggle between all of my classes, I pretty much studied endlessly this year and hanged out with friends less and less. I ended up losing a close friend of mine and have recently started feeling alone again, but I hope that this will change once I move into a new environment with new people and fresh faces (only a few people are still left on campus). 

One more thing that I'd like to address: I have never had much luck with girls before. I had been interested in a close friend for the first two years of college only to get shot down, which made me quite defensive around girls. I am very inexperienced, and because of this, I often don't know how to behave or what to say. I don't think I'm unattractive: I'm pretty oblivious and even then, I've picked up getting hitted on many times; unfortunately, I usually just clam up whenever this happens to me.

Anyways, thanks to anyone who had the patience to endure through this incoherrent mess. Hope things will look up for you guys too :) "

I recently completed my Masters degree in a mental health field and had an internship at a local psychiatric hospital during my advanced year. The hospital doubled as one of the only public hospitals for more than 40 miles, so we received most of the people with mental illness and/or substance abuse problems from a wide area.

Through that experience, I had the opportunity to spend a lot of time with local law enforcement. By the time I completed my internship, I knew most of the officers by name and am still friends with a few of them. It often was beneficial for both sides of the aisle to have a good working relationship, as it was a lot easier to know what to expect out of each other beforehand without having to be explicit. Different patients responded differently to our various skill sets, I suppose.

I know I shouldn't generalize, but having you guys around made it a hell of a lot easier to work with patients that were incredibly drunk or high as a kite on bath salts. In the same vein, I think the local PD appreciated us stepping in when someone was suicidal or depressed. I don't think I'd want to be a LEO, but to be fair, many police officers have told me that they wouldn't want my job either.

I hope that I can maintain a positive relationship with law enforcement throughout my career. Keep your heads up and stay safe out there."
1epmjb,1,2013-05-20,Some advice?,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1epmjb/some_advice/,"First of all, English is not my native language, so please excuse me for making any mistakes.



I should probably start with a little background information. It doesn't matter how hard I try, I will still get bad grades in school. Even though I'm nearing the end of High School, I still have no idea what I want to do with my life, absolutely no idea. Now, this is not really my problem, the real problem is a little more sophisticated.

In the fourth year of the course I'm currently doing, it's mandatory to go on an internship to a country where English is the native language. For my internship I went to Maidstone in England. I stayed there for 2 weeks with a lovely family. I had an amazing time and I was very happy, everybody thought of me as a very clever guy and people only saw the ‘good’ side of me.

But when I came back home, I felt very different. My home reminded me of how bad I am in pretty much everything I do, it reminded me of every single bad characteristic I have.

This, and some other factors, have resulted in me not feeling at home anymore. My home reminds me of how miserable my life is, I feel like I have no future, and I have absolutely no motivation to do anything anymore. I would rather just stay in bed all day because I don't really care anymore.


I don’t even know what I’m supposed to do anymore, I feel like shit.  I really want to talk about it with someone, but I don’t know who. I was hoping someone here could maybe give me some advice, because I’m absolutely clueless on what I should do, I have never felt like this before.

1epc1n,2,2013-05-20,I'm imploding all my [friend] relationships before leaving college. I'm going to regret this.,[deleted],ForeverAlone,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/1epc1n/im_imploding_all_my_friend_relationships_before/,"I don't know why life chose this time to make everything go down the gutter, but I guess that's luck. College is ending in a week and my friends - people I've known from freshman year and even high school - are always hanging out with each other for one last hurrah before various internships and jobs take us apart.

Problem is, everyone has a girlfriend or boyfriend and these events become ""couple"" events, except for... you guessed it! Me. I'm the one single person tagging along to the restaurants, to the parks, to the clubs, in the last few days/weeks.

""But premeddit,"" you may say. ""They're your *friends*. They don't care if you're single, go have fun with them!"" And this is probably true, but I still feel so incredibly frustrated by seeing them holding hands and cuddling and making eyes with each other that it doesn't MATTER how much of friends they are with me. All the friendship in the world couldn't make up for that total withering that happens inside me when I see such behavior which just reminds me how much of a loser I am.

Recently I've started to back out of events. When we went to a club last week downtown, I snuck out after once again being rejected by the random single girls I asked to dance. I snuck out and walked around the building for a while, my phone and texts constantly ringing from my friends asking where the hell I was.

I've asked out so many girls this year, put myself out there so much, developed so many hobbies, and nothing. Now I get to watch as the end of my college experience becomes a tapestry around me, of what could have been and what I'm missing out on.

Should I suck it up and go hang out with my friends before we all go to different parts of the country? I really want to be with them. But I don't want to feel this loneliness and frustration.

I guess this post doesn't have much of a point, just me rambling and letting this shit out. Thanks for listening."

1eom8j,64,2013-05-20,Elmo: (Possibly) The Worst Ex Boyfriend Ever,ensnarethesun,LetsNotMeet,https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/1eom8j/elmo_possibly_the_worst_ex_boyfriend_ever/,"Pardon the length, this will be worth the read for people who have dated complete psychos. 

Some info: I'm a 20 year old girl who just happens to be an asshole magnet.

Around mid last year, after being strictly platonic with Elmo for more than a year, we decided to give the whole relationship thing a try. The relationship was wrong from the start, as Elmo was in a relationship at the time and he basically cheated on his then-current girlfriend to be with me. Yea, I was stupid but that's not the point of the story. 

Additional info: this guy got kicked out of his house after he beat the shit out of his own father, had to stay with me because he had nowhere to go. Didn't have any money at all, so obviously I was financially responsible for his fucking well-being. I gave him food, clothes, a working phone (after he smashed his phone to the wall one day when he got angry at me), and money. He literally almost never paid for a single fucking thing while he was dating/living with/leeching off me for about 10 months.

Fast forward 8 months, Elmo turned out to be a complete asshole. I found out he was cheating on me through MY WhatsApp history (Yes, he cheated on me while using my cellphone. Low sunovabitch). Also found out that he's been using MY car to meet up with random skanks, take them out, take them back to their places and sleep with them (Keep in mind that he used my car when I was sick, sleeping and/or he just borrowed it saying that he needed a car to go to his friend's house to study).

Also found out that he has been cheating on me several times from friends who has seen him in public with different girls (using MY car) and paying for them using MY money. 

Once, I also went out with Elmo and a few friends and 2 juniors of mine. I had shit to do so i didn't stay long and I had to take myself home to my parents house. Since I can't have Elmo following me around as my parents hate his guts, I suggested for Elmo to catch a ride with the others which he gladly did and ended up harassing on of my juniors/forcing her to kiss him (BTW, the junior was his best friend's little sister) .

I finally had enough of that shit and confronted him, which only ended up with him slapping me, dragging me out of the house, smothering me while I was trying to scream, banged my head against my car, picking me up and threw me to the floor. All of this happened at around 3/4 in the morning while it was raining hard so none of our neighbours had any clue of what was going on. 

(Now this was my fault) We broke up but still kept in contact and hung out together. there were no feeling left, but I guess I was just used to having him around. He had to leave to Europe for an internship so we parted. 

i ended up dating this really nice guy, Ari, who I've also been friend with for about a year. As you've figured, Elmo goes all batshit crazy. He started calling my close friends, asking them where I was, who I was with, what I did that day, etc. This went to a point where I start getting complaints from my friends, saying that Elmo was utterly annoying. One friend even had 88 missed calls from Elmo within an hour. He also started stalking all of my social media accounts, sending me texts saying something like ""You replied his tweet, why won't you reply my messages?"" or ""I know you're online"". 

He also started sending me messages saying how he doesn't have money to eat there, how he has lost so much weight since he got there, basically saying how he is just suffering in Europe. A friend of mine who is also doing an internship there and sees him every day said he was doing just fine. He also went to a point where he told my best friend that he was using drugs, and that he wanted to commit suicide. Luckily my best friend didn't really give a shit, knowing that he is well known for his over-dramatic behaviour. 

The cherry on top of the cake was when he threatened to kill my friends and my family members if I didn't want to get back together with him. So obviously, being tired of all his shit, I told my dad about this Elmo guy, who calmly said that he wouldn't mind taking this whole thing to court if Elmo won't stop harassing me.

Eventually all the crazy stopped. I have blocked him on every social media app available, but I still hear from friends that he still tweets about me sometimes. As for today, I am still happily dating my boyfriend Ari and haven't had Elmo trying to reach out to me for months. Thank God for that."
1eob7f,4,2013-05-20,Marketers of Reddit. Have I made a mistake choosing this profession? (current student),[deleted],marketing,https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/1eob7f/marketers_of_reddit_have_i_made_a_mistake/,"Hello Reddit,

I wasn't sure where else I could ask, but I am looking for advice.  
I am a college student, I work full time at a decent job making $9 an hour and I also attend school 12-15 credit hours a semester, 2 nights a week right now.  Before I transferred from community college to a 4 year university I was majoring in accounting, something I wasn't really that interested in.  After speaking with a few people and some family members, I decided that Marketing would be more intriguing and more fulfilling throughout my life as it seems that there are a lot more opportunities for a Marketing major, but I may be wrong. 

I have been looking for internships on and off for the past 3-4 months and have gotten 3 phone interviews so far and have not gotten the jobs.  My interview skills need work, but they are getting progressively better I feel.  The problem was that all of my jobs going through my life until now (I got my first job when I was 14) have been acquired through friends or family.

Now that I am getting more serious with this Marketing career with my graduation date approaching in May of 2014 if all goes as planned, I am starting to second guess my decision to switch from the usual job that my family has chosen (we have 6 accountants in my family) and went with Marketing for reasons that I thought it would be better for me.

My problem that I am coming across now is that I feel that I will not be good at this.  Granted I have only taken 4 or 5 core classes toward my bachelor's in Marketing, but I feel that I may be too introverted for the jobs that will come my way.  I know these things take practice and I have made it conscious effort to become more personable with people I encounter at work and have been working on talking to people, but can somebody with these kinds of social skills be successful in Marketing?  I believe I am a smart individual.  I get good grades, am highly motivated in my work, and feel that I am a well rounded person who is quick to adapt to environments, it is just that before I am ready to make a huge jump out of my current job environment of 3 years, I want to have something where somebody will really help me learn. 

Do entry-level Marketing jobs all require sales?  Can I be a successful marketer without being a super salesman?  Sales is something that I really don't think I could do well unless it is a product that I truly believe in in an environment that people are looking for information, not looking for people to sell to who were not interested before, if that makes sense.

I am just looking for advice from someone who may have second guessed their major in college and what happened with it.  I know there are more things to do in Marketing besides sales, but do analysts, market researchers, internet marketers all fall under the same blanket ""Marketing"" degree?  

One more thing, if I want to specialize in the online side of marketing, is learning HTML, SEO, and even graphic design a must?  I feel like that would be really useful, just don't know where to start..  

I think I may be overthinking all of this. I am really looking for some insight here.

Thanks people"

Ten is the minimum amount of questions required, but I wanted to know more about being a biologist. I'm not quite interested in wildlife biology or marine biology; I would rather work mainly in a laboratory setting than outdoors. I am also not quite sure if being a biologist is right for me. I have considered being a biologist, forensic scientist, veterinarian, optometrist, and psychologist. I'm hoping I can gain some insight about what is like to be a biologist to determine if I should continue looking into becoming a biologist. I plan to major in biology for either path I go.

1eqlqv,18,2013-05-20,My mother...,smarmodon,SRSWomen,https://www.reddit.com/r/SRSWomen/comments/1eqlqv/my_mother/,"1) So I'm in college and  I have my first ever real-person job this summer. Okay, it's an internship, and it doesn't pay, but I'm going to be doing something I am passionate about that will help me get a paying job in my chosen field eventually... hopefully. The fact that it doesn't pay means I'd have to take a second job at like a McDonalds or something, which will suck but I gotta pay rent! So I'll be working 50-60 hours a week.

2) Also, I come from a very wealthy family, which means that during the school year I am entirely financially dependent on them. My parents pay my tuition and give me spending money. (I'd get a job but it's impossible on my campus if you're not work/study which I don't qualify for.) I totally understand that this is a really privileged position and I am very grateful for the fact that my parents support me and that I won't have to graduate with any debt.

3) Thirdly, over spring break I chose to go on a vacation with my boyfriend's family instead of staying at home with mine. I did it because I wanted to meet some of his extended family and get to know his parents better. I would not have done it if my family had plans, but they didn't because my brother didn't have a break. So I didn't spend much time at home over last break.

With all of those things in mind, here's the real issue. My parents are trying to plan a vacation this summer. We usually go somewhere really far away for at least 10 days. But I only have a week between the end of my internship and school's start date. I also have plans the weekend after my internship that can't be moved because it's for a fixed event. So I really have 5 days for a vacation. Which apparently means I can't go on any family vacation, although I tried suggesting a long weekend or short vacation just to a local beach or something. But apparently we just have to go to the Galapogos or Alaska or SE Asia or something far away and long.

My mother is guilting the crap out of me over this. ""Oh is it that you love [SO's mom] more than us? I'm really hurt that you chose to go on vacation with her but not us!"" ""We never get to see you!"" and more. She wants me to ask my boss for vacation time but I don't feel comfortable doing that, because it is only a 3 month internship and who takes a vacation on that? In addition I'd have to get time off for two jobs which means I might not be able to swing my budget for that month... it just seems very complicated.

Don't get me wrong, I'd love to go on vacation with my family, but circumstances may make it impossible for me to do so. And my mother is furious over this. She's very manipulative and can get quite nasty when she wants to. Usually when she gets mad enough at me she threatens to stop paying my tuition or giving me spending money (which I mostly use for essentials, it's not like I go skydiving with it or anything). I kind of want to tell her that her little baby is growing up and that I simply cannot swing a vacation this summer, but she would probably do that icy ""I'm not speaking to you until you give me what I want"" thing and maybe take away my spending money/freeze my checking acct which is technically under her name. She hasn't done it before but I would not put it past her if she gets mad enough.

I realize this is such a privileged little baby problem but I honestly am just so confused and I don't know who to ask about it. So my question is how do I deal with this situation and should I even bother confronting my mom? This whole ""control"" situation has been bubbling for a while now just below the surface and I have to deal with it eventually. My plan is to call my dad at work tomorrow and make sure he'd be okay with giving me spending money if I didn't go on vacation with them, and then call my mom and tell her that I can't go and sorry but I really need to focus on my future right now."
1ev20s,6,2013-05-22,My [21F] (wannabe) boss[32M] is driving me crazy!,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ev20s/my_21f_wannabe_boss32m_is_driving_me_crazy/,"I've been volunteer interning at the Texas State Capitol for the 2013 session for the Rep that represents my hometown. It started in January 2013, but due to the suffering from horrible allergies, I didn't actually start until February 2013.

I work in a state representative's office and his chief-of-staff is driving me crazy for a few reasons. 

First, because he began to hit on me. I have a... curvaceous bottom and he's made several comments about it. I didn't really make a big deal about it at first, but I just got progressively more uncomfortable. He'd say that when I step right, it goes left. I chose to ignore it. I got a boyfriend mid-March and I've been pretty vocal about it with the other girls at the office so I know he knows. After he found out I was in a relationship, he stopped making those comments.

Second, I've been trying to lose some weight this spring. I'm nowhere near fat, but I'd like to lose about 10 pounds. He's made comments about my weight and sometimes I'll cheat on my diet and he would say, ""aren't you supposed to be eating clean?"" Just constant ridicule of my body. I'm also Facebook friends with the representative I work for and I know his chief-of-staff runs it. I'll post my meals on Instagram and link it to my Facebook and he has said things like, ""brown rice and corn isn't eating clean,"" in a really condescending way. Again, I chose to ignore it. 

Lastly, I was sick for almost two weeks last month and I had to call in for about 6 work days. I haven't had anything to do in the office since March and I don't get paid to do this job, so I figured calling in wouldn't be such a big deal. BIG MISTAKE. He's basically forced me to be the only intern in the office since after the school semester ended (I'm an undergrad student at UT Austin) without anything to do. I spend my time at the office being on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Reddit. Finally a few days ago I went to him and said, ""do you need me to do anything? I'm really bored."" His response: ""You're the only intern who took almost two weeks off from work. You claimed you were sick. We have constituents from the rep's district call everyday and can easily say 'we saw one of your staffers out and about today,' which I know is a total lie because I was NEVER out an about in the district. So basically I'm being forced to twiddle my thumbs at work.

He's always making shitty comments around me while in front of me. For instance, our legislative director and him were talking and our legislative director said, ""that means our interns have to come in this weekend, right?"" and he goes, ""well I know TG (another intern's initials) is down,"" basically saying that I won't do what's asked of me. WHAT THE HELL? I have never indicated I would not come in if needed to. I'm just so tired of being treated inappropriately and thought as of being lazy.

So r/relationship, what do I do? Session ends in a week, but I plan on putting this job on my resume and I'm so scared that a future potential employer will call him and he'll say all these horrible things about me. Advice? 

TL;DR my (wannabe) boss has made sexual comments to me, made comments about my weight and made comments about me being lazy, which is absolutely not true. Help? "
1eu0sj,15,2013-05-22,Need Advice/Help with Freelance Rates,memicoot,writing,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/1eu0sj/need_advicehelp_with_freelance_rates/,"Sorry guys, not sure who else to ask about this.

So I've been writing part time for a software company over the past two years. My hours have fluctuated depending on what else I'm doing - use to be 30, currently is 20 hours a week. 

I write blog posts about online marketing for them, and I write website copy for their site, and help with research on larger products. I didn't go into this as an expert, but since I started, I feel that now due to my work I could be considered a semi-expert on online marketing, social media marketing, SEO techniques, etc. I've tracked some of my blog posts and generally they perform very well and drive a nice amount of traffic to the site. The company has expressed enthusiasm for my work.

Originally I started working for them as an intern for about $10/hr. A few times I asked for a $5 raise, and now I am at $25/hr. Technically I am a freelancer with them, and that's what I did my taxes as. 

Just recently I started doing research on freelance rates, and have seen that most ask for $50 - $100 an hour. Considering I am now doing fairly high-level writing with a good amount of industry experience, it would seem $25/hr is too low for me to be getting paid.

However, I don't want to burn bridges with this company as we have a nice history. Also, I know normally freelancers ask for more since their work is intermittent, but this company has always let me work 10-20 hours, no questions asked, so does that security mean I shouldn't be asking for a higher rate?

I don't really feel like I can ask to have my rate doubled suddenly...not sure what to do. Any advice would be very much appreciated!"

I'm having trouble finding concrete info on this topic, and have a few questions. 

1) What are the differences between all the science majors? How will picking one over the other affect my gradschool/career options? I'm thinking of doing a BMB, or a Bio/Chem double major.


2) I am not very interested in pharmaceutical research. What I would like to do is research brain/computer interfacing, for prosthetics etc. Or researching genetic engineering/gene therapy. (Not that I wouldn't take a pharma job, I just wouldn't want to do that permanently.) Does that count as Biotech, or Bioengineering?


3) I want to get an internship as soon as possible. Any tips on what researchers look for in applicants? 


4) How is the pay, are there good opportunities for advancement in research? I was thinking that after gaining a lot of experience, I might start my own research company- is this a pipe dream, or a matter of hard work?


I would really appreciate any responses."

Audi TT, and Audi A4/S4 really get my blood pumping, but I worry about maintenance costs. I also really love the Infinity G35/37 coupes. 

One weekend last summer I took a day to test drive a few cars to start getting a gauge of what I'd be looking for.

I just do the homework assignments two hours before the midnight deadline and scrape by. We're learning Assembly language (CUSP) and complex data structures and it's hard for me to take seriously because I've never had to use them in the entire 7 years I've been programming.

I've basically devoted all of my time to learning objective-c and ios development on my own. I've also taught myself a bunch of history and economics through research on the internet and I learned public/private key cryptography, the bitcoin protocol, mongodb and node.js on top of that.

1etfim,4,2013-05-22,"I think my family hates me, and the feeling is mutual.",throwawayeddy,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1etfim/i_think_my_family_hates_me_and_the_feeling_is/,"So, I've never done this sort of thing before, but I've only told one person I know how I feel about this, I don't want to bother him by saying it all again, and I don't want to say it to anyone else. 

So, I'm the youngest of four. I just graduated college, and moved back in, looking for work. There's a lot of tension in the house, because my father thinks I'm lazy for being unemployed, but... we'll get to that.

Anyways, I always felt like the black sheep of the family. I was born with high-functioning autism, and never really connected with my siblings the way they connected with each other. They always ganged up on me, teased me, made fun of me, that sort of thing. That only got worse when they all went to the private school my father's successful business got them into. I wasn't able to go to that school, because they said they wouldn't take a kid on the spectrum. So, I went to a public school in the city instead. They got the better education and prospects, and a circle of friends they all hung out with and talked about in conversations, which further excluded me. In a way, I've never really been a part of my family. 

My parents divorced when I was in middle school. That was the worst time I life so far. My mother was abusive, and so were the authorities at school (who I won't go into right now). My father got custody, and I don't see my mother much any more. 

My father shits on everything I accomplish. I got involved in politics, advocating against the war or for labor rights or on climate divestment- he never encouraged me, even though he himself was involved in work against the Vietnam war and for divestment against apartheid. Even when I take leadership roles in groups, he just ignores it, belittles any cause I care about, and tells me to focus on my work. When I needed an internship, I went to the farmer's market in the area- a farmer's market he helped found before he withdrew because it wasn't profitable enough for him- and even though they didn't have an internship available, I offered to work one for them, created the internship, and left behind a working internship program for other students in the area. He didn't say, ""Hey, great job making your own opportunity"", or ""What a good way to benefit future students!"". Just nothing. I graduated from college, having gotten their highest scholarship, and was the first of his kids to graduate, from his own alma mater- the same school whose prep school program wouldn't take me for being on the autism spectrum. He didn't even congratulate me. I recorded and released an album of original music, gave all the proceeds to charity, and got an offer from a small record company to do a professional album, and he hasn't even listened to the copy of the album I gave him. He never praises anything I do- just makes snide comments about my weight (I'm *not* that fat!) and calls me lazy for not having a job. 

I don't think he understands the job search these days. He's built up this mythology about what a great all-American up-by-the-bootstraps hero he is, conveniently forgetting that his father-in-law and his three business partners all helped him with the start-up money to get his company going, before the business partners dropped out and conveniently left the company to him. He hasn't had to look for work or fear for his job for longer than I've been alive, and has no idea what the youth unemployment statistics are- much less the statistics for unemployment for people on the autism spectrum. Still, he feels confident telling me that if I can't find a job while living in the country with no car to get anywhere for a job interview, that I must be lazy. I've applied to dozens of jobs, but he doesn't believe me- he never believes I do any work unless he sees me do it himself, because he believes that I'm lazy. 

The other night, my father came downstairs drunk, and starting rambling on about how disappointed he was that the woman he wanted to screw hadn't come over. I didn't say anything, so he turned to me and said, ""First good night of summer, I'll drink if I want to- fuck you!"". He'd always confided his romantic and sexual frustrations in me, since the divorce, even the ones involving my mother. He hadn't started drinking in front of me until my grandmother's funeral a year or so ago- he got sauced the night of her wake and kept up half the relatives playing music. So, the other night, he comes downstairs drunk and talks for three hours about how great he is for having money, and how every woman who's rejected him must have a mental disorder or been raped as a kid and be screwed up as a result (because that's the only explanation for not liking him- he's made the same theory about my mother. He has no capacity for self-criticism). I always act as his sounding board for this stuff (as have the other kids and my grandmother before she passed away), but he never gives a damn about any of my romantic problems. So, that night, just to give it a shot, I say (quite honestly, as it's been on my mind) ""I don't think I'll ever date. It seems like it's frustrating for most people, and seeing as I have a hard time with normal interaction, I'll probably never get the hang of it"". Now, you might think a father would here recognize the signs of a growing depression and try to comfort or encourage his son- but instead he said, ""Yeah, I don't think you'll ever date"". 

I don't think he gets how to be a father to a person on the spectrum, either. He likes to pretend he empathizes with me because he had a stutter as a kid and knows what it's like. He always tells me to never use it as an excuse or be dependent on anyone, but he tried to get me to play along with him in a benefits scam to claim I was too dependent to be considered an adult after I turned 18, so he could keep getting child support. He keeps telling to apply for disability, and any time he's angry at me for being unemployed, he tells me that if I don't find a job, he'll call the state and have them put me in a group home. He doesn't understand why I'm angry at the prospect of being forced into a group home, when my previous experiences in life include being forcibly committed to a mental hospital when my mother lied and told the police I hit her, being forced to take an addictive medicine (that caused weight gain and sexual dysfunction and relieved none of my anxiety) for years (and getting off it cold-turkey), and being segregated into dehumanizing and insulting special education programs that treated me like I had an intellectual disability (I don't- my IQ is 143, I've always been a top scorer in standard tests and AP courses, and I did well at a prestigious college). 

My brothers and sisters still gang up on me. Every time my sisters come home from the Cities, I dread it, because no matter how mean they are individually, they're meaner when they're together. They all seem to think they're much better than me- which is bullshit. One of them dropped out of a community trade school, went to drive a delivery truck for our father, and is being groomed to inherit the business by virtue of being the first out of our mother. He thinks this makes him a very successful and intelligent person. The younger of my two sisters went to art school and now works as a waitress because she can't sell the bumpy, painfully abstract lumps of acrylic-abused canvass she creates. The older of my two sisters has been trying to get her Women's Studies degree for the last six or seven years and draining the family's finances. Of course, after paying for three kids to attend a private prep school and helping one son to attend and drop out of trade school, one daughter to attend art school, and one daughter to attend an expensive private college for over a half-decade, my father still complains most bitterly about the 10% or so of my education he's paid for (after the scholarship that covered half the costs and my loans that covered most of the rest).

My brother likes to side with my father and call me lazy and fat at any given opportunity. Of course, he's the one who's a 28-year-old trade school dropout who's still living in his dad's basement and relying on nepotism at his dad's company to bankroll his lifestyle. My sisters, when they come home, enjoy acting like they are very progressive, countercultural, and knowledgeable about all social issues (when I'm the one that spent the last four years studying environmental science and policy and taking a leadership role in social activism- fuck, I have to worry about having law enforcement attention for my organizing role in the local groups and my close friendship with other activists who've been targeted, and neither of them have so much as attended a protest since Obama got elected). The truth is that neither of them understand a thing about politics (the way they talk, you'd think an unmanned drone shoots rainbows and laughter when a Democrat orders it deployed). In politics and lifestyle, my brother and my sisters have nothing in common but their high school and their genetics, but they still agree on one thing- fucking with me. I'm the constant butt of their jokes and object of their ridicule, and every time I try to say anything, they just laugh at me. 

So... there you have it. I hate my family, and I'm trapped in this damned house with them until I can find a job and leave. When I do, I'm not looking back. "
1ete98,1,2013-05-22,"The things I chase don't make me happy. Or, why my job is making me miserable right now.",[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1ete98/the_things_i_chase_dont_make_me_happy_or_why_my/,"I apologize in advance for the wall of text ... I'm here with my backstory to ask for career and life advice from you wise ladies (and men!) Right now, I don't really have any peers or friends to talk to about this, and I'm just feeling really lost and confused about where to go from here because, for some reason, I can't figure out how to make myself happy. 

Up until this point in my life, I've done all the ""right"" things (the things that I was always under the impression that I should do). I went to college, got good grades, completed two internships, and was offered a real, professional position before I even graduated. Great, right? On the outside, yes, but on the inside? I can't even remember the last time I wasn't miserable. 

I killed myself to get though school, working full time while going to school full time, and completing internships. At the end of the day though, I would tell myself that it would all be over soon, I would graduate, get a job, and just concentrate on work. Yeah, right. 

I stayed at my first real marketing job for 6 months. My boss would call me at all hours of the day/night to drop her new, insane ideas on my already overloaded workload, and I would have to grin and say I was right on it after my advice was scowled at (i.e. wouldn't this be better after we complete this?). I was a one-woman show for all of her hopes and dreams. I worked crazy hard, but just couldn't do it after a while, so I found a new job. 

Present day - I'm in communications at a large company. Everything started out great ... but now I'm even more miserable than I was at my other job. I'm jumping through flaming hoops on a daily basis to keep my job (layoffs and such) and I'm doing the workload of at least two of my more experienced peers - no exaggeration. I'm constantly under pressure, and I'm running on stress/adrenaline all day, yet I receive positive feedback from everyone I work with. I easily work 10+ hour days at work just to complete my work ... Then I come home and work. I end my day feeling disoriented and miserable. I'm miserable at home, I'm miserable with my SO, and I'm started to feel really down about everything, not just my job. 

The problem is that I don't see how this will change, or if I have some character flaw that makes people want to give me so much work to see if I'll break (that was a bit dramatic, but still). I can't tell if it's my jobs, my field, or the realities of being a young professional. No one talks about this kind of stuff with you in college, before you enter the real world, and I'm just feeling lost about what to do to improve my life, because right now working less and leaving work at work just aren't in the cards.

1etcu0,2,2013-05-22,Saving for grad school in two years with $50k/yr + and $25k cash&amp;ST,[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1etcu0/saving_for_grad_school_in_two_years_with_50kyr/,"First off, I would like to apologize for asking a variation of one of the most common questions to come up here.

I finally landed the job that I have been working towards for a while and with my new financial situation I have set to figuring out my savings. One problem is that with my chosen career path people usually go back to school after 2-3 years before moving up in the industry, so I am working on balancing saving for that with getting a jump on my retirement savings.

Some numbers:
* My new job pays $50k plus a bonus which is usually between $10k and $20k. Since I was an intern at my company until now, I expect to make $41k total this year with a bonus around $10k.

* I currently have a little over $25k in cash that I have intentionally kept liquid because I did not know what was going to happen with this job. (This includes $12k in a 12 month CD that I could withdraw by forfeiting all of the $0.36 interest or whatever that it has accrued)

* I expect approximately $2.4k/month total expenses

* My employer does *not* match 401(k) contributions  :( 



Preliminarily, I am thinking that I max out a Roth IRA, find the best short term vehicle on a 2-3 year horizon (not many choices, are there?) to put the rest of my non-emergency-fund cash, and then probably split the ~$1k/mo in left over income between my 401(k) and my short-term grad school savings (whatever that turns out to be). It seems like the 401(k) keeps getting pushed down the priority list with no matching and this looming education expense, but I would at the very least like to contribute whatever of my income is left in the 25% tax bracket (approx $3k + whatever my bonus is) to some pre-tax savings.

This turned out a lot longer than I had expected. So I would really love any insight anyone cares to offer, but I am particularly interested in what, if any, are good ways to save money on a 2-3 year time period. Some kind of bond portfolio? Also, what are the merits of funding school with a Roth IRA? It is probably too short of an investment period for a 529 to be any good.

Another thing that I guess I should look into is exactly how much I intend to have saved going into grad school. I'd have to crunch some numbers on the opportunity cost of the savings sitting around as cash for a couple of years vs earning returns in a retirement account but having to partially debt fund school (I expect at least $100k out of school, but then again: who doesn't?). It may turn out to be the most beneficial to dump all of the extra money I make into a savings account to avoid any educational loans.

I tried to make this as focused as possible, but I apologize if it dissolved into my openly contemplating. Oops!


Thanks for your time to anyone who made it this far down. :)"
1et4b5,1,2013-05-21,"Encouragement, Prayer and/or Advice",[deleted],Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1et4b5/encouragement_prayer_andor_advice/,"After working as a volunteer in several ministries over the past eight years or so, working as an intern for two years, serving on staff part time for about nine months and getting a Bachelor's degree in Biblical Studies, I am still having a difficult time finding a ministry position to serve in. I will be starting on my Master's degree in August (money permitting) and I am clearly called to serve in youth ministry.

The one thing that education and experience have left out is how to find a full time ministry position to serve in, outside of the church you have been attending. I check the online postings very frequently, trying to be among the first to apply for any appropriate position, but they typically fill quite quickly and I rarely get anything more than ""we are considering you for the position,"" and a day or two later ""we're sorry, the position has been filled.""

Tomorrow I will start going from church to church, looking for either available positions or youth pastors that know of available positions. I'm not willing to take a job that is clearly not a ministry to which I am called. I will not compromise with a church that promotes beliefs that I do not support. I'm not in it for the money, but if I am to serve full time, obviously I will need money to live on. The issue is not so much that I need the job for the money. The issue is that without a job that pays money, I will be left to take a non-ministry job for the money for my family to live on. This is, in fact, the reason I left the part time position I was paid for. It was very little pay, and I was happy to serve in the ministry, but the job I took required me to work nights to a degree that I was unable to continue serving.

I was never interested in youth ministry, but I ended up working in it a few years ago and came to realize that was where God was putting me. I am not interested in getting a job as a stepping stone to a ""better"" position. I am looking for a church to plug into. I expect to join a church as a youth pastor and watch my kids grow up in this church. I am more concerned about how well my wife, my children and myself will integrate into the church than I am about how much I will be paid. I want to join a ministry to serve and until I am serving in a ministry as I should be, I feel as though I am loafing about, not doing what God wants me to be doing.

I know that God has a plan. I know that the troubles we go through serve a purpose, in sculpting us for the ministry we will serve in. Obviously, I am not going to be able to lay out every detail that could pertain to these subjects in such a small post. Mostly, as stated in the title, I guess I am looking for encouragement and advice from other pastors who were looking for their first positions out of college. Otherwise, prayer has accomplished amazing things, but God loves to answer prayers that give Him the most glory. Such a large number of people praying would surely give Him glory when the prayer is answered. I'll try to remember to check back for advice and questions at least once a day, so do not get mad at me if I don't no life the post to catch every response immediately. It is almost 9:30pm and it will not be long before I leave for work.

If you have reached this point in the post, I appreciate the time you have put into reading it, the advice you provide and the prayers that are offered up."
1exp8l,1,2013-05-23,I just need some advice. (23f/22m),that1girlfromschool,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1exp8l/i_just_need_some_advice_23f22m/,"Hi guys, I want to apologize in advance for the wall of text about to insue. 

I (23 f) had been dating this guy (22) for 7 months.I was his first everything; kiss, sex, etc. During those months, I really enjoyed his company, he paid lots of attention to me, we never fought, all good traits of a healthy relationship. The only thing that concerned me was his lack of drive for his career. When we met, he was in his senior year of undergrad, hoping to become a detective. I started noticing how he would procrastinate with his school assignments; submitting them 2 minutes before an online deadline. He kept putting off his application for the local police academy. It really concerned me. 

I guess I should back up. I'm a junior, as of this fall, and I am a very determined person, so much to the point I will start working on a project the day it's assigned, even if it's not due for a month. You can see why this would irritate me.

I broke up with him under the terms that I wanted to focus on school (true), and that I wanted him to not have to wait for me or follow me around the world, as I want to work a few years internationally before settling down (Also true). Obviously, I still loved him, but it wasn't fair. Anyways, 3 weeks later (one week ago), we start talking again, because guys, he's my best friend. We eventually agreed on being friends with benefits. 

A few days ago, he told me he was going on a date. I tried to express a sort of happiness for him, but by the end of the conversation, I told him I was scared. Scared that I wouldn't be able to hang out with him again. Especially not with her, I have major jealousy problems. Major. Like some may even label me ""bat-shit crazy"". 

Fast forward to yesterday. He had the date, a girl he met on okcupid. He even showed me her picture. SHE LOOKED EXACTLY LIKE ME; same hair cut/ color, makeup style, and I swear I owned 2/3 outfits she had in her pictures. I'd never seen a more convincing doppleganger. It really hurt me. I felt like I was completely replaced.

I was supposed to go to a house party with him after their date. I told him I wasn't feeling well, and that he probably didn't want to hear what I had to say. No reply. A few hours later, I ask for all my stuff back. No reply. Delete him on facebook and my phone. I end up crying myself to sleep after two hours. Woke up at 5 am, from a dream about him. Cry. No reply. Decide to get all of his things together and put them on his porch. Text him at 5:45am telling him his stuff was there and to do the same with mine. No reply. 

I'm at a loss of what to do. I love him so much. Not to sound cliche, but I haven't been able to eat since 2 days ago. I've tried everything to keep my mind off him, and nothing seems to work. The worst part about it is, it's summer and all my friends have left town for internships, study abroad, or just to go home. It's literally just him and I, as far as our friends go. I want him back so bad, even though I know I'm the dumper. I'm just scared of ending up married to someone who doesn't take their career as seriously as I intend to take mine. 

Any advice would be helpful. Thanks."

However, the company spends anywhere between a few hours to a week creating websites for their business. This often means copying HTML/CSS code, mimicking other sites designs VERY closely.

1ew7ed,33,2013-05-23,Two Sorcerers -,AFunnyThing-,gametales,https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1ew7ed/two_sorcerers/,"A long time ago,
when all of those men who live today's fathers were not even sperm in the sacs of their fathers, there was an orphaned elf by the name of Aza Alarin.
The orphaned elf was an apprentice for an apothecary in Greendale, and spent most of his days cleaning up, begging for change, and taking care of an easily-angered old drunkard by the name of Thaadius Winsor. In exchange for a place to stay and food in his belly, he would play the part of housekeeper and glorified slave in the unbridled hopes of one day learning a trade he really had no interest in (but beggars can't be choosers, now can they?).

One fateful morning, Thaadius Winsor sent delivery to the Elvish City Fort Lheao in the providence of the Seanchanni in the Southern Wood. The delivery, he marked, was ""of extreme importance"" with promises of lashing the payment out of him if he were to lose it... But promises of recognition if he were to deliver it.
It was a potion meant for a Lord there. A rare, experimental potion that was to cure any wound or ailment no matter how severe.

As it so happened, while travelling through those thickened woods, the youngling elf's ears picked up on sounds from the distance and an uneasy feeling vibrated down his body (the kind which he used to get when his father would cast spells). Curious, Aza diverted from the well-worn path to investigate. There, in the Southern Wood, is when Aza laid eyes upon a most beautiful High Elf, bloodied and surrounded by a pack of dead Dire Wolves.

Then, from nowhere, Aza was drawn on by others whom had heard the noises. Realizing he was just a youngling and the other High Elf was near death, demanded his money, his package, or his life. Deciding that none of those were rather pleasant options, Aza decided to make a third option - using a spell his father taught him to use in dire emergencies, he blanketed the area in a thick fog and dragged the High Elf to safety in the chaos.

Despite warnings, and no repercussions to be had for his inaction, Aza Alarin cracked open the salve and applied it to the wounds on the female. But she did not awaken. For a day and a half he gathered berries and hunted using the little spells he knew, and fed her as best he could. Upon the third day, she would regain consciousness and inquire about the events past. That High Elf would introduce herself as Shival Hakor, married to the Elven King Matrim Hakor.

Aza Alarin introduced himself as the son of Tucker Alarin and explained the events of the last few days.

Shival, being taken aback by the use of magic of a Youngling and the outright generosity he showed for someone he knew nothing of, went with the Young Elf's help to Fort Lheao and sent word for Aza's internship to be released from Mr. Winsor. She, out of her influence as Queen, provided him comfort and a home to live in. After indulging him in the depths of Elvish society once more, she began observing the youngling from a distance to see his actions via magic.

Every night, Aza would sneak out of his room, cast Featherfall to land quietly, and climb up the side of one of the taller buildings to count the stars and weave spells... Seemingly out of the blue with no words nor materials.
He would then return to the bottom of the window, cast a spell to throw himself up again, and pull himself into the window and sleep the next day.

One night, Shival Hakor invited the young Aza to her observatory to view the stars and to cast magic. When she inquired about his skill, he remarked that his dad and his family had always been able to use magic. And, when remarked about the stars, he said:

*""My mother always told me that the Stars were those we loved watching out for us from the afterlife. Every man and woman is a star. And, as they gaze upon us, we should gaze upon them.""*

Finally understanding the plight that the boy faced, and inspired by the child-like innocence when it came to magic, she sent to her husband that she would return with the Youngling for a period of time to the Ignis Faatus, the Magical Guild that sat upon the tower at the top of the Laboo Wilderness. After a weeks' ride, they became known at the magical guild and she settled him in with the finest instructors known in the realms, then resumed her position as a sitting adviser to the then-head of the Ignis, River Delphinius.

And from there, time and time again, wars would be fought and won - or lost - and evil would rise and fall. As Aza grew up and as Shival Hakor eventually resumed her name as Shival Felwind, he slowly became attached to the woman whom had changed his life.

Nothing came to fruition until the second time Aza Alarin would save Shival Felwind's life: The day the Abyss was nearly opened and those beings that haunt the chaos of Xel nearly slipped out and infected the world with Chaos.

During the fight with the Unholy Order of Xel (a cult dedicated to opening a gate to Xel and releasing Chaos unto the world) Shival Felwind became surrounded by the chaotic energies, herself defenseless since she was maintaining a spell to keep the gate sealed. Aza, the once-youngling now younger elf, waded through the corrupting energies and cast a ward about them both. The energies would eat at the muscles on his legs, making him eventually fall from his feet but maintaining the spell all the while.

After the battle was over, and the Chaos dispelled, Aza collapsed. This time, he was the one awakening later and asking about what time had been lost.

Shival Felwind was not there, for it would be inappropriate of a High Wlf of her position to show bend toward any common elf, but one of the Healers at the Ignis said that she had spent every night at his bedside - but not to tell her that because he was content with keeping his eyes open and working late (for whatever reason, Aza didn't ask nor did he care). But, as Aza tried to rise, he noticed that his legs failed him and that he could not walk on his left one.

He was told that the corruption permanently disfigured him, and that there was nothing that could be done. He would never use that leg again.

After hours, when a hushed silence would fall upon the infirmary and darkness would veil the eyes of sleeping mages, he would close his eyes and listen with his Elvish ears. Each night, a familiar shuffling of feet would resound and sit beside his bedside. And, each morning, they would leave. He had no doubt in his mind it was Shival, but he would never confront her about it.

One day, Aza Alarin would awaken to an unusual site. Someone had left him a specific object at the base of his bed: an animated rag-doll in his likeness. Aza smiled, knowing of only one enchantress who could weave life like that magic into fabric in imitation of life.

When he confronted her later on, Shival called him a fool and asked him:

*""Do you want to be a star so badly that you'd kill yourself for it?""*

To which Aza replied:

*""I find life much more bearable being the star looking down upon you than you the star looking down on me.""*

And that was the moment when Aza looked out into the stars for a moment, contemplating life and its meaning, when he first received a loving embrace and a gentle kiss from Shival Felwind.

From then on, no matter what the situation arose, she and he would hold that moment in time as pivotal moments in their lives. Aza would fall in love abroad and bare children, Shival would marry multiple times - both would fight wars and destroy evil that threatened the world... But, they would always share that moment and several others like it. Hidden from the world and in secret:

An Elf and a High Elf. Two Sorcerers."

I had two internships that paid pretty well at fairly large companies in the area that ended when I graduated. Both internships went well and I graduated with a 3.7 major GPA which is respectable, but I didn't go to Harvard or anything like that. 

Currently, I commute an hour and 15 minutes to my job that I got when I graduated. I make $45,000 salary at the moment, been there since January. At the time I accepted, money was a big issue that motivated me to take the position before applying to a large number of places. I don't want to sound ungrateful, because I know there are a lot of graduates looking for work. I feel like I'm underpaid as I can barely find a decent apartment and pay all my bills with what I'm making. The commute is terrible and I feel like I'm stuck. However, I'm doing well and everyone's happy with my performance. I like what I do and the people I work with, but I don't see a raise happening anytime soon as it's a smaller company. I don't want to appear to be a job hopper either. If anyone has advice or similar experience I would like to hear from you.

1evg5n,14,2013-05-22,"Proposing/Introducing a centralized and transparent bitcoin ""bank"" tentatively called ""minisats""",minisat_maker,Bitcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1evg5n/proposingintroducing_a_centralized_and/,"**Introduction and Overview:**

I am beginning a project I would like to dedicate my time to. It will be open-source, welcoming both forking and contribution. I believe it will serve an unimaginable number of uses. This might be a bit of a wall of text, but I'd rather be clear than catchy. I'm looking for any criticism, comments, questions, and contributions. **There's a TL;DR at the end.** Here's the idea:

At the most basic level, I'd like to create an open-source, totally-transparent, provably secure and trustworthy anonymous bitcoin bank. As awesome as it is to have the first peer-to-peer success of Bitcoin's magnitude, there are SOME innate perks to a centralized system that we can harness. I believe that if we built a centralized system that was *provably* open and just wrapped it as closely to the Bitcoin ideals as we could, we could get something pretty cool.

A user goes to the site. They request a new account, and two things happen. First, it generates a deposit address for them to send bitcoins to; second, it asks for an address they own. In order to do anything with the bank, they have to send both the command and the *signed* command to the bank. In this way, the user can control their account without ever revealing their private key to anyone, even the bank. The process may seem a little awkward, but this is designed to be securely handled by a trusted client-side program.

**Tips:**

Once the account has funds, you can send a tip to any other user. You can also send to any Bitcoin address, which will create an account for that address and just hold the funds until someone with the corresponding private key does something with them. A tip is instantaneous and irreversible. A tip consists of:

- An amount of bitcoins, with more precision than a satoshi. A transaction can deal with millisatoshis, microsatoshis, etc. I'm using the umbrella-term ""minisats"" for the sub-satoshi denominations.

- A memo, which would support an html-like markup language, capable of referencing other tips, other accounts, or just a general link. It will support small messages or links to larger media.

- (further on in development) ""custom tip behavior"", which will be modeled after [bitcoin contracts](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Contracts). Contracts are currently dormant in the Bitcoin protocol, but offer some really interesting tools.

Each tip will cost a **very** small amount of minisats: something more comparable to a coin's ridges rubbing off after use than a credit card's transaction fees. This will be targetted to exactly pay off the server cost of managing the new information. It's hard to articulate the scale I'm talking here, but you'd have to be sending an insane number of tips for this to affect you in any significant way, and will be far, far less than the transaction fee associated with using the Bitcoin network directly. At the same time, it will basically prevent a ddos attack or spam from being ""worth it"" from the spammer's perspective.

**Data Analysis:**

There will be an exposed interface for viewing the tip history database, possibly just as simple as exposing part of an sql SELECT statement to the user. This will also be designed as a backend for other open-source tools built to access it. To run queries, a user must use an account with some small balance; queries will require some small amount of minisats again targetted to exactly pay off the rough cost of the query in terms of server processing time. This will encourage optimized queries over data-combing; a programmer with a bit of time should always find it affordable to run simple queries even if monolithic entities are running huge data-combing operations. The price will scale along with server demand, so we are always at peak perfromance without crashing. (I'm also considering publicly logging all data searching; what do you guys think about this?)

The culture surrounding this data availability will be like Facebook or Myspace, in that all of the information you could find has been uploaded with the understanding that it was public. This will, by the way, be an excellent way of demonstrating to new cryptocurrency users exactly what ""public yet anonymous"" means, and show them the ins and outs of this new set of rules and consequences.

**Example applications of data analysis:**

Consider the following algorithm that a client could perform:

Given an account id, it will find its biggest sent tips, return the info (from id, to id, amount, memo), limiting by saying something like ""activity last week"". Then take that pool of accounts, and repeat the process with their combined tips matching similar criteria. Continue for some small number of loops.

Now fill in the blanks with some examples. The account was your neighbor Joe's public account. Oh, he donated to that space program. Oh, he sent a few millisats to some other dude with the memo ""for homegrown carrots. tasted great, thanks!"". When the loop iterates again, you'll be reading about your acquaintances' biggest public expenditures. No matter how many loops you iterate through, you're always guaranteed a real person, not a spammer, because you're only getting to people who have done something to receive a tip from someone you trust, at least vicariously. Imagine knowing in an instant every restaurant review your friends have ever had in an instant by only searching the memo field for ""restaurant"", ""food"", or ""delicious"", and specifying only 2 or 3 degrees of separation. Imagine searching instead for the keywords ""amazing"" ""vacation"", and ""travel"", and letting it iterate through a few degrees of separation. Great travel ideas, just like that, pre-sorted in terms of how much your friends vicariously valued the comment. It will be like a subreddit for your life.

I'm sitting at home, up late becuase I can't sleep, and bored. My stoner friend calls me up and says he REALLY needs some pizza but he can't DRIVE and he has some BITCOINS that could be mine. I'm bored anyway, and I could use some more money, so I accept. When I get back home, I see he's tipped me with the memo ""that pizza was awesome. thanks for the delivery man"". A day or so later, I see I've received a tip (maybe with no money, maybe with a few microsats, maybe more) with the memo ""I see you delivered pizza last night super late. Would you mind delivering to my address for XX bitcoins/satoshis?"" He explains that he knows my stoner friend's friend, and he came across the first tip when searching for ""pizza delivery"". If the price is right, I agree. If not, I ignore it or make a counter-offer. And suddenly, with no effort on my part, I have the opportunity to begin delivering pizzas for profit.

Find yourself often killing time in town? Start taxiing your friends around for bitcoins, and soon their friends will be calling you up for rides. No money to pay for food tonight? I bet you could find someone who'd pay you to mow their lawn or shovel their driveway. Start with your friends, and branching out will be easy, with almost any line of work. If you do what you're good at people will pay you to do it again, and specialization will become as natural as breathing.

And beyond things that are just convenient for you to do, consider all the things that you *like* to do. Let's say that you like working with small [quadrotos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrotor), so you get one and start messing with it. One day you are able to program it to do something cool, so you make a video and post it somewhere associated with your account. If your friends think it's cool, they'll tip you for it, which both funds you *and* makes *their* friends more likely to hear about it. The cooler your video is, the more money you get from it, first from friends and then from strangers--and one day you could find that you have an ongoing crowdsourced fundraiser, moving enough money to you to buy a few more quadrotors and start working on [something like this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp89tTDxXuI). The sky is the limit with this kind of growth, and the better you are at it the better this will work. And besides the money you'd get, you can browse the tips with any number of algorithms, finding the most constructive criticism quickly in the same way you can do so on Reddit.

This kind of thinking applies to *anything*. I believe that one day, with Bitcoin, restaraunts will fall to the people who just like to cook; specialty book stores will fall to people who like weird books; schools will fall to tutors and apprenticeships. I think this tool is the next step toward that. Why go to college for an engineering degree when you could instead just find and pay an engineer to let you shadow him for a day/week/month? Why take an internship when you could just impress that guy with your knowledge? If you pay attention and you're a smart kid, one day you'll find that he's willing to pay you to show up to work and tell him what you think. Why would an engineering firm hire a graduate when they've seen that your mentor (their associate through some degrees of separation) tipped you a significant portion of a payment for catching an important detail? All you have to do is do what you love as long as it's worth your time, and you'll find your place in the world.

I could go on and on about the amazing things this system could do, but if you're still reading this then you probably get the basic idea by now. I'm mainly posting here because I could use some help, and I'm hoping that this idea is exciting to someone else who can contribue to parts of the project that I'm less able to.

I can immediately start on the database manipulation and bitcoin handling, and when that's done I'm going to start on a basic AJAX interface, assuming no one has already begun making better interface tools. If anyone else is interested in contributing their skills, we'll need:

*At least one cryptology expert

*People willing to work on interface tools; on one hand the database searching, and on the other hand the tip/account management. I'd also like to see a basic tool that handles them both.

It would really help to have:

* Some well-known community member(s) getting involved to more easily prove project honesty/openness.

* Other people setting up their own servers with variants to see which systems and settings work better

* More ideas on how to make this *provably* honest and open. It will be trivial to prove the server *has* been honest, but I haven't yet figured out to prove that it *will* be honest.

* Users, ideally with friends to bring in to start building networks and dialogues.

* Finally, if you love this idea but can't help with ability or time, bitcoins are of course always welcome. I can coast for a while and dedicate my time to this project, but one day bills will come to take me away from this. You can bitcointip me, or my bitcoin address is 17BrEsAs2TY5PkgcyPWyNt2AyenBNTPcJr; depending on the activity of this project, tips will either go toward hiring more talent, tipping good contributions, or paying for my next batch of top ramen and internet bills. Keep in mind that if you'd rather not depend on my honesty, you can always find some other contributor to donate to. Once the ball gets rolling a bit more, I'm sure we'll set up a general donation address.

Alright guys. Sorry for the wall of text. I hope some of you get as excited about this as I am. I'm going to be watching this and responding when I can, and unless the feedback is such that the idea changes rapidly, I'm going to start on the project either today or tomorrow.

**TL;DR: Minisats will be a centralized but 100% transparent online bitcoin bank capable of regular-sized or incredibly small micropayments with memos called ""tips"", and the tips database will be searchable to an extent that will allow an incredible range of uses and, I truly believe, usher in a new era of social interaction like we can't imagine.**"

the first thing was i was getting eye pain... the next day it was eye pain + headaches. i used to get headaches as a chile, but i have not had any (other than the infrequents) for around 9 or 10 years. i have had a running headache for the past 4 or 5 days now, which comes and goes in waves... it will let up for an hour and then come back even stronger. yesterday, i had very bad stomach pains as well. so bad i had to leave my job early, come home, take 500 mg of naproxen sodium and go to bed at around 3:30 pm. for the past 3 days, my urine has been a very dark color. yesterday being the worst. looked like someone left a family sized tea bag in the toilet for a good while...

now, i HAVE been drinking slightly less water (as im not biking down here), the first day i had a headache i ignored it, but as soon as i saw my urine slightly darker, i upped the water 2 fold. (i would still say i was drinking more water than the average person though).

it did not help.... the stomache pains came the following day from me drinking more water.

the first week i was here, i was drinking bottled drinks, which makes me think its something to do with the water im drinking. im about to drive to walmart and get a few gallon jugs of water... my room mate never uses the refrigerator water filter, and when i did start drinking form it it tasted a bit funny. i let it run a bit and it cleaned up fairly well. 

so, my question to you guys: do you think the drinking water was the issue? or should i be worried about some illness? also, if it was the water, will switching to bottled fix that? or do you think i caught some pathogen that was lingering in the stagnent water in the fridges piping?"

I can probably secure housing after that, but there's a chance I may have to be homeless for a little while. I will not have a vehicle, which would make it considerably easier. 

Does anyone have any suggestions for homeless living in a large city like DC? What services can I take advantage of, what areas are safe, what 24-hr places are there?

1ezb3q,6,2013-05-24,How does my career road map look towards CPA and public accounting?,dzyj,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1ezb3q/how_does_my_career_road_map_look_towards_cpa_and/,"Few things about me first. I graduated 2 years ago with a BA in economics. I had a job for approx 6 months as an accounting clerk, even though it was at a bookkeeper level it still gave me a small taste of accounting and between work and the financial accounting classes I recently have taken I enjoyed it and knew this was the career path for me.

My only concern though is that I didn't take advantage of the my previous university's career services while I was going for my econ degree. In addition, my current university which I'm enrolled under their accounting certificate program, doesn't have the largest network/career services for the big 4. How do I make my self noticeable to them?

Finally, since my workload is fairly light right now(wasn't able to get as many classes as I wanted), would it be a smart thing to start studying for the CPA exam so I can take it as soon as I have enough credits to sit for it, even though I haven't taken the necessary classes.

Also when would be the best time to start looking for the big 4? Would they consider me as an intern candidate with only 4 accounting classes under my belt, or would I be better off looking for an intern once I begin sitting/passing my cpa exams?

thank you for the guidance"

I make it less than two months and I start getting a burning in my stomach, go to an urgent care just to hear it could be gerd or ulcers. I wasn't happy but they gave me medicine I FELT HORRIBLE got nauseated had a nurse tells me if that happens go to ER (this is visit number 1). Sit there for hours get some magic nausea pill and I'm feeling alright and they give me some mix of crap that kills the pain for my stomach great! They give me another medicine to try and I'm on my way 6 hours later at 3 in the morning.   
  
Next day I'm so nauseated its worse than before in so much pain I finally fall asleep from exhaustion clutching my stomach. LOW AND BEHOLD its the medicine I deduce and after a second episode of nausea and It hits me a third time and I head to the ER (visit number 2) mind you I am new to my area and I am using the ER and urgent cares because I can't see a Dr. for 2 weeks I am playing a waiting game because no Dr. seems to think its important enough to see me despite how horrible I am feeling. I GET EVEN MORE NEW MEDICINE.

Here is where it gets mildly better the DR we though we had told us the wrong date and if we waited I have to take another week and a half of horrible nauseated nights. We call around find 1 DR that said ""You have been in the ER twice? Can you come in this Thursday?"" hell yes I can and I think everything will be better. Finally see that doc and he does a physical and evaluates me mentions a slight spine curve nothing serious but just adds on the pile said it is probably what causes my back tension. While he does that I keep thinking man my joints have been hurting a lot lately and he says it could be the medicine so get off of it for a few days and lets see. Few nights of nausea and pain and yup its the medicine yet another switch. I get a new one it gives me more problems related to gerd which at this point we thought it wasn't necessarily, like really it caused problems?  
  
Do H-pylori test hoping for an easy answer but noooo can't be that simple for me no luck. At this point I've also had headaches and the Dr is a little concerned which made me really concerned the guy hardly listened to me some times it seems but he was helpful and got me a neruo referral and a gastro.  
  
Well gastro calls to schedule 4 fucking months away I am still waiting till July for this. Neuro schedules but hey doc my face muscles feel tight and so does my right side of body kinda Dr says go to ER to be evaluated ASAP. I do get brain scan no doesn't seem like your dying but its probably tension headaches.  
  
Mind you while all of this is going on so is school I went from not missing a single lecture or anything in an entire year which I was proud of and I'm missing two lectures a week at least. So I have to go out even more and try and catch up in between all of my lab classes and work.  
  
Well back to the DR. between all of that and he throws me on Nexium and if you don't know its the big boy stuff for these kind of problems and its $150 bucks a month which is like a fortune for me between paying rent and other expenses. 

Hurray all the Nexium at least makes me mobile again not more clench over, or may be I'm healing and it is bad ulcers the doc doesn't know and I won't know for months.   
  
In the mean time I am now off to Physical therapy for tension headaches and it kinda pulls the tension to other places and that gives me head aches when I wake up now. I ran out of sample Nexium the doc gave me and I am on day 2 with out it and my insurance didn't authorize it. So I had to wait even longer and literally as I wrote this I got a call that it will be there hallelujah something descent is happening.  
  
To put icing on the cake my fuckin girlfriend the best person in the whole fucking world took care of me with all my sickness and bitchyness that I am sure was there and then she had to leave for an internship for 6 months leaving me in the apartment by myself which with out being sick wouldn't be as bad but has left all but depressed and lonely since friends have gone for the summer and she works a really tight 16 hr schedule at her internship daily where she barely gets service so can't text me often.  
  
And grades came through I should have had all A's but ended up with B's in a couple classes which isn't bad but when the reason is you missed a few points on the final for my calculator fucking up mid test, and the other teacher changed the question HE SAID WAS FOR SURE ON THERE to something else.  
  
Here is to hoping I'm slowly not rotting from the inside out with something horrible as the Drs play the waiting game with me and that 2013 some how turns up (which wouldn't be hard at this point).  
  
And to every god damn person that doesn't get the care they need and have it a million times fuckin worse that I do. I am sorry and I wish every goddamn person the best because I know I am stressed out, and tired, and just wanna be able to walk around with out thinking ""why does this part hurt now?"""

About us: VouchedFor is a disruptive Start-up in the financial services sector. We like to think of ourselves as the TripAdvisor of independent financial advice. In other words, we let people find, rate and review Independent Financial Advisers and have plans to do a whole lot more.

We’ve already secured partnerships with major industry players, received great press coverage and have the backing of an awesome group of investors with successes like Betfair, Zoopla and Gumtree under their belts.

We’re based in SW London and are currently recruiting two Graduate Interns to join our growing team.

Description: There are two roles up for grabs

Social Media and Communications Intern

Raising awareness of our brand is key to making us grow quickly. Working with our Communications &amp; Marketing Manager you’d be instrumental in devising and implementing campaigns to ensure that VouchedFor becomes synonymous with personal finance. Regular tasks will include:

Social: Write unique engaging blog content; Engage our audiences through social media (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn); Manage our blogger outreach programme
PR: Develop insightful reports, analyses and infographics; Draft press releases, surveys and pitch stories to trade and consumer journalists
SEO: Develop and manage a link build programme; identify opportunities for on-site optimisation

Business Development Intern

Generating and fostering new relationships as well as building on existing ones within in the industry are key to driving our business forward. Working with our Business Development Manager you will be at the forefront of our B2B efforts, making VouchedFor a must have for every IFA. Regular tasks will include:

Account Management: You’ll be in charge of nurturing relationships with IFA’s and developing new systems to ensure that our growing database runs without a hitch
Onboarding (Just our fancy word for getting advisers up to speed on the site!): VouchedFor is always evolving which means new options and packages for our IFAs. This role involves keeping the IFAs up-to-date with current changes and ensuring they’re on the best package for their needs
SEO: We’ve developed a successful link building programme (you’ll have the keys to the car to make it even better!); identify opportunities for on-site optimisation
B2B Marketing: It’s all about getting our name out there in the industry so you’ll be involved in generating new business through your weird and wonderful marketing ideas.

Above all don’t forget we’re a Start-up so no 2 days will ever be the same. It’s about diving in, coming up with ideas, trying them, figuring out what works, and doing more of it. We’re always open to fresh insights and there is plenty of scope for the roles to evolve. We are all the time.

Salary: Initially we’ll be looking to pay National Minimum Wage but for the right candidate we’d hope to turn this into a permanent salaried role. However, if you’re set on joining a blue chip and using us as a stepping stone we’ll be happy to have helped you on your way.

About you: You’ll have graduated from a good University and be dedicated, full of ideas, happy to get involved and give things a go. We’re looking for analytical minds, so you’ll be adept at identifying issues and solutions and spotting opportunities, and how best to maximise them. Both of these roles have huge potential to grow, and the right people will be instrumental in helping to shape our business. An interest in personal finance and/or relevant work experience would be a bonus but not essential as we’ll be here to get you up to speed.

Most importantly... How to apply?

We’d like to see your CV, but just as importantly we’d like to know why you’d like to work with us. So ditch your usual blurb and let us know in one sentence, maybe two, why you’d like to join the team… Bonus points for originality!

You must have full entitlement to live and work in the UK.

1eyrh3,19,2013-05-24,[Intro] Hey everyone! I found this subreddit recently and thought it was a great idea.,Kafke,Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Amazon/comments/1eyrh3/intro_hey_everyone_i_found_this_subreddit/,"I gotta say. Seeing subreddits like this and others similar is pretty amazing. I never thought I'd see people online gifting to complete strangers. I've done some gifting myself (through twitter, /r/playitforward, and other various sites), and found that it's actually pretty fun to see others reactions.

So... A little about me: I'm a 20 Y.O. college student who's close to graduating. I'm a computer science major and spend a lot of my time making and playing video games. I'm more of a Nintendo fanboy, and I like their consoles/games over the compeition. I'm currently playing through Kingdom Hearts DDD on my 3DS (I love that little console).

I'm also a fan of anime. I frequent /r/anime and I keep track of everything through [my anime list](http://myanimelist.net/animelist/Kafke). I like a wide range of shows from action stuff like Death Note and Baccano! to more light hearted shows like K-On! (yes, I'm one of those people).

I don't know how much I'll be able to gift right now, seeing as most of my money is going toward living costs and school costs. But I'm working on getting an internship over the summer and will hopefully be able to gift some people.

So... Any one else here like games and anime? Is anyone into computers and programming? General interests?

It’s been five days since the music festival and I still can’t sleep.  I’ve already purchased my tickets to go see Bassnectar perform again a few months and 600 miles from now.  I’ve been continuing to go to work at the semiconductor company where I’m an engineering intern and I can’t stop coming up with amazing ideas to pursue in regards to production control fixes.  This upcoming weekend is a four day weekend due to the fourth of July and I can’t wait for it to come.  I get off work after another amazing day at the office and proceed to head home as usual.  I am so excited to go cliff jumping tomorrow that I can’t contain my excitement.  I start jamming out to the music I’m listening to at the light and proceed to get weird looks from the car next to me.  I laugh and continue jamming, really, really hard.  
I make it home and proceed to head to my office where I’ve spent the past few days and nights watching videos on youtube and reaching out to the people who’ve created them, offering my opinions on their material as well as commending their dedication to their videos.  I spend the next few hours doing the same and eventually realize that I need to eat dinner.  I start cooking spaghetti and realize that there’s a ladybug on the ceiling.  I feel as though this is a sign for the upcoming fun tomorrow and pay close attention to what the ladybug is doing.  It starts walking on the light fixture above me and I start to count how many squares it’s traveled on the plastic covering of the light.  14.  I make sure to remember this number as it’s sure to help me in my adventure the following day.  I finish cooking and eat my well-made spaghetti, it’s delicious.
After cleaning up the dishes, I go back to the office and make the stark realization that chairs are evil and that I shouldn’t be using one.  Chairs promote a sedentary lifestyle that I can’t even imagine living at the moment and it bothers me to be in the same room as one.  It goes out into the living room.  The ladybug has followed me into this room, I take this as another sign that the number 14 is going to be vastly important.  I start to listen to music on soundcloud and play a song by NitGrit called “The Awakening”.  I remember that there’s a video someone made to it and proceed to watch it:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Wcv5sfiuQU
Its super trippy and I somehow feel connected to it, that the ladybug who is on the ceiling is somehow trying to tell me about life lessons.  After it finishes, I start to scribble everything that comes to mind down on my dry erase calendar on the wall.  To me, everything is interconnected and makes perfect sense.  I draw one line from a realization to another, thinking of the ways these things interconnect and are meant to be.  I’m a genius.  The rest of the night continues on, with me listening to more music on soundcloud and writing the artists, telling them how I want to start a music label and that they should hit me back if they’re interested.  
The morning comes and my friends arrive for our trip out to the waterfall where we’ll be cliffjumping and swimming.  I still haven’t slept.  I show them all of the amazing connections on my calendar and proclaim how excited I am about life.  One friend seems to get what I’m saying and comments on a few of the connections and how it’s an interesting take on the relationship.  I agree and am stoked that someone else shares my new view on life.  We pack our things into the car and proceed to get ready to head out.  My neighbors are outside, a young couple in their late twenties doing some yard work.  I strike up a conversation about the weather since it was nice out and proceed to fill them in on our entire trip planned for the day.  They seem curious about cliffjumping since they’ve never done it before so I tell them that it’s about the best natural rush you can possibly get.  I’m having the best day ever I think to myself.  
	We finish packing and head down to the local REI.  Me and a friend are going to buy some Vibram five fingers for the trip.  In our opinion, these are going to be the best shoes ever to go cliff jumping with, and I willing drop $90 on a brand new pair.  I buy a year-long membership to REI while I’m there because hell, why not.  We pick up parking passes for the place that we’re heading to and embark on the short trek out there.  On the way, I’m starting to feel how the music we’re listening to is affecting our immediate moods.  It’s also interesting to me to note when we drive through shady spots as opposed to light spots.   I’m convinced that something about the shade brings out more negative conversation than that of when we’re in the light.  I keep telling my passenger to make notes of the some of the things that we’re thinking up on the way out there.  “Wandering thought train of love” is what I feel we are while in my car and am stoked on it.  Rolling down the windows completely changes the dynamic of the ride and each billow is affecting my mood.  I’m amazed that I hadn’t noticed how light and sound affected me previously and make sure to tell my friend to jot down (364) because it represents the light spectrum from a computer’s standpoint.  
	We arrive at the exit and no joke, its number 41.  I take this immediately as a good omen because of the number 14 that the ladybug had told me the previous night.  I get utterly excited and know that I am meant to be here at this place with all of these specific people.  We make the 2-mile hike in to the waterfall and setup shop at its base.  There are tons of people that I know here who I wouldn’t normally expect to see and I start to feel as though I’m the reason that they’re here.  People from my high school, people from work, and people from my college all in the same spot enjoying what I feel to be the most beautiful day ever.  I start talking to one of my friends from college, saying how I’m never smoking or drinking or doing drugs ever again because I’m so high on life.  He questions me on it and I argue that there is no better high than being completely sober because it allows you to experience all of your senses to the max.  He shurgs, agrees, and walks off with beer in hand.  
	The day progresses and I meet an Indian fellow taking pictures of the waterfall.  I ask whether or not he’s from Gao as I would love to visit there someday.  I’ve heard about headphone parties they have there where there are 3 DJs spinning and you can select which one to listen to on your headphone frequency selector.  I take his contact info down in my phone because I really want to go to India.  Cliffjumping concludes and I depart from my group to head the complete opposite direction where my parents live.  I realize I haven’t packed anything for the 3 day weekend but I could care less.  All I have on is a shirt, shorts and my vibrams.  
	On the drive out, I stop at a local convenience store/ gas station to pick up some gas and grub.  I feel as though I’m meant to stop here.  I start talking to these teens who have the same hat as one of my friends that I was at the musical festival with.  I ask if they know her and it turns out that they do.  I’m not surprised by this because I’m at the point where I’m feeling all powerful and that everything is happening for a reason.  I text my friend saying that I met Lucas, one of her friends from the ski camp where these teens were staying.  I get a huge question mark in return.  I proceed to the checkout and the cashier looks at me, and says that he was at the same music festival.  He tells me that he just went and was able to get in completely free.  I am now convinced that something divine is happening to me even though I’m not a religious person at all.

1eyhzv,0,2013-05-24,"I feel like this is something that bothers me, but I don't think many people will see it as a problem. Or at least, not yet.",mykelmontes815,ainbow,https://www.reddit.com/r/ainbow/comments/1eyhzv/i_feel_like_this_is_something_that_bothers_me_but/,"I understand we're currently in an era in which a majority of society view gay rights as a necessary value, while at the same time, we are struggling with legalizing same-sex marriage everywhere since there are still people intolerant of homosexuality. So, I feel like there is an issue that needs to be acknowledged, but will most likely be ignored since we already have the main problem.

Still, I'd like to ask about the issue of today's teens that come out and try to define themselves with their orientation. Most teens want to be noticed, and will do so by finding something to be recognized by, and many will use sexual orientation. I think that this has resulted in some teens lying to themselves about their own orientation after seeing how interesting gay culture is. I've noticed it with a friend I knew in middle school who temporarily considered himself bisexual.

I'm not saying that teens that come out as gay/bisexual today are lying, but I believe that some are.

My sister has this friend who is openly gay. Before he came out, I believe he did have a crush on my sister. I'm not sure. But when he came out, my sister said that his attitudes and behavior changed. He would speak loudly and with feminine tone with many friends, but would speak completely calmly and naturally with my sister. He also made his straight friends uncomfortable by hitting on them, to the point where the straight friends had to tell him to stop.

I also know of another gay young man who is very trendy and fashionable (his Facebook profile said he was an intern at Vogue) who was in a group of friends I saw at Starbucks. Two of my friends talked with them, and when the group of friends left, the gay young man called to my friend and said ""See you when you turn 18"". I've also seen a picture on Facebook of a student with a substitute teacher, and the young man commented on it saying ""This sub looks very fuckable.""

I think that it is fairly annoying when straight people bring up their sexual desires when it is unwelcome and I believe it is equally annoying when people of another orientation do the same. It would be hard for one to speak out about it because that person would risk being viewed as homophobic. I truly believe that sexual orientation should not define a full person. I understand that this was a good thing to do when people needed to rebel in order to defend homosexuality, but these days, I think homosexuality should be blended in so that sexual orientation becomes only a normal human characteristic, along with ethnicity, height, weight, hair color, eye color, etc.

I feel like the type of teenagers that I complain about only make it harder for intolerant folks to learn to accept homosexuality in society, and also contradict the idea that sexual orientation is a natural gene that humans are born with. I think this is something that needs to be addressed so that orientation can be accepted by everybody without appearing abnormal.

Hopefully, I worded this well and didn't come across as offensive, and if I did come across as offensive, I apologize. But I am curious to know what others think."

I'm a 3rd year computer engineering student from Canada. I've taken a year off (to work as an intern) and I'm really interested in contributing to an open source project on the side. Cloud computing seems perfect for me because I love Infrastructure/Operating Systems while preferring a higher level language like Python. I do not have too much experience working with large codebases and I have little to no experience contributing to an open source project. Do you think it's a little over-ambitious as a first project? Should I focus on something easier? And if I do decide on OpenStack, where exactly do I start? There seems to be a sea of documentation that leaves me confused. I found the Nova compute platform relatively interesting.

All suggestions would be well appreciated :)"
1eyaui,6,2013-05-24,"Having a real hard time getting over a breakup, need to vent out a bit",TheBozzCL,MyLittleSupportGroup,https://www.reddit.com/r/MyLittleSupportGroup/comments/1eyaui/having_a_real_hard_time_getting_over_a_breakup/,"I've been reading some of the other posts around here, and my problems seem really minor compared to what other people are going through. Still, I've been having it rough lately, so I need to spit it out.

Last year I started dating a friend's sister. Everything was great for the first three months, we were really into each other... until she told her parents I have Asperger's. She didn't tell me she was going to do it, nor she did ask for my permission. I was devastated because it was a really hard topic for me at the time, especially without my consent, and fell into a depression that only got diagnosed recently.

I was deathly afraid of how they would react because I've been discriminated against and bullied because of my syndrome in the past; I thought ""What if they don't approve of me now? What if my girlfriend changes her mind about me?"". One would think that it should change nothing... but things *did* change. She became progressively more distant and cold, and whenever I asked if anything was wrong she would say she just was tired. She stopped inviting me over to her house and having lunch with me, and whenever I complained we were spending too little time together she said she was too busy with her internship. That didn't stop her from spending time with me before, but I decided to trust her and do my best to cope with my insecurity.

Two months went by this way, with her becoming more and more distant but denying anything was wrong, and me feeling more insecure and unwanted. In the end, we were spending maybe an hour per week together. I blew up and told her I couldn't take it, that I felt she was not interested in our relationship anymore. She called me selfish and said I could not expect her to spend more time on me. We had an argument and decided to take a break to think things through. She didn't talk to me for a whole week, and whenever I tried to talk to her she would push me away. In the end, I had to ask her brothers what was wrong... they both said she didn't want to be with me anymore.

The next day she talked to me, and broke up with me using lame excuses and even lying to me to make me feel guilty. This devastated me. I mean, she never even voiced a complaint about me and now she's so desperate to get away from me as to not even give me a proper breakup? I was dumbfounded for a month, but then I became incredibly angry. I didn't do anything to her to deserve that treatment. I made the mistake of venting out on Facebook... of course she heard about it. She called me and told me she wanted to talk to clear things out. I said no, because I still was too hurt and needed more time to heal. So she proceeded to write me an email with everything she wanted to say. I didn't want to read it, but I forced myself to because I felt that at least I could learn something. I was wrong: it was all even lamer excuses and childish banter. I couldn't believe it, *this* was her way of clearing things up? In the end, I just gave her what her wanted: I told her I understood what happened better now, then I told her that I loved her for real, that not having her with me hurt too much so I needed her to stay away from me. We haven't talked or seen each other since then.

It's been about seven months since she broke up with me. During that time, I've been going to therapy to try and overcome my fear of being discriminated, as well as trying to understand what went wrong with our relationship. It took us a lot of effort because many of the things she said and did were so contradictory, but in the end we had to accept it was because I have Asperger's... literally *nothing* else happened that could have driven her away the way it did and make her leave without any explanation at all. It's very probable her parents stopped approving of me, and their approval was way too important for her. My therapist says I need to understand she's way too immature for her age (she's 24). I have a hard time understanding it, tho, it's just too alien to me. It hurts a lot to think about it, even now.

In the meantime, lots of other things have happened: I severed contact my ex's brothers (both were really good friends, even after their sister broke up with me) and I distanced myself from our group of friends because I didn't know how to deal with the situation and they were making too many questions; I realized I can't really use the rest of my friends to vent out or as support because they know my ex or her family too; my family is too far away to give me any real support, and those who are closer don't understand anything about my condition or my past traumas; my depression and self-questioning have caused me to realize I took a wrong turn in my choice of career studies, which I still don't know how to deal with since this is my last semester before graduating. To top it off, right now I feel like I'm going to stay alone forever, with my circle of friends shrinking and little to no free time to meet new people because of college. My therapist and psychiatrist have helped a lot, I have to admit... but there's times I still feel overwhelmed by all of this.

I am writing to inquire about possible internships in the HVAC field at COMPANY; my résumé is enclosed for your consideration. COMPANY philosophy that engineers should never stop learning and be on the cutting edge of technology appeal to me as a learning mechanical engineer.

Currently I am pursuing a bachelors of Science degree in mechanical engineering from COLLEGE. During my senior year I took a HVAC design course. The class required heating and cooling load calculation to be performed and from these calculations the hydronic and duct system were developed and implemented. The HVAC project introduced me to certain aspects of engineering, such as the economical aspect, efficiency, and the feasibility of the design.

In the course of my three years at COLLEGE, I have demonstrated my motivation, energy, and passion for engineering. In addition, I have learned to work efficiently under tremendous stress and, with limited resources, to accomplish goals. I would welcome the opportunity to contribute these abilities to COMPANY. I am available for an interview at your convenience. If you would like to call me rather than email me back, you can reach me at PHONE NUMBER. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Since day three of my freshmen year, I've been dating my girlfriend. We actually got together out of a hook-up; I was being an adventureous college male and stumbled into a 4 year relationship.

Since the beginning, we've had a lot of problems: she's pretty clingy, she's jealous time I don't spend with her, the list goes on. Half way through our freshmen year, she had a mental breakdown due to depression. I spent my entire second semester taking care of here, as she had made no friends except me. During this time, due to forced counseling I made her receive, she was diagnosed as bi-polar.

Near the end of that year, she had to take a medical leave from school to avoid failing her semester. Against my better judgement, I helped her lobby my mother to allow her to move in with me at my family's apartment during the summer. She did, and after I finished school, we spent the first part of the summer together. As that summer went on, I began to doubt us, and grow resentful of here; I worked all day and would want to see friends at night, but she just wanted to sit in her room and watch television from dawn to dusk. 

At about July of that summer, I asked her to go home a few times abortively, but chickened out and asked her to stay after I saw her reaction. It was about this time she began to say suicidal things over the possibility of me leaving her. Eventually, my mother had enough and bascially forced her to go home; though I acted hurt in front of her, I was secretly incredibly grateful to my mom. I moved her back to her home in another state and spent the rest of the summer apart, though still together long distance.

Start of Sophmore year. Both of us return to school, different dorms and all. The time we spent together only increased, and not by my choice, but I continued to go along stupidly. She remained very clingy, and she also completed neglected her schoolwork, while hiding the failure from her parents. Mid-way through this year, she began pushing the marriage question, and being weak, I gave in and start looking at engagement rings with her just to make my life easier.

After failing her whole year almost, summer came again. This time, I tried putting my foot down and told her I was through with it. We were apart for a few days, but after about a week, she turned up back in my city having found a job and a family friend to live with for the summer. I tried ignoring her, but..I gave in again and starting seeing her again. It's probably good to note at this point that my family hated her, and vice versa. So...ashamedly, I started lying to both parties over dating her.

Junior year. Much as the same as the last two years: she failing all her classes to remain with me, while I continued on blindly because I was too weak to break it off. I felt drained and beaten every day, and I continue to today, even long distance. At the end of this year, I got an extremely important internship that required me to travel across the country. Lying to her about the job requiring me to live where they told me, I left for a blissful free summer away from her.

Finally, to my final senior year, this year. Due to her family being unable to continue to pay for her to attend school and fail every class, she has lived at home three hours away the entire year. The freedom has been wonderful, especially since I finally had time to be a college kid with my friends and roommates. But almost weekly trips up to see her, as well as her taste in dining out and shopping, have drained me financially, put me in debt and left me destroyed.

And now..I'm a week away from graduation and I can't do it anymore. I've lied to her so much; part of me blames her, but part of me feels like I'm culpable for leading her on for so many ears. I really don't want or am able to have her see me graduate, and I just can't continue. I have a job lined up across the country, and I don't want to bring her or be with here anymore. 

But whenever I try to break it off face to face, whether at a neutral place like a mall in between us, or at either of our homes, I find myself clawing in to escape the pain, the heartbreak, the crying and her hysteria. She knows exactly what to do to sink me back in, the exact words and all. I know she's the type that will continue even if I break it off; I'm paranoid she will show up at my graduation with my family and start trouble.

 I'm a defeated and weak man. I don't know how I can do it; over the phone, a text message, Skype, and then just stop talking to her? She know's where I live, she has a million excuses to rope me in. I have stuff of hers, she has stuff of mine. She has five million guilt trips to keep me and I feel absolutely powerless to be free. I can't take this anymore Reddit! I know I've contributed by being a lying asshole, but I can't figure out how to make this right for everyone involved.

I had great friends, with whom i had a great time both in and outside of school. I felt awesome back then.

Second year started, still great, still awesome, when suddenly my best friend ever quit his studies without letting anyone know, including me. By this time, i was running behind on my studies, and got into more and more classes with people i didn't know and who had formed friend groups of their own. I was waiting for my best friend to come back, thinking he was just sick and needed some rest. half a year passed, and i decided to contact him anyway. Which is when i discovered he quit.

So then the next year started. I was alone by now, all my friends had gained on me and i ran behind even more. I had no idea how to get accepted into other friend groups, and got more and more lonely. My social life stopped existing.

3 years later, i decided to quit the studies. I was feeling very lonely, and my internship at a high school wasn't going as planned. My coach saw that i didn't feel at home and asked me why i hadn't quit earlier. It was all because i told myself this was what i wanted to do all my life.

Since my best friend left, my social development stopped. I'm 24 now, started a new study to become a lab assistant, and i've felt like i've made some friends, but i feel like it's not really friendship. It feels empty, and fake. It feels like I'm not giving everything to be friends, and I think i'm doing this because i'm afraid to lose another friend. I never ask anyone to go out, because i want others to ask me, which hasn't happened so far. I'm afraid of people. I'm afraid of making friends because they'll leave me anyway(which is probably not true at all, i know. But i need proof to believe that again...)

the only people i consider real friends are people i've met online, and chat with online on a regular basis. We meet up about 2 or 3 times a year, which makes me feel loved and cherished.

At school I feel like i'm being watched all the time. When i try to be funny, it fails. When i try to make friends with the people who have more friends, it fails. They look at me like i'm some sort of nerd who's trying to be popular. I'm just a normal person, but i don't know how to make friends without losing them. I do have some people i sit with, play games with and talk with at break time, but it just doesn't feel like

i still live with my parents. I should have moved out a long time ago, but that wasn't possible because of money and failing studies. I imagine my life will be a lot better when it comes to a social life when i move out (which is going to be soon), because then i'll be living nearer people my age.

Anyway, i feel lonely and needed to vent some of this. I know what i need to do, but i just don't have the courage to do it...

I have also been told that I was too much of a pessimist by my mother recently, but crap keeps happening and once in a while, even a minor success would be nice.

She's self-motivated, down to earth, and has these incredible eyes. She's exactly the kind of girl I've been wanting to meet in college.

She's an amazing kisser and, when she opens up, becomes a resilient, yet hopeful and sensitive person.

At moments of intimacy when we look into each other's eyes, I feel like crying because of how incredibly close I feel to her. I don't feel close to other people very often at all.

REALITY CHECK: 
I've probably already put too much pressure on this girl and this relationship in my mind. It's still very new. She might not see things the same way, and I'm way too insecure and cautious to make assumptions about her behavior. I'm leaving for an internship out-of-state within the week. When I come back in a few months, who knows where things will stand. 

I'll just have to use some patience, take things one at a time, and see if this goes anywhere. Fingers crossed.

My boyfriend and I have been dating for almost a full year. We go to the same college on the East Coast, but we are working in different countries over the summer so we are ""long-distance"" for 4 months. This has been hard, but we've been doing okay so far.


Here's where it gets a little hinky. **Once we get back from summer, we will be spending our last semester together.** This is because my boyfriend, Nate, is graduating and moving back to his home city (City 1) in Asia, and if his job this summer goes well, will be working full-time in City 2 (also in Asia). So City 1 and City 2 are going to be his main homes after school, and he doesn't plan on ever coming back to the United States again (due to a mixture of reasons, cultural and career-related).  After he graduates, I still have one semester left to finish college.


*Note: sorry for the vagueness of the locations; I am super paranoid and feel that the combination of cities and the situation is unique and there's a 1-in-1000 chance my boyfriend will chance upon this thread (he's a redditor).*


We have, at this point, realized that due to 1) my being primarily based in the States, all of my job opportunities will likely be in the States in the future, as well as my friends and my life, really and 2) his life is back in Asia, where he has friends and family, in addition to him not liking the culture in the States, that we should not pursue our relationship together after he graduates. **We will break up once he leaves the States.**


This decision has nothing to do with how much we love each other, or how compatible we are. It is purely because realistically, our paths are never going to cross after he leaves. It will be too hard, and even unfair, for one of us to uproot ourselves and sacrifice our familiar lives, job opportunities, and a lot of other things to move across the world to be with the other. I think it is a mature understanding, and we intend to make the best of the time we have left together. 


Unfortunately, it has also been breaking my heart since we've reached the decision, and as a result, I've been foolishly looking for ways to make this work. I just can't wrap my head around the fact that I'm supposed to give up on the one guy I've come to love because of something out of our control. We share the same heritage (both Asian, but he grew up in Asia whereas I grew up in the States), same sense of humor, sense of financial responsibilities, and most political and philosophical issues. Damn me that I've always been the type who can never just let it go. 






**Here's the catch:**


I am interning for a very large and well-known company based in NYC (where I will be this summer) that has headquarters all around the world, including one in City 2. What coincidence, then, that City 2 has been my dream work city ever since junior year of high school when I was lucky enough to vacation there. I fell in love with the city, the people, and the culture almost immediately (this goes way back before our relationship, and has nothing to do with Nate). 


I know it's a long shot. But I somehow convinced myself that at the end of my internship, if I can score a full-time job with this company (reasonable) and somehow magically be able to transfer to the City 2 location in a different department (not as realistic)...I can't help but wonder if we would be able to reconsider our ""planned breakup"" (super duper really not realistic, like seriously in trouble here). 


Reddit, I've been a long-time lurker and admirer of the sound advice that you've given to people here. Can you help me figure this out? Please knock some sense into me, no kid gloves needed, honest opinions appreciated. Heck, at this point, the fact that you've read this far is appreciated. :)


**TL;DR** I've been beating myself up for allowing myself to hope for a chance to simultaneously land a job in my dream city and continue my relationship with my boyfriend. I can't tell if I'm grasping at straws and need to wake the fuck up or if this is actually a glimmer of hope that I can work towards this summer. 

**edit**: I added some bolding/formatting because I pressed ""submit"" and the wall of text even scared me! So sorry for writing a novel. Let me know if the bolding helps or annoys you. "
1f0ihi,11,2013-05-25,I stole a bottle of liquor while at a work party,hey_hey_throaway,confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1f0ihi/i_stole_a_bottle_of_liquor_while_at_a_work_party/,"I know comparatively this must seem minor, but it's something that's been eating away at me. Last night I was at a bar with the company where I intern, I had had a few drinks at this point and had somehow, in the search for a restroom, wandered into the downstairs cellar area where they keep all the liquor. I remember looking at all of it, mostly admiring it, and then, as if possessed by someone else, I grabbed a bottle and put it in my bag. I went back upstairs and the suspicious doorman asked me how I even got down there in the first place (I came up a different way than I had gone down). I really have no idea how I got down there. Later in the night the doorman approached me again, asking how I got down there, acting (rightfully so) very suspicious of me, and out of fear and embarrassment  I left very shortly after that. 

I've never stolen anything in my life before this. I have no idea why I did what I did. I dont even like the type of liquor I stole (I threw it away this morning without even opening it). The fact that I was at a work related event makes it so much worse. I have this immense fear that they caught me on camera and they put the cost of the bottle on the companies tab, ultimately allowing me to lose my internship. Or that they caught me and told my boss, and on Monday when I go in I will face an awkward sit down and, once again, termination. Me being an intern I am obviously at the bottom of the totem pole, so them firing me and me losing a reference would really be nothing to them.

I needed to confess this because I feel awful, and I fear that someone who works at that bar could be blamed for that missing bottle. I fear that the wonderful people I work with know, and feel betrayed. I fear I will lose my job over one stupid drunken impulse decision."

I'm looking for a 1 bedroom or studio that's pretty cheap (I'm hoping to stay around 500 a month) but I can only do a 3 month lease, since I'll be moving back to school after that.

Also, I'll be working on the west side, near Avon on Rockville road, so close to there would be ideal, but nowhere too sketchy, since I'll be a single, 21 year-old girl living alone in an unfamiliar city...

1f3o8c,19,2013-05-26,My ex-boyfriend is engaged. I don't know how to feel.,[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1f3o8c/my_exboyfriend_is_engaged_i_dont_know_how_to_feel/,"This is a bit cathartic. I'm trying to sift through unanticipated, complex feelings. 

We were together for 4 years, from the time I was 18 until I was 22. Two years into our relationship, he moved about 6 hours away to go to law school, but we maintained a  long distance relationship for two years, and it didn't diminish the significance of our relationship. 

I'd known him since I was six years old. He was my next-door neighbor for about a year; he and my younger brother were buddies. I have a lot of funny memories from that time, after-school Power Rangers, building forts with blankets and going to the moon, that sort of thing. Eventually, he moved away, as did my family. I saw him again when I was 14; he worked at a movie theater nearby. The chubby kid who was possessive with his ""magic rocks"" morphed into a skinny, industrial-music loving teenager with hair down to his ass. It was always kind of funny going to the theater and seeing him; he had no idea who I was but I remembered. When I began working at that same theater a few years later, it didn't take long for us to reconnect. We began dating a month before I graduated high school, and by June, I had my first boyfriend.

The first two years we were together, I was a mess, but looking back on it, I've never really had it together. High school, well, I did really well, but I spent some time with the wrong crowd. He was strictly against substance abuse, so I quit smoking pot and cigarettes (the cigarettes made their way back into my life though...it was an issue). When I moved out to go to college, I was extremely homesick. He transferred to the same university; I ended up living with him. At this point we had been together 3-4 months. Enter madness.

My mother began her rendez-vous with crack-cocaine that summer, and that little appointment ended up being a three-year marriage. She was a full-blown addict; a panhandler, lived in ""crackhouses"", sold her body. She lived the lifestyle. We wouldn't see her for months, she would show up so, so thin wearing the clothes I wore in middle school. She would leech off of my grandparents and then disappear. Eventually, she went to jail; she has been clean for 3 years. 

Meanwhile, at college, I was spent most of my time playing World of Warcraft, and doing well enough in school to keep my scholarships. Those years...it's funny to laugh about how insecure you are in your late-teens/early-twenties, but for a lot of people, that insecurity manifests itself in other ways. Food made me anxious, people made me anxious, he made my anxious. I was mean. MEAN, MEAN, MEAN. To him. And jealous...so jealous. And for what? What good does it do to be insecure when you significant other has female friends? It just pushes them away. And being that unhappy with your body that you would toss up your meals. I was a mess. My roommate, whom I love dearly, is at that age. I am 25 now. I tell her that it gets easier to love yourself. To understand who you are, what your strengths and shortcomings are, what you look like; the cellulite, the unibrow, the naivete, the cankles. She doesn't believe me. Insecurity doesn't completely go away for anyone, ever. But it diminishes as time goes on. I wish I had understood this when we were together or never understood it at all so I could never realize how awful I was. And he put up with me. To this day, I feel terrible; I am ashamed of a lot of things I did and said.

Naturally, after two years together with some pretty big issues, you decide whether or not you are going to part ways. He was pressing me to find my own place my junior year of college. He was getting ready to go off to law school somewhere. It was a good point in our relationship to break it off. We talked about it, we were both upset, but I insisted that I would change. 

*I can change, I can change, I can change. If it helps you fall in love.*

Heh. He was unconvinced, but things got better. And then he found out he got into a really school law school and would be an idiot to stay here in lieu of attending that school. Fuck it, I wasn't going to end it over him moving 6 hours away. I loved him. And as he said the evening before he left, if it doesn't work, it wouldn't be because of the distance. It just wasn't meant to be. And it wasn't.

For two years, we saw each other twice a month. I would drive up once a month for a weekend, and he would drive down two weeks later. We alternated holidays and breaks for the most part. We made it work. The first year of long distance, I lived in a dorm. I spent my days studying, working out, working in lab. I got my first scientific publication, decided I wanted to get my Ph.D in the biological sciences, so I worked at it. The second year we did long distance, I got my own apartment, and I made friends. I started to go out, to do my own thing, and that works when you have a significant other who lives 6 hours away. But when they're around, you feel obligated to stay home when you don't want to, and he wasn't the type to hang out with me and my friends. He didn't drink, and we were at different places in our lives. And when he came home to do a summer internship, I wasn't ready to settle back into the life I was living two years ago. After four years, it was over.

I know. I'm selfish. And I spent the summer numbing how I felt about the past four years, how much they meant to me, and how terribly it ended. I was a cunt. People tell you that you shouldn't feel bad for leaving something that wasn't working. But it was how I left it. There was no grace there. He deserved more than that. And I'm happy he found someone who deserves him. 

Three months after we broke up, I met a person who would spend the next year depleting a lot of things from me. He was a terrible person, but I it opened my eyes to a lot of things. It changed the way I treat people. And made me realize how terrible I was in my previous relationship. 

I wish I could write him up and apologize. For yelling at him over a parking pass, waking him at at 4 am and accusing him of cheating, for not going to Lego Land with him for his birthday, that I realize I was terrible, I know that. And I'm sorry. I would thank him for always telling me I was beautiful, and smart, and could do better than the mediocrity I immersed myself in. I'm happy he has found someone...and he should *never change, never change, never change.*

But I won't. We don't speak anymore.

*Edit* I guess I've painted a pretty sorry picture of myself. I broke up with said person 3 years ago. I do not have any residual romantic interest in this person; they were dead before it ended. I do not want to reconnect and ruin this person's relationship with someone. When I say I am happy for someone that does not mean I want to destroy the relationship they are currently in. When I say someone ""depleted a lot of things from me"", I mean they smothered me, hit me, called me any name under the sun, abused my cats, never let me be alone. They took away my ability to be elusive. I endured it because I thought I deserved it. I am the advice-giver to my friends, I have been single for a while, and the one boyfriend I did have told me I was ""a good catch, but he just couldn't see it."" He was ""never going to care about me as much as I cared about him"". I got something off my chest. I never had bad intentions. I just wanted to know that someone understood how I felt.

Sometimes people have problems, and sometimes people need a little help.

I live by those words.

My friend who's going to NYU Stern next year told me that on the application, you can check off NYU Stern and ALSO check off ""I would also like to be considered for CAS"" just in case you dont get into Stern, you can still go to CAS. Is this true?

Also here are my stats... what I'm worried about is my GPA...

GPA: 3.6 UW/4.5, 3.8 weighted out of 4.5, which IF I'M DOING PROPORTIONS....3.6 weighted out of 4.0.

SAT I: 1950, 2120 on 2nd try (a large improvement)
SAT II: anticipating a low 700 for Math II and high 600 for US History lol

APs: anticipating 4/5 on APUSH, Micro/Macro economics, 5 on AB Calculus

senior year Im taking 4 more APs

I have a LOT of actually solid ECs: president of FBLA, state assembly representative of JSA, boy scouts for 7 years (won't make eagle scout though), lots of clubs/leadership in the clubs, played at Carnegie Hal 2x for piano, won a lot of piano competitions.... 

also I'm gonna get 2 very good teacher recs AND a rec from a NYU professor at Steinhardt (which isn't NYU Stern but still) so that might help me out :D **edit: I'm getting the rec because Im doing an internship for him/her this summer. also Im doing that internship and maybe getting another job over the summer in fashion.**

tbh NYU fits me like a glove, I cant see myself going anywhere else. also I come off as an intelligent/anti-society person so like a hipster........ businessman, i dont fucking know

can I get into Stern or should I try my luck at CAS? or can I do the above listed application method still......."

Generally I'll be okay, but sometimes I slip into a crazy mood swing and start snapping at people. Just earlier I snapped again and began verbally attacking my boyfriend for something that wasn't even his fault. I feel so terrible about it now but I don't even know why I reacted the way I did.

It's my third year in college and I'm very stressed out on getting an internship or summer job, neither is working out. I've also lost a lot of motivation for what I'm doing, and my grades are slipping. I still have a very high GPA but I feel like complete shit at what I'm doing now. Most of the times now I feel so worthless and tired, but I can't seem to get any motivation. I'd try to go for counselling but even that is falling out because school is ending and their almost fully booked. What are some things that I can do and how can I manage this properly?

Bear with me.

I don't know if it's that I love cheating so much as I love the thrill of the chase. That feeling of finding a girl, getting to know her, flirting, exchanging texts at all hours of the day, and finally hooking up... I love it. It's my drug of choice. Then after we've had our fun a couple of times, it's on to the next girl. Most of the time it's mutual, other times I'm a complete piece of shit and crush the girl.

It started with my first girlfriend. We started dating when we were both 16, until we were 18. During the last 3-4 months of our relationship, we both started to realize it wasn't going to work. We were graduating in a few weeks, going to different colleges, pursuing different life goals. We stuck it out as long as we could because we didn't know any better.

With the fact that we were doomed no matter what looming over me, my mind started to wander. One of my older friends took me to see one of my favorite bands as a graduation gift. (Queens of the Stone Age, front row, amazing show) Anyway, at the concert, I met this really cute girl that was standing behind me during the show. Before the opening act, we started to flirt and make small talk. Between sets, it kept going, and I let her get in front of me for Queens because I'm pretty tall. The show got loud and crazy, and our bodies were close the entire show. I put my arms around her waist at one point because of the insane moshing behind us, and she held them there. It was the first time I'd had any type of romantic contact with a girl other than my girlfriend in like 2 years. Just having my arms around her waist just blew me away. We ended up holding hands through the rest of the show, on and off.

After it was all over, we exchanged numbers, and immediately started texting while my friend and I were driving home. It started innocently enough, getting to know each other and whatnot. Found out she was my age, about to graduate, single, all kinds of stuff that attracted me to her. We began texting and talking on the phone almost non-stop. I, of course, never mentioned my girlfriend. There was no motive for this. I honestly greatly enjoyed talking to her, and it was clear she had a crush on me. The chances of us never talking again were too high to tell her.

A week or two passed, and we wanted to see each other. Problem was, she lived an hour and a half away. She didn't have a car, and I didn't have the most reliable vehicle in the world. One night, I threw caution to the wind and drove up to see her. She lived with her mom, who was out of the state seeing an ill family member, or something. We had the house, and weekend to ourselves. I knew what this meant. I KNEW what would happen if I went up there. I told my parents that some friends and I were spending the weekend at a friend's place, not doing a damn thing but play video games, order pizza, and act like hooligans. We did this a couple weekends a month, so they bit. On the other hand, I told my girlfriend that me and the friend who took me to the concert were going on a little road trip. She believed me, and even packed me a sweet little care package to have on the trip. A cute gesture that I gave zero fucks about...

Anyway, I get to the girl's house, and it's awesome. We didn't do anything but hug at first. We hung out, talked, went on a midnight snack run, and spent most of the night and early morning watching movies, flirting, and all that good stuff. We finally start getting serious, and the first kiss happened. It was heaven. I loved it. I loved everything about it. The fact that she was hot, a good kisser, and the fact that I was getting some on the side.

Now I guess I should mention that I had a healthy sex life with my girlfriend. It wasn't mind-blowing by any means, but it was good. I wasn't starved for sex.

Eventually kissing turned into making out, which turned in to going to her bed, which turned into getting naked. You see where this is going. We didn't have a condom, so it ended with the both of us getting each other off orally. She wasn't BETTER than my girlfriend, just different. And I loved it. She swallowed, which is no big deal to me, but it wasn't something my girlfriend did. She came multiple times when I went down on her. Again, something my girlfriend didn't do. It was insanely hot. We spent the weekend together, got condoms for the next night, had crazy sex, barely slept a wink. We spent almost the whole weekend naked and doing some kind of sexual activity.

This post is getting pretty goddamn long, so I'll wrap it up soon, I swear.

This carried on for a while. It came to an end when she couldn't deal with me being far away, and on the verge of being further when I left for college. I essentially had two girlfriends. Long story short, both of them ended and I went off to college.

Freshman year, I met an astoundingly beautiful girl and we started dating. We fell in love, and it was the happiest I had ever been. Freshman year, sophomore year, junior year... it was all perfect. She was the prettiest girl I'd ever met, perfect in a million ways, the girl I knew I was going to marry. And yet the entire time we were together, my mind wandered. When we weren't hanging out, I actively thought of what it'd be like to hook up with other girls. I never pursued it, or rather, never got the chance to. But I look back on it and don't doubt for a second that I would gotten down with the first girl that came my way that wanted it.

As great as our relationship was, it came to a screeching halt before my senior year. She'd just graduated, and came clean that she couldn't see herself marrying my with my career path. I was majoring in theatre arts, and constantly in plays/musicals. I had a paid internship with a local theater that was going to become my real job upon graduation. She couldn't deal with my hectic lifestyle. The travelling, the late nights, etc. We broke up. I was utterly devastated, and severely depressed. I was madly in love with her and she broke my heart. I took to easy bar girls, dating sites, and girls I'd been wanting to bone for years to relieve myself. At any given time I was ""dating"" 2-3 girls at once, and hooking up with some rando from a bar every night of the weekend. Every time, it was the fact that it was a new girl that got me off. The chase, the thrill of new experiences. 75% of the time the sex was bad, but I didn't care.

Fast-forward.

I graduate, get into the professional world, get over my breakup, meet a real girl, fall in love, we move in together.

Present Day: We've been together for 2 years, lived together for almost a year. We're in love, happy, comfortable... it's all good. We have an amazing dog, she's a fellow actress, and we both run a theater and theatre-troupe in my city. Living the dream.
But I still can't go a day without wanting to jump the bones of the first girl that gives me a real shot. In my profession, it's not hard to find that. I've done the right thing and said ""no"" on two separate occasions since we've been together. I get cast in plays typically as the guy with a love interest. It's my type. Fitting... right...?

So occasionally that actress will come along who takes our stage relationship too far, and develops a crush. I, admittedly, develop it too, but restrain myself because I love my girlfriend. It's a struggle. A ridiculously hard struggle. The fact that I have to kiss other women all the time in plays doesn't help. Sometimes during the rehearsal process, those kisses become a little bit more real than just stage kisses. It would take only a word for me to take that kiss further sometimes.
I'm terrified that I'm going to ruin the best relationship of my life by giving in to a 'fetish' I've had since I was a kid. I love my life, my apartment, my job, my girlfriend, my dog... and I'd love just about all of it if I cheated. And sometimes, I don't care. That terrifies me. How could I be so willing to throw what I have away just to experience that rush? Is it sex addiction? Am I just a horrible person?

**TL;DR I cheated on my first real girlfriend, and have since been plagued with the desire to cheat in all of my relationships, current girlfriend included. It effects my daily life in that it's something I think about way too often, and I'm scared that I'll end up throwing everything away by giving into a problem I developed during my teen years.**"

Eventually kissing turned into making out, which turned in to going to her bed, which turned into getting naked. You see where this is going. We didn't have a condom, so it ended with the both of us getting each other off orally. She wasn't BETTER than my girlfriend, just different. And I loved it. She swallowed, which is no big deal to me, but it wasn't something my girlfriend did. She came multiple times when I went down on her. Again, something my girlfriend didn't do. It was insanely hot. We spent the weekend together, got condoms for the next night, had crazy sex, barely slept a wink. We spent almost the whole weekend naked and doing some kind of sexual activity. 

This post is getting pretty goddamn long, so I'll wrap it up soon, I swear.

This carried on for a while. It came to an end when she couldn't deal with me being far away, and on the verge of being further when I left for college. I essentially had two girlfriends. Long story short, both of them ended and I went of to college.

Freshman year, I met an astoundingly beautiful girl and we started dating. We fell in love, and it was the happiest I had ever been. Freshman year, sophomore year, junior year... it was all perfect. She was the prettiest girl I'd ever met, perfect in a million ways, the girl I knew I was going to marry. And yet the entire time we were together, my mind wandered. When we weren't hanging out, I actively thought of what it'd be like to hook up with other girls. I never pursued it, or rather, never got the chance to. But I look back on it and don't doubt for a second that I would gotten down with the first girl that came my way that wanted it. 

As great as our relationship was, it came to a screeching halt before my senior year. She'd just graduated, and came clean that she couldn't see herself marrying my with my career path. I was majoring in theatre arts, and constantly in plays/musicals. I had a paid internship with a local theatre that was going to become my real job upon graduation. She couldn't deal with my hectic lifestyle. The travelling, the late nights, etc. We broke up. I was utterly devastated, and severely depressed. I was madly in love with her and she broke my heart. I took to easy bar girls, dating sites, and girls I'd been wanting to bone for years to relieve myself. At any given time I was ""dating"" 2-3 girls at once, and hooking up with some rando from a bar every night of the weekend. Every time, it was the fact that it was a new girl that got me off. The chase, the thrill of new experiences. 75% of the time the sex was bad, but I didn't care. 

Fast-forward.

I graduate, get into the professional world, get over my breakup, meet a real girl, fall in love, we move in together.

Present Day: We've been together for 2 years, lived together for almost a year. We're in love, happy, comfortable... it's all good. We have an amazing dog, she's a fellow actress, and we both run a theater and theatre-troupe in my city. Living the dream.

But I still can't go a day without wanting to jump the bones of the first girl that gives me a real shot. In my profession, it's not hard to find that. I've done the right thing and said ""no"" on two separate occasions since we've been together. I get cast in plays typically as the guy with a love interest. It's my type. Fitting... right...?

So occasionally that actress will come along who takes out stage relationship too far, and develops a crush. I, admittedly, develop it too, but restrain myself because I love my girlfriend. It's a struggle. A ridiculously hard struggle. The fact that I have to kiss other women all the time in plays doesn't help. Sometimes during the rehearsal process, those kisses become a little bit more real than just stage kisses. It would take only a word for me to take that kiss further sometimes.

I'm terrified that I'm going to ruin the best relationship of my life by giving in to a 'fetish' I've had since I was a kid. I love my life, my apartment, my job, my girlfriend, my dog... and I'd love just about all of it if I cheated. And sometimes, I don't care. That terrifies me. How could I be so willing to throw what I have away just to experience that rush? Is it sex addiction? Am I just a horrible person?

**TL;DR** 
**I cheated on my first real girlfriend, and have since been plagued with the desire to cheat in all of my relationships, current girlfriend included. It effects my daily life in that it's something I think about way too often, and I'm scared that I'll end up throwing everything away by giving into a problem I developed during my teen years.**"

I'm a 20 yr. old male in college. I am 5'5"" or so, skinny, and white. Money is, fortunately, not an issue, but I feel quite uncomfortable sporting attires that have big names and logos covering them. I'm a quaint, down-to-earth person who's just looking for a little change - nothing to wow or dazzle here.

**Advice Needed:**

I'm going to be doing an internship this summer, and I'm looking to perhaps step away from what has been my persistent t-shirt and jeans combo with the occasional sweatshirt on colder days. I don't intend to never wear them again, but I'd like a slight change.

The internship is in a research lab in New England, but I will be in a control room-type setting dealing entirely with computers/programming and math, so I don't have to worry about spilled chemicals or anything. 

While I'm sure many scientists don't give a damn how they look and don't care how I look either, I'd like to wear something casual but not quite as ""grungy"" as a t-shirt and jeans. At the same time, I don't want to suit up, as there's no dress code, and that would seem out of place in a lab setting that I believe dresses fairly casual as a whole. I'm fine with wearing (dark) colored jeans unless I find other suggestions I prefer, but my main issue is I'm not really sure what to wear shirt-wise. 

Thanks! "

This is in response to your query on Christians responsibility with the environment and what we think.

I wrote this paper for my 'Book of Romans' class for an internship I'm in for my church in Seattle.  I hope it's somewhat clear.  

Would love to hear thoughts and opinions...before writing this I never gave much thought to the environment as a believer.  Cheers!


​Have you ever taken a walk outside during an exceptionally beautiful, sunny Seattle day?  Have you taken time to notice the beautiful green of the trees or the bright color of the many varieties of flowers that blossom in the spring?  Or have you ever driven over the 520 bridge towards Bellevue on a crisp, clear evening and been awed by the wonderful reds and oranges in the clouds during a sun set, while looking towards Mt. Ranier in all her glory?  Only recently have I personally taken note of the wonder of God’s creation.  As a kid, I traveled a lot; many times going back and forth across the country.  I have seen many amazing things, but I had taken for granted their intricacy and beauty.  
​Now as a young man, and one who has an established and loving relationship with the Lord, I am beginning to see His wisdom, genius, brilliance and even His love expressed in His creation.  David declares, “The earth is the LORD’s and all its fullness…” (Psalm 24:1 NKJV).  God crafted His planet Earth for His glory, that it would bring Him praise and honor.  This applies to humanity as well.  God’s original and coming purpose for man is to live perfected with Him in a perfect paradise.  But Adam’s sin postponed the fulfillment of this intention; however, God’s plan of redemption will ultimately bring the Earth and humanity back into His perfect will.  Our responsibility should reflect God’s original intention for us in the Earth.
​The Book of Genesis recounts man’s creation and his tasking, by God, to be stewards over the Earth.  In verse 27 of the first chapter, God, “created man in His own image; in the image of God he created him, male and female He created them.  Then God blessed them, and God said to them, ‘Be fruitful and multiply; fill the earth and subdue it; have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, and over every living thing that moves on the earth.’…”  This is man’s original purpose with relation to the Earth: steward it, lead it and rule it.
​When Adam and Eve sinned, God cursed the creation saying:
Cursed is the ground for your sake; in toil you shall eat of it all the days of your life.  Both thorns and thistles it shall bring forth for you…in the sweat of your face you shall eat bread till you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken; For dust you are, and to dust you shall return. Genesis 3:17-19
Mankind would no longer be allowed to enjoy the Earth but be forced to endure it because of his sin.  Solomon alludes to this in ‘Ecclesiastes’ when he says, “For what has man for all his labor, and for the striving of his heart with which he has toiled under the sun?  For all his days are sorrowful, and his work burdensome; even in the night his heart takes no rest.  This also is vanity.” (Ecclesiastes 2:22-23)  
​God’s plan of redemption through Jesus Christ is to bring us back into relationship with God and to ultimately have our corrupted, natural bodies redeemed, just as Christ’s resurrected body was redeemed.  As the Holy Spirit sanctifies us unto that day, with which Paul says that we hope for, the creation too looks forward to its redemption.  Paul, writing to the believers in Rome, says, “For the earnest expectation of the creation eagerly waits for the revealing of the sons of God.  For the creation was subjected to futility, not willingly, but because of Him who subjected in hope; because the creation itself will be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.” (Romans 8:19-21 NKJV).  Our sin brought a curse and corruption over God’s creation here on Earth.
​Grace, through Jesus, has brought redemption to our souls and eventually will be consummated in the redemption of our bodies.  Likewise, redemption will be brought to the creation, even as it now looks forward to that day with the same hope that we have.  The Apostle John writes in his ‘Revelation’ on the island of Patmos, while exiled by the Roman Emperor Nero, “Now I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away.  Also there was no more sea.” (Revelation 21:1) and God proclaims, “Behold, I make all things new.” (Revelation 21:5)  This new heaven and new earth, with the return of Jesus, ushers in a new era where man dwells with his God in paradise.  Thus, this is the fulfillment of God’s intended purpose for His creation.  
The prophet Isaiah describes the future glory of Zion, an image of heaven and paradise in the 35th chapter.  “The wilderness and the wasteland shall be glad for them, and the desert shall rejoince and blossom as the rose…the parched ground shall become a pool, abd the thirsty land springs of water; in the habitation of jackals, where each lay, there shall be grass with reeds and rushes.”  Finally, Isaiah forsees “But the redeemed shall walk there, and the ransomed of the LORD shall return and come to Zion with singing, with everlasting joy on their heads, they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.” (Isaiah 35:1-2, 7, 10)  
​Our heart toward the Earth should reflect God’s and we should realize our intended purpose as rulers and stewards of it.  Humanity has been given this wonderful gift of Earth, with all of her trees, animals, mountains and seas as an inheritance and blessing.  He created it for us to enjoy and where we could worship and glorify Him.  Thus, we should do our best to be good stewards, not intentionally destroying and polluting it.  But rather doing, to the best our abilities, to preserve the environment and practice healthy habits for sustaining ourselves and the planet.  
​
We know that we have been saved by grace, that we have relationship with God and that in the future we will be completely restored to perfection, even as Paul says that we now, “beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, just as by the Spirit of the Lord.” (2 Corinthians 3:18)  We even know that God will redeem the Earth when he returns.  But in the same way we are encouraged to live our lives with wisdom and with Godliness, we should treat the Earth in the same way; instead of being negligent, knowing what God will perform in it, we should treat it with care.
​However, we must beware that we don’t put so much of our emphasis on the Earth instead of God.  Paul says in the beginning of epistle to the Romans, that those who sin and worship themselves, “exchanged the truth of God for the lie, and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator…” (Romans 1:25 NKJV)  The Apostle John writes that the elders who sit before God’s throne in heaven declare, “And that You should reward Your servants the prophets and the saints, and to those who fear Your name, small and great, and should destroy those who destroy the earth.” (Revelation 11:18)
​We know what God will do in the future, but that does not give us free reign in continuing to harm the Earth intentionally.  We should be inclined, not given, to the Earth’s preservation as a means of worshiping and honoring God.  For this, is a part of His intended purpose for man, that we be rulers and stewards of His creation.

1f4s6x,1,2013-05-27,Today at work,[deleted],TalesFromThePharmacy,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromThePharmacy/comments/1f4s6x/today_at_work/,"So I don't usually work weekdays, but the pharmacist in charge asked me to fill in and tech today since we were short, and I needed the extra money.  I felt like coming on here and posting some stories from the day.  

First up I took in a prescription for Actonel for an older lady.  She handed me the Medicare/DVA copy of her (already dispensed, because it had a PBS sticker on it) script, with nothing attached, and asked 'Can I still use this?' 

*I'm posting from Australia - Aussie prescriptions always have a duplicate copy, which is attached to all repeats and is kept by the pharmacy after the person gets their final repeat filled, as well as a Medicare/DVA copy, which is the one that goes to government insurance (i.e. Medicare) with the PBS sticker attached to it after dispensing so that the pharmacy gets paid.  You need to have both copies otherwise the pharmacy can't dispense the script.*

I politely explained to the lady that the person who gave her out the script last time must have made a mistake to have given this back to her, as we needed to keep it to send to the government to get paid for the Actonel, and took instead the proper prescription with both copies that she (fortunately) had on her.  She then said to me, as I was writing out a ticket for her to pick up her script, 'Usually I only want to get one or two medications at a time, and when I pick up my scripts from here all the paper gets stapled together.  I wish they wouldn't do that.  I have to pull them apart and bring them in.  I've got so many loose pieces of paper like this at home.'

I wasn't really sure what to say at this point.  We have a lot of customers that take a lot of meds and only want certain ones filled - most pharmacies do staple all the repeats together for customers like this so nothing gets lost, and the customer usually just tells us what they want filled at the dropoff and we write it down.  I couldn't understand why she would think she needed to pull the paper apart.  
The pharmacist came over at this point to talk to her about bringing in the DVA copies with the stickers on them, so that we could get paid for dispensing her meds, and I went away to serve another customer.  Later I found out that the lady's husband had called in and said that he had dropped off the stickered copies to the competitor pharmacy across the road.  None of us had any clue why he would have done this - the pharmacist called the competitor and was told that the couple hadn't filled there for a couple of years.  So it looks like we aren't getting any money back for that Actonel - I hope she wasn't on anything else expensive.  

Anyway...

The next thing that happened today was much more standard fare.  A lady who spoke very little English informed us that she wanted three refills on each of her meds and that she wanted specific brands.  We ended up having to borrow a box of her simvastatin brand from the other pharmacy in our chain nearby because we didn't have enough.  All up there were 12 prescriptions that I needed to dispense and the pharmacist needed to check.  She decided to wait for them (of course) and the whole time she was there, asked every single staff member in the dispensary multiple times if it was ready yet.  The intern pharmacist was about ready to strangle her.  We were all very relieved when she paid for her meds and left the store.  

The retail manager is continuing to display blatant favouritism.  From the two years I have been working there, it's been common knowledge that those put on as supervisors with the ability to do refunds and count cash and such are very strongly preferred to be over eighteen due to the fact that they're often handling a lot of money.  The weekday floor supervisor that's been put on recently is sixteen.  She's also the retail manager's granddaughter.  The retail manager has this habit of playing favourites even with people who aren't her family members.  Her current one, a girl who is rude and condescending to the other staff but bends over backwards to fawn over the retail manager and the store owner, doesn't get given any cleaning jobs to do on the weekend, while the other girls had to do double the work.  Ugh.  

Anyway...that was my day at work today.  Just moderately crappy.  I would kind of like to read about other people's workdays in the comments (assuming I get any) but that's just me.  TL;DR: I was having a bit of a bitch about my job.  "

Thanks in advance for the consideration.

I had a fairly normal childhood. One older brother, parents divorced when I was 8. I was nerdy growing up and never really fit in. I got teased a bit, but nothing too serious. I never really had any interests, hobbies, or the like and even until today my mother always questioned/s ""Why don't you do __ like the other boys?"" ""Oh honey, normal boys don't like that stuff."" ..and the like. Both my parents always meant well and I was fortunate to be raised in a fairly affluent area and be well-traveled around the US. I was really studious, got good grades, steered way clear of trouble and did everything 'right'. Because I never really had a group of friends until senior year of high school, and because I was never really close to my family, I opted to go to college clear across to the other side of the country. I saw this as an opportunity to get a fresh start and to find my way.

Freshman year of college ('10 - '11) was great. I made an awesome group of friends, I earned good grades, and I landed an internship for the summer. In October 2010 I had the confidence to come out to one of my high school friends via snail mail. I slowly came out to other friends (college friends in January 2011) and could not ask for a better reaction - everyone has absolutely no problem with it and has treated me no differently.

I'd say I've felt depressed for as long as I can remember, but to put a fixed time on it I could definitively say 7th grade ('04 - '05). Last year ('11 - '12) is when my depression became so overwhelming that daily activities were exhausting. I talked with my roommate about it in the fall. He was understanding, as he had also dealt with depression. I was suicidal then, too. I recognized I needed help and turned to friends for support. I told them my entire background so they knew where I was coming from, and made them aware that I was depressed and suicidal. I did this individually with 5 or 6. At my most dramatic moments, I wrote out 3 page long bulletins that I mass-emailed to a dozen or so outlining my depression and asking for them to be understanding and supportive.

I think turning to my friends made the depression even worse. Instead of being able to talk to them about it, I found that it was (and still is) difficult to articulate my feelings. I'd feel like they wanted to hear and help, but then when I tried sitting down with them and explaining things that they were dismissive or disinterested in helping. My roommate referred me to his mental health counselor here at school, saying that she really helped him. I went to her two or three times and after taking the PHQ-9 was diagnosed with severe depression, as well as moderate anxiety. I tried antidepressants for a month or so and went to counseling two or three times but neither felt right, or like they were helping so I stopped both. I had 4 or 5 instances where I've been really intoxicated with alcohol and sent to the hospital, with friends present. Most of those times I was also suicidal so I was on watch during the night at the hospital. All of this was ongoing from October 2011 - August 2012. I tried to keep a happy front, but even with my depression in full-blown view in front of them, my friends never asked or seemed to genuinely care about my wellbeing.

I traveled for a bit and studied abroad from August - December 2012. Travel has always been my one and only true interest in life. I used all my savings and nearly wiped out my account to make this possible, and to try my best to reinvigorate myself. Perhaps I was overly optimistic, but I thought that after coming back I would feel refreshed, be able to get a full-time job for after graduation, and maybe even date.

Since returning from study abroad, my depression is not as bad as it was a year ago, but I'm afraid it's slowly creeping back to that point. I've submitted over 200 applications and interviewed more than 3 dozen times, with no job offers. Fortunately, I did earn an internship for this summer with plans for it to transition to full-time. The work is just okay in terms of where I'd like to be, but the pay is abyssmal - lower than what I made at my first internship. I tried a dating site or two (and more than once), and I went on dates with a dozen or so guys. Either I wasn't interested in them, or they weren't interested in me, so I've given up on dating. I've had more hookups than I'd like to share (this was after trying to find dates.)

At this point, I'm just trying to do all I can to keep from reverting back to how bad my depression was before. I really don't feel like I'll ever be 'not depressed' though. From most people's point of view my life should look great so I feel guilty feeling depressed. I was able to go to college out of state and have parents help support me, I will be graduating a year early, I am well traveled, I am happily out to friends. What I see, and what perpetuates my depression, is that: I am not out to my family, I worked hard in school but don't have a full-time job, my savings are almost out, I feel uncomfortable turning to friends for support, I don't think I'll ever be in a relationship.

Again, sorry for the long read, and I'm sorry if it's too scatterbrained. I'd be happy to clarify anything so you have a better understanding of my situation. I'm looking for objective advice from an outside perspective, or to hear from anyone who has been in a similar situation. Thanks."
1f4k78,7,2013-05-27,Can we have a frank discussion about immigration in the tech industry?,sixdrinks,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1f4k78/can_we_have_a_frank_discussion_about_immigration/,"RE: This article on the new immigation bill: 
http://news.yahoo.com/high-tech-industry-big-immigration-bill-winner-122335675.html

I work as a dev lead in a fortune 500 company. There are a lot of people from other countries on my team - Chinese, Indian, African. Most of them are great people. I feel really lucky to work with such a diverse group, but honestly I am uncomfortable with the number developers coming from other countries and how cheaply they are willing to work. I realize this is an age old issue: Immigrants filling a skill void and causing local animosity. But for several reasons, I can't help feeling like we are making a mistake. 

The main culprit in my opinion is that it is relatively difficult and costly for US students to get a decent technical education and succeed in the high-tech industry, compared to India and China. It's definitely not because China and India turn out such awesome programmers; they just have a system that can produce more technical degrees at a lower cost.

I would also submit that from a business standpoint one could argue that on-shoring makes financial sense, but like so many business trade offs, it doesn't necessarily make sense for the economy or society. 

I value the diversity, but the system appears to reward workers that come here, send their money home, and return after several years. These employees in general do not invest in their community, do not lay down roots, and are less likely to take ownership in local politics and societal issues. If they were truly immigrants I may feel differently (perhaps not better though).

Conclusion - I think we are losing the education investment game. I think we are taking the easy way out by giving away visa's for high tech jobs that most Americans would kill for. And I think companies are selling their communities short by not training new grads and bringing up interns. 

Thoughts anyone?"

1f480j,1,2013-05-26,Can Someone Please Help Me Build A MultiPurpose Rig Please?,dcd1990,buildapcforme,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcforme/comments/1f480j/can_someone_please_help_me_build_a_multipurpose/,"&gt;What will you be doing with this PC? Gaming? Photoshop? Web browsing? etc. If you need a Workstation, be specific on the programs you'll be using. Try to list as many games/applications that you'll be using as you can, as well as your performance goals for those programs.

The main purpose of this rig will be to run a virtual Ubuntu FTP server, with Windows 8 Pro as the host OS.  Light gaming will be done on it, nothing too fancy..mainly: Halo CE, KOTOR, AC 1 and 2, Maplestory, Risk, Slender, possibly Minecraft (doubt I'l install texture packs, etc).  Most newer games I will play on PS3 or PS4 when it releases.  I will run a few virtual emulators on here, such as a virtual gameboy advance and PS2.  Other than that, I'll be doing general web browsing, MS Office work, and very light Photoshop work. 

&gt;What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?

I will have to get peripherals too, so I'd rather keep everything under a $2000 budget as much as possible.

&gt;When do you plan on building/buying the PC? (note: if you're planning on buying more than 2 weeks from now, it's very much recommended you wait and come back then, to ensure you get the most recent and accurate price data)

I cannot do this build for a while, probably for another month since that's when my internship starts.  I wanted to start planning now though so I could get an idea of what I'm looking at getting.  I've done some builds with friends, but thought it couldn't hurt to get Reddit's opinion too.

&gt;What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? ""Everything"" is not specific enough. Tower, Operating System, peripherals like the keyboard, mouse, and monitor(s), wifi adapter, speakers/headphones, etc. are all relevant.

This build will be nearly completely from scratch.  I think at best the only thing I could contribute to it is an Intel 330 series solid state drive.  Oh, and an okay 2.1 speaker set (I'm not a huge audiophile). This would make my laptop completely useless though, although admittedly the system board on it is going.  Other than that, I would need the monitors, keyboard, mouse, tower components, and most of the cables.

&gt;Which country will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in the US, are you near a Microcenter store?

I'd prefer to get most of these parts at Microcenter, as I have one that's close by in PA. I wouldn't mind getting some at Tiger Direct or Newegg if it's going to be a decent increase in specs for around the same price.

&gt;If reusing any parts, what parts will you be reusing? Please be especially specific about the power supply. List make and model. If you have a monitor, list the size/resolution.

As I said, I think I'd only be reusing a SSD I have in my laptop.  

&gt;Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?

I would rather not get into overclocking, as I'd rather not get into water cooling or overclocking itself for this rig.  This is for CPU, RAM and GPU.

&gt;If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, please list them. Examples might include rear and/or front-panel USB 3.0, a RAID setup, etc.

Two 2TB HDDs in RAID 1...I've had one too many HDDs fail on me due to a combo of misuse and bad luck, so I'd rather not have to keep rebuilding multimedia again.

USB 3.0 on the front would be amazing.

If the case could come with built in blue LED fans, that would be great...

Blue backlit keyboard would be awesome too

&gt;Do you have any specific case/tower preferences such as a window or LEDs, or do you have a preference for low-noise components?

Pretty much what I already said above...having a window to view in would be really nice.  However if there are blue LED fans that can be seen from the outside of the case, I wouldn't mind no window or a mesh like covering for it.  Low noise would be awesome, but isn't super necessary.

&gt;Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes, what OS?

Uh...good question.  My MSDN license is still good until mid July.  I should be good until then, if not I'll get one separately.

&gt;Extra info or specifics:

I will be using a triple monitor setup for this rig, something I've been set on for a while.  I'd prefer the monitors to match, have a 5ms response time or less, support 1080p + and have HDMI and DVI compatibility.

&gt;Other notes:

I'll update this as I think of anything else, but I believe that I got everything.  This will be my first build and I'm tech savy to a degree but not on par with some of you guys.  This helps me out a lot. Thanks again for your help in advance everyone!  "

1f7iz6,0,2013-05-28,"2 and a half years later, I [23/m] still love her(21/f)...",[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1f7iz6/2_and_a_half_years_later_i_23m_still_love_her21f/,"Alright relationship gurus. I'm warning you now, this is going to be a long one. I'm going to have to do a good background in order to make the current advice question make perfect sense.

I'll start at my junior year of high school: There's a girl in my pre-calculus class with blue hair and the most adorable smile I've ever seen in my life. For privacy sake, we'll call her... Kat. I rarely get a chance to talk to Kat, not out of nervousness, I'm not a shy person, never have been, there just isn't enough time in the day while in school, but I do make conversation every once in a while and we seem to get along. One day, a mutual friend (Vicky) brings Kat into the room that my friends and I hang around in before and after school to say hi to everyone. It begins.
Kat is in an ending relationship, she's not happy and comes to me one day for a shoulder to cry on. Of course I oblige, though I know it's not my place to give advice or whatever so I keep my mouth shut. Fast forward a couple of weeks and she's single, so I ask her on a date. She agrees and things go very well, from here on out, we are inseparable. When I say inseparable, I mean my sheer definition of perfect. This girl is everything I could ever ask for out of a girl and more, I have never known happiness like this in my life (even to this day). Our relation ship goes on like this for a year, we do not fight or argue a single time. We have a few short talks of engagement, and other lovey dovey ""we'll be together forever"" stuff. 

We hit late spring of 2008, the end of my senior year of high school and her junior year. Her father (who we are both extremely close to) is diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and passes away. Here begins all of the problems. Of course she is absolutely distraught, and I am too, but she looks to me to be her rock so I do my best to be what she needs. The problem is she begins to look at me as a replacement for her father, often making excuses for things like ""daddy would have done it with me"". I cannot be a replacement for a father, and begin to get slightly frustrated. By September/October of 2008, things are shaky, but we seem stable. I'm holding on knowing that daddy issues aren't going to be something that just goes away over the course of a couple of months. I'm still in love with her and always do my best to be everything she needs from me. She gets a job at a supermarket and things get weird. She begins to vocalize her suspicions of me cheating.... which are completely wrong and have absolutely no evidence or support. 

January of 2009: one of her co-workers messages me on Facebook out of the blue, saying that he's glad that Kat and I are ""back together again"" and he hopes there's no hard feelings. Now, this was a shock to me, as I was not aware the Kat and I were ever not together. We have a long conversation and both find out to our dismay that she's been playing both sides. She told him that she had broken up with me for him, and told me that he was just a friend from work. This had been going on for a month and a half. I call her, give her once chance to confess, which she doesn't, and break up with her. We are apart for until the end of July the same year.

Late July 2009: She gets back from a mission trip type thing to Costa Rica and asks me to meet in a park. She wants to talk. I agree (why I don't know). I realize I miss her and we get back together. Things are good for a while. I'm still in community college in the same town, and she's about to move to a university, a two hour drive away. Not too bad I think, we can visit often, it's not far. At this point I'm still blindly in love with her. We work with the long distance for a while. Here's where dates and things get muddy. 

Sometime during winter of 2009: Our relationship starts going sour for multiple reasons. Being away from each other and I still haven't completely forgiven her for cheating the previous year. Things happen and we both end up cheating. I have a one night stand with a co-worker after she gets snowed in at my apartment and we both get drunk. She goes on to have another similar second relationship for a month or two, except this time the guy is completely aware of her being with me. I find out about it and flip my shit. 

Skip forward to September 2010: I move to the same university as her (believe it or not, she had absolutely nothing to do with my decision of that school, it was one of 3 in the state that offered my Major and happened to be the cheapest and closest to home. We're still together at this point, but our relationship is hollow and broken. Neither one of us is happy, neither one of us trusts the other, we're together simply out of jealous lust and an obsession with something that no longer exists. Even though we live only a mile and a half from one another, we never get to see each other. She's an RA on her dorm, and I work 35 hours a week at a restaurant plus school. We spend Christmas back in our home town, and the day after Christmas day she suggests we break up. I'm tired of the relationship and so I agree. We part ways 2 days later. I try my best to get over her by not talking to her, finding other girls to sleep with and generally just trying to push her out of my mind. None of it is working. 

April 2010: She drops out of university. I find out and am upset, but try to laugh it off like I don't care. At this point she's in a relationship with another guy again. I focus all of my energy on school and work as much as I can. Come summer time, I have an internship at a factory for some extra cash and random job experience back in our home town. She calls me one day, our conversation isn't exactly nice, and she ends our talk with this, and this is an exact quote. ""I'm going to go now, but I hope you can be happy for me, I'm going to be engaged soon"". This slams me harder than I've ever felt anything before in my life. I am broken. I have no idea what to do, what to say to anyone or how to go about my life. I spent the next 5 months in a deep depression, finally deciding that the only way to get over her was to hate her. When ever she tried to talk to me from here on our, I swore at her, told her I hate her, and that I never want to talk to her again. She says that she's sorry things worked out this way, but I'll hear nothing of it. She finally gives up. 

I'm going to skip straight ahead to this past weekend now, present time. Her engagement failed early this year and they are no longer together. I have since graduated from university and got a really good career going in another city which just happens to be only 2 hours in the other direction from our home town. I tried to have a relationship with someone else a couple of months ago for the first time since Kat and I broke up, but it was unfulfilled and I broke it off. I have gone 2 and a half years now trying every method I can think of to get over her, and nothing has worked. A friend told me to talk to her over facebook and maybe I'll get some kind of closure. I decided to try it, and she found out that I was going to be in town for the weekend to visit my parents and some other friends. She asked if I would meet her for dinner, to which I said that I was unsure about, but eventually I agreed. 

Saturday: We went to dinner at 7:30, as soon as she pulled up in her car my heart stopped. We spent a good 2 hours at the restaurant talking a lot. We went for a drive up the blue ridge parkway to one of our old favorite spots and ended up sitting in the car and talking in the car until 3am. During the time in the car talking, we held hands almost the whole time, I cried for the first time in 3 years when I told her about how it felt to hear about her getting engaged, we hugged (kinda cuddled a bit I guess) and kissed a few times. It's obvious we haven't got over each other at all. I miss her so much. She has been through some pretty serious shit the last year or so, she got raped, found god and religion and some other stuff too. But most of all, she's grown up and I can tell that she's actually had some life experience now, as opposed to a few years ago. She seems to have dealt with her daddy issues and I honestly believe that she is back to the girl that I remember. The things we shared before were all there in those 12 or so hours that we spent together this weekend. 

Sunday: She asks me when I'm leaving to go home, I say later tonight. She wanted to see me again before I did so I took her to the movies and for dinner again. Once again, we held hands the whole time, did some cuddles and kisses. Her current situation is where some HUGE problems arise. She's going to college there in town for at least another year, as well as working in a store full time. In the last couple months she's signed a lease for the next year with her new best friend, who happens to be in love with her. She tells me that she cares about him, but that she doesn't love him.
So now we're in a strange situation. We have both confessed we miss each other tremendously, and still are in love. I'm uneasy about her living with him, and she's uneasy about telling him that it's going no where because she's with me for the possible awkwardness between them and the distance between us again. 

Reddit... I've never asked for relationship advice before, especially not from the internet. But what should I do. I'm STILL desperately in love with this girl, but our situation seems impossible. I'm lost. 

TL;DR

The love of my life and I broke each others hearts 2 and a half years ago. Met up again this weekend and it's all come flooding back, but in a crazy impossible situation. What on earth should I do. 
I know this thing is a freaking book, but I wouldn't have taken the time to write it all out and put 5 years of my life on the internet if I wasn't in some real trouble here. Please help"

You used to be a good reason to get up in the morning.
You used to be my first true love.
You used to be my biggest source of happiness.

But now look at you. To me, you aren't worth a fucking penny.

You left me almost 7 months ago now. I'm sure you thought I would break down and become a complete wreck. For your information, I DID break down and become a complete wreck, but this time around it was different. I picked up all the valuable pieces left after that destruction of our relationship and I fucking rebuilt. You know what I did in that 7 month time frame, you fucking bitch. 

I got my way into two different internships that could potentially lead to careers. Let alone they leave me with phenomenal recommendations. I am on the verge of getting promoted at work. I am finishing up school. 

One of the biggest accomplishments is that you HATED having sex with me because I was so fucking fat. Well, guess what. I've lost almost 60lbs of that fat you hated so much and ON top of that I am finally on the road to get that athletic body I've always wanted INCLUDING THAT SIX PACK YOU SAID I COULD NEVER GET.

But above all else, I am a fucking happy man. I have never been SO happy in my life, and I hope you and your douchebag of a boyfriend enjoy your mediocre lives together because I WILL GO FAR.

I am going to go places.
I am going to accomplish my dreams. 
I am going to help people to the best of my ability be better people. 
I am going to go on and travel. 
I am going to see the world. I am most importantly going to find somebody who doesn't hold me down like you. 
I am going to find somebody that will increase my happiness, productivity, lifestyle, and world.

You are a hindrance to yourself and everyone around you.

1f79ch,23,2013-05-28,I've been outed! Need advice on how to handle a complicated family situation. This is long :P,[deleted],exmuslim,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/1f79ch/ive_been_outed_need_advice_on_how_to_handle_a/,"**TL;DR** I'm supposed to give a talk in Sydney about atheism in Malaysia. My whole extended family back in Malaysia now knows about it and about my atheism. My parents are probably furious and will want me, among other things, not to give the talk. They may even force me to return to Malaysia permanently by refusing to pay for my studies. What do I do????  
  



So, further to my post on [bringing shame to my family](http://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/1f69jb/have_you_brought_shame_on_your_family_lately/), there have been some new developments and I need some considered advice on how to handle the situation.

**A bit of background:** I am 31, female, from a muslim family and a muslim country (Malaysia). I've been an atheist for over 10 years. *My parents have known about my lack of belief in god for about 1.5-2 years.* My parents used to be your typical 'relaxed' muslims (fast during ramadan, avoid pork and alcohol, but do not read the quran or pray). However, the past 7 years or so have seen a dramatic 'islamisation' of their way of life, for various reasons. Then 3 years ago, when my paternal grandmother died, their islamism reached new heights. They've been working hard to 'set me straight' but I keep telling them that, whatever i do or don't believe, I am still a good person with principles and integrity and I don't want our relationship to be ruined by constant friction. 


**One year ago**: Last year I decided I could not stand to live in a muslim country anymore and wanted to move away permanently. I informed my parents of this and they, of course, freaked out for various reasons. After a massive quarrel or epic proportions, I came to Sydney, Australia for 3 months on a tourist visa, using my own savings from 5 years of work, hoping to find a full-time job with an employer that would sponsor a working visa for me for at least 3-4 years. However, my job hunt was not successful because employers in Australia generally prefer to hire people who already have visas or permanent residency.


**6 months ago**: I decided that I couldn't give up and applied to take up a Masters course at a university in Sydney. My plan was to network and do internships or part time jobs while I studied so that I could prove myself to potential employers who would then have a more solid reason to hire me and sponsor my visa to stay on in Sydney. I was prepared to use up what was left of my meager savings (Sydney is a m&amp;$^#*#@$g expensive place) to pay for the first semester of tuition and then work my ass off in part time jobs to pay the rest of the tuition fee and cover my living expenses. However, my father took pity on me and offered to pay for my tuition and even cover some of my living expenses. I was incredibly grateful and accepted his offer, with the idea that I would pay him back once I started working full time in Sydney (IF i ever did).

**Present day**: A few weeks back I received an invitation from the Sydney Atheist Society to give a small, 15-minute talk about what life is like for atheists in Malaysia. I accepted. In ways which I shall not go into here, my cousins found out about this. Prior to this, my cousins were NOT aware that I am an atheist and have been for the past 10 years. 

This morning, I received a long, angry, incoherent message from a 20-something male cousin of mine telling me off about bringing shame to the family, etc. I replied politely and firmly, basically telling him to sod off in the nicest way possible.

This evening, I received a text message from my mother saying that my father 'wants to have a talk' with me. No doubt my cousins and aunties and uncles have contacted my parents about my evil ways (of which my parents were already aware anyway) and now my parents are forced to take action against me for the sake of saving face with the family.

You can imagine that I'm not quite sure what to do. Abandon the idea of giving the talk out of respect to my father's wishes (he is, after all, paying for me to be here studying in Sydney)? Maybe. But then what will that accomplish? I would still be a decade-long atheist. 

I could try to be open with my parents about the talk (the talk is not about bashing islam, but is about the social and political structures which affect the daily lives of atheists in Malaysia), but at this stage, with his 'public shaming' among the family for having a sinful atheist daughter, he probably won't listen.

And what if he refuses to fund my education any further? I'd have to start selling my body if I wanted to raise the funds to finish my Masters degree.

Also, I swear I will frikkin kill my bullshit meddling cousins. I would like suggestions on how to go about this. This is very important to me.

Thank you very much.

Because they are biological, Archons do more damage to them, which intern is a nerf to mech play.

We talked about how we ""knew"" that we had found ""the one"" with each other. I was her first time. Both of our lives were going great, I had an internship set up and she had been accepted to med school, all in the same city.

This summer was supposed to be our first time living in the same city while dating.
Then the past few weeks she had been avoiding me, saying she was busy with all of her friends who were graduating. She's been super sick, and had such a bad cough that she dislocated a rib. I figured she needed some time to rest.

Yesterday, she finally asked if I had a few minutes to see her. At least I had some sort of hint it was coming. We drove to a park. She started crying before she said a word. She told me she thinks we should break up. She told me that it didn't feel right. I have no idea what that means and I just keep wondering what I did wrong.

This is the worst feeling I've ever had in my life. It's been over 24 hours now since she broke up with me, and I haven't eaten, haven't been able to sleep. I keep telling myself that she just hasn't been feeling well, that she doesn't know what she was doing. Maybe she just wants to meet a doctor at med school instead. I guess it doesn't really matter now.
I was supposed to get to see her every day this summer. She was moving in 5 minutes away from where I'm living. Now I won't see her at all. It's taken all of my will power to not text her and ask if there's someone else. I don't think I could handle it if she said yes anyways.
And I can't even be mad at her. She's always been honest with me, any time we had an argument we were always respectful of each other and never said anything we'd regret or use mean words. I just want to be mad at her but I can't, I'm just so fucking sad. 

As if I wasn't tormented enough, at the end of it she said ""Maybe we can see where we're at at the end of the summer."" What the hell does that mean? If she's done with me, I need to stay completely clear of her to begin the healing process. But if there's any hope then I would do anything. 

She starts med school tomorrow and knowing that I won't be able to ask her how her first day went makes me sick. 



EDIT 6/2/13: I've decided to add an update to this post at the end of each week, until I feel like I don't need it anymore. My phase of not being able to eat or sleep only lasted two days, and my appetite has slowly been returning ever since. I started lifting again for the first time in two years which I think has helped a lot with both my physical and mental health. 

It feels like there's no rhyme or reason to how I feel each day. Some days I feel fine, and am thankful to be busy at work which keeps me distracted. Some days I won't be able to get anything done because all I do is think about what I would say if I saw her and just feel too sad to do anything. I was able to go out with my friends the past two nights. I'd be lost if I didn't have some of the most supportive friends I could ask for. They've been trying to get me to talk to new girls at the bars, but it honestly just feels like I'm being disloyal to my ex. Which I know doesn't make any sense, I was dumped, but I can't help it.

On Wednesday, I stumbled on the Christmas card she wrote me from last year. I shouldn't have read it, but I did. I think that may have been the lowest point I've hit since this whole thing happened. We were both so happy. In her card, she thanked me for being so supportive of her while she was applying to med school. She said she wouldn't have been able to do it without me. Now that she's in, it feels like I just wasn't needed anymore. She wants to start a new phase of her life and doesn't want me to be a part of it. 

Tomorrow night, one of my best friends and roommate is having a shared 21st birthday party with one of my ex's best friends. I'm terrified of seeing her there. Sometimes I get excited at  thinking about getting to talk to her. Then I feel like I shouldn't say anything at all. I've been successful at no contact so far but I don't know what's going to happen if she's there tomorrow. All I know is that I'm not going to miss my friend's 21st because of her. "
1f6c4o,1,2013-05-27,It's the end of the school year and I've set myself up for failure.,thrownaway0-,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1f6c4o/its_the_end_of_the_school_year_and_ive_set_myself/,"I'm 16, a rising senior in high school, and as the school year comes to a close the downward spiral I've gotten caught in is starting to really get to me. This is pretty much the end and there's nothing I can do about it. I've been fully aware of my descent into a state that I never would have expected I'd find myself in. 

From an outside perspective, I would be tempted to say that it's just the stress of final exams that's getting to me and making me react this melodramatically. But it's not. I truly have let myself become become lazy, avoidant, and defeatist, and it makes me incredibly ashamed of myself because there's no excuse.

So, let's see... 
Despite some struggles, I've always been able to maintain good grades, i.e., an A/B average. I have two Fs and two low Cs this quarter and and they're not exactly on track to improve in the next week and a half. Last quarter I was doing comparatively better but not phenomenally. 

I have a final essay due in under two hours that I haven't started on. I have a project due tomorrow that I have no more than glanced at.
I have a different (group) project due tomorrow that I haven't contributed to yet, and my group members have been reminding me of it all weekend. I haven't responded. 

I'm not entirely confident that I will complete any of the three tonight.

The thing is, this isn't new. I have allowed myself to neglect studying for an in-class assessment or skip out on turning in an assignment multiple times in the past weeks, which isn't characteristic of me at all. 
I have so much less motivation to do these things but I still feel just as guilty about it. 

After sticking with a group of friends that I connect with for way too long because I didn't have the confidence or know-how to find anyone else, but finally I broke away from them (naïvely believing I'd be able to find someone else.. nope). That was a while ago, and I've noticed that as I inconspicuously drew away, I became increasingly apathetic. Now they decide to include me in this summer trip they're taking right after school ends and I accept their offer because even though it's going to be awkward due to the fact that I'm no longer a part of their social group, I have nothing else to do. Maybe I'll learn something from it.

It really bothers me that I can't make friends. 

I deleted my Facebook. I sit alone at lunch. I've established myself as an absolute nobody. I waste the majority of my time worrying about stuff but never doing anything about it. I don't have a good relationship with my parents - they ask what's wrong with me and leave it at that. I won't venture any further into my past because by this point I'm sure you're tired of reading this. 

May I touch upon one more topic before we're through? 

I'm so worried about this summer. To preface this, another mannerism I've developed is the tendency to let things accumulate, like books I want to read and movies and music and ideas for my art and thoughts I want to expand upon in writing and and subjects I want to learn about and places I want to explore. My OneTab Google Chrome extension is a pretty accurate metaphor for what happens after the initial discovery and decision to pursue something at a later date: 133 other pages waiting for me, and there's very little chance that I'll do anything about any of them. 
I've passed up [all of the] countless opportunities to apply for an internship or some sort of work over the summer that would provide some degree of additional help getting into college that I'll so desperately need. I let them accumulate and told myself I'd look at them later and it's way too late now. I have something in mind that I'm already passionate about but I don't deserve to be a part of something so important. Regardless, it's too late. 

I could have gotten into governor's school, for example, but it's too late. 

I now do terrible, self-destructive things like habitually overeat and pick at my face everyday in a vain attempt to 'deal' with my acne which probably wouldn't even exist if it weren't for this disgusting development of mine. 

I don't want to turn seventeen, ever. I don't want to bother anyone around me by expressing all of this. Nothing is acceptable about what I'm letting myself do, especially because I've convinced myself that I'm capable of much better, but here I am. And finally, I'm willing to pay you five dollars in exchange for a hug. Mostly serious.

Sorry about the novel. 

**TL;DR**, For some reason I've consciously allowed myself to become a useless human being and the internalization that this is going to affect me in the future is hitting me hard. Feeling sorry for myself is stupid and makes me feel even worse but I don't know what else to do at this point. "

To our surprise, it turns out that we both received engineering research internship positions with Google and will be working together. I suppose attending different universities and having similar resumes led to this. We are both really excited and have already contacted our supervisor and started brainstorming on our work together. 

However, we have come up with a possibly awkward issue. How do we tell our other co-interns and supervisors about us? 

So I was wondering, does anyone have experience with working with their SO? Any advice or stories? Please post them :D

1fa7h9,2,2013-05-29,College-bound high school graduate—what advice do you have for me?,[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1fa7h9/collegebound_high_school_graduatewhat_advice_do/,"I just graduated from high school a week ago and will be starting college this fall. I was hoping to receive advice on how to not completely screw over my future, specifically in paying off my student debts and being able to transition to an independent lifestyle.

I'm attending a private institution thanks to a generous scholarship, and I estimate that I will have about $24k in loans by the end of four years. I'm comfortable taking out this amount because the student debt I would incur at the alternative, my state's flagship university, is around the same amount. 

Although my parents will assist in paying off my loans, I wanted to contribute, and I've started saving my money to put a dent in those loans. I currently have $1,150 in savings for that purpose. 

My plan is to work on-campus throughout college and continually put most of my income toward those savings, using summers either to take more classes, work full-time, or (most importantly) internships. 

Does /r/personalfinance have any advice on how else I can work toward paying off those loans quickly, or making it through college in general? I've thought of investing some of those savings as I don't plan on touching it at all for four years; is P2P lending such as Prosper a viable option? Should I wait until I accumulate more money then lock it up in a CD?

Edit for additional information: Once I have a steady source of income, through an on-campus job or whatever else, I planned on getting my credit union's Young Adult credit card so I could start building credit as well. "

But, she moved away for the summer the very next day.",backyard87,seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1fa4lm/fropened_built_attraction_escalated_twice_briefly/,"I've sat behind the HB 8.5-9 (maybe 9.5 on a personal scale) throughout the semester, but never talked to her and I've never met her. Anyway, at the end of the year school party we had a drunk conversation for like 10 minutes; good kino, escalation, and just getting to know each other, but nothing more. I kind of felt like this girl was into me, but I also assumed she moved out of town for her summer internship, so I stopped thinking about it. 

Well, the other night at the bar, I see her come in with a dude. It was so perfect, as I was chilling at the bar with another HB 8.5-9 and her HB 6.5-7 friend. I go up and talk to the girl &amp; the dude, introduce myself to the dude, and kino once on her arm to let her know the deal. Then, I eventually left with the girls I was with. 

The next morning, I was kicking myself for not hitting on this girl/getting her number, so I said fuck it--I'm going to go for a fucking gay ass facebook number close. It's all I knew to do, because there's no telling where I'd see this girl again. So I messaged her something short and sweet telling her that ""we should hang"" out asking her number, telling her I'd call her (KEY = CALL GIRLS, and tell them your going to call them). I immediately regretted it &amp; assumed she would think I was a fucking chump. BUT, she messaged me back telling me ""we should definitely hang out!"", she gave me her number, BUT, that she was moving cities for the summer the very next morning. BAD FUCKING TIMING YO!! I called her the next day telling her to holla at me if she's in my city &amp; I'd holler at her if I was in her's--basically I just wanted to make contact outside of facebook and I wanted her to know my number.

Also, thoughts on this situation?? I think this girl is interested in me. We go to a small school together, so I know we'll see each other in two months again. But I'm wondering whether I should try to communicate with her throughout the summer, or whether I should just leave it alone until school starts back, then, game her from there? I'm thinking just waiting to game her in person is the way to go? Thoughts?"

People are free to wear sandals, shorts etc.

Normally I don't wear a T-shirt, rather I stick with button downs and sweaters but I'm wondering how I can 'dress up' without seeming obnoxious. Obviously the general saying goes that one should 'dress for the job you want' but I don't really know how to dress up with out coming off as snotty. I guess I'd be more comfortable wearing a tucked in shirt with a tie or a blazer but I probably couldn't do that in this environment. 

Any ideas of how to dress up in a super casual work environment? Any tips or suggestions would be great, thanks!"
1fa171,2,2013-05-29,Statistical Study of Most Effective 6v6 Team Class Arrangements,[deleted],truetf2,https://www.reddit.com/r/truetf2/comments/1fa171/statistical_study_of_most_effective_6v6_team/,"Oi,

I'm a High-School aged kid who has a profound interest in the applied science of Statistics.  And, no shit, I love TF2 as well, since I'm here right now.  I've taken a large interest in amateur and professional 6v6 gaming in competitive TF2 -- there's a lot more class-based strategy when there aren't one-per-class limits.  I.e, you could have:

* Aggressive Scout

* Frontline Medic

* Primary Pocket Heavy

* Secondary Pocket Demo

* Tertiary Pocket Soldier

* Spy

For an overall aggressive team.  On the other hand:

* Backline Engineer

* Support Medic

* Sniper

* Backline Support Engineer

* Roaming Pyro

* Demoman

For a staunchly defensive tactic.

Of course, these are two extremes.

There are millions of combinations -- especially when strategies are considered.  A ""frontline pocket soldier"" and a ""frontline pocket demo"" share more attributes in terms of strategy and game flow with each other than a ""frontline pocket soldier"" and a ""backline roaming solider"", even though the latter comparison is between two of the same class.  Those ""backline"", ""frontline"", ""pocket"", etc. adjectives are essentially as important an implication strategy as the class itself, as you all most likely know from experience, whether you've played 6v6 or not.  In 6v6 however, a single weak link in the strategy can ruin a whole set of rounds.  Some example class adjectives:

* Frontline -- Player will play at the front line of action

* Pocket -- Player will be healed and Uber'd by a Medic

* Support -- For engineers, they help another engineer build their buildings before building their own -- good for pregame.  For medics, it means a medic that doesn't have a single pocket, but goes around and heals/Ubers more randomly based on situation without obligation to a single player.  

&gt; So, what's the point of all of this?

I'm going to do a study (of sorts) using statistically sound methods to determine what types of class arrangements are best suited to fight against other arrangements.  

&gt; How is this useful to anyone?

You tell me.  It's somewhat obvious, no?  

&gt; How are you going to get the data?

Hopefully with the help of you guys.  I don't have a method of collecting data yet, but I suspect I will have to make a spreadsheet online and ""hire"" some respected redditors here to help me record the results of professional 6v6 games and the classes used (and some defining characteristics of the game, like time spent, kills per team, kills per player, connection problems causing delays, etc.)  The ""payoff"" of being ""hired"" would be that you would get free access to the result when finished, being that you get knowledge that competitive teams would want.  Want, as in, would possibly pay in-game currency like refined for.  

&gt; But how are you going to get a statistically-significant sample size?

A mixture of the above, and some self-made simulation based on the results of the above.  Basically, I'm collected a few thousand data points in the first round above, then making a simulation based on it that will help me pound out billions of data points.  As the first-round collection increases in sample size, the simulation becomes more accurate.  

&gt; Will the results of simulation be open to the public to learn from?

Depends on how useful the /r/tf2 and related communities are in helping me collect data.  

&gt; Are you a le fuckign F2P player?

Yes, but with two years of good experience.  Soon to upgrade to Premium when I buy everyone in a 6-member team we have some Mann-up tickets and surplus vouchers later this week.  I'm a good player but not (yet) at the professional level -- another 500 hours will probably give that.

Because we all know someone is going to ask it in the comments section.  

&gt; What statistical knowledge do you have?

A 5/5 on the AP Statistics AP Exam, some outside self-driven knowledge, the ability to model simulations.  So I'm not like a doctorate in Statistics, but I'm knowledgeable to complete something like this.  

&gt; What knowledge do you have on modeling simulations?

I'm what some call a ""Computer Science Prodigy"" (and what others call an ""autistic little fuck"", though I do lead a relatively normal extrovert life); I have experience with writing the course curriculum for a 3rd year Computer Engineering undergraduate class during an internship at a top-ten ranked US university, I've won multiple state science fairs, etc.  This is easily within my range and it's probably the easiest part of this project to complete.  

&gt; Future outcomes from this study?

If things go well, I could hire myself out to professional teams or something, run a statistical analysis on their performances, and be an advisor to them on how to win a larger percentage of games.  And if they're a cool team filled with cool dudes I'd probs do it for free.  But I need to complete this study first.  

&gt; Anything else?

This is a preliminary interest thread.  If no interest is shown, I'll do my best to get results on my own, and keep them to myself.  If people want to participate, I'll make another series of threads after this (maybe organized in an informal subreddit to keep things clean) to update on results and such.  

Thanks for reading.

and I would really love to come to SF, but I don't have an internship.

I have some questions:

1) Do you think it's worth it to go without an internship? I'm wondering what is your opinion on this summer program?

2) Do you know any company working in data mining / visualization / mathematical modeling that could use a (paid or unpaid) intern?

3) How exactly does the visum sponsoring organization thing work? Can any company hire an intern? Does it cost a lot of money for the company to hire an intern?

Thank you so much!

1f9xk3,17,2013-05-29,Been lurking on /r/aves for a while from across the ocean. Couple of questions for you guys...,itchymuller,aves,https://www.reddit.com/r/aves/comments/1f9xk3/been_lurking_on_raves_for_a_while_from_across_the/,"So I've been lurking on this subreddit for a while now. I'm flying to the states (Boston, MA) in a week for an internship and will stay for 6 months. I'm utterly surprised at the huge difference of style at what is popular here and what is popular in Europe(Netherlands). 
First and foremost: A lot of popular DJ's in the States have already lost their superstar-status here and are considered mainstream and/or bygones. Let's see: Tiesto, Armin van Buuren, Afrojack, Sunnery James/Ryan Marciano, Sydney Samson. Those guys were hot, like 5 years ago maybe. (Not being judgemental here, I danced to that music at that time as well).

Now we saw a big shift here in the past years from house/progressive house/trance to more of a techno/techhouse/deephouse/nu-disco music. DJs like Joris Voorn, The Magician, Marco Carola, Stimming, Solomon, Karmon (Diynamic label in it's entirety), Innvervisions label... you name it. Those are really the reining music bosses here.

I was wondering: How is the techno/techhouse scene in the USA? Are there any nu-disco/indie house DJs that I should know of? Any deephouse festivals this summers near Boston? 

Thanks!"
1f9whn,0,2013-05-29,[20M] Wondering if others have been in this very strange situation. [20F] [21F],[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1f9whn/20m_wondering_if_others_have_been_in_this_very/,"I cheated. No doubt about that.

I've been with [21F] about 3.5 years and she's not only the person I've been in love with since freshman year but also my best friend. At the start of the fall semester we will be moving in to a 2 bedroom apartment with a friend. It's a 12 month lease and neither of us could afford the place if we were not splitting the price.

Right now she's back in our hometown and has a job. I'm in our college town taking classes and also have a job. This means we can only see each other on Saturday and Sunday (its an hour drive) and I stay at her parents house with her when I visit. She straight up doesn't want  to drive down and visit me. This, in turn, means our sex life has diminished and she doesn't seem to care very much about that.

Meanwhile, I started talking to [20F], a friend I made earlier in the school year because she was in a relationship with my roommate and we also were both raised in the same religion and both left it. We always got along well but i hadn't really seen her for awhile because their breakup was less than clean.

Apparently she smoked together/hooked up with my roommate again just before he left for a summer internship, and it drove her emotions pretty high. She turned to me to talk to about it and we both expressed how lonely we were stuck in town without many friends. This led to us deciding to smoke together and hang out. (both smoking weed and me hanging out with other girls are something [21F] would vehemently disagree with, so I have kept it all secret)

[20F] came over and we watched some movies/shows together while I worked on some homework. We had pretty much agreed to just do our own thing, and really liked the idea of having someone else nearby while doing so. She didn't have a piece so we didn't smoke, but when it got late she decided to stay the night. Both of us longed for some physical contact and neither of us meant for cuddling to turn into sex, but it did.

Cut to the morning and we parted ways. I was actually headed off for a trip with [21F] and her parents for memorial weekend. We continued to text (in secret via google voice) and both agreed that it was a one-time mistake and that we would work to not let it happen again. She still had feelings for my roommate and felt bad both because of that and because I had a SO. I really didn't feel as bad as I should have. I didn't so much see that as cheating and saying it was a one-time mistake made it easier to write it off.

The trip was great and there was no weirdness between me and [21F]. We even got a rare chance to fool around alone in the hotel room. I don't feel any less in love with her.

Cut to Monday. I got back home to college town and [20F] came over again. This time she had a piece but didnt feel like smoking, so it was more of watching netflix and doing homework. This time we went to sleep with me on the futon and her on the bed. 

Here's where I become a horrible person. I knew she was laying there in only underwear and a tshirt, and I made a conscious choice to switch to the bed. The futon was very uncomfortable and I used that as an excuse, but I probably could have toughed it out. She immediately expressed an desire to have sex and I went right along with it. The sex we had was phenomenal. I'm much less experienced than she is, but we both felt very satisfied with it. 

After we were done, she told me she loves cuddling but that would feel too wrong when I have a gf. I was disappointed but knew she was right, and we fell asleep. The next morning I again left for school but this time I had to give her my key as I wouldn't be back until late in the evening and she did not have to work that day. She did some errands and then came back to my place before i got home and just chilled there.

Have I mentioned how much I trust [20F]? I've told her almost everything about my life and she's confided similarly in me, more than she ever has in someone. I don't think I would want to be in a real relationship with her but I adore her as a person. She likewise does not have romantic attachment to me, and would absolutely not tell anyone about what we did or try to use it against me. She is leaving for a different college at the end of the summer, so this is quite literally something that will not be found out by anyone unless I directly tell them. 

Anyways, during our texting after the second time we had sex, we both agreed that doing it twice was much worse morally. Again we resolved to either sleep separately or with clothes on and without touching. Last night we finally smoked together and I fell asleep earlier than usual on the bed. I thought she was going to join me later but when I awoke this morning I found that she had slept on the futon. Though I felt bad that she had slept there without a very good blanket, I'm glad that we did not fuck again.

And then I wrote this. Part of me just wanted to get this all out there somewhere. I know what I did was wrong, but I think it would be too harmful to my life to tell [21F] about it. It would probably end or ruin our relationship, and in the process it would mangle our housing plans and lose me my best friend. [20F] is leaving at the end of the summer and that will be the end of any infidelity on my part. 

Has anyone been in a similar situation? Cheated in such a way that there's no risk of someone finding out? How do you feel about it and how did it all turn out for you?

**tldr: I cheated with a friend and won't get caught. I'm still hanging out with said friend. I don't want to tell my SO about it and almost definitely will not. I am without doubt a bad person for all of this, but feel free to reassure me of that.**

My boyfriend and I have been dating for almost a full year. We go to the same college in the States, but we are working in different countries over the summer so we are ""long-distance"" for 4 months. This has been hard, but we've been doing okay so far.


Here's where it gets a little hinky. Once we get back from summer, we'll be spending our last semester together. This is because my boyfriend, Nate, is graduating and moving back to his home city (City 1) in Asia, and if his job this summer goes well, will be working full-time in City 2 (also in Asia). So City 1 and City 2 are going to be his main homes after school, and he doesn't plan on ever coming back to the United States again (due to a mixture of reasons, cultural and career-related). After he graduates, I still have one semester left to finish college.


*Note: sorry for the vagueness of the locations; I am super paranoid and feel that the combination of cities and the situation is unique and there's a 1-in-1000 chance he will chance upon this thread.*


We have, at this point, realized that due to 1) my being primarily based in the States, all of my job opportunities will likely be in the States in the future, as well as my friends and my life, really and 2) his life is back in Asia, where he has friends and family, in addition to him not liking the culture in the States and not wanting to live here, that we should not pursue our relationship together after he graduates. **We will break up once he leaves the States.**


This decision, I believe, has nothing to do with how much we love each other, or how compatible we are. It is purely because realistically, our paths are never going to cross after he leaves. It will be too hard, and even unfair for one of us to uproot ourselves and sacrifice our familiar lives, job opportunities, and a lot of other things to move across the world to be with the other. We intend to make the best of the time we have left. 

Unfortunately, it has also been breaking my heart since we've reached the decision, and as a result, I've been foolishly looking for ways to make this work.I just can't wrap my head around the fact that I'm supposed to give up on the one guy I've come to love because of something out of our control. We share the same heritage, same sense of humor, sense of financial responsibilities, and most political and philosophical issues, so all location challenges aside, we are pretty compatible. Damn me that I've always been the type who can never just let it go.

**Here's the catch, or what made me start having these stupid hopes:**
I am interning for a very large and well-known company based in NYC (where I will be this summer) that has headquarters all around the world, including one in City 2. What coincidence, then, that City 2 has been my dream work city ever since junior year of high school when I was lucky enough to vacation there. I fell in love with the city, the people, and the culture almost immediately (this goes way back before our relationship, and has nothing to do with Nate).
I know it's a long shot. But I somehow convinced myself that at the end of my internship, if I can score a full-time job with this company (reasonable) and somehow magically be able to transfer to the City 2 location in a different department (not as realistic)...I can't help but wonder if we would be able to reconsider our ""planned breakup"" (super really not realistic, at this point I don't even know if this is healthy for my dignity).


Reddit, I've been a long-time lurker and admirer of the sound advice that you've given to people here. Can you help me figure this out? Please slap some sense into me, no kid gloves needed, honest opinions appreciated. Heck, at this point, the fact that you've read this far is appreciated. :) Also go ahead if you have questions, I'm sure I should have clarified something or other better. Thank you.


**TL;DR** I've been beating myself up for allowing myself to hope for a chance to simultaneously land a job in my dream city and continue my relationship with my boyfriend. I can't tell if I'm grasping at straws and need to wake the fuck up or if this is actually a glimmer of hope that I can work towards this summer.

1f92fb,17,2013-05-29,"BF is having a dom/sub online relationship and not telling me about it. We're in an open relationship, but we agreed he'd tell me if he was involved with someone, and his non-disclosure really bothers me.",[deleted],nonmonogamy,https://www.reddit.com/r/nonmonogamy/comments/1f92fb/bf_is_having_a_domsub_online_relationship_and_not/,"Throwaway account because my boyfriend is a Redditor. Sorry in advance about the wall of text.

My boyfriend and I have been together for 5 years--we're both in our late 20s/early 30s, talked about marriage, etc.

We've had an open relationship since the beginning, and, minus a few bumps, it's gone pretty well. HOWEVER. The only reason we opened our relationship up was because I have a significantly higher sex drive than he does (I like sex daily, whereas he'd be happy with once a month.)

He and I met online, and when we met, he was VERY good at seduction. Teased me, was a bit dominant (which I like), etc. However, after I moved to live closer to him, I discovered that while he can talk a great game, he does in fact have a low libido and severe anxiety issues, and so the pressure of having a serious partner (I was his first EVERYTHING) killed any desire he had to do anything sexual with me.

We've been really happy these past five years--our relationship just keeps getting better and stronger--except for sex. Other than that, he's pretty much the perfect partner.

So anyway. About two years into our relationship, I went to borrow his phone to make a call, and accidentally saw a new email he'd left open. Because of the content one email I saw, I kept reading, and it turned out that he'd been having a steamy online fling with a woman on a message board we were both members of.

I was devastated. Yes, we had an open relationship. But (1) he never told me about her, and (2) he was giving her sexual attention that he wasn't giving me.

I confronted him about it, he broke things off with her, and I told him that he was welcome to have ""things"" with other women, online or otherwise, but (A) he had to tell me, and (B) I didn't feel it was fair that he gave someone else something I wasn't getting. He agreed.

I will freely admit to snooping off and on in his email, and he flirted a little with various women, but nothing I'd consider intense or crossing a line, so I never told him about it. Our sex life never improved, but, whatever.

The following year, we actually saw a counselor together, to try to resolve some of our frustrations in the sex department. That actually really helped--our sex life didn't get better, but I was able to better understand why he wasn't sexually into me. Sex is an inherently fraught thing for him, for reasons he wasn't able to fully explain, but as such, it's much easier for him to get into when he knows he doesn't have any commitments to the woman.

Two years later, same thing happened. I hadn't snooped for several months, but when I noticed him hiding his phone from me again, I went and snooped, and sure enough, he had a thing going on with TWO other women. But before I could figure out how to confront him about it, things blew up--they both were friends, and didn't know that he was flirting with both of them, one of them fell in love with him, and told a mutual friend of ours that she was devastated that he wouldn't break up with me and move to be with her, since I was clearly a horrible person and she was the right person for him. The mutual friend told me, and I confronted my boyfriend. 

This time I wasn't devastated--I was very straightforward, and told him that he had been lying to me, and I didn't appreciate it, and while I understood why he wanted to be sexual with another woman (or two!) and was fine with it, what I was NOT ok with was that he didn't tell me about it. He apologized, broke things off with both of them, and that was that. They were pissed off at him, and rightfully so!! He was always VERY clear that he was happy to stay in our relationship and wasn't planning on leaving, but they still both wanted monogamy, and it was pretty obvious from their emails.

So anyway. I've occasionally (every few months) snooped over the past couple of years, and haven't found anything other than mild flirting. But, yet again, about a month ago, he started the familiar pattern of hiding his phone, so I went and snooped, and sure enough, he has a very hot D/S online relationship going on with another woman.

I'm bothered by this for two reasons.

1) She's married, and it doesn't appear that her husband knows about this. Although they don't have any plans to meet, and I STRONGLY doubt he would do so knowing his anxiety issues, so, maybe it doesn't matter? It still bothers me that he doesn't know, though.

2) HE HASN'T TOLD ME. HE KNOWS HE'S SUPPOSED TO TELL ME. I've always been 100% upfront about my other partners (and currently I've only had one other partner for the past about 18 months. No surprises there.)

And to be honest, there's also the part of me that's a bit jealous that she gets that from him and I don't... but really, it's mainly the second point--the fact that HE'S NOT TELLING ME ABOUT THIS despite the fact that THAT'S WHAT WE AGREED ON. And, because of this, it's hard to not feel cheated on.

So I don't know what I'm asking, here. I don't want to leave him. Honestly, other than the sex thing, he's an absolutely amazing partner--loving, respectful, and a partner in the true sense of the word--we work amazingly together as a team. Am I stupid to hope that I can somehow get him comfortable telling me that he's at least having an online thing with anoher woman? I don't even want details--I just want to know, dammit.

**TL;DR: Open relationship for 5 years. Boyfriend doesn't have any other physical partners, just online relationships. Despite agreeing to tell me about any online relationships he's having, he has repeatedly lied by omission and not told me. How can I make him more comfortable with telling me that he's involved with someone online? Or should I just be happy he's happy?**

**EDIT:** I sat down with him last night and didn't bring up the ""other woman,"" but I did tell him that he's talked about dealing with his anxiety many times before, and he needs to take the next step with that. (Last year, after four years of me pushing him, he FINALLY went on antidepressants, and they did help a lot, but now he needs therapy!) I actually watched him as he emailed Kaiser (his health insurer) and asked them what the process was for getting a referral for counseling. I don't know if he'll go through with it, but I'm going to keep pushing him. I don't know that I'm going to bring up his online relationship just yet. He's finally in the process of finding an internship to finish his master's degree, something he's been putting off for the past YEAR, so I think doing that and doing his own counseling are two good first steps. 

Then, if he's doing both of those things and still talking with the woman in another 2-3 months, I'll figure out how to address it at that point in time. I just wish I could get him to understand that I'm FINE with him having the relationship--I just need to know about it. Honestly, I really, REALLY hate snooping. I don't want to do that--I don't think it's fair to him. But neither is him hiding something major like that."

So I know that you probably read the title and may have already written this off. But I promise no wall of text, just the facts. 


So I was in a great relationship with a girl who I met in college. She had moved near me after graduation (got an internship coincidentally near me), and I had 3.5 great years. Dates, dancing, hanging out with friends (both together and separate), flowers, romance, etc.; it was great overall. It was one of those relationships that I was moving towards proposing towards her. Then came this shady fella that she worked with. I wasn't jealous really of him, but I did suspect that he was up to no good. 


The thing that started getting me suspicious was that he asked her to go with him ""as friends"" to a wedding, and she asked me if it was okay that she went with him. I told her I wasn't really comfortable with it, but I thought that it would be a way for her to get out and meet new friends (she didn't have a whole lot besides me and college friends locally.) She told me at that point that ""well, it didn't matter what you said, I was going to go anyways."" That was about 6 months before she broke up with me. 


Towards the end, she told me that ""something was wrong"" but really couldn't quantify what it was. I sat down with her and talked through it, asking her if it was something that I did, or what she felt. She felt that I didn't value her (I lived for the last 8 months about 200 miles away, talked frequently, did Facetime as well as visited home every other weekend. I brought her flowers, danced with her, kept asking her what she wanted to do every time in addition to making a decision together for both of us, etc. So I'm not sure what more I could have done much more. 


She became distant, really talked this other guy up with all my family and friends, and then decided that, as I was out shopping for a ring to call me, argue with me and then upon asking me say ""we're done."" I wanted to work through things with her, but she decided that she had had enough (really it felt like I wanted to fix things and she didn't) 


I should say that I really opened myself up for her here, and valued her in every way I knew how to. It's been 6 months since we talked, and I want to call her and talk to her (we haven't talked, and I saw her once at a mutual friend's wedding since then). I want to find out the truth, and possibly trying to get back with her and start anew. Really, I'd like to hear your advice on what I should do, whatever it is. Thanks in advance. 

UPDATE: So I decided to call her, not to beg for her to come back, but to see how she was. She talked about how everyone around her was doing well, but didn't bring up the other guy. Thank you to all who responded, I honestly feel like there's nothing there, that she really doesn't care about me, etc. Oh yeah, and coincidentally, the night I called her another girl called me that I've been interested in, came over and had a very enjoyable night. I get to see this new girl again, and I'm glad I'm moving on.

There were more videos, but I think you get the idea. Shoddy camera work, amateur equipment, yada yada yada. And at this time, I had just an intermediate grasp of FCP7 and no knowledge of divinci or after effects. 

Apparently, the company that contracted me were pleased with the work, and as they expanded, so did ""The HoC"" project, as well as the amount of work they would throw at me.

I'm still with the company, and we just wrapped up ""[HoC Austin 2013](http://www.thehoc.com/austin2013/)"" and ""[HoC Palm Springs 2013](http://www.thehoc.com/palmsprings2013/)."" We're working with a new production company that uses a RED Scarlet, as well as having a proper workflow. For 4-5 days straight, we would have 3-4 bands per day come perform at a venue, and deliver 1 performance video per band, 1 interview per band. So if 3 bands came to the house on day 1, we would deliver a total of 9 videos within 24 hours. 

This is the result from the recent ""HoC's"" (best of the best) And by this time, I wasn't only editing interviews, I was also tackling performances.

A couple things to keep in mind, each of the 2013 videos were edited and delivered 24 hrs from the moment they were filmed. On my part, HoC Austin 2013 was 24 videos out of 32. HoC Palm Springs was 17 videos out of 38.

So r/editors, how am I coming along compared to where I started? What needs to be worked on? How can I get better? And don't forget to check out the rest of the videos on TheHoC.com. If I was unclear about anything, or more details are needed, I will update.

I got accepted into a decent grad program starting Fall 2013. I was told by pretty much everyone that I'd *probably* be given some sort of research task over the summer from the institution. Well, I foolishly followed this advice and didn't apply for any summer internships since I thought I was covered for summer. Well, turns out, I was wrong. I'm a little peeved, but I suppose it was my fault for not making sure earlier.
Some of the reason was due to me having a late graduation date (mid-June). 

So now I'm a little bit worried about what to do for Summer. It's way too late for almost any internships, and the only ones I could find were at my local museums, but not very related to physics. I need to save up some money to move to my grad institution, but I also wanted to get my foot in the door with some research being done by the professors. I even offered to work unpaid and part time and they refused, which I found odd. 

My options seem rather limited now. Do I find a part-time job for only ~7 weeks? Even still, I have bills to pay, unfortunately, so it won't allow me to save any money for moving expenses. I'm a little frustrated at this point and wish I planned out my summer better.

Any advice? Thanks.

So I just completed the equivalent of what would be my second year in CompSci. I was late to start applying to internships and where I live doesn't have a ton of opportunites anyways, so I haven't been able to find anything yet. I applied to this small software development company that was offering a part-time position, and after I was interviewed they told me they could only offer me an unpaid internship for 2 months and maybe hire me on later. I declined and thought that was that.

A week later they called me up and asked if I would be interested in a technical writing position. I said I would be interested though I don't know anything about technical writing outside of writing lab reports. He e-mailed me a ""real-life task"" and attached were a Quality System Procedure along with a ""QSP Marked up process map"" which is basically a marked up flow-chart. In the e-mail he lists some guidelines but never specifically tells me what to *do*. I assume I am supposed to write a document that encompasses what is in both documents but I am really not sure.

Anyways, my question is if anyone who has had experience in technical writing could tell where to begin exactly(books, websites, etc.)? Also, what does the employer want from me?(I will probably have to ask him that later but I don't want to be completely ignorant.)"

I'm an intern at MacPherson Architects and we are currently going over plans to create a pedestrian friendly area on Adams street and bring business/ people back to downtown. As some of you may know, downtown isn't exactly the busiest place in Toledo. In fact it's quite the opposite when there's not a Mud Hens game going on. With all these beautiful high rises sitting vacant it pains me to see so much potential boarded over and hoping for something to come along and move in. We have more open parking lots than we need and a beautiful view of the riverfront from the empty park next to it. 

What I want to know is what do you want to see happen? what could we do to make Downtown more inviting? 

Here are some precedents we've been looking at;

I remember pretty vividly when I arrived in Vermont. It was so different than what I was used to. Mountains were quite unfamiliar to me having grown up in the Midwest, and I was in awe at being constantly surrounded by the beauty of it all. New England Culinary Institute (NECI) was located in Essex Junction, which was very close to Burlington, which was a cool little college town very similar to a college town that I lived near in Iowa. It was just enough familiarity for me to keep me going, seeing as this was quite possibly the boldest and spur of the moment decision of my life to date.

I fell in love with everything Vermont. The local businesses, the food culture, the farmer's market, the mountains, the weather, the microbreweries, and even the people. Except the hippies. I've never liked hippies.

So I moved into the dorms almost the instant I got into town. The dorms were basically converted housed where about 5 people shared a floor, common areas including a bathroom and kitchen, and we got our own bedrooms. Not a bad setup, really. I went to orientation, signed my life away to a student loan company, and began classes.

It was a completely new experience for me. The classes were all strictly hands on learning through cooking. The school was located in a resort with functioning restaurants and banquets halls, so everything that was prepared was ultimately served to a paying customer. Other classroom environments were located in Burlington at a high volume restaurant. It was a great learning experience all around. I was making friends as well, which was something I had worried about having moved away from all of my own friends. I was truly starting anew, having essentially left my entire life behind me. Was I running away from my problems? Absolutely. Was it one of the best decisions of my life? Well, yes and no.

I met a pretty little lady who was in my class. There weren't a whole lot of females in the school, and she was by far the most attractive. I had absolutely no chance with her, so I rarely made more than small talk with her. Well, until one night I got pretty drunk and I saw her in my building. She had been drinking a bit as well, but wasn't really as drunk as I was. I get pretty bold when I drink, so I started talking to her. And, hey, she was even talking back! I asked her for a drink of her beer (she was drinking sweet malt beverage, and I wanted to try it), so she took a big sip, came in to kiss me and spit it into my mouth. I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there.

The next day, she seemed pretty embarrassed about it and apologized for the way she acted. She was a bit of a goody, after all, and wasn't used to acting like that or being around people who acted like that. And then she asked me if I wanted to go out sometime. Score number two! We went out for coffee one night and walked around Church street. I was pretty convinced that it was a bit of a pity date because she felt bad (and also because I'm an idiot and oblivious to when a woman is into me) so I just enjoyed our conversations and our time spent together, took her back to her dorm room, and that was the end of it.

Until a week later, when she was asked out on a date by another guy, and she quite vocally replied to him, ""Well if inquebiss doesn't ask me out again, I might have to go out with you!"" Woah, what? She actually wanted to go out with me again? That's when we started dating for realsies.

So we finished our first year of school. We both went on internships at different restaurants for the summer, but were reunited the following fall. I signed away again at that student loan to attend another year of high end culinary school. Towards the end of the year, I heard rumor that the school was going to offer a Baking and Pastry degree program. Well, that was kind of why I attended culinary school to begin with. Now they have a program that focuses on just those things? Hell yeah! So, after having completed almost all of the required classes to get my Culinary Arts degree, I re-enrolled to attend another year and a half to get my Baking and Pastry degree. Oh, and the nice girl I was dating decided that she wanted to do the same. She wanted to be a cake decorator, after all.

And we signed our life away to the student loan company again.

The new school program was only offered at the other campus, so we had to move down there to attend. We decided to get our own apartment in the next town over having figured out that it was actually cheaper than paying room and board. We spent the next nine months in classes learning all about how to make artisan breads, pastries, deserts, cakes, and chocolate work. 

And after two years of dating, I proposed. Spoiler Alert: She said yes ;)

We finished our classes, but still had another internship to go through. We decided that we wanted to be together, so we tried to get an internship at the same place or places close together. We found a golf and beach resort that would take us both in their pastry kitchen, but it was in Florida. Sure, why the hell not? We were young and adventurous!

We packed up our cars, drove to Florida, found an apartment, and started our internship. We made $9.00 an hour. But we were livin large, because of all the overtime we were working. Being on an internship meant you were still technically enrolled in school, so we weren't paying on our loans yet. We weren't even thinking about them. Just makin money and spending money. The internship ended but we still had a lease on the apartment, so we figured we'd just stay for the rest of the year. We were offered jobs at the site, but the experience we had with the pastry chef was terrible. We jumped ship at the first chance. I landed a job at a pretty sweet beach club for the elite and my fiancee couldn't find a job in pastries, so she worked for Sak's Off Fifth and Victoria Secret. I wasn't doing any baking or pastry work, but I got a really good experience doing high end beach food at the restaurant as well as doing banquets, weddings, and special events. And the location was at one of the most beautiful beaches I've been to. Couldn't ask for much more than that!

Alas, the end of our lease was coming up and we knew the grace period on our student loans would be ending soon, so we began to plan for heading back to New Hampshire, which was where her home town was located. We'd stay with her parents for a bit until we found jobs and could move out. We enjoyed our stay in Florida, but we were definitely ready to leave. So the time came, we packed up our cars again, and made our way back to New England.

We both started looking for jobs right away and my fiancee applied to a high end pastry shop that she had dreamed of working at. It was her inspiration for attending culinary school. And she got the job! But she was only making $8.00 an hour. Temporarily, hopefully. I found a great job at a very nice artisan bread bakery making $10.00. The downside was that it was just outside of Boston, which was an hour and a half drive each way. But, I needed a job and I wanted it to be in that specific field, so I did it. It took a few months for us to both start working, but we got it in. And good thing too, because we got our first student loan bills in. 

Her's was about $1000 and mine was up around $1200. 

Yup. Having attended the most expensive culinary school in the country, I owed about $100,000, and she owed just under that. I was making less per hour than what I was before I started school. What in the hell were we going to do?"

So after being out of grad school for a year, I FINALLY found a position! (Woohoo! there's hope after all!) It's an internship, but I'm getting paid and the position is exactly what I want. My boss even basically said that by the end of the year I'll probably be a full time member of the team. There's a major need within this company for someone with my skills/talent, so I know I'm going to have a good time fitting in.

Now... the place I'm working is very new to me. It's very small (only about 7-8 people work there), and the attitude is very relaxed and collaborative. So far my job is to gather information and create sort of a knowledge base for both people in the company and for clients. I figured the easiest way to do this is to write blogs about different processes and post them on the company website (they're very active with their blogs).

The only problem is that I went to a very prestigious school, where everything had to be written in a very strict, essay format. I also did an internship during school with the government - where nothing can be written in a personal voice, and everything has to go through various levels of management before it's approved. I'm having trouble finding my ""voice"" as a blogger, and revealing the person behind the words (so to say). I'm not comfortable writing ""I"" and revealing things about myself through my work.

Any tips on writing blogs? Or becoming more relaxed in the workplace? Also, do you have any blogs you read regularly that has a style you like?

tl;dr: how do I reveal my personality through my blog? (and yes - actually, writing this reddit post helped me learn a few things about talking about myself, but this is still anonymous so it's not as scary)"
1fc7zi,5,2013-05-30,"Long distance, long-term relationship worth fighting for? [23/F] and [26/M]",bjorns_free,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1fc7zi/long_distance_longterm_relationship_worth/,"I met Jai two years ago online while doing an internship in another city. It was my first experience with online dating, and I wasn't expecting to actually meet anyone in person, but we really hit it off and had a great three months there. He's a talented, sensitive, altruistic person whom I share many values with. At that point, I could really see us going places. Even in our difficult times later on, we've grown together. I met and love his family, and they really liked me; my parents weren't that thrilled, but they never are. He knew from the beginning that I was leaving for another state for a teaching job for at least two years, and we decided to try long distance.  

The training for my teaching job that summer and the entire first year after that were awful. I was stressed beyond self-recognition, and I definitely took it out on him. He also didn't understand anything about what I was going through, and I had a hard time communicating that to him. He would make it seem like there were simple solutions to the issues that I was having, and it would frustrate me. Things would escalate quickly, like if I was ranting and swearing about a work-related issue, he would yell at me about ""swearing at him."" I didn't feel like he was a support and added to the emotional burden that I carried from my job. He would say that he was supportive because he'd stay up with me many times while working, which is true, but he has usually used that fact to hold that over my head in arguments. We also had intimacy issues. I was so unhappy and overworked that I had no drive, and he would tell me that I made him feel unattractive and like I didn't want him.  

During that time, I also became close to a male coworker who empathized with me rather than criticized me. While I did develop some feelings for the coworker, I didn't act on them, but it strained my relationship with Jai that year nonetheless. This year, it has been a non-issue as we don't even see or speak to each other much anymore, but Jai still seems suspicious that there is someone else in my life.  

That first year, I only saw Jai once for a few days during Christmas. He lives with his parents, and I didn't have a good time with him; he seemed hostile towards his family, and because I didn't feel comfortable getting intimate in his parents' home, he was even more upset about the lack of intimacy.  

When I returned to work, I was back in survival mode and didn't think too much about our relationship except for putting out the fires that developed. When summer came around, I wanted out. I wanted to focus on getting better at my career and getting away from other stressors. I cried so much and had a lot of trouble articulating myself, and Jai's vitriol made everything worse. He accused me of cheating him of a chance to see what my life was like, since he had planned on coming to my state and maybe even getting a job here. Jai also accused me of ""emotional rape"" and being cold when I was trying to cut contact. I don't recall how, but we wound up getting back together after a week, agreeing that I wanted to focus on my work but that we could still be together.  

That summer I visited him, and things seemed better. He also came to visit at the beginning of the new school year, when I was still extremely stressed. I continued to express my frustration and wasn't interested in being intimate, and it made him resent me. He told me that my job was harder than he thought it was, which made me resent him. After he left and as the year went on, things seemed to improve as we took the time we needed to do our respective things and still spend some time talking together on Google Chat, the phone or texting. I've made a much greater effort towards intimacy, too.  

That being said, I still didn't see our futures melding. I don't know how long I want to stay in my current state and teach, and I don't want to live in the city where he and his family are. What I wanted to do was spend the summer together and then start talking about the inevitable. I'd been avoiding the future talk for some time, when a few nights ago Jai insisted on talking about it. He was looking for assurance, but I told him that I couldn't promise anything. He said that my indecisiveness was hurting him, so I told him that I would then need to let him go. He started backtracking, saying that he didn't need an exact answer, saying that he wanted to work things out. Then he said he wasn't going to let me break up with him. That he wanted to see me grow as a person and go to grad school, etc. Then he turned around and said he felt like committing suicide (I told him that I'd call the police if he kept talking like that, and he stopped), that he'd ruined his standing in his community with his relationship with me and would be doomed to be alone without me (we're an interracial couple). I ended the call with us both crying and feeling incredibly guilty.  

The next night we spoke again and Jai told me again that I gave up easily on relationships, that he thought I understood his culture and it was my fault, that everything could be worked out and I wasn't trying hard enough. I stood my ground this time the way I hadn't the year before, and we're broken up.  

I think I'd be willing to work things out if we were physically together and had therapy, but I don't know. I've seen comments on Reddit about girls in their early twenties wanting to find themselves, and there's some truth to that (although he'd told me age was no excuse that first night). I told him that last night and he said he wanted to look into online counseling. I said I'd think about it. My mom thinks he's emotionally abusive and that I'm crazy for considering it. How about you, Reddit? (Thank you for even reading. It helps to write it all out.)

**TL;DR I've been dating a man long distance for 2 years after meeting online and being together for 3 months. After I moved, our relationship tanked because of a lack of communication and stress. Things are better now, but I'm not sure if I should walk away because our futures don't seem to mesh well.**"

I'm not sure if this is the right place to do this but I have a few questions.. A little background about myself:

* 3rd year economics major at UC Irvine
* Plan on graduating Fall Quarter (December '13)
* No experience/internships with any departments

UCI has a CSO program which I could apply for, but one of the requirements is that I have a FULL academic year left at UCI (and even then, some people hear back 2 years later so it's no guarantee that I'll get in).

I've been asking around at a few departments in the area, but most prefer Social Ecology majors (such as criminal justice or psych) and give them preference for internships.

So my questions are:

1. Are there any other possible ways to get myself ready/become a better candidate?
1. How soon before graduating should I begin applying?

Unless you're willing to do long-term dating (or you're also planning on being in Tucson, AZ in August/September), then this is short-term dating.

I'm not in the bay area that often - I'm not aware of where the lgbt community is, or how to get involved.

I am a student at the University of Arizona doing an internship at a small software company in San Jose. I am decently fit (I cycle about 20 miles/day), and I'm told I pass. I have been on hormones for a little over a year (slowly getting high dosages... I'm now at 2mg estradiol+150mg spironolactone!). I am a casual gamer - the only games I play are minecraft and kerbal space program. In an earlier lifetime, I was pretty good at smash brothers, but I haven't touched a console in about 2 and a half years. I spend a lot of free time playing with computers (writing software - it's part of how I deal with dysphoria, the logical part of my brain takes over, and the emotional part is pushed to the background). I'm a major space geek, sending giant metal dildos up above the atmosphere, and accelerating them to 5 miles/second is just amazing.

**3,092 American Idiots** for **1 year**.

Green Day is surely a name that most of you recognize. The group has been constantly releasing various very recognizable songs for the longest amount of time, which are world-renowned today. I mean, who hasn't heard of ""Boulevard of Broken Dreams""? And guess what, that song has been released *nine* years ago, at which point they have long established themselves as one of the leading rock bands of its time.

What is now one of the most important punk bands of the past two decades began as a duo between the two childhood friends Billie Joe Armstrong and Mike ""Dirnt"" Pritchard at age 15. After having adopted the name ""Green Day"", the group released numerous well-known albums to the likes of ""Dookie"" and ""American Idiot"" that ensured their rise to mainstream popularity. The group now has four regularly appearing members, which are the aforementioned Billie Joe Armstrong (Guitar, Vocals), Mike Dirnt (Bass, backing vocals), and the later joining Tré Cool (Drums) and Jason White (Guitar, backing vocals)

It is thus no wonder that a small branch of its fanbase have found themselves on Reddit, where they gathered themselves in a small, yet active sub, under the control of three mods, who are the founder /u/Garin2010, and his two minions, /u/MispelledName and /u/Slapdown, whom I was able to ask some questions:


&gt;1\. What brought you into listening to Green Day?

&gt;&gt; **Garin2010:** I discovered Green Day just as I was also becoming acquainted with other bands like The Offspring and Rage Against the Machine. American Idiot was given to me as a gift from a family member after it was released in 2004 and I immediately became a fan. From then on I moved on to listening to their entire catalogue and have been following the band ever since.

&gt;&gt; **MispelledName:** I actually got into Green Day because I saw them in the ""Thank You"" area of a lot of albums, especially my then-favorite band Good Charlotte (I was 14 at the time, don't judge). I kept hearing all of my favorite pop-punk bands saying that they were their inspiration in interviews, and it was love at first listen.

&gt;&gt; **Slapdown:** I started listening to Green Day when American Idiot came out. I heard Holiday on the radio and loved the song, so I went out and bought the album and loved the entire thing. A couple of years went by and I saw the music video for 21st Century Breakdown on MTV and loved that song too so yet again, I went and bought the album. That was when I went back and looked up all their older songs and I knew then that they were my favorite band and still are to this day.

&gt;2\. Which one is your favorite album?

&gt;&gt; **Garin2010:** As much as I would like to say that I have a number one favorite, I usually break down into selecting two. My first is Warning, I love the acoustic sounds of the album and also how it became the album that signified much of Green Day's style changing from their punk days, to the much more modern rock sound that we hear today. The second album is Insomniac, for it's raw sound and punk roots. It's one of those albums that I point to when anyone objects to their punk beginnings.

&gt;&gt; **MispelledName:** My favorite album is American Idiot, because it was the album that got me into Green Day, and actually got me interested in playing guitar and bass. I've always loved concept albums, and you can't go wrong with crunchy guitar and well thought out lyrics.

&gt;&gt; **Slapdown:** My favorite album would have to be 21st Century Breakdown because I love the music on the album and the lyrics. They just hit that spot we all have when listening to our favorite albums. I also tie that album in to being why I looked up all their previous records.

&gt;3\. What was your favorite experience with Green Day?

&gt;&gt; **Garin2010:** My favorite Green Day experience was undoubtedly my first concert. I saw them in 2009 on their 21st Century Breakdown tour in Salt Lake City. I was a Verizon customer at the time and they hooked me up with free tickets, soundcheck passes, early access to the venue, the whole VIP treatment. I was extremely lucky to have such an awesome experience at my first concert, and I still consider it one of the best days of my life.

&gt;&gt; **MispelledName:** My favorite Green Day experience is when I saw them on the American Idiot Tour in Dallas back in '05. I was right on the rail at the very front, and got to high five all of the guys. I even got a water gun blast right in the face from Billie Joe (No, that is not a euphemism).

&gt;&gt; **Slapdown:** My favorite Green Day experience I've had would be learning and playing the songs on guitar. My girlfriend inspired me to pick up guitar again and learn the songs about 2 years ago. I've been ""Having a Blast"" ever since!

&gt;4\. What motivated you to create the sub?

&gt;&gt; **Garin2010:** I created the sub about a year and some months ago after coming on to other band centric subreddits like /r/blink182, and also the fact that I felt that Green Day fans needed somewhere on Reddit to get together and discuss after seeing comments in Green Day posts get so hostile in other subreddits.

&gt;&gt; **MispelledName:** I'm so glad Garin created this sub, he's done a great job with it. Back when I first joined reddit, this was the first sub I looked up and it had barely any posts. Now, it's become a really great community.

&gt;&gt; **Slapdown:** Garin has done an awesome job with the subreddit so far. Keep it up bossman!

&gt;5\. Do you wanna say anything to your subscribers?

&gt;&gt; **Garin2010:** I love the fact that our subscribers are very active! And if you ever see a helpless person lost in an /r/music thread, direct them to the sub! Also, there are going to be a number of changes happening that I think many will like.

&gt;&gt; **MispelledName:** We have some pretty great posters, the only thing I really have to say is keep being awesome guys! Keep that good content coming! AND USE THE DAMN [MERCH] TAG!

&gt;&gt; **Slapdown:** All I want to say to the present and future subscribers is: You guys are the reason the subreddit is awesome, keep it up!

To finish this up, since I'm a new intern at /r/subredditoftheday, I would like to introduce myself:

My universal username is schampanes (shum-pun-ase), and I've had it for as long as I can remember. I've been on Reddit for just over a year now, following the path of one of my IRL friends, who introduced me to the site. I don't have a lot to say about myself, other than the fact that I like music of any form (which is the inspiration for this post), so I might be leaning more towards featuring music-oriented subreddits (or not, who knows?). 

Also, GreyWriter is the sexiest writer of all. ^(Now please put that gun away)"

But my main concern is that I'm still in college and have commuted since freshman year. I'm out now and I want to be out away from my parents. My dad never was a witness but my mom still is. There was a lot of tension in my household growing up...

I told my parents that I'm going to be moving out and getting an apartment. I have the money. It's going to be a lot but I think it's going to be worth it. I'm really tired of spending 2+ hours a day on the train and being so left out. It sucks when you barely have friends at school and your'e afraid to talk to them/get closer to them because you're told you shouldn't. I just want to go out and enjoy making friends for fucking once...
Then I feel like I'm just being childish. People always look down on younger kids for being childish and bitchy. I can't help but feel now I'm feeling the same way. My mom is telling me to ""be more patient"" and just stay home until I graduate and that I have plenty of opportunities to be independent...but how the fuck am I going to make friends? I'm on an internship right now and it's fucking depressing how stale my routine is. I can't imagine my life being this way in the future. Fuck all of this. fuck. It's so hard to contain the anger. My therapist suggested I should let out the anger during sessions because it seemed like there was a lot pent up inside of me. Hopefully I can sleep tonight and tomorrow won't be so shitty."

I'm coming to Atlanta for 4 weeks for a medical school rotation at Emory University Hospital Midtown starting Monday.

I went on Craigslist for weekly rentals for housing about a month ago and found a pretty decent place in Decatur for 125$ a week. I paid a deposit right away to confirm a room and text the landlord a week ago to confirm that there is still a room. I was told yes. 

I was all packed and ready to go this morning and thought I'd send another text to the landlord to tell him that I'm coming. I was pretty shocked when he told me that he actually doesn't have the room since he's not sure if the previous tenant is going to move out.  

I tried a few extended stay hotels around midtown Atlanta but all of them are booked full. I went on Craigslist again to try to find other places but no one is picking up their phones (I guess since it's because its Friday afternoon?). 

My internship starts Monday and now I've got the weekend to find a place to stay. People of Atlanta, can anyone help me out?

Thanks!

Ich kann also Französich zu verbessern beitragen, und nutze Skype jeden Tag. Ich kann auch email tauschen.

________________________________________

Hi, I'm a french student currently working as an intern in a german company since one months and for another two months. Before arriving, I didn't know anyone here in the company as well as in the city. Since the people here have a strong accent, I hardly can participate to the conversations, and the only times I speak German, I speak about work. Since I intended to improve my German (and not only my knowledge of the technical vocabulary), I decided after being invited by a friend of mine, to register here. I'm also looking for someone to discuss with and help me become more fluent. In exchange, I can help improving your fluency in French. I daily use Skype and can correspond by mail too.


Furthermore, I'm going to spend one year to study in Canada (Sherbrooke), and I'd like to practise my English before I go there, and maybe, create contacts in Canada or in the USA to travel a little bit.
I like to talk about music, films, mangas/animes or cooking (but also literature(fantasy, crime fiction, novel or poetry), science or arts in general even if I don't know a lot about it and if I mostly read/have French references).
____________________________

Bonjour, Je suis un étudiant Français en stage dans une entreprise allemande depuis un mois et pour deux mois encore. Je ne connaissais personne en arrivant, que ce soit dans l'entreprise ou dans la ville ou je loge. J'ai également du mal à me mêler aux conversations à cause de l'accent des gens. Les seuls moments où je parle c'est pour le boulot. Comme j'ai pas envie de n'apprendre que le vocabulaire technique, une amie m'a convaincu de m'inscrire ici, pour chercher quelqu'un avec qui discuter. Je peux aider à améliorer le niveau de français, j'utilise Skype tous les jours et peux si besoin correspondre par mail également.


De plus, je vais partir étudier un an au Canada (à Sherbrooke) et j'aimerais améliorer mon anglais avant d'y arriver, voire éventuellement me créer des contacts au Canada anglophone ou aux Etats-Unis pour pouvoir voyager. Mes centres d'intérêts sont la musique, les films, les mangas ou animes et la cuisine (je peux aussi parler de littérature (fantasy, polar, roman, poésie), de science et d'art en général, mais je ne m'y connais pas beaucoup même si j'aime bien, et n'ai presque que des références françaises)."

What are my options?,TheShadyInvestor,finance,https://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/1feo40/computer_science_student_looking_to_possibly/,"I'll try and keep this short. I'm a computer science student and, as a part of my program, my school arranges a few internships for me. After a few of these internships, I've realized that I don't really want to have a career in computer science, whether it be as a developer or something else. I just don't find it very satisfying and honestly can't see myself doing it day in and day out. I know some of you might think that I should only study things that interest me and so forth so, to that extent, I can say that computer science interested me a lot before I started my degree, and it still does, but just not to a level where I can see myself doing it as a career.

One of my internships has been in a finance job working in middle office. (I'm purposely not giving away specifics but can try and clarify certain things if people have questions.) My question for you, /r/finance, is what career options do you think are available to me? The way I see it, I have 3:

1) Go back to that position for my remaining internships (if possible) and try to get a job there post-grad. After that, continue to climb the corporate ladder.
2) Work for a few years post-grad and get an MBA, which will hopefully land me a career I like better (but obviously there's no guarantee).
3) Try and go back to my finance internship position full-time and get a CFA. The only career I know I can have as a CFA (that I normally couldn't otherwise have) is being a Portfolio Manager, which I don't know much about but am currently exploring as well.

Any guidance and/or advice will be much appreciated!

1fehv1,2,2013-05-31,I. JUST. WANT. THIS. INTERNSHIP.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1fehv1/i_just_want_this_internship/,"**TL;DR: Professor pulled a Scumbag Steve on me and my internship opportunity is slowly slipping away.**

Update: I called around my university and actually got into contact with my elusive dean. Asked him for letter. He sent one. I'VE GOT THE INTERNSHIP!!!! THANK YOU REDDIT, FOR STICKING WITH ME THROUGH MY PANICS!!!

Good morning, OMC. 

As a follow up to a [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1ercmt/reddit_please_help_what_do_i_do/) I wrote weeks ago, I was offered the internship, but I need a letter of acknowledgement because it's unpaid and legalities, etc. I was told to get it from an IT (computer science) professor, advisor, office of admissions, etc. 

Despite emailing all of those people, only my professor responded / picked up my calls and - phew - said he'd write it. But as of right now, I still have no letter. I even sent him the layout the internship said was what they needed (they literally sent me a fill in the blank letter for my professor, which really just required him to put his name and sign it). 

He's a nice guy, but he puts off things for way too long. For example, in his class, our homeworks from the beginning of the semester weren't graded until the very end in a rush. 

At first, I dropped little emails and reminders, but then it turned into a once a day memo of ""pleaseeee, I really want to do this and it'll advance my career, etc."". 

WHAT DO I DOLS JDL:FKJWKLRHLFSDF.

Edit: He just sent me a looonnnggg email explaining how he couldn't do it because it's an exam day and basically told me to try someone else, after waiting a week and a half. But he just has to PEN HIS NAME ON THE BOTTOM AND DURING EXAMS ALL YOU DO IS SIT THERE AND THIS IS SO DISRESPECTFUL TO MY PROFESSOR BUT WHYYYYYY AUGH. Professor, you could have penned it instead of writing me a wall of text in that amount of time it took to do so. "

Ich bin ein französicher Student, und absolviere mein Praktikum in einem deutschen Betrieb seit einem Monat (und werde noch für zwei Monate in Deutschland bleiben). Da ich niemand weder in diesem Betrieb noch wo ich lebe kannte, da ich viel Schwierigkeiten habe an den Gesprächen teilzunehmen (die Leute haben hier einen starken Akzent), spreche ich nicht so viel. Und wenn ich spreche, spreche ich über Arbeit.
Ich möchte nicht nur das technische Vokabular lernen, und mit Leute sprechen, die mir meine Fehler korrigieren, also habe ich mich hier angemeldet, um jemand mit dem zu diskutieren, um meine Sprachkentnisse zu verbessern. Ich kann also Französich zu verbessern beitragen, und nutze Skype jeden Tag. Ich kann auch email tauschen.

Hi,
I'm a french student currently working as an intern in a german company since one months and for another two months. Before arriving, I didn't know anyone here in the company as well as in the city. Since the people here have a strong accent, I hardly can participate to the conversations, and the only times I speak German, I speak about work.
Since I intended to improve my German (and not only my knowledge of the technical vocabulary), I decided after being invited by a friend of mine, to register here. I'm also looking for someone to discuss with and help me become more fluent. In exchange, I can help improving your fluency in French. I daily use Skype and can correspond by mail too.

_____________________________

Bonjour,
Je suis un étudiant Français en stage dans une entreprise allemande depuis un mois et pour deux mois encore. Je ne connaissais personne en arrivant, que ce soit dans l'entreprise ou dans la ville ou je loge. J'ai également du mal à me mêler aux conversations à cause de l'accent des gens. Les seuls moments où je parle c'est pour le boulot.
Comme j'ai pas envie de n'apprendre que le vocabulaire technique, une amie m'a convaincu de m'inscrire ici, pour chercher quelqu'un avec qui discuter. Je peux aider à améliorer le niveau de français, j'utilise Skype tous les jours et peux si besoin correspondre par mail également.

_______________________

Furthermore, I'm going to spend one year to study in Canada (Sherbrooke), and I'd like to practise my English before I go there, and maybe, create contacts in Canada or in the USA to travel a little bit. 

I like to talk about music, films, mangas/animes or cooking (but also literature(fantasy, crime fiction, novel or poetry), science or arts in general even if I don't know a lot about it and if I mostly read/have French references).

___________________________

De plus, je vais partir étudier un an au Canada (à Sherbrooke) et j'aimerais améliorer mon anglais avant d'y arriver, voire éventuellement me créer des contacts au Canada anglophone ou aux Etats-Unis pour pouvoir voyager.

Mes centres d'intérêts sont la musique, les films, les mangas ou animes et la cuisine (je peux aussi parler de littérature (fantasy, polar, roman, poésie), de science et d'art en général, mais je ne m'y connais pas beaucoup même si j'aime bien, et n'ai presque que des références françaises)."
1feel1,1,2013-05-31,Are you fucking kidding me?,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1feel1/are_you_fucking_kidding_me/,"This whole week got a whole lot worse. Some background on my part, I am a chemical engineering student graduating in under 15 days and for the last 4 months, my life has gone to total shit. If that's not bad, what I am going through right now is a world of mental bullshitting pain that is also eating up my wallet. 

First of all, I got an second interview at a Controls engineering company, Great right? I thought so to. Here I thought, after 4 years of pain, that I was finally gonna have what most people want--- a fucking job. This was for an internship but none the less work experience and getting paid. I had a midterm on Friday, 5/24, and I have my senior design due on 6/7. So after the midterm I was working on design, this is a group project so I was waiting on person#1 to send me his numbers( optimum pressure, temperature, reactor size, separation numbers such as # of trays, basic ChE plant stuff). Let's call person#1 : J. So after doing that for 2 days, it was a 3 day weekend here in the U.S, on the monday before the interview I was preparing for the interview. Before I get too far ahead here, I would like to say that J hasn't given me any numbers yet, and since this is close to the deadline, I am kinda freaking out. But this has happened before and I knew we would figure it out before this was due, so I didn't worry about it too much. Back to the interview, I knew the company wanted someone who wanted some sort of controls software knowledge, so I was studying that online, cause our school doesn't teach us any more than PID controls. So I am online learning about different controllers ( Allan Bradley, Modicon, etc) so I can ace the controls knowledge part of the interview. So I go home on Monday, and again prepare for my interview at home. Come the day of the interview, I get there 10 mins early, and just try to keep myself calm and collected. And at 11AM, one of the interviewees walk in along with the guy who interviewed me for the 1st interview, our school's alumni. I was happy to see him and he told me I needed to impress his team in order to get the internship. No problem, I thought, I have been studying online for a week now about PLC controllers, and I have a solid background knowledge about the company, this is in the bag no sweat. Here's where the trouble begins :
We walk in to the interview and not 10 seconds in, one of the guys tells me, ""we are looking for someone with a solid software background"". I am like ok, all  I know is MATLAB, but I can learn C++, Java, etc. Then the 3 guys start interviewing me and asking me about my projects that I have done in school. I tell them, in detail what I did and they seemed to be impressed. Here I am thinking, ""yea, what I learned in college and in my labs are really helping me out"". But then 15 mins in, they start going into software knowledge, and how good I am in programming, I tell them about what I taught myself in PLC controllers and they ask me if I ever programmed one myself. I tell them no I haven't because I have never seen a PLC in the first place, other than online on YouTube. They were not impressed but still we moved on. Second thing, they start grilling me about different aspects of PLC controllers and I can't say anything other than what I learned online. So after getting crushed at the interview, which was suppose to last 1 hour and it ended up lasting 35 mins, one of the 3 guys shows me around the company and I leave after. I come home feeling super pissed, IF THEY FUCKING WANTED A SOFTWARE ENGINEERING WHY ARE THEY LOOKING FOR CHE's? EVEN MY ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING BUDDIES DON'T KNOW ABOUT PLCs AND NEITHER DOES MY COMPUTER SCIENCE BUDDIES. FUCK ME. Well I take the train back( $90 round trip) and I come back to J messaging me on facebook saying, that he's thinking of withdrawing from the quarter. Remember J hasn't given me any of the numbers previously mentioned. I am about to lose my fucking mind. I go to his house and we go out get some food( I pay for his food as well), cause someone came and stole his wallet. Let me say this before, this guy never locks his front door and anyone can just walk in and take his stuff without anyone knowing. So anyways I tell him before he makes any decisions, talk to our professor cause this is pretty close to turn in time. He emails the professor, and I talk to the professor today and the professor himself is stunned. This has never happened before in the last 15+ years of him teaching this class. And to make it all worse, I get a message from him today at 9:27 PM : ""Dude, I just withdrew myself from the quarter"". FUCK MY LIFE, MAN. SENIOR YEAR OF COLLEGE IS SUPPOSE TO BE FUN. FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK. IT'S LIKE GOD, IF HE'S REAL, IS UP THERE PLAYING THE GAME, LET'S SEE IF WE CAN DESTROY HIS SPIRIT TO LIVE. 

Come on man. I just want a break. Is it too much to ask that after 3.5 years of work, I can't relax cause of stupid bullshit. FML. 

All I'm asking is why can't I get a break man. I want to be able to relax and enjoy the end of senior year with my friends. I just want a freaking job. Is that so hard? Is it? I was already exhausted but after what happened this week I'm just on the verge of saying fuck it all. I don't give a damn anymore. "
1fe5nt,3,2013-05-31,I'm overwhelmed with graduation and changes.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1fe5nt/im_overwhelmed_with_graduation_and_changes/,"College wasn't easy, and my home life was even harder. Over my four years my best childhood friend was struck with some form of epilepsy, another committed suicide, my mom got cancer, my dad lost his job, and then the house, they lived out of a motel for a bit and then moved thousands of miles away. There was no more safety net. I got a job and thew myself into my academic program.

But I also had the time of my life. I gained new lifelong friends, found love, and became well known in my major. I got to fly places, and study abroad, and get recognized for my work. I finished classes 2 months early and secured a paid internship before that. My family life is much better and things a pretty damn shiny.

But I keep freaking the fuck out. Now that life seems pretty secure I'm suddenly insecure. I'm dreading my move to the city and keep crying almost everyday about the most trivial of shit. I really need to pack but cant bear to get my suitcase out of the closet. Tomorrow I'm selling the car that I've owned for 5 years and it hurts to even think about it. I feel like I did everything I was supposed to do as a first generation college grad, and now, after everything, I feel lost.

I don't know what I mean to say except that I really, really, am going to miss my car."
